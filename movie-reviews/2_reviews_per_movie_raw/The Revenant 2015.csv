","A lot has been said and written about this film, mostly about its troubled production - forget all that: it has no meaning whatsoever for the experience this film provides. A word of advice though: if you go in expecting a testosterone-fueled revenge thriller in the vein of 'Apocalypto', you'll likely end up disappointed. It's simply not that kind of film - but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it if you watch it with the right expectations.<br/><br/>'The Revenant' opens with images from a dream; we see snippets of memories showing a peaceful life - and soon the loss of that peace, and the loss of life. The images change and we hear the soothing sound of gurgling water as we follow the camera via a long tracking shot over a flooded forest; it's an image that seems to imply peace, evoking nature's beauty with an almost meditative quality - before the barrel of a rifle appears in the frame.<br/><br/>Those first three minutes I just described (which are the only spoilers you will get in this review) set the tone for the film perfectly. It's a film that tells a story of harrowing circumstances through images that are breathtakingly beautiful; a film about survival and death and shocking acts of sudden violence - and yet a film that, despite all its visceral intensity, also has a quiet, immersive quality to it that feels almost hypnotic.<br/><br/>Many critics and reviewers point out the stark contrast between the film's poetic beauty and the ugliness of its violence - implying the director wants to use this contrast to make a certain point regarding mankind's interference with nature. While that would seem pretty obvious (and it probably is at least partly true), I left the film feeling Iñarritu had shown me a vaster, far too complete image of the clash between man and nature to justify such a simplistic interpretation of the events portrayed on screen. Whether intentionally or not, Iñarritu shows the star of his film with a complexity and honesty that we normally don't get to see in these kinds of stories. And I'm not talking about Leonardo DiCaprio here (who gives a no-holds-barred, crazy good performance and I'd love to see him win an Oscar for this film) - the star of this film is not a person: it IS nature, plain and simple.<br/><br/>The revenge plot - which feels almost like an afterthought or a ploy to give the film a certain structure and a proper ending - is not really the film's main theme or strongest aspect, and it certainly isn't the reason that made this film so compelling to watch for me. Such stories have been told often enough - and often better - than in 'The Revenant'. No, what really makes this film stand out for me is that I have NEVER seen a Hollywood film (any film, really - apart from documentaries) that shows nature in such an unflinchingly honest and mesmerizing way as is the case here. And the way I perceive it, Iñarritu sees his human protagonists as being very much a part of nature as a whole - regardless of their destructive behaviour. <br/><br/>It's that refreshingly holistic approach (which some viewers might perceive as nihilism on the director's part) that I find to be the film's biggest accomplishment: it depicts the people in this story as just another species trying to survive in that perilous frontier-world. The emphasis is not really on the moral aspects of the brutal injustice that the main character suffers or how the Native Americans are cruelly exploited; we witness all that - but Iñarritu keeps a certain emotional distance, as if he were shooting a documentary about predatory wildlife. And just like the bear's attack, most of the violence in this film comes as a reaction of defense. Be it self-defense, defending one's offspring or defending territory and valuable resources. Even the character that comes closest to an actual villain is driven by fear - not hate, and his most obvious character defects were caused by a very traumatizing experience. As in nature, there is a simple (if often brutal) logic to why most characters, men or beasts, act the way they do in 'The Revenant' (OK, maybe not the French - but I didn't say the film was perfect). And the bear attack is the most realistic depiction of an animal attack I have ever seen on film.<br/><br/>All in all, this film feels less like a story of revenge and more like an ode to the visceral beauty of nature and the relentless, savage force that is life; it provides an immensely absorbing - and touching - experience to those who have an affinity for the wilderness, but it's also a visual masterpiece and a great piece of old-school filmmaking for lovers of Cinema. It's not perfect (especially during the last third of the film where I felt the pacing was a bit off), but it's a film the likes of which we will only rarely get to see - if at all - in the future. 'The Revenant' is visual poetry of the most primal kind, and it should be seen on the biggest screen possible. 9 stars out of 10 from me.<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
"mrblacktip","8","499","691","9 January 2016"," One of the Best Movies I'll never watch twice
","The Revenant falls into the same category as Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" and Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" for me, in the essence of being a terrific movie but not something I think I can sit through a second time. In all these movies there are brutal sequences that cause emotional stress and disgust just watching because it is so REAL and GRIPPING. To think that events in these movies actually happened or that they could very well happen is too much for me to think about. Not to say that I did not enjoy this film thoroughly. <br/><br/>The Revenant is a technical masterpiece that left me wondering ""How the hell did they do that?"" after many scenes and sequences. With beautiful cinematography and adroit camera movement this film is a visual magnum opus. It is apparent that the great minds that put forth this film are none other than the same ones that brought us Birdman: Lubezki and Inarritu. There are many long shots without cuts that are sprinkled throughout the film that add a sense of sophistication to it with the added bonus of predominantly location based shooting and natural lighting for the film , that can even make a novice film watcher raise an eyebrow at its complexity. <br/><br/>The camera work is not the only noteworthy aspect of the film; The actors did a superb job executing their rolls. Many are raving about DiCaprio's performance but I was more of a fan of Hardy's brutal and gritty character Fitzgerald. Granted, half the words that came out of his mouth were unintelligible but he left no doubt in my mind that he was fully devoted to his role and bringing Fitzgerald alive instead of just Hardy playing a character named Fitzgerald. He was simply amazing.<br/><br/>With all this said, there are still flaws in the film. At some points it was dragging on and moving too slow. It gave the impression that the film itself was cocky and wanted to show off all of its beautiful scenery and camera work too much. Then there was the ""he shouldn't be alive"" situations. Hugh Glass was a real guy that really did survive a bear mauling but in the film they make this guy practically immortal. There were too many instances where I was thinking ""he should be dead three times over right now, for me to enjoy the film as much I should have. <br/><br/>All in all a great film that I only recommend to seasoned and mature film viewers."
"nikshah-688-552284","7","34","42","6 July 2019"," Superb Cinematography But totally Unrealistic
","As mentioned 10/10 for the scenic cinematography and direction. But storyline is totally Unrealistic. I mean u will see Leonardo DiCaprio surviving a giant bear attack, surviving a 150ft fall , surviving a swim in a freezing cold river, surviving a group of indians firing in a close range, surviving don't know how many knife stabs.. totally Tollywood/ bollywood style where Lead hero won't die no Matter how much ever ways of killing u try, but villians die just with a one shot !! Not happy with the over unrealistic storyline."
"MR_Heraclius","10","53","69","23 February 2020"," love this movie highly recommend.
","Finally saw this movie (yes 4 years late) and I understand why Leonardo won the Oscar, along with the many academy awards the movie and director won. It is a cinematic masterpiece. The cinematography is amazing, the whole cast (Tom Hardy is great here) is great. The costumes and weapons used (early 1800s) look so damn good. The story is very simple and not complicated. It is about revenge and surviving in the cold and icy wilderness of 1823. The action scenes are brutal and gritty, like they should be for that time period. Officially in my top 10 movies of all time. If you've never seen this film, do yourself a favor and rent it or buy it. It definitely deserves to be in your collection. Some people might not like all the spiritual stuff or reading subtitles (lots of Native American language here) but it is needed since there a lot of interaction with Native American tribes here. FINAL REVIEW 10/10"
"summerloud","6","53","70","7 January 2016"," great effects and an awesome start but degenerates into a meaningless mess of Hollywood clichés
","I recently came across the story of Glass briefly when reading TC Boyles ""The Harder They Come"", and since this book increased my already big fondness for pioneer or realistic wild west settings, I was looking forward eagerly for a new big budget movie that promised to capture the pioneer era atmosphere in a grim survival story.<br/><br/>The movie starts out awesome enough, kicking off with a powerful Indians vs Pioneers battle scene that features incredibly long, action-packed shots. Unlike in the original story the movie is based on, Glass brings his half-Indian son along, creating some father/son moments and some tension with the other guys on his trek who are not that fond of savages. Shortly after, we are treated to the high point of the movie - the already famous bear scene, which is masterfully done, and painful to watch for its cruel realism. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, from there, it is all downhill.<br/><br/>The whole point of the original story, Fitzgerald and Bridger leaving Glass behind, gets watered down by the state Glass is pictured to be in - the way it is shown in the movie, it would have obviously been the only logical thing to do to leave him behind, with the Indians on the trek's tail and his chances of survival being nil. <br/><br/>Rather than creating a believable dilemma, the movie goes all over- the-top in Hollywood clichés. Instead of just leaving a maimed Glass behind for dead, Fitzgerald kills Glass'es son, turning a survival story into a revenge thriller. We are shown all kinds of bad aspects of Fitzgerald's character to turn him into ""the bad guy"" so we can root for Glass killing him at the end.<br/><br/>At the same time, the whole Indian side-story that was courageous enough to show Indians as ruthless attackers and not stick to the ""noble savage"" cliché gets watered down with an unbelievable silly twist when it is revealed that the Indians are just searching for the chieftain's kidnapped daughter, which we later find out was kidnapped by those pesky French, who do all kinds of badguy Indian killing stuff (as opposed to our noble pelt hunters, who are righteous decent human beings with the exception of the traitor Fitzgerald).<br/><br/>The actual survival story then gets completely out of hand, being so over-the-top as to remind me of action movies like Die Hard 2, that do not claim to be realistic and do not take themselves as serious as this movie. Glass, still in a state where he can only crawl, escapes the Indians by jumping into an ice-cold river, gets thrown down waterfalls, gets on a horse, falls down a cliff of around 100ft, etc etc etc. At this point, the survival story failed to grip me, since it was obviously based on comic book physics and -realism. <br/><br/>It gets even more ridiculous, when Glass manages to find the time on his survival ego trip to befriend a lone Indian (who is later killed by the evil, evil French, but not before healing Glass with some Indian sweat lodge magic), and even to rescue the Indian chieftain's daughter who was held prisoner as a rape object by the French, who again thankfully stepped in to fill in for the bad guys.<br/><br/>Despite all of this, the movie manages to stay pretty enjoyable (and never boring) until the ending, which was so horribly predictable that it made me cringe. <br/><br/>First Glass meets up with the rest of the trek, looking extremely healthy for what he's supposedly been through - DiCaprio could have at least lost some weight for this movie, or otherwise they could have used CGI to make him look thinner. <br/><br/>Fitzgerald escapes from the camp, stealing the money from the rest of the crew in the process (that baddie bad guy!). For some reason, even though they still have plenty of other men left, only Glass and the Captain set out as a group of two to hunt Fitzgerald down.<br/><br/>When the Captain then tells Glass some sentimental crap about his wife when they sit down at a fire at night, he might have just as well put on a red Star-Trek shirt, because it couldn't have been made any more obvious that he would be shot in the lead-up to the inevitable showdown between Glass and Fitzgerald.<br/><br/>Predictably enough, thats exactly what happens. To make matters worse, we are not only treated to the good old ""both antagonists lose their weapons so it degenerates into a fist fight"" cliché, but then, as the predictable fight, that tries to make up in cruelty what it lacks in innovation, inevitably ends with our hero Glass beating Fitzgerald and threatening to cut his throat, Fitzgerald tells him in a typical bad-guy way that killing him won't bring back his son, AND SO GLASS REFUSES TO KILL HIM. Are you kidding me? You just ruined the whole point of turning a survival story into a revenge trip, and lost the last bit of credibility the story had until now.<br/><br/>But of course we cannot let the bad guy get away, and so the actual killing is done by the Indians, who arrive just in time to finish Fitzgerald off and stare silently at Glass in a menacing silent Indian cliché thing. Since Glass saved his daughter's life, the Indian chieftain refrains from killing Glass, and instead rides off silently without acknowledging or helping the wounded Glass lying on the ground who saved his daughter's life. Makes sense.<br/><br/>The movie fades out with a shot of Glass staring into nothing. At least he didn't go after the chieftain's daughter to make some more Indian half-breed babies and live happily forever after.<br/><br/>6/10"
"BoxOfficeKid","7","250","362","25 January 2016"," Visually beautiful, story-wise not on par...
","The natural landscape and some of the scenes are overwhelming and spectacular! The camera-work is so immersive, you believe are a part of Hugh Glass' journey through the wilderness and back to civilization. Also with great performances not only by DiCaprio, but also Hardy, as the unsympathetic fellow fur trapper leaving Glass behind. <br/><br/>Story-wise, it is a bit thin for a 156 min picture. Glass' quest for vengeance is sometimes lost as he utters few words about his drive and is being more or less, chased himself. The story arc of the Indians quest for their daughter felt a bit out of place and strange. We also get to see the fur trappers p.o.v. that left Glass behind and the Captain way ahead of them. Which in my opinion takes a little bit of the magic of Glass' total perilous journey.<br/><br/>All my stars goes to the beauty, production value and performances alone! Regardless, this is one of those overlong movies one like, but would not sit out for another viewing!"
"mptaylor-50564","3","751","1152","16 January 2016"," Great photography, not so great film
","You are almost immediately plunged into the action, in a similar way to the opening of 'Saving Private Ryan', with a Native American attack on a group of fur trappers. DiCaprio even does that momentarily deaf thing that Tom Hanks does. Lots of bows and arrows and gore and excellent photography that is really immersive. Great opening scene.<br/><br/>There there's the scene where DiCaprio is mauled by a grizzly bear. Again, really believable, exciting and up front and personal - you can almost smell the bear's stinking breath. Brilliant. <br/><br/>And then there's ... well ... not much really. Photography and scenery are by and large excellent but you do get the feeling that better use could have been made of them. Iñárritu often seems to chop scenes around for no particular reason, although you do get the occasional sense of the vast wilderness that comes over well on the big screen.<br/><br/>Dialogue is scarce. Most of it goes to Tom Hardy who tries to put on a Texan accent but succeeds in sounding as if he has a sock in his mouth (does he specialise in being inaudible? remember him as the mumbling Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises'?). <br/><br/>Then there's the storyline. You know the ending, right? (Just look up the definition of 'revenant'.) Leo is up against it and he suffers a great deal. But you know he is going to survive. So when, to top everything, he falls off a cliff on his horse you realise he's actually become Mr Indestructible. And two and a half hours of crawling, grimacing and wincing does not a very entertaining film make.<br/><br/>There are also several non-credible plot twists. Like when Tom Hardy (a.k.a. The Mumbler) somehow cracks an impressive-looking safe and makes off with the garrison money and just two guys go after him, including the garrison commander. This nicely sets up the final confrontation between Mr Indestructible and The Mumbler .... but really? <br/><br/>We also develop little or no emotional connection with the main character. The silent dream scenes are a clichéd way of trying to do this and they don't work in my opinion - they're just puzzling and boring. Nor do we see much of the relationship between Leo and his son to set up the emotional links between them - just Leo being harsh and dishing out tough love a couple of times. <br/><br/>The pacing is also poor. Once you've passed the opening scene and the grizzly scene, feel free to go and refresh your popcorn - you won't miss much. <br/><br/>Overall, the film is self-consciously bleak and overdetermined and is unevenly paced. A better director might possibly have made this a good film but Iñárritu is clearly not David Lean.<br/><br/>If DiCaprio gets an Oscar for this it will be because the Academy think they owe him one and possibly because of the hype. This is a film that will be forgotten. If you want to see a good silent movie with snow, ice, struggle for survival and even the odd grizzly bear thrown in, watch Chaplin's 'The Gold Rush' - it's far more entertaining."

"CalRhys","Null","358","556","17 January 2016"," A Powerfully Bleak & Masterful Film
","Take the direction of Alejandro González Iñárritu, combine it with the stunning cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki and toss in Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy for their acting charms and what do you get? An extraordinary and masterful film.<br/><br/>Fresh off of 'Birdman,' Iñárritu moved straight on to 'The Revenant,' a western-epic inspired by the true-life experiences of frontiersman Hugh Glass in the winter-struck landscape of 1820s America. The film gained some notoriety in mid-2015 for its production problems and has thus been regarded one of the most challenging film shoots in the history of cinema. Rightfully so. The film opens with the soothing sound of running water, thrusting the audience into an almost meditative state, and then it strikes, an action-packed sequence ensues with a near single sweeping take. Now this is a spoiler-free review, so I'll leave the pleasure of viewing that scene to you.<br/><br/>This film heavily evokes reactions from the audience and does so well, whether it's staring at the screen in awe or gasping at the visceral violence, if you face this film with the right attitude and expectations, it will be a thrill ride like no other. Lubezki has proved that he is one of the most fantastic cinematographers of modern cinema, and the extensive use of natural lighting over artificial supports that statement even further, the film is beyond stunning. Supporting this is the score from the relatively unknown composers, believe me, when the sudden orchestral boom strikes your eardrums, it's mesmerising.<br/><br/>The makeup, the direction, the editing, the visual aesthetics, and of course the performances from a hopefully soon-to-be Oscar winning DiCaprio, 'The Revenant' is a visual treat for those who appreciate cinema and for those who wish to just get absorbed by the immense landscapes and poetic justice Iñárritu has given it. This is, for me, a modern masterpiece."
"lnvicta","8","128","192","29 February 2016"," Harrowing storytelling with a gorgeous cinematic backdrop, The Revenant is not for the faint of heart but will stick with those who make the journey.
","Since the first trailers of this movie came out I knew it would be an experience. Following the incredible Birdman, director Alejandro G. Iñárritu had the public anxiously awaiting his interpretation of this bleak survival story, and much like Birdman, Iñárritu is also the star of this film. The Revenant has some of the most beautiful cinematography I've ever seen. It's cold, visceral, and almost entirely authentic from the use of natural lighting to the barebones yet powerful storytelling. You can tell Iñárritu poured his heart into this project and it pays off tremendously. This is not to discount the incredible performances of DiCaprio and Hardy (DiCaprio finally getting his well-overdue Oscar), but it's hard to imagine the movie being so impactful had another director been at the helm. <br/><br/>The story is as simple as it gets. In the 1800s, a group of settlers escape an ambush by an indigenous tribe, and during their travels one man gets separated from the group and gets brutally attacked by a wild bear and subsequently left for dead by his team. It's a revenge story more than anything. What it also highlights is human perseverance and the will to live. The things that happen to this man are truly horrific and difficult to watch. I'm not sure what parts of the story were embellished or Hollywoodized, but this film sucks you into this world and puts you right alongside this fatally wounded man desperate to survive. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a heart-wrenching performance as Hugh Glass, expressing a wide range of emotions despite the limited dialogue. Tom Hardy is also phenomenal as one of the most vile, wretched human beings on the planet. This guy is despicable to the core, and you forget you're watching Tom Hardy at times because he's completely absorbed in the role. The supporting cast is great as well despite their small time on screen. As far as performances and cinematography goes, The Revenant is flawless.<br/><br/>What prevents this from getting a perfect 10 is one particular storyline that I didn't think was needed, and it involves the wife of Hugh Glass. She's never developed as a character but she appears intermittently in visions and dreams and it almost sucks you out of the movie for a second because of how intense the main narrative is. But this is a very small gripe. From beginning to end this movie had me on the edge of my seat, my jaw on the floor and my eyes glued to the screen. The Revenant is definitely not for everyone, but it's impossible not to appreciate it for the breathtaking cinematic achievement that it is."
"martha-adam1","3","464","757","15 January 2016"," A classic case of style over substance
","What an absolute waste of 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>It didn't look like it was going to be my type of film, but the trailer was very convincing, not to mention the plethora of award nominations it has received, so I decided to give it a go.<br/><br/>Mistake.<br/><br/>It started with a collection of superb actors, delivering solid performances. Despite what I've read, I thought Tom Hardy's accent was spot on - that is what that accent sounds like! Domhnall Gleeson is in everything these days, for good reason, and Will Poulter was certainly endearing. Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent, dragging oneself through the snow post-bear mauling should be pretty torturous, and as we know from Wolf of Wall Street's infamous 'Ludes' scene, DiCaprio is a pro at crawling and grunting.<br/><br/>A cast such as this should have delivered an outstanding movie, so I can only assume something went catastrophically wrong with the script. Because my God was it BORING.<br/><br/>There was absolutely zero character development. If you're going to produce something that is on the long side, at least give me something to work with here? The son was killed so early (and following so few lines) I genuinely didn't care, which didn't help to lay a foundation for why I should care about Glass's prolonged revenge mission. <br/><br/>As well as the characters being entirely 2D, they also quickly became parodies of themselves. ""The Revenant Presents: Domhnall Gleeson as the Principled Yet Naive Captain (who must die as punishment for his ineptitude); Tom Hardy as the Southern Villain (with no redeeming features, who likewise must die to maintain the idea of a Just World); Will Poulter as the Impressionable Young Soldier-type and Leonardo DiCaprio as the Tortured Hero. Don't forget the Arrogant French Braggarts, and the Wise Yet Ruthless Indigenous People. Oh and Tom Hardy's Random Cockney Friend.""<br/><br/>While I still think Hardy's accent was well executed, the choice to use an accent which is often a source of ridicule (I'm not endorsing that view) only served to undermine the tension rather than build it, making him seem like a fool rather than a dangerous adversary. Admittedly, he did a kill a number of people so maybe playing The Fool was his way of lulling everyone into a false sense of security.<br/><br/>DiCaprio was convincing in his role of the Aggrieved Father avenging the death of his son, but his journey of adversity quickly became absurd rather than laudable. The bear attack was BRUTAL, and as his company quickly concluded, it seems unlikely he would have survived his injuries, particularly when being carted around in the depth of winter. <br/><br/>But no, not only does he survive, he also survives Hardy's attempt to smother him, and being dragged into a partial burial, as well as witnessing the murder of his son (which would be enough to render any of us catatonic). OK, this might be plausible, maybe.<br/><br/>Then he wanders around for a bit, spurred on by the prospect of vengeance, before being nearly drowned in a river. Again, the trip down the rapids would have been enough to drown the average man, let alone someone who has just suffered a savage bear attack followed by an attempted smothering. But no, he comes to a gentle stop at the river bank and has a nap - mysteriously without succumbing to hypothermia.<br/><br/>Cue more wandering, some assistance from a kindly fellow wanderer, and yet more wandering.<br/><br/>As if three potential deaths weren't enough (four if you account for the bear effectively attacking him twice), he's then under attack by the very people who's daughter he's just rescued, and not only does he not get shot (despite these people having been shown to be frighteningly accurate), his horse RIDES HIM OFF A CLIFF and surprise, surprise - HE LIVES! In fact, he doesn't just survive it, he guts the dead horse and SLEEPS INSIDE IT. *Beats chest asserting manliness*<br/><br/>By the end I was desperate for one of them to just kill the other so I could go home. Tom Hardy finally met his maker - not before uttering the obligatory moral message that revenge doesn't make us feel better.<br/><br/>The Revenant is a classic case of style over substance. Fantastic actors, slipping effortlessly into a range of clichéd characters, stunning cinematography, and zero emotion. I'm a crier, I will cry at the majority of films and TV shows (and occasionally books), so the fact that I not only didn't cry, but felt absolutely nothing towards any of the characters, says it all.<br/><br/>It's clearly a polarising piece of work, I've seen many other reviews here that echo my sentiments, yet my boyfriend loved it, and the average rating is currently 8.3! Unfortunately, Award Land appears to be siding with my other half. This year's Oscar Best Picture category is a crowded race with several worthy contenders - but the Revenant is not one, and I really hope it doesn't win.<br/><br/>Does DiCaprio deserve the nomination? He was one of the better things in this film, and playing such a role must have pushed him to his physical limits, so maybe he does. Frankly, he's massively overdue one so for God's sake just give the man an Oscar and let's forget this absurd study in masculine pride ever existed."

","Go and see this movie. In the cinema. As soon as possible.<br/><br/>Simply put, it is an excellent story of family, revenge, survival, and nature.<br/><br/>The Revenant is one of the most beautifully-shot films I have ever seen. I lost count of how many scenes I sat there in utter amazement, which is undoubtedly due to the brilliant directing and spectacular cinematography: there's no shaky-cam, no quick-cut editing, and a lot of incredibly complex shots which appear to have been completed in a single take. If all films were shot similarly to how the Revenant is, then the movie industry would drastically improve.<br/><br/>The entire cast did a phenomenal job and they all deserve recognition for their performances; however, if Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't win an Oscar for his breathtaking portrayal of Glass then that will be the single biggest injustice of the year.<br/><br/>Do not miss the opportunity to see this masterpiece on the big screen!<br/><br/>UPDATE: I've read an unnerving amount of other user's reviews complaining about the plot. I can understand that the plot may seem a little basic or perhaps lacking at times; however, the plot is not what makes this film so excellent, and I feel as though those who failed to recognise this have seriously missed out. You don't just watch the Revenant: you experience it. Every single element from the music to the cinematography is cleverly concocted to draw you into the film and put you alongside the cast in the brutal wintry conditions. If you've not been drawn in due to being too concerned with the premise of the story, then I fear you've missed a truly enthralling and one-of-a-kind cinematic experience.<br/><br/>UPDATE TWO: Leo won the Oscar!"
"bob-the-movie-man","9","244","405","15 January 2016"," Almost un-bearable pain
","I went to see ""The Revenant"" on the day that it was nominated for 12 Oscars, which certainly sets the expectation that it is going to be good – and it is. But I saw it described by DiCaprio as an ""epic art-house western"" and that's a good description. In the same way that Iñárritu's ""Birdman"" (this time last year) was unarguably a brilliant but not very mainstream film, so I think the Oscar buzz will attract a big audience to this movie who may find it a struggle to really enjoy. Because it is bleak unremittingly bleak, in terms of the landscape, the weather and the motives of the characters. It is also extremely violent but, unlike ""The Hateful Eight"" (another film I saw this week that was unremittingly bleak) the violence is much more gritty, realistic and visceral making the drama a lot more compelling.<br/><br/>DiCaprio plays ""Hugh Glass"", an historical figure who was a legendary fur-trapper in the early 1800's and the central figure in this bear-related yarn. Although the story has been re-embroidered over the years, the 'facts' align with the film's basic story (there's a good ""Daily Telegraph"" article outlining this - see the link on bob-the-movie-man.com).<br/><br/>Attacked and pursuing by local natives, Glass's party is striking across woodland when he is viciously attacked by a 500lb Grizzly bear. Although appearing mortally wounded, he is a highly respected individual and so is stretchered up by his boss Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). Unable to proceed further, Henry pays for the mercenary John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) to stay with him, together with his half-Pawnee son Hawk and friend Bridger (Will Poulter), to die in peace. Predictably, Fitzgerald is not to be trusted, and Glass is abandoned in a shallow grave. If this is not enough, for other reasons we won't go into, Glass has even less inclination to keep his fellow trapper on his Christmas card list. Thus is set up a classic revenge movie, with Glass determined to stay alive to enact that revenge despite the enormous odds stacked against him.<br/><br/>This is surely DiCaprio's year for his elusive Oscar as he turns in a cripplingly painful performance. It is clear that the suffering on screen is not all acting – it cannot be, given the inhospitable conditions in which the crew were filming (in Canada and Argentina). As examples he had to eat raw bison liver as well as suffering a much discussed Han ""I thought they smelled bad on the outside"" Solo moment. Despite having very few lines to deliver, DiCaprio is on screen for 90% of the time, and it is a bravura performance.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy – also Oscar nominated – is also impressive as the villain of the piece, although for most of the time his lines might have well been delivered through his Bain mask for the sense they made. He is an inveterate mumbler.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson's performance is also compelling, adding a degree of goodness and compassion to the film that was so missing from ""The Hateful 8"". (Gleeson is surely vying this year with Ben Whishaw for the busiest mainstream film appearances after this, ""Ex Machina"", ""Brooklyn"" and ""Star Wars""). Finally Will Poulter gets a chance to shine in an A-grade mainstream dramatic movie and he well and truly makes that grade.<br/><br/>Director Alejandro G. Iñárritu has to be commended for eschewing the use of green screens, insisting on live performances and in natural light to boot. Stylistically (and indeed story-wise) the film has many parallels with ""Gladiator"", with its effective and artistically constructed dream sequences. But the film is not without special effects, and these are phenomenal, most incredibly delivered during the relentless and gruelling bear attack scene: a seamless blend of live animal work and effects that make it horrifically believable.<br/><br/>There is also some fantastic camera work (by Emmanuel Lubezki) of the ""how the hell did they do that variety"". Recalling his work in ""Birdman"" it's challenging to do single tracking shots of people walking through buildings. To do these same tracking shots during a pitched battle scene is just phenomenal. During one scene in this harrowing sequence at the film's start, the camera is on the ground filming a native galloping towards a victim, then the camera is seamlessly filming the rider as he gallops away. Astonishing.<br/><br/>The only area I really didn't care for was the music, by Carsten Nicolai and Ryuichi Sakamoto. A combination of droning strings and (later) some whiny ""Ligeti-style"" elements, it was in turns intrusive, gloomy and annoying. Music should largely stay in the background to set the mood. This didn't.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a masterful film, but it is a slog and not a feel-good film to sit through. It also has significant violence which might not suit all viewers, with the final confrontation in particular being one of the most visceral fight scenes I've seen in years.<br/><br/>By the way (I had to look it up) the definition of ""revenant"" is:<br/><br/>noun <br/><br/>1. a person who returns<br/><br/>2. a person who returns as a spirit after death; ghost.<br/><br/>Now you know too – this public service announcement brought to you by One Mann's Movies!

","Pretty much everyone has written about visual appeal of the film and how nature is portrayed in raw form. I grant that. But for me movie has to have a story first of all. And this fails miserably. There is hardly any story, no connection with protagonist, excruciatingly slow pace, and absolutely no direction where movie is heading. I mean, I had to force myself to finish this and would not have missed anything had I abandoned it. Utterly forgettable. Pathetically boring."

","I went into this movie with high expectations. I came out feeling like i'd just sat through a long funeral for someone I didn't know, on a hot and humid day. <br/><br/>*********MASSIVE SPOILERS******** I BASICALLY DESCRIBE THE WHOLE MOVIE IN DETAIL *********<br/><br/>The movie started out great with a little action scene and a little bit about the main character (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his son. After that, with very little else about the story or anything to tie viewers into it, DiCaprio is mauled by a bear because for some reason he's in the forest alone after just being raided and destroyed by some Indian tribe, who are looking for some random girl. (maybe i'm missing something but that's about all I took from the beginning of the movie)<br/><br/>So the rest of the ""Americans"" come and rescue DiCaprio from underneath the bear he just killed after it nearly mauled him to death, and for some reason he survives even though in reality he'd probably had lost enough blood at that point to kill three people. The rest of the middle of the movie is watching DiCaprio breathe heavily and crawl around the forest floor with some cinematic shots of snow, and listening to Tom Hardy attempt to cover up his terrible accent by speaking as low as possible. Oh and did I mention DiCaprio has an Indian kid? Yea so he has a kid, the kids mom and tribe was massacred by Americans or French or something like that, and DiCaprio is really close to the kid and vice versa. (Yes it's the predictable average story of revenge)<br/><br/>So Tom Hardy kills DiCaprio's kid because the kid doesn't want him to kill his father. Then they leave DiCaprio behind to die (BUT GUESS WHAT??? THE MAIN CHARACTER DIDN'T DIE! WOW! DIDN'T SEE THAT ONE COMING)<br/><br/>so he regains strength, gets some support from some random Indian dude who also lost his family, but to another tribe, and then some French dudes who have the girl the other tribe is looking for, find and kill the other Indian dude, but don't see DiCaprio apparently even though he was in a giant wood shelter with a fire going. DiCaprio becomes hero and saves the girl, kills some french dudes, and rides off to get his ""revenge""<br/><br/>And you know what happens next?? HE GETS HIS REVENGE!@!!!@#!@ WOW WEE WHAT AN ADVENTURE <br/><br/>Movie ends with the Indian tribe who got their girl back finishing off Tom Hardy with a hatchet or knife, and they walk past Leo and leave him alone. <br/><br/>Seriously though, I don't understand the hype around this movie. It WAS Oscar bait, because 90% of the movie is Leo breathing heavy, acting as injured and in pain as possible crawling around grunting and moaning. <br/><br/>The only good thing about the movie was the cinematic shots and scenes, but nothing else. Insanely bland and generic story with a good setting. <br/><br/>I actually like most of DiCaprio's movies, and I think he should've had an Oscar a long time ago, but I don't feel it should be for this movie."

","Sorry but this movie is terrible. You get thrown in the movie without any explanation of the story and the characters and during the movie this doesn't improve. What really annoyed me is the fact that the movie was very unrealistic, like a lot of others users write in their reviews on IMDb. Leonardo gets attacked by a bear but survives. Fine, but after this it gets ridiculous. His body is mauled and after his friends carry him for about 2 days, Leo gets buried alive but decides to resurrect and find tom hardy, who killed his son. THe rest of the movie is unrealistic bull crap for a gullible audience. Apart from the fact that Leo almost eats nothing but is able to move his extremely wounded body around amazed me, since i have been in a live threatening situation myself and there is no way that you recover from such injuries so fast in the extreme cold and without any food. Leo also seems untouched by the cold weather and the water because he throws himself in an icy river and when he gets out he doesn't even shiver. A normal person would have hypothermia. He falls with his horse down a huge cliff and survives and when Leo gets chased by 10-20 Indians they all shoot at him but keep missing from close range and Leo EVEN FIRES HIS FLINT LOCK PISTOL TWICE WITHOUT RELOADING!! Come on, did nobody notice this? <br/><br/>I cant believe people give this movie such a high rating but they must be the people who also think a series like the Walking Dead is worth 10/10."

","""The Revenant"" is probably the most beautiful movie I have seen for a long time. This is not only due to the incredible locations, but also to the excellent (and by excellent I mean excellent) camera-work. Frequently I was just blown away by the sheer beauty of the rough terrain of Canada and how it was captured by the crew. However, there are a few drawbacks. Mainly the story (it is a very simple revenge story line) and the dialog (it is basically not existent :D).<br/><br/>When I first left the movie I was still blown away by all the great things I mentioned above (I was thinking about a 10/10 rating), but the longer I was outside the movie the more I recognized that ""The Revenant"" is a film that is incredible entertaining whilst sitting in the cinema, but also a movie I quickly forgot about when being at home again.<br/><br/>Still, the movie is definitely a must-see.

"plpregent","6","149","262","25 January 2016"," Linear survival tale in which revenge becomes secondary
","I haven't seen all of Alejandro González Iñárritu's films. Those I have seen were excellent or at least very good: ""Amores Perros"", ""21 Grams"", ""Babel"" and ""Birdman"".<br/><br/>When I saw the trailer for ""The Revenant"", needless to say, I immediately thought it had tremendous potential and got pretty hyped up about it. It showed gorgeous, naturally-lit cinematography, dynamic directing, a historical depiction of the early 19th century savagery, and what seemed to be quite a visceral performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>I thought that, with Iñárritu's name attached to it, this would be a much deeper film than what I ended up watching, at least in its depictions of history, first nations, and in its ability to exploit classic themes such as revenge and survival.<br/><br/>Without saying that ""The Revenant"" is an empty shell (although a gorgeous one), Iñárritu's film fails to impress when it comes to depth, thanks to a linear and predictable narrative structure, one dimensional characters, and a revenge plot that never manages to be compelling to the audience.<br/><br/>DiCaprio offers a demanding, physical performance with very little dialogue, but his character, always in survival mode, never reached me emotionally. All the agony grunting and wincing, enhanced by the costumes and make up sure make the character believable, but the script never allows the character to develop or to unfold anything that goes beyond an extremely narrow range of emotions. Very unfortunate.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is okay as the antagonist, another character that suffers from his development being jilted by the writers. This is an unfortunate mistake to make in a revenge-themed film, where the antagonist is supposed to nourish the quest. In ""The Revenant"", the antagonist is barely a background character that will leave the audience almost emotionless and neutral.<br/><br/>The directing (Alejandro González Iñárritu) and cinematography (Emmanuel Lubezki) are the highlights here. Visually, ""The Revenant"" is flawless. The framing of the shots, the camera movements and the snowy, low-saturation imagery are all gorgeous. Some scenes are absolutely incredible to watch.<br/><br/>Editing-wise, Stephen Mirrione could have cut a few corners here and there. And this is coming from a movie enthusiast who sure appreciates a slow-paced film. Watching Hugh Glass walk through the endless forest was great, but you do see at least a dozen very-low angle shots of trees. They're just as beautiful as they're eerie, but slightly redundant at times. <br/><br/>Overall, ""The Revenant"" is not a bad film. It just isn't a great one either. It does have its moments. Definitely a case of style over substance, ""The Revenant"" disappoints both as a revenge tale and as a meditation on the savagery of both man and nature. Plot-wise, its flaws keep ""The Revenant"" in a linear survival tale in which revenge becomes secondary.<br/><br/>Too bad."

But oh the plot. If you try to take it seriously it fails utterly. As an Indiana Jones caper it lacks wit. Too often you say 'I know he'd be dead from hypothermia/blood loss etc etc in any possible world but I'll just keep watching in case something interesting happens'. You ride your horse over a 150 foot drop, fall into a tree, and survive. You travel downstream in an icy river in your fur coat and don't drown/freeze. You manage to light a fire even when you are 9/10ths dead, there are no branches and you're flint went a few scenes ago.

"lee_eisenberg","10","173","330","13 January 2016"," Leonardo DiCaprio said what needed to get said
","""The Revenant"" marks a big turn for both star Leonardo DiCaprio and director Alejandro González Iñárritu. Following up on his roles as maniacal tycoons in ""Django Unchained"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", DiCaprio plays a fur trapper abandoned in the snowed-in wilderness. It's intense enough knowing that this was a true story, but how they film it makes it even more so. Like ""Birdman"", the movie contains several long shots filmed in a naturalistic style to create a sense of realism. Hugh Glass's determination to survive and find those who abandoned him provides one of the most harrowing stories ever put on screen. Covered in blood, sweat and dirt, DiCaprio spends much of the movie not talking, keeping the focus on his actions. And by actions, I mean that you rarely see something this intense on screen.<br/><br/>I'd say that the movie deserved its Golden Globe wins (but it repeatedly irritated me that the presenters kept mispronouncing Alejandro González Iñárritu's name). And while accepting his award, DiCaprio spoke up for the world's indigenous peoples and called on people to protect the environment from corporate interests. Indeed we should heed his call. In the meantime, definitely see ""The Revenant"". It's an experience like you can't imagine."

","In real life, Hugh Glass was mauled by a grizzly & left for dead, but managed to drag himself back to a frontier outpost. The cinematic handling of the story in Revenant, however, is straight out of Cormac McCarthy: heavy-handed with funereal music & gray-scale tones throughout, creating an overall impression that the sun rarely ever shone in those mountains in those times. Just watching it becomes a test of endurance. Cold, colorless, dismal, stark, bleak, brutal, dispiriting & ultimately pointless. Perhaps that was how these men actually lived their lives? Maybe that's the point? If there is one?<br/><br/>At the end of the film, we're left not even knowing whether Glass, after exacting vengeance on the man who killed his son, lives or dies himself.

"Auntie_Inflammatory","5","65","117","2 February 2016"," Un rêve? Non!
","I made the mistake of reading up on the life of the real Hugh Glass (the character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio) before seeing the film. What I saw on-screen was a very distorted/Hollywoodized version of his story with lots of unnecessary racism thrown in (because, you know, Hollywood just can't pass up the chance to bash Whitey whenever possible). Inarritu takes a simple survival story and turns it into a violent, gory revenge story. Sensationalism for the sake of sensationalism abounds. So do clichés.<br/><br/>There is some speculation that the real Hugh Glass may have married a Pawnee Indian woman during a period (which ended a couple of years before the events depicted in the film) when he lived with the tribe. However, there is no surviving documentation, either public records or correspondence to/from Glass, that mentions a wife. In the film, Glass has a Pawnee wife who we see in flashbacks getting murdered by an evil, White soldier because, you know, White people are horrible and Hollywood wants you to know that.<br/><br/>The real Hugh Glass had no children. Movie-Glass has a half-Indian son who he coaches to act ""invisible"" because the (racist) White men they work with will only see his skin color. His son later gets murdered by an evil, White man because, you know, White people are awful and Hollywood wants to make sure you understand that.<br/><br/>Real-Glass never killed an army officer. Movie-Glass, it is revealed in flashbacks, once killed an evil, White lieutenant who was trying to murder his very young son because, you know, White people are just terrible and Hollywood will not let you forget that.<br/><br/>Real-Glass did not rescue a woman during his arduous journey back to the fort. Movie-Glass not only rescues an Indian woman but he rescues her while she's being raped by an evil, White, French guy because, you know, White people (no matter where they're from) are just horrid and Hollywood will remind you of that as often as possible.<br/><br/>Real-Glass was helped along on his odyssey by some friendly Sioux Indians, none of whom were killed by White people in the process. Movie-Glass is helped by one Indian who is later murdered by evil, White, Frenchmen because, you know, White people are reprehensible and in case you still weren't sure yet Hollywood will BLUDGEON YOU OVER THE HEAD WITH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!<br/><br/>Fabricating a bunch of racist scenarios in order to move the story along and provide impetus for the main character is cheap and lazy screen-writing.<br/><br/>Real-Glass did not get any revenge on John Fitzgerald, other than getting his rifle back. Movie-Glass gets a very violent, bloody revenge. Real-Glass eventually let go of his anger and forgave Bridger and Fitzgerald. Movie-Glass has a weird quasi-redemption where he stops short of finishing Fitzgerald off but then sends him on to certain death at the hands of another. So, is that redemption, really?<br/><br/>The film goes way overboard depicting Glass as a super-man. I'm sure men were made of sturdier stuff back in the 1820s but when he and the horse hit that tree I just thought, ""Oh, COME ON!!"" The guy wasn't even fully recovered from getting mauled (and rolled on) by a 300-400 pound grizzly bear yet! And, no, he did not fall off a cliff in real life. Did I mention that the bear attack actually happened in August and Glass reached the fort in October? So, there was no crawling through snow or wading through icy water in freezing temperatures either. How would he not have hypothermia and/or frostbite after weeks of that?!<br/><br/>Movie-Glass occasionally has dreams where he hears his dead wife murmuring analogies about trees because nothing screams, ""This movie is really, really deep!"" like whispered dream-guidance from a dead Native-American.<br/><br/>Yes, there is lots of striking cinematography of beautiful scenery. Much has been made of the fact that Inarritu used only natural light and it does work well with the tone of the film.<br/><br/>The bear attack is both impressive and horrifying. If you know anything about how to react to a bear attack you will cringe in horror at Glass' stupidity. (Note to screenwriter: bears HIBERNATE in the Winter!)<br/><br/>The music is good.<br/><br/>I was surprised that DiCaprio won the Golden Globe and I'll be disappointed if he wins the Oscar. He gives a good performance in the film but I just don't think it's an Oscar-caliber role.<br/><br/>""The Revenant"" is sensational but not in a good way."
"jonas_bassforce","5","30","50","3 March 2016"," A bit too much and a very unbelievable story.
","I honestly don't know what to think of this movie. It's good in a way and at the same time awful. To begin with, the idea to the story is interesting. It's set in the 19th century which makes the scenario more complicated than it would be today. But then there is this whole father/son scenario which really makes no sense and seems out of place. There is some back story to it that is scattered out through the film and I understand it's there to add some tension to the movie, but there is no build up to make you feel anything about it and in the end it seems boring and pointless.<br/><br/>It is well made though and most of the scenes seems very real and believable. I sometimes grasped the chair grinning cause I really felt the reality and pain in it. The bear attack for one stands out. The acting is very good and the actors do as much as they can with the script they're given, but as much as I believe Di Caprio deserves an Oscar, I really don't think this role was the one.<br/><br/>The plot could have been more interesting. It looks a bit like they tried to make another ""Deliverance"" but failed in character development and gravity of the story. Along the way I lost interest since everything seemed to be based around how everything in the wild hurts, and the main character is hurt a lot. Still he seems to survive anything that happens to him, sometimes in the most obscure ways. At the end I didn't really care whether or not he was going to make it back home, even less if he was going to be able to avenge his son, because nothing felt dangerous anymore. I was just hoping for the movie to end because it felt way too long. They could easily have made this an hour shorter which I think would have made it more exciting and less dragged out.<br/><br/>Warning! Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>There were a number of things bothering me about this movie but what bothered me the most is that there is a huge lack of credibility throughout some parts of it, especially since it's supposed to be based on real events: <br/><br/>Mostly I was annoyed by the fact that he seems to take any chance he has to jump into the water and have a swim. Everyone who has been living in a place cold enough for it to snow during the winter knows that falling into ice-cold water when it's that cold outside, is equal to freezing to death if you don't manage to get out of your clothes and get warm somehow. Yet he barely seems to freeze at all. It's snowing and there are ice floes in the water for God's sake! In reality he would have been dead by the time he reached the riverbank, and certainly after his ""nap"". Seems like the movie makers forgot to do some research about hypothermia. <br/><br/>After the bear attack his foot is clearly broken and points in the wrong direction. Yet he manages to crawl off and swim down the rapids in ice-cold water only to be able to walk out of the river on his now miraculously healed foot. <br/><br/>The only problem to him surviving seems to be the injuries he suffered from the bear attack. I mean he even rides off a cliff and survives the fall only to miraculously survive yet another cold night of snow storms.<br/><br/>Why do they eat raw meat when they clearly have made a fire two steps away where they could cook it? It makes no sense.<br/><br/>All the lines delivered by the native Americans seemed out of sync for some reason, which is weird since todays technology in syncing picture and audio is quite developed.<br/><br/>All in all it's an interesting story but a bit boring and unbelievable way to tell it. I would have bought it if it was a fictional story, but this time it's based on real events. If you want to revel in pain, suffering and misery, and if you like to watch a movie about how hard it was back in the 19th century, please go ahead, but there are better ways to spend your money."

I may see it in hypocrisy to protest the idiot [""pendejo""] director's soap box politics. But at least I refused to pay FOR the movie directly, so they don't get my money, so there's that.<br/><br/>As for my opinion:<br/><br/>Terribly overrated. It's ridiculous, pretentious, inanely contrived (esp. protagonist's dead Indian wife), frequently dull and thematically & aesthetically anemic with one-dimensional characters especially the villains who hammed it up.<br/><br/>There is absolutely no point in this movie. <br/><br/>It is offensively politically didactic to the audience on race relations between Amerindians and whites, as if patronizing the audience by the director's self- important mockery, which felt overbearing with his overkill directorial style, like ""Look at this, look at me, isn't this pretty, great job (cinematographer buddy) Chivo!""<br/><br/>Some shots are irritating with ""in your face"" close-ups. There is absolutely no tension throughout the movie because of over-directing that is so palpably annoying it kills the enjoyment with occasional dull pacing in paper-thin plot structure. <br/><br/>There are unintentionally laughable scenes that require suspension of disbelief like CGI animals (not just the mauling bear) and swimming in the icy-cold river wearing bear fur coat with no adverse hypothermia effect (frozen to popsicle afterwards in twenty degree temperature). It's like a nature action movie with lack of logic as seen from Hollywood perspective.<br/><br/>As for Leonardo's acting, it's really nothing to write home about. It's all method acting aided by the cold and chilly air that affect the actor to nearly and almost overact. I really didn't think his acting Oscar is due for this movie. It's a pity award. <br/><br/>The movie drags way too long. An hour could be cut and nothing would be lost. Pretentious filmmakers think length equals depth, but it's the opposite. They are very shallow in preconception, heavy on sensationalism (some scenes obviously pretentious as if the director is a show-off) and light on logic and reasonable pacing.<br/><br/>Inarritu is a total hack who pretends to be an intellectual when he is not, instead he mugs as if he's on par with Kubrick. Cinematography is the only thing that's good about the movie, but still an awfully pretentious movie with no point to comprehend.<br/><br/>I checked my watch more than a few times during the movie. It's how restless I felt. Gore doesn't phase me, but Inarritu's directing is the worst and most irritating factor about this movie. <br/><br/>George Miller is very calm, controlled and serenely self-assured in commanding direction in contrast to Inarritu's desperately provocative and bore-you-to-death pretentious approach to filmmaking. <br/><br/>That Miller lost best direction Oscar to this sentimental and lecturing hack Inarritu says a lot about the idiocy of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Don't bother because it's so long and indulgent with pretension that Leo's subtly Oscar-bait overreaching method acting cannot compensate for how lousy this movie is, in terms of demerits. <br/><br/>What a piece of crap. <br/><br/>* out of four"

If you want to pay $7 to watch almost 3 hours of Leonardo DiCaprio sleeping and breathing heavily in the snow, it's the perfect movie for you.<br/><br/>It was also really inaccurate as the dude Leo was playing was somehow very literate and wrote in present day English. This would not have been the case. it was really unnecessary to have this detail in it. <br/><br/>The only enjoyable part for me was the symbolism of Leo's rebirth as he was coming out of the horse that he was in due to the weather. <br/><br/>I am only writing the last two things because i can't upload the first paragraph unless i have 10 lines. <br/><br/>But seriously. Do not waste your money on this movie. Pirate it if you really wanna see it, but even then, it isn't even worth the time."

","If ever there was a case of style over substance, The Revenant is it. Visually stunning, yes, but films have always been about more than that. If something nice to look at is what you want, go and stare at a painting or a photo for 2 and a half hours.<br/><br/>This isn't a bad film in the way that Adam Sandler films are bad, it's a bad film because there is nothing (bar the visuals) to enjoy. It is so unrelentingly grim, with zero character development, It left me asking, am I meant to care? As the film opens with the slaughter of half the group, it's a pretty brutal scene, but with no impact, as we weren't even introduced to them. This serves as a recurring problem throughout the running time.<br/><br/>The only thing interesting thing about this movie is that it serves as a metaphor for DiCaprio's own struggle to earn an Oscar. His character goes through so much Hell to survive, has everything thrown at him, and its' almost like Leo is pleading to the Academy - 'Look, look! See what I'm willing to put myself though?!'To be fair, it paid off in that respect."

","This was, in my opinion, one of the best movies of 2015. The way the movie was filmed was astonishing, the actors were great and the story was good as well. The film was shot using only natural light so all of the scenes in the movie look authentic. I have never seen a film shot so gracefully to the point where when each scene starts I am amazed again. Every scene feels like you are in it. And the bear scene that everyone is talking about, is mind-blowing. Honestly, I do not know how they did that but if you see the movie for nothing else, see it for the bear. The actors did very good as well. Leonardo DiCaprio has another stand out performance along with Tom Hardy who did great as well. Many people felt like DiCaprio did not show enough emotion for his role but I think he played the role perfectly for the type of character he was. I do not think this was his best performance but I also do not think this was his worst, it is one of his best. The story did not carry the film to me. I felt like it was a good story but the acting and the visuals of the movie really carried it. <br/><br/>So, <br/><br/>Story (How well the story was) -8.5 <br/><br/>Re watch (Are you able to watch this movie multiple times)-8.5 <br/><br/>Cinematography (How well the movie was made) -10<br/><br/>Overall, 9/10"
"Kray_Kray","9","35","62","9 January 2016"," Iñárritu's Revolutionary Re-interpretation of American Myth-Making
","There have been two masterpieces in cinema this year. In Mad Max Fury Road, George Miller gifted us a dystopian deconstruction of the inevitable consequences of the will to own: a society both totalitarian and nihilistic, headed by an obscenely controlling monster commanding drug fueled Jihadis, regulating every resource from water to mother's milk. Misread in some places with a strictly ""feminist"" critique, exegesis of Miller's film can fly marxian or libertarian – it hardly matters as the solution to the chaos of dictatorship the director provided with Furiosa's victory was both egalitarianism and freedom.<br/><br/>In The Revenant, Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu attempts something more subtle: with one stroke of his pen, by giving protagonist Hugh Glass a native wife and son, he weds an early icon of American Exceptionalism into a matrimony of Old World and New. It was not long after Glass's travails that ambitious frontier writers grew his legend, and by the end of the 19th century Glass had entered a pantheon of American folklore heroes from the wholly fictitious Paul Bunyon, to the richly documented Davy Crockett. The historical Glass fell somewhere between symbolic characters like Johnny Appleseed and fictionalized pioneer figures such as Daniel Boone. Glass's place among these icons ebbed and flowed with each new literary interpretation, but none has challenged his role as an early representation of the American cultural values based on Puritan work ethic, Calvinist Pre-Destination, and economic liberalism. By the time Thoreau poetically stamped naturalism on the emerging national character, the attributes of perseverance, ""rugged individualism"", and emotional solitude had solidified into the championing of an individual persona that collectively birthed the philosophies and policies of American Exceptionalism and Manifest Destiny.<br/><br/>Wholly within a European tradition, neither Glass's experience nor iconography made room for a shared native American narrative. The value of communalism, spiritual communication with the natural world, and preservation of the environment were never compatible with the mission to homogenize and control that environment with ever increasing technological advancements. Native lifestyles and beliefs, in particular the unwillingness to entertain the notion that land could ever be privately owned, doomed any hope for a co-existence of equals. But in the Revenant, Iñárritu suggests that Glass's almost super human fortitude and survival skills were sourced not just from the core early American cultural value of self-sufficiency, but from the First Nationer acceptance of nature as a reverential if temperamental partner; a mate not to be dominated and contained, but to be respected and cajoled into compatibility. In the face of the arbitrary brutality of nature, it is not Glass's master of technology that saves him, it is his native-like learned connection to the spirit world and his understanding of the natural world that restore and guide him. Glass is a man with a foot planted firmly in both worlds, but it is his chosen one that is both sacrificed in the person of his son Hawk, and transcended in the visions of his dead wife and son. On his recovery and ""revenge"" mission, his sustenance is derived from animism; his survival from a native conciliation with the harsh environment.<br/><br/>I believe in The Revenant the film-maker wants his audience to extrapolate the sources and resources of Glass's survival and consider the role that native peoples had in the formation and growth of a nation, to ponder and accept the importance that native people's beliefs and practices had and still have in creating a harmonious balance between a natural world that is and will always be capable of demolishing the best plans and inventions of men, and the harnessing of that world in the name of advancement. Iñárritu's revision of the Glass story is not a mere plot device; it is a radical epistemological one that poses timeless questions. I do feel the wonderful performances, majestic cinematography, and riveting action in The Revenant are all subordinate to what the director would like us to entertain about the survival and ""revenge"" of Hugh Glass."
"pfgpowell-1","6","3","3","28 May 2017"," Great on style, not quite so great on content
","I feel a bit like a party pooper, especially as The Revenant was deemed worthy of three Oscars, but I was underwhelmed by the film and not even slightly. There's no denying that visually it is a feast, and the well-known scene where Leonardo DiCaprio is attacked and mutilated by a grizzly bear is an cinematic accomplishment all of its own.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe – although given the CGI expertise about it shouldn't be – that the scene is entirely and utterly fake: the wood in which it takes place is made up entirely of 'rubber' tree props, the 'bear' is a stuntman in a blue CGI suit and DiCaprio is attached to several harnesses to allow him to seem thrown about by the bear. Which is all fine and dandy and makes for a thrilling experience. But it also leads to questions about Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's reported insistence that his troupe of actors should all go through a week's boot camp so that they get to know and understand the hardship the characters they play suffered and also look the part when it comes to filming.<br/><br/>Now, call me an old cynic but that – the reported week in boot camp – is entirely the kind of story the studio press department would like to get out there to drum up a bit of interest, for which read money before the premiere. 'Look,' the story tells us, 'this is the real deal, this is acting really suffering for their art, this is serious filmmaking' with the subtext 'this film is one you really won't want to miss because it is special.' Yes, but is it really?<br/><br/>Although Inarritu lost out on the Best Director Oscar, his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki was luckier and grabbed one of the little fellers for is camera-work. And apparently Lubezki wanted to work with only natural lighting and eschew artificial lighting so much that filming lasted at most four hours a day.<br/><br/>Well, for this old cynic it reakkt doesn't quite stack up, and that snippet of news – as well as other stories 'leaking out' that filming was 'so tough' hardened crew simply walked out of the production in protest – most certainly didn't do pre-publicity for the film (and whisper it quietly, the film's Oscar chances) any harm at all. So what of the film? Well, what of it? What is it about? <br/><br/>Superficially, it is at tale of survival against all odds. Our mutilated hero, DiCaprio, is left for dead by two men charged with taking care of him – though the younger man is far less culpable than the nasty old Texan played by Britain's Tom Hardy – yet despite his wounds, despite being at death's door for quite some time, despite plunging into icy-cold water several times, despite his skin 'dying' (which I suppose is gangrene), despite being chased be Native Americans, despite riding over a cliff and plunging several hundred feet – despite it, all dear reader, our intrepid hero manages to find his way back to civilisation after almost two months – it is never clear just how long it took - in. Once there, he is not a bit puffed and then sets about chasing down nasty old Tom Hardy and has enough energy to pretty much kill him. (He doesn't actually do the deed - he remembers the wise old words of a Native American who befriends him on the way and leaves the dirty deed that to an troop of Native Americans who also want him dead). And then he dies. Fancy! What a man!<br/><br/>Well, I was pretty underwhelmed. I was underwhelmed by the lack of a story, I was underwhelmed by a vague kind of mysticism which permeated the story but which really made little sense at all, I was baffled by the intermittent appearance of a gang of French trappers, I was underwhelmed by the gang of Native Americans whose chief is looking for his daughter, and I was underwhelmed by the film's insistence that a man who was barely alive and could, at first, only crawl everywhere, who ate hardly anything but roots and shoots should still find the energy and resolve to survive hyperthermia finally to get up and walk (and after his supposed exertions) appear to have lost very little weight).<br/><br/>Am I being unfair? Well, only if the whole film had not been pitched as 'this is something entirely different – this is real!' At the end of the day it is in many ways an entirely impressive piece of filmmaking but in many other ways it cuts to many corners to be taken completely seriously. For style it gets pretty much top marks, but sadly loses quite badly on content."

","This tedious movie is a humorless, monotonous, pretentious music video that occasionally feels like a Leonardo DiCaprio showreel. It is distractingly directed by the gimmicky showman Inarritu, whose Birman is possibly the least dramatically interesting movie ever to win an Oscar.<br/><br/>And while a movie does not need to have have likable characters, it should at least have interesting characters, and The Revenant has neither. DiCaprio certainly looks uncomfortable in the snow, but since there is nothing to his character but his affection for the young native--a relationship that does not last very long--most of the movie has a zero dimensional character struggling with the elements with elaborate, gimmicky, cg-enhanced set pieces. Despite being played by a talented actor, the lead is completely uninteresting and his quest for revenge dull.<br/><br/>This is the worst movie I've seen in the theater since the similarly humorless, monotonous, and self-important movie, Precious. The politics are very patronizing and simple minded and lacking any depth other than the typical ""we are all to blame"" rehash that so many guilty and self loathing people love, as exemplified by the ""you are to blame!"" and truly laughable final shot.<br/><br/>A feature length music video full of cg tricks, but wholly lacking in characters, drama, humor, heart, and depth. Self-congratulatory, egotistic garbage masquerading as important art that will unfortunately fool a lot of people."

","If 'Inspired by true events' means once again telling the vague, half truth, white man version of a story, then yes, that's exactly what happened. If it really is about the 'power of the human spirit', then maybe focus on the unbelievable resilience of the Native Americans that get constantly ignored in history!<br/><br/>DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, for roughly 30 minutes, then allows the viewer to not have to hear his voice for the remaining 2 hours of the film. And I'm sorry to say that his attempt to illicit my emotions with just his expressions was a failure and only made me wish the bear had finished him off...sorry. Nothing about this performance screams Oscar, and none of his previous performances do either, which is why he doesn't have one! <br/><br/>Tom Hardy plays Fitzgerald, your standard ruthless, racist, Texas d-bag, which he completely pulls off, with the exception of his voice. If he had hit his mark, then perhaps this was award worthy but instead, as with most of his other roles, he struggled with the accent and he succumbed to mumbling and incoherent speech. A shame really, so close to a perfect performance.<br/><br/>Forrest Goodluck is perfect as Hawk, and honestly he could have pulled off main character status had the film been centered around him! He was flawless!!! I felt what he felt and all I wanted was more of all of it. This kid will have no problem getting work in the future.<br/><br/>If anything the DP deserves an Oscar for the stunning locations and incredible aesthetics in this film but that unfortunately is all it deserves. Cinematography was definitely the 12th man that brought this film to its peak.<br/><br/>Just my opinion"

","It is a travesty. The scenery shots are boring and carelessly tacked on to create a disparity between the violence and serenity of nature I assume but it's really badly done. I think it's supposed to be arty? If you watch the trailer, google some pics of Canadian landscape and youtube that scene from star wars with the tauntaun you have basically watched the movie. Don't waste your money. It is soulless Oscar fodder and brings nothing new to cinema so if you want to watch the same old story of a guy surviving against all odds because revenge and manpain are powerful driving forces, go for it. You'll probably enjoy it. If you want to watch something with beautiful editing or scenery or costume design, there are way better films out there that do all of this a lot better and have a more original storyline/progressive way of showing that storyline.

Of course, only in Hollywood would it be possible to create an epic fight between a bear, four to five times the size of the pro/antagonist, yet with the bear still loosing the battle. What gives, though; as long as there is an epic CGI battle with blood splattering all over the screen, then the movie must be good.<br/><br/>Truly disappointed in yet another Hollywood garbage movie that is meant to excite the Zombies here in America."

","I was really looking forward to this, I love wilderness films. I was slightly looking forward to it less when I realized it was a re-hash of the classic Man in the Wilderness. Its a beautifully shot film with some good moments but it just seems that Hollywood bods get together, select a scenario and inject the same components over and over again. This could have been a war film set in the 1990s, or a 'defense against aliens' film set in 2200. Its the same growling macho performances, tinged with an honor and pride that only seems to exist in the dream world of Hollywood, finishing with a lesson that the human spirit, especially if you are American, seems to know no bounds. Why not tell the story like it is? People don't survive numerous powerful attacks by the same bear, or manage to endlessly dodge weapons, bullets and Indian ambushes. Build the story about what is realistic and inject some subtlety around it. People were simpler in the 19th century - this lot look like they have been spoon fed a cocktail of Tony Robbins and Bear Grylls. People are so impressed with big stars, huge performances, epic music and unworldly cinematography that they can't see that there is just so much padding to this simplistic narrative of growling and fighting. It's an OK film, it will win Oscars. Give me Richard Harris any day over this."

","Maybe I am the first one to say this but this movie is god awful. If I could give it a negative rating I would. I don't know when directors got the notion that a long movie makes for a good movie. Whatever became of good editing? I fell asleep watching Leo DiCaprio limp through the snow for 2.5 hours. Sure it's a tale of fierce determination, but really, it could have been told in 90 minutes with no loss in quality or character development. I feel that the movie was horrifically bad and would present a strong cure for insomnia. Out of mercy's sake, I would volunteer to jump into the movie and shoot him dead; to put him out AND the audience out of misery. Please note this is not a death threat but only an improvement to the waning plot. The movie is incredibly Hollywood-predictable to make me laugh out loud, even if it's based on a true story.SPOILER ALERT: In retrospect, if I saw this movie again, I would root for the bear. Hopefully the academy has some sense and realizes that they should not agree that this is good cinema just because that's what everyone else is saying...I say that the emperor has no clothes!"

","Everybody loves this picture. They praise the looks of it. And indeed, it looks beyond awesome. From a technical point of view, it is nothing short of flawless. But unfortunately, beauty is only skin deep, and if one manages to look past the the cinematography, he/she will find that the story is nothing special, in fact, compared to the praise this movie is receiving, it feels like it is a fraud. Basically it is the journey of DiCaprios character from near death to a moment of revenge, but if you take into account what his character goes trough, he should be dead already from exposure or pneumonia half way trough, instead, amongst other things, he rides a horse off a cliff and falls hundreds of feet without getting a new scratch next to the scars made by a bear. Also, the plenitude of nature shots which are there to pound in the viewers the severity of the heroes situation, despite being beautiful, are so excessive that a good one hour of the 156 minutes runtime of this movie could have been cut out without any actual loss to the story. The director is also pushing the boundaries with the flashbacks and hallucination scenes just for the sake of back story and motivational exposition. Given the depth (or lack there of) of the story, the movie should have been around 90 minutes flat instead of an almost 3 hour long epic. Honestly, when I was not bored by the national geography shots, I was hating this movie with a passion. I found it to be pretentious, hollow, with badly written characters and way too long for its own good. Also, in about 2-3 years of time, nobody is going to talk about this movie unless the topic is not the fact that DiCaprio still did not received an Oscar yet. Quite frankly, I cannot imagine anybody to want to re-watch this movie again given its length unless he/she is glutton for punishment. I could go on and on about why I find this movie to be soo bad, but it would become a mindless rant and I do not like that. It is basically the posh version of Avatar. I am just wondering when will people see this?"

","This is another film where visually it is brilliant, the acting is really good but let down by an unsatisfying story. Another film where millions are spent on locations, costumes, actors, CGI.<br/><br/>However, they go to poundland for the script. <br/><br/>It's a watch once but I doubt you will bother enduring the 133 minutes a second time.<br/><br/>If you've seen 'Jeremiah Johnson' with Robert Redford this has similar mountain men/wilderness/Indian realism. Quite possibly the makers are trying to emulate Jeremiah Johnson. <br/><br/>Similarities end there, Jeremiah Johnson has a really strong story and is a classic film of the genre.<br/><br/>The Revenant is badly let down by the script. Which is a shame. It had everything else going for it.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is exceptional and in my opinion far outshines De Caprio. (and De Caprio does a good job in the film) <br/><br/>Main aspects plot/script aspects that spoil, what visually was a great film, are <br/><br/>1. de Caprio badly mauled by a bear, leg/ankle broken, chunks out of his flesh to the bone. So badly injured that his companions give him hours to live. He cannot move or speak. Not even when Tom Hardy offers to kill him. Not even when Tomy Hardy decides to suffocate him anyway. Not even when Tom Hardy sticks a knife in De Caprios Indian son. <br/><br/>Yet rapidly through the film he has the healing capabilities of Wolverine. <br/><br/>Even flowing down an icy river for some time clutching a log. I'm not a survival expert, but doesn't being immersed in icy water kill even a fit and healthy man in minutes? But I forget we are dealing with Wolverine. <br/><br/>2. De Caprio has an Indian son late teens early twenties, who accompanied his tough 'mountain man' father on the expedition. Yet despite his upbringing, massacres n such. When the son 'hawk' finds a man trying to murder his father, his reaction is more like a vicars wife. As a result he is very easily killed. Very implausible. <br/><br/>The son is a rather pointless character other than for De Caprio's 'flashbacks' to his Indian wife, who was killed in a massacre. <br/><br/>3. If they had spent 15 of the 133 minutes showing De Caprio the family man. With his happy Indian family of wife and son and their demise. The flash backs may have more relevance. It could also have explained the otherwise pointless mentions of how 'De Caprio' killed an officer. <br/><br/>4. Numerous rather meaningless (because we have been given no real info on this subplot) 'flashback'/visitations of his dead Indian wife. Ripping of Russell Crowe's dreams in Gladiator?<br/><br/>5. The initial attacking Indians are searching for the chiefs daughter. Apparently she was stolen at some stage by 2 nasty white men. We see these same Indians trading with French trapers and finally receiving 5 of the French traders horses to assist the Indians in their search. <br/><br/>Later, a now much revived de Caprio, comes across the same French trappers. One of which is raping the daughter. De Caprio, whilst stealing a horse helps her (the chiefs daughter) escape from the French trappers. .............................What?<br/><br/>6. When De Caprio finally reaches the fort. The Captain wants to go out alone and get Tom Hardy. (Who has run off --- the little rascal) De Caprio even in his wounded condition insists on going with the Captain in pursuit. The fort is presumably manned by soldiers, of which presumably the Captain is one. There are certainly plenty of men with guns. <br/><br/>Why did they not take more men? have a posse? Then the poor Captain would not have died. You'd think a military man, experienced in fighting injuns', would have more savvy.<br/><br/>7. At the end, the bad injuns finish off big bad Tom Hardy for De Caprio. They then trot on by the wounded De Caprio, the chiefs daughter gives him a final condescending look as she walks her horse past.<br/><br/>Uhhh?<br/><br/>Summary. : <br/><br/>The film is watchable. It's not disastrous.<br/><br/>In my opinion the film makers error was doing 133 minutes of man struggles to survive after being mauled by a bear. (And makes a remarkable recovery in a remarkably short space of time)<br/><br/>Throwing in a few flashbacks is insufficient to show, that he did in fact have a life, before he met the bear."

","Technical achievements aside, The Revenant is a pretty hollow and depressing experience. Lacking diversity in tone and exploiting a unique combination of time period and environment to tell a tired revenge narrative. The story is too basic to be set against such a complex backdrop. You've got colonial politics, genocide, a civil war (Which wasn't even brought up until the third act) and yet at the centre, the emotional core, all there is is just a revenge movie. <br/><br/>No problem with that at all. It is a problem though when it's a matter of KFC being served on silverware. The best this film can provide is to watch poor Leo suffering for an hour for the pleasure of people who don't want to sit through the Oscars. <br/><br/>When I see rape used as a cynical attempt at an audience pop, I know then this is not my kind of film. That being said, the biggest pop from the audience i was with was when Hardy's character had his fingers cut. This is from a film featuring such highlights as a one shot bear mauling, graphic arrow injury detail and all other types of contemporary award bait. Finger chopping. That's what did it for people and that was because Hardy was the most interesting thing in this hawkish misery. A character, not a plot device or a motivation, but a character, with layers. What a luxury! <br/><br/>It's so sad that it's usually the little things messed up during Oscar season. Puts the work of so many talented craftsman to waste. In short, i did like The Revenant, in the cut they chose to release. It was passable. But considering it's ambition, so painfully evident on screen, passable just isn't good enough."

It stars 2 of the best actors in Hollywood, and is directed by a man who cannot seem to lose at the biggest of award ceremonies. Not to mention constant emphasis on the unique and agonizingly difficult way in which the movie was filmed. Labelled as a thrilling story of survival, who would give this a miss?<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a bang for some, but in truth it is merely a graphic bloodbath that provides little context. There are random arrows flying through the skulls of countless individuals, random butchering of a horse here and there, and very little dialogue. The only reason you know that Leo and Tom are the leads, is because they are not doing something silly like running out into the clearing alone (only to be horribly slaughtered), or staying back and killing their own horses rather than trying to escape this death trap! It is horribly unrealistic, like a bad horror movie minus any form of comedic undertone.<br/><br/>You gain some context after the first scene, where the situation is explained, and literally one character is developed: Tom Hardy. He is the only prominent talking character. A very selfish man who is willing to commit the most despicable deeds for money or survival. One of these deeds leads to the ""story of revenge"". At this point, the other main character (Leo) has said or done very little. We simply know he has a young, clearly half-native son at his side. A good vendetta will develop characters with a fundamental difference, both wielding charisma on opposite sides of the spectrum. This particular vendetta is slapped together in a very rushed manner, as the revenge plot seems secondary to the amount of time spent on survival. This movie merely uses a heinous action to create the necessary vendetta, and overly heinous it is. I found my tastes starting to sour at this point simply because the substance around the incident was very weak and the movie: otherwise pessimistic and brutal. There had been little to no character development, the charisma level was atypically low for Tom Hardy, and Leo may as well have not even been there (prior to the start of his desperate survival tactics). The acting was just fine, simply put the roles provided no vessel for charisma to this point.<br/><br/>Ironically, this story of revenge is the only thing that makes Leo any form of real life character other than a mumbling, groaning, foaming vegetable trying to keep himself alive. After the famous bear attack, which simply occurs like everything else, (randomly), it is one unrealistic survival after another. This includes a whole lot of facial/verbal agony, for which he will likely win all of the awards. The so called ""story of revenge"" remained as unfulfilling as any part of the movie. Along the way, there is a whole lot more violence, and the odd little story line which typically ends in butchery. The overlying theme: one brutal incident after another without end, and a whole lot of moaning. You could literally walk away for half of the movie, come back having missed almost nothing, and be introduced to everything this movie has to offer right away.<br/><br/>The development of any relatable emotion occurs either through horror, or pity. It did not keep me on the edge of my seat, merely wondering how much more of this I am able to watch. Any attempt at a moral or message was very poorly embedded.<br/><br/>The filming and scenery are clearly the bright spots, but this to me is simply like putting grains of sand in a tiffany's box. They have the most expensive packaging, a pretty bow, and the best salespeople, but no product. The unnecessary effort in shooting, and the ordeal the actors went through is baffling to me, but clearly not to the critics. I believe Innaritu could re-master the film ""Waterworld"" and win 12 awards if he so chose.<br/><br/>As a follow up to ""Birdman"" I cannot help but find irony. If nothing, Birdman criticized big budget violent movies that inevitably become very successful. Critics pan them, Actors become typecast, the public eats up mindless violence and thrills. Not only was this one of the most violent/brutal movies ever made, I would argue that there is FAR less brainwave activity or cause within this movie, than one of the dozen Avenger series movies. This movie has already attained critical acclaim, the main actors are in no danger of becoming typecast, and a large portion of the public likes this movie. You tell me: Is Inarritu an oblivious, fraudulent, King Midas where everything he touches turns to gold...or is he one of the smartest men in Hollywood who knew how to turn the table in an ironic fashion within this film?"

","How can I reconcile the great reviews that film critics and many (actually a majority as far as I can see) on IMDb have given this movie? Easy! Anyone who likes this film is also a fan of the Rocky films. Just like Sylvester Stallone, Leonardo di Caprio gets off the mat after a near lights-out experience and goes on to defeat the enemy of the time. That's all there is, folks - Rocky in the Rockies! Unfortunately, Rocky movies were far less boring than this steaming pile that Iñárritu has deposited (again after Birdman).<br/><br/>Is there something worse than mere boredom? Yes there is. Tom Hardy's portrayal of a cleft palate requires subtitles to decipher what the hell is this character's problem. Sorry Americans but some of you really don't render the English language in a way the rest of the world understands it. How did this performance ever get the Best Supporting Actor Oscar? In fact, how did Leonardo di Caprio get his best actor award? I suspect that it was for The Wolf of Wall Street and not this orgy of grunts and crawling out of dead horses and freezing rivers.<br/><br/>I might have given The Revenant a better rating for the cinematography as the movie lovingly portrays the Canadian Rockies. This movie was given an award for Best Achievement in Cinematography. Sometimes the Academy does the Right Thing. That being said, maybe they should have just made a travel documentary instead.<br/><br/>At the end of The Revenant, I was cheering for the bear at the beginning of the movie. Perhaps if the she-bar had really finished off Leonardo's character, I wouldn't have wasted my time."

","This movie is without doubt the worst revenge movie I have ever seen! I can't believe Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy actually wasted their time making this load of crap! <br/><br/>Nothing happens for the first 2 hours of the film, except watching Leonardo DiCaprio paw around in the snow after he was ripped to shreds by a bear. Just imagine watching Uma Thurman (in Kill Bill) crawl around on the hospital floor (after she wakes from her coma) as she makes her way to the Pussy Wagon. That's the movie in a nutshell. What happens after the bear attack is laughable - leaving only 15-20 mins for Leo's revenge - and the fact that he survives this attack is complete BS. No one could have survived this attack!<br/><br/>Here's the sum of the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is butchered by a bear, falls down a waterfall and then thrown off a cliff. Somehow, beyond credability, he manages to survive all this, and makes his way home to spend 15-20 mins hunting down the guy his killed his son. 45 mins into the movie, I wanted to walk out. Not worth seeing at the movies. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! My girlfriend and I both hated it!<br/><br/>If Leo wins an Oscar for this, it's should be for doing all the gross things he needs to do in order to survive; like eating raw animals and sleeping in the butchered carcasses of horses. <br/><br/>0 out 10 from me. <br/><br/>Worst revenge story ever!!!"

The many landscapes of wild nature are very beautiful! Leonardo DiCaprio's wounds and tormented face are so well rendered, I do not know how one can lose the Oscar for makeup. Throughout the film, Leo plays absolutely brilliant, with Tom Hardy also excellent. The movie is very well built in details, it has memorable scenes (like the one when jumping on the horse from the cliff and surviving in the freezing night that followed) and depicts very well the struggle to survive in harsh natural conditions in frontier areas in those times.

","I truly hoped to finally enjoy a decent outing at the movies. I haven't seen a decent flick at the cinema in over a year. 2015 was very painful for a fan of the silver screen with such duds as Black Mass, Crimson Peak and Sicario all previewed with that ol' Miramax feel, a brand of underground hits from the 1990's which featured great casts and crew. I also was duped into the Hollywood hype-train flicks like Ant Man, Jurassic World and The Martian... Lord knows I was finally going to get a decent flick here with Leo and Hardy, even though Inarritu's Birdman was pure garbage, IMO. Unfortunately, this ain't happening, not today. Without spoiling anything vital to the story. I will say that you will see an exact copy of the early scene in Saving Private Ryan at the beaches of Normandy, only this time it will feature cowboys (fur traders) vs Indians. You will see Leo saved from brutally cold weather in the belly of a Tauntaun like in The Empire Strikes Back, I'm sorry I meant Luke saved in the belly of a horse!? I will also say that you will see Tom Hardy do a completely outstanding job of emulating the Tom Berenger role in Platoon, however, in this flick he will be rolling around in the snow and the scar will be worn on his scalp, not on his face. Kudos to Hardy cause he really sounded like Sgt. Barnes. Hardy enjoying a smoke off a pipe really sealed the deal for me. I will also say that this script has the same revenge motif used several times before, primarily in Braveheart and Gladiator. The end result is a ton of wasted scenes featuring snowy mountains, snowy trees and snowy rivers, all of which seemed like they were stolen from, or at the very least, inspired by Godfrey Reggio. Needless to say, I could easily see Leo signing on to this Inarritu project after the Birdman hype because, Hey! if he could get Michael Keaton a best actor award... Bottom line, a bunch of pretentious garbage by Hollywood and their new favorite hack director."

A third, scenes of nature, the outdoors, environment, locale, etc that should be integral to the emotions, but are not evocative, and seem to have been filmed, then interspersed periodically for no reason and to little effect.

The first twenty minutes are pretty good, but after the bear attack it becomes both silly and tedious. Indeed it's sillier than the film where Liam Neeson gets chased around the wilderness by a pack of wolves, and at least that was quite exciting.<br/><br/>The biggest problem by far was that the DiCaprio character continued to live. In sub zero temperatures if any human, but especially one that's been severely weakened, is plunged into freezing water and then is unable to get dry he will die of hypothermia. What he won't be able to do is go back into the freezing water in order to build a horseshoe of rocks under the water so he can trap fish. This was just one instance of many.<br/><br/>A horse's chest cavity is simply not big enough to accommodate a fully grown man, Leo fires his barrel loading pistol twice in quick succession which is impossible.<br/><br/>Then there were all the continuity problems. Leo gets washed downstream but appears to arrive at a location which is at a higher altitude. Sometimes there's lots of snow on the trees, then in the next shot barely any snow at all.

The movie follows a simple revenge/survival story with Leonardo DiCaprio being the focal point of it after being left for dead by his crew in the wilderness.From watching the teaser trailer last year, I could already tell that it would be visually stunning but after watching it I have concluded that it is more than visually stunning it is a visual achievement, there are scenes that will shock you and make yourself wonder how it was shot. There are many scenes in the movie that are shot in a ""Birdman"" fashion with the slow tracking shots with long takes however it never feels like Innaritu is milking on Birdman's visual success. The movie also looks very realistic in showcasing the grit and filth of being a frontiersman. The acting in this movie is also very good and DiCaprio puts on a very captivating performance which could very likely win him an Oscar. I feel as though Tom Hardy should also be recognized for his performance as he was excellent as well. However amidst all this praise I cannot help but feel as though the film has flaws. I feel as though the plot is very simple in essence and is just how DiCaprio's character survives and how he obtains vengeance. However I never feel as though the moral Innaritu was trying to portray at moments in the movie is fully expressed. It was almost like the film was going to go in a more morally conscious direction but was changed. However the movie is still one of the best I have seen in 2015 and is sure to win many awards.

The reality is, people (even evil French), would never jeopardize their business and lives in this fashion. <br/><br/>--Our protagonist gets cold and manages to generate a fire with a flint and black powder, all well and good. THEN our protagonist is caught up in a river that is below freezing, he goes over waterfalls, through raging rapids, finds a tree piece to cling to and after several more minutes lands safely on land. The life expectancy for someone with a ravaged sickly body in such water is under 15 minutes. Our hero climbs onto shore, the camera pans somewhere else, and comes back to out hero with a blazing fire. EVEN if the guy still had some black powder (which he doesn't, he left it behind), it would never be able to start a fire with wet powder.<br/><br/>--Our hero comes upon the French and sorta saves the Pawnee Indian girl (in British Columbia), and takes a good ole black powder pistol, maybe its a flintlock, maybe. In any event, he takes the pistol, and some how manages to get off 3-4 shots with that one shot pistol, taking down Bad guys while riding a horse. Then later he gets set upon by a pack of Indians, and gets off a few more shots, taking out Indians while riding horse back, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the SEMI AUTOMATIC black powder pistol(Glass was bear mauled in the 1820s, so it was a semi automatic cap and ball pistol folks).<br/><br/>--Now we come to the climax.

He had no children. That he was in fact mauled during summer. That the colleagues of Glass killed the she bear and nursed Glass back to health, somewhere in the sunny midwest (not BC in the winter). <br/><br/>Finally, the movie does not say at the end that no animals were brought to harm, I know they used puppets and special effects in some cases for the animals, but if in fact animals were not brought to harm in the making of this movie, it WOULD say so in the credits. <br/><br/>-IE, animals were killed in the making of this movie"

","The Revenant is a drama/thriller film based on the story by Michael Punke about a frontiersman named Hugh Glass. Glass sets out on a path of revenge after witnessing his son's death at the hands of the man who left him to die. Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu.<br/><br/>The excellent cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki really brought this film to life on almost all levels. It greatly enhanced the acting by creating an immense sense of realism throughout the entire film. However, The Revenant easily could have been a 2 hour and 15 minute film, as opposed to 2 hours and 36, and still send the same message. Lengthy shots of Glass' surroundings and very little dialogue made this film feel a little longer than it was. The direction, however, was on point by Mr. Iñárritu the entire way, and every other aspect of the film was too, except for the plot. Very one dimensionally, the Revenant's entire storyline is focused on revenge, and that's about it, sure there was more dialogue and some beautifully choreographed action scenes in the beginning, but the rest of the film was mainly just Glass dragging himself hundreds of miles across almost impossibly tricky terrain. DiCaprio, Hardy, and Gleeson's performances were very good, along with the direction and the cinematography. It is a shame that these three actors, plus Mr. Iñárritu, and Mr. Lubezki, all teamed up for a film with a weak screenplay with not much too it. It would be great too see a similar combo of actors, directors, and cinematographers team up for a much more well-rounded film.<br/><br/>Direction: 9/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Acting: 9/10 Music: 8/10 Screenplay: 4/10<br/><br/>Overall: 8/10"

Then the revenge part takes about 20 minutes: the bad guy flees an army fort with all the money, and only 2 people go after him. Really? I was so bored I actually noticed the sound track being really weird: it sounded like a broken dripping faucet and it left me wondering if that's really a sound that can be heard in a frozen forest during winter. Anyway, to sum it up, I'm really disappointed for wasting 2.5 hours to see this."

","The Revenant (2015) directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu is about survival in the extreme wilderness. It's also about: revenge, a man coming back from the dead, a historical interpretation of the first settlers in America with the French and Americans encroaching upon Native American territories, and an exploration of what it means to live, and why we live?<br/><br/>Watching this is a completely different experience from Iñárritu's last movie, Birdman (2014). Whereas the majority of Birdman was shot in narrow spaces with tight frames following around the central protagonist through narrow corridors and the backstage – which created a feeling of claustrophobia – here it's the complete opposite. The Revenant creates is expansive, with a lot of wide shots and sweeping images of nature, mountains, rivers, waterfalls, the woods, and demonstrates the awesome power of nature in comparison to humans. In some ways the Revenant reminded me of another of my favorite, Terrence Malick's Tree of Life (2011), particularly in the way sometimes beautiful random shots of nature interjects the film for a few seconds, but unlike that movie, Revenant contains a cohesive narrative structure that's much easier to follow. (Note: turns out my instincts were correct on the visual resonance to The Tree of Life. On checking IBDb it turns out that the cinematographer for this movie is Emmanuel Lubezki, who was also the director of photography for The Tree Life and multiple other Terrence Malick projects.)<br/><br/>My favorite parts of the movie contained shots of nature where a character, usually Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) was alone in the wilderness. They were without any dialogues, accompanied by just the sound of nature like a roaring waterfall, or sound of melting snow from treetops, or instrumental sounds (especially the drum beats) evoking something very primal. The use of drums in a few key scenes during the later half of the movie, sounded like it did in Iñárritu's Birdman (must be his signature style). Although, I think it's far more effective in The Revenant, since sound is used so sparingly that when it is utilized, you pay attention. For example, the thumping of the drums reminded me of racing heartbeats during crucial moments of life and death.<br/><br/>In this movie, the director constantly experiments with perspectives and innovative camera-work. A lot of the perspectives in this movie is really unusual. In the beginning, during an important battle, I found the camera angle so unsettling – it felt like the viewer was a child, standing very close and looking up to the characters. The shots were taken from the waist, and from an uncomfortably close proximity, as arrows flung, and people fell to their deaths unexpectedly. Also, a lot of the violence in the movie is captured from up-close that it looks real, and the viewers also experience the pain, shock, and surprise. This is a visceral, immersive cinematic experience. I also appreciated the fact, that you can literally see the camera lens get foggy when the camera zooms in at least 3- 4 from what I counted, and the viewer knows that it's really, really cold in actuality and the shot is not some CGI trick. I loved the soundtrack; combined with the visuals, it's probably the best marriage between video and audio I have heard in a long time. The Native American languages spoken in this movie, also sounded very melodic to me.<br/><br/>The cinematography with it's sweeping landscapes, and the exceptional soundtrack need to be experienced on a big screen to appreciate the grand scale of nature. If you are a student of photography, you will love this movie. I was so engrossed in the visuals of this movie, particularly the landscapes, and the way the cinematography captures the changing seasons that I kept missing some minor events that were happening to the characters in the movie.<br/><br/>For full review see: http://www.artspeaksy.com/the-revenant-movie-review/"

"Alex1972249","8","40","81","15 January 2016"," If you think you'll be warmer inside the cinema watching 'The Revenant' this winter... You're wrong!
","'Birdman' introduced Alejandro G. Iñárritu into the limelight last award season, virtually stealing the Oscars with 9 nominations and 4 wins including Best picture and Directing. Now a year later and it's the same story with 'The Revenant' being nominated for 12 this time round. The academy aside... Can it really be as good as everyone is saying?<br/><br/>No. Good would be an understatement.<br/><br/>'The Revenant' is and will always be one of those very rare films that weren't just a trip to the cinema, but an experience. With the film being a lengthy 2 hours 36 minutes I was pleasantly surprised that I never had the urge to check my watch, because of how well the film pulled me in. We are thrown into an intense, brisk, frozen adventure of pure revenge but with far more depth and meaning than you may think. Iñárritu uses his seemingly signature long takes to completely submerged the viewer in the freezing temperatures, along with using natural light and wide angle lenses to show the vast landscapes and real settings that the characters are trying to survive in. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio's 'Hugh Glass' as the desperate protagonist abandoned by his fellow hunters after a brutal encounter with a bear, serves up one of his best ever performances. Showing that he is more than capable of expressing deep emotions with minimal dialogue. Tom Hardy's 'John Fitzgerald' is an amazing antagonist who is being hunted by Glass to seek revenge for leaving him for Dead. Hardy was great in the role, adding yet another outstanding performance to his near flawless track record of films and performances. Domhnall Gleeson is also in the film as the hunting group's leader who does a decent job, further cementing his status as an actor to watch out for with cinema-goers. <br/><br/>Whilst the plot may sound relatively simple for a 2 and a half hour film, you will never even think about the time as you'll be so immersed in the dramatic, adventure thrill ride that you'll start to shiver from the frozen environment. <br/><br/>A must see for everyone!"
"Manal1987","5","13","22","8 February 2016"," All That Went Wrong with The Revenant
","It's the Oscars season hooray! And everyone seems on the lookout for who deserves the ultimate Hollywoodian honor and who is going to go home with a gold Uncle Oscar. I've been avidly following the ceremony for years now, but that doesn't necessarily mean I hold it in the highest regard; everybody knows it's all politics at the end of the day.<br/><br/>Today I went to the cinema to watch this year's most talked about film, Alejandro González Iñárritu's The Revenant, trying so hard to ignore the two Golden Globes, the 12 Oscars nominations and the 8.3 IMDb rating. To cut things short: I was immensely let down, and here are my reasons why:<br/><br/>1) Iñárritu is a genius, there is no doubt about it, but geniuses are obviously not immune to over-inflated ego. The Mexican director has become popular with film critics and moviegoers worldwide for his ability to make films that are both aesthetically and thematically stunning – films that are so beautiful to look at and so touching you could easily relate to. Who would ever forget the heartbreaking realities of Amores Perros (2000) and Babel (2006)? And the surreal worlds of Biutiful (2010) and Birdman (2014)? After those masterpieces, The Revenant looks like a sheer act of muscle flexing. We get it, Iñárritu! You can do magic with your camera; you can take beautiful long shots, you can make a man-bear fight look so goddam real, you can film inexplicable gore and violence like no one has ever done before, yet I was bored to death because I couldn't feel the slightest connection to anything or anyone. The film comes out visually outstanding but cinematically fragile because it lacks the substance that should hold it together. The entire plot is based on a father- son relationship that wasn't developed enough (or wasn't developed at all) for the viewer to emotionally connect with Hugh Glass, the revenant, which made me feel that the whole survival quest was a bit on the absurd side.<br/><br/>2) Clichés. Clichés. Clichés! The film is so rife with clichés I actually thought Iñárritu is playing some kind of a joke on us. A die-hard hero, a classic mindless villain, a dead Pocahontas, a wise chief and of course some careless Frenchies. And don't you think the clichés just stop at character level, they run deep to include predictable plots and extremely bromidic lines and dream sequences. I don't mind that the story is a cliché revenge story, it's the treatment that concerns me. The Revenant is basically about a man who wastes two precious hours of our lives looking for another man who killed his son and left him for dead, and when he finally finds him, the evil man's dying words are revenge is no good. The end. That's it, I swear. If you can see something beyond that, please feel free to contact me.<br/><br/>3) I don't usually like to dwell on this point in my film reviews but the improbability of the events was pointless and so difficult to ignore. So we have a man who is fatally attacked by a grizzly bear, almost smothered to death, shot at, falls down a waterfall and off a cliff, stabbed and beaten (I hope I didn't forget anything), yet he miraculously survives! I expect to see him in the next Avengers movie.<br/><br/>4) Number four is not really a shortcoming but a disaster redeemed. The outstanding performance by all the cast members makes up for the one dimensionality of the roles they play. Domnhall Gleeson and Tom Hardy hit all the right notes with exceptional maturity (even though I thought Hardy's Texan accent was a bit funny, but maybe on purpose?). Both are actually growing on me in a speed of light. DiCaprio was amazing as usual but I don't think this is the performance he should get an Oscar for. I do appreciate all the trouble and the physical pain he had to go through but compared with his other performances I'm sorry Leo, you can do much better. Anyways, if he grabs an Oscar this year, he would still deserve it, retroactively.<br/><br/>The music and the sound editing in general were annoying. I would've sufficed with DiCaprio's incessant heavy breathing.. which is equally annoying to be honest.<br/><br/>Go watch Cast Away instead. If you have seen it already, watch it again it would still be a more enjoyable experience."

Of course, there are the hackneyed 'bear' and 'horse' scenes, but all in all, there is nothing to feel or worry about. To get a general feeling for the Revenant, just read through its 'Quotes' (which are accessible from the main page),- this is almost all the dialogue you hear in the entire movie. Very 'fascinating' indeed... And for all of you, who love and hype this movie so much,- I dare you to watch it again... today... Lets see how reluctant are you gonna be to do so!? I liked 'The H8ful eight' way, way better! In fact, once I finished watching it, I almost immediately started to replay my favorite scenes from the movie, - because they were so powerfully delivered.

He does not wear gloves and his fingers don't get frost bite; he falls into a frigid grand rapid river, down multiple waterfalls and doesn't instantly freeze to death; he continues crawling around in those wet clothes in the snow and still doesn't freeze to death; he's mauled by a bear, including the bear ripping a giant hole in his throat that the water he drinks pours out of and said bear dying on top of him, and he doesn't bleed to death or get crushed to death; he and his horse take a leap off a 150' cliff, the horse is splattered on the ground but Leo miraculously lands in the top of a tree and somehow survives; need I go on?<br/><br/>The movie is excruciatingly long at 2 1/2 hours.

","Loosely based on the life of 19th century frontiersman Hugh Glass, The Revenant is a brutal yet visually stunning western with one of Leonardo DiCaprio's best performances yet. The film follows Glass after he is mauled by a bear and left for dead by his fellow fur traders. One of the frontiersmen, John Fitzgerald, kills his son, and Glass voyages over 200 miles to exact revenge on him. The Revenant is one of the most violent movies I've seen from 2015, although the incredible scenery and cinematography also make it one of the most astonishing movies to look at. It combines some intense, difficult-to-watch scenes with amazing scenery which makes it one of the most beautiful violent films I've seen. Leo's committed and demanding performance is certainly one of the best of his career especially because of the lack of the dialog in the film. The 156- minute running time, relentless brutality and limited dialog does take a bit of a commitment to finish, but The Revenant is a masterfully directed film that makes the most of its subject matter's intriguing story."

Scene after scene I was in awe of the directors taught vision, the cinematographers beautiful eye, and the casts brilliant immersion into their characters; which each and every one breathed life into an already energized movie. Leonardo DiCaprio does some fine work here, not his best because i think he's already given his all to another role (The Wolf of Wall Street) but nonetheless immerses himself completely in a role which you have never seen him in before. <br/><br/>It's quite a spectacle, all of it. And tom hardy will likely receive an Oscar nod if not snagging one outright. Though I believe the real winner here is the director; Alejandro Gonzalez Iniarritu, and cinematographer Emanuel Lubezki.

I couldn't help but keep asking myself how someone could make a film look so much better than anything I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Each shot is carefully choreographed and each sweeping camera angle toggles between close and personal face shots and sweeping landscapes that make you feel both elevated, and smothered.

"CuriosityKilledShawn","3","25","48","22 January 2016"," The most mind-bogglingly overrated film in a long, long time
","The Revenant exists only as Oscar-bait, and I have no doubt that DiCaprio deserves the award for such a brutal role in tough conditions. However, the rest of the film serves absolutely zero purpose, has no deeper meaning, barely any story beyond the struggle for survival, and almost collapses under the weight of its own self- importance. This is not the first time that the story of Hugh Glass has been brought to life, but its certainly the most alienating and depressing.<br/><br/>We've seen this struggle done before. Tom Hanks in Cast Away is a lasting example of an actor putting their body through hell and going full-on cave man. Cast Away also dealt with the themes of loneliness, sanity, and the need for direction. In the Revenant I knew almost nothing of the inner workings of Glass or Fitzgerald (a rather over-rated Tom Hardy performance). Glass seems to cope just fine with being alone (the pretentious hallucinations of his family only puzzled me), but I have a feeling that this was not the intention. As for direction (within the movie, I mean) it is noble that all of it was shot on location but there is no sense of space or place. We never know where any of these characters are in relation to each other. Every new location looks different from the last but we never have any orientation or a grasp of the greater landscape. All it would have taken is a five second shot of a map with any random character saying ""here we are, and this is where we are going"".<br/><br/>Alejandro González Iñárritu's pompous style of long, long takes is completely inappropriate for this material and it took me out of the movie every time he tried to pull it off. I don't want to believe I am watching a documentary. I want to be excited and feel tension. The bear attack scene was brutal, but I would have felt more fear and anxiety had it actually be edited than done in one long shot. This kind of direction is not the antidote to Michael Bay's 1000 cuts in a minute nonsense. It was a mistake to shoot the film like this. Totally unnecessary.<br/><br/>As for the cinematography, a lot of people are praising it but it left me unimpressed. I admire the fact that they fought to shoot it all under natural light but almost every shot was wide and flat, wide and flat, wide and flat, wide and flat. Not once was I in awe of any spectacle or breathtaking natural beauty. Attenborough documentaries are shot better than this and spend less time on indulgent cutaways. Perhaps the grain and texture of 35mm could have fixed this.<br/><br/>If you want a one man against nature story of survival then watch Cast Away. If a grisly tale of genocide against a new world backdrop is what you are after then Apocalypto is much better. The Revenant bored me and I walked out of the cinema immensely disappointed."

The dialogue was clichéd stilted and racist without any redeeming quality.<br/><br/>The storyline predicable dull there was no drama, the setting was inconsistent one frame the poplar trees have their spring & summer green foliage the next frame its gray snow covered ground middle of winter with trees barren and blizzards at the drop of a hat. <br/><br/>Lets look at the plot a man survives not one but two bear attacks in the first 15 minutes. The producers would have had a better scenario setting this movie on another planet or with aliens. Of course he survives being being thrown into a grave a couple handfuls of soil with MASSIVE internal injuries and NO cover in the middle of winter in temperatures that freeze a a body solid not 20 feet away. I could go on for hours but I'm not wasting any more of my life on this believe you me it only gets worse! <br/><br/>Every movie goer willing suspends belief in reality when entering a theater. It's what we do to allow the magic of a movie to capture our imaginations to inspire and entertain us. This movie insults, degrades and then destroys that willingness in the first 20 minutes and then gets worse. <br/><br/>Its getting 1 for the scenery, stunning countryside shame it had to be an unwilling participant in this travesty of movie making."

","Cinematography- Within 10 minutes it's clear why this is an obvious win. No movie,in a long time, let alone this year has looked as strikingly beautiful.<br/><br/>Director- Alejandro Inarritu has again proved his ability to make a movie both beautiful and entertaining. He's able to craft a great story, getting the best from his actors against the backdrop of beautiful scenes.<br/><br/>Actor- Leo DiCaprio again delivers a top notch performance proving he is one of the best actors of his generation. The fact that he hasn't won yet proves what a joke the Oscars are. DiCaprio plays Glass, who after a vicious attack is not only abandoned to die but must witness the demise of his only son. Braving a never ending barrage of Indian attacks and the unimaginably cruel elements of Mother Nature while he struggles to survive and return home. (Tobe fair, Matt Damon might have been a little better I The Martian, but it's Leo's time).<br/><br/>Supporting Actor- Tom Hardy's performance is the true standout of the film, as he is actually much better in his role than Leo is in his, and that isn't a knock on Leo's performance it's just that Hardy was that good. Hardy plays Fitzgerald, a cold blooded, perpetually angry ex- Texas military man who is outraged by the mere presence of Glass (the expeditions scout) and his half Native American son. After the attack on Glass Fitzgerald takes it upon himself to decide Glass's fate & the fate of any man who would stand in his way. The strolls into town to collect the money owed him for doing right by Glass. All in all Hardy plays the role of a scumbag perfectly and shows a true mastery of his craft I scenes where he discusses his scalping and his father's view on God. It is a true shame that Stallone will probably win for nostalgic reasons when Hardy was truly the best.<br/><br/>I don't think it should win best picture or screenplay since it does get a little muddled and slightly repetitive in the middle, but still a fantastic movie that really makes you appreciate how easily we, as a whole, have it."

","At 156 minutes, ""The Revenant"" is unwatchable, so it wasn't. After an hour, instead skipped to watch a minute every three or four through to the last twenty minutes which encapsulates the final conflict between John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Hugh Glass). Nothing was missed for in between is Glass grimacing left then right.<br/><br/>There is a harrowing, savage bear attack leading to Glass hanging to life by a slender thread. Oddly, all that came to mind is how the effects were accomplished. That goes to a lack of empathy for protagonist Glass.<br/><br/>This is a film of unquestioned artistic merit. Though some gush about the cinematography, it is merely serviceable. It's not the cinematography that's beautiful, it's the wilderness. All that's required of an available light cinematographer is to set the frame and F-stop. The actors most likely kissed pavement back in civilization after shooting this demanding film. They did well under the circumstances, particularly DiCaprio. The villain is the director and the unreachable allegory he wrote on the script pages.<br/><br/>In ""Jodorowsky's Dune,"" the titular director made a few memorable Seventies' films. When pitching ""Dune,"" the studios requested a standard length film - 120 minutes (not viable for a film from a story this complex). But Jodorowsky wondered why it couldn't be ten hours or twenty hours. He was clueless why the studios weren't funding him. The doc is in part the story of a delusional, out-of-control ego. The viewer may wish to slap his face. Enter Alejandro González Iñárritu who also appears to have an ego of the same dimensions.<br/><br/>God bless the artists, but not those who trade their expression for self aggrandizement. Not only is ""The Revenant"" a vanity project, it is Oscar bait.<br/><br/>Awards should be given to those brave enough to sit through this slog. It is a simple story raised to the power of crashing bore. ""The Revenant"" is nearly incomprehensible, and filled with spiritual mumbo-jumbo even Iñárritu most likely can't explain.<br/><br/>See this if you relish masochism. It's a bet this film will bomb. Maybe that will awaken Iñárritu. He's a genius. He just doesn't know how to connect with an audience. He certainly doesn't here."

","Wow. What a classic. What an absolute legend of a motion picture. I don't often give out 10/10s, but when I do it tends to be for the sort of brutal, cynical edge-of-your-seat madness that The Revenant thrives on. I really liked Birdman, but Innaritu has done some of his best work here. From the cinematography to the performances to the technical finesse to totally maddening brutality, this is a masterpiece of epic proportions. With regards to immersion, there are sort of two types of films. Some, like the works of Goddard, seem to want to have us think intellectually about the movie, to interact with the movie as a person external to the film interacting with that film. I like these movies, but The Revenant comes from an entirely different world. This is the sort of movie that you get drawn into, where you forget that you are inside a movie theater watching a movie and instead feel the movie at a raw, terrifying, fundamental level. If the frenetic delivery of Birdman was tantamount to jazz, the bare bones brutality of The Revenant is more like industrial metal. I've seen it twice, and intend to go again, and I'd recommend that anyone with eyes and a strong stomach to do the same."

I guarantee that when you leave the theatre you will think twice about complaining when you shovel the driveway, or when you are tempted to return food in a restaurant because it is undercooked.<br/><br/>2. As a clinic in how to direct a film, Iñárritu is at the top of his game. When you think back on what you watched --- and you will think back -- you will have to conclude that the director somehow managed to tell the heavens what weather to provide on any given shooting day; and even arranged for a wild bear to attack on cue but leave the actor alive ..... there are scenes in this movie that you literally will never forget. The ""horse motel"" for one. And the demonstration that the fastest way to get to the bottom of a mountain when you are being chased is simply to jump off the top of it.<br/><br/>3. As a showcase for Hardy, this will become a welcome part of his body of work. I am convinced that Hardy, an actor who acts with his entire body, will be studied and appreciated by audiences of the future. My favorite role of his was Warrior where he practically stole every scene he was in. Child 44 is also worth a watch if you have not seen it.<br/><br/>4. Some IMDb members are hard on DiCaprio and they should not be. He is at the stage of his career where he can take a massively ""physical"" role like without having to worry about fickle fans not approving of his career choices.

Using the rough outline of the Glass arc, this movie adds absurd and, more vitally, totally unnecessary plot lines about sex slave Indian daughters and martyred, fictional sons and all manner of other rote plot devices in order to - I guess? - try and dramatize a story about a guy who *literally* crawled 200 miles without skin on his back in order to save his own life. As if Hugh needed the posthumous help.<br/><br/>Hardy might win an Oscar for his excellent performance as foil and I'm sure Leo will get plenty of hype for grunting his way through 150 minutes. But man, they're both just shadows cast behind a movie that could have been great.<br/><br/>The writers could have fictionalized a plot loosely based on Glass's life and rightly called it fiction. Or they could have made a great movie about what actually happened and sold it as truth. Instead, they manage go wrong in both directions. ""The Revenant"" dishonors Hugh Glass, disrespects its audience, and desecrates a tale worth being told much better than this. Your time would be better spent sleeping inside a dead horse."

I wanted to give this movie a 10 so bad but there was just some reason inside that I could not, yet I thought about the movie all day and couldn't think of anything wrong with it; so I came to the conclusion that it is one of those movies that you need to see multiple times before you can even begin to appreciate all the beauty it brings. Leo gives an A1 performance but I can still see the Academy finding a way to not give an Oscar for some technicality like ""He didn't have enough lines"". Really Tom Hardy was the one that took over any time he was on screen, when he was on screen things were happening and you waited intensely for what he might say next.

","The Revenant is a film that works on a plethora of levels. It follows a fairly basic storyline that the average moviegoer could wholly understand. However, there is much more looming within the incredibly imagery and filmmaking of the Revenant than one might assume. The Revenant is not a film with a clear message, but instead one with many, small hints as to what the underlying implications are. Alejandro G. Innaritu's directorial style and choices shine through this film, creating a visceral and aesthetic yin and yang as we watch the gorgeous and gentle landscapes and scenery meld with the brutal, harsh storyline and occurrences. Leonardo Dicaprio's performance as Hugh Glass is one of little dialogue, but large impact, and may win him an Oscar this year. Tom Hardy's performance as John Fitzgerald is one that is possibly more exemplary than Dicaprio's, although that's up for debate. Although parts of this film are slightly too long winded or slow, overall it is a film that's imagery and story will resonate with the viewer long after watching it, and truly pays homage to the art of filmmaking."

","The Revenant, the movie that will give Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar. For the second time in the last two years we have been blessed by the extraordinary vision and direction of director Alejandro González Iñárritu. Iñárritu brought this amazing story Hugh Glass, the frontiersman, fur trapper, and explorer that was mauled by a grizzly bear and ultimately left for dead by the company that hired him. The film follows the theme of the will to survive, bringing the audience to question, What would you do to survive?<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio will win his first Oscar for his role as Hugh Glass. If he does not win the award there is something wrong with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The scenery was amazing and to know that the film was shot with no artificial light. With Iñárritu at the forefront again don't be surprised to see him win for best director again and it sure looks promising that The Revenant will win Best Picture. <br/><br/>I urge you to see this film because of the trials and tribulation that Hugh Glass went through. The shot selection that Iñárritu used was fantastic and personally I wouldn't change it. From the opening body camera to the closing close up, the film kept you engaged and wanting more. <br/><br/>Alejandro González Iñárritu may not be the easiest man to work with in the film industry but he sure knows how to direct and how to make something truly fantastic. Though certain characters didn't have the most dialogue, what they did say ended up leaving more of an impact. Tom Hardy was fantastic as John Fitzgerald and really did a good job convincing the audience that he was doing the right thing throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Overall the film was great and will pull in some awards and people like DiCaprio and Iñárritu will be recognized for their work. The film emotionally connected with audiences challenging them to put themselves in Glass' situation. It calls into morally what one would do, as well as, spiritually what one would do. The quotes ""I ain't afraid to die anymore. I'd done it already"" really makes the audience fell for Glass and that all he does to survive and his actions are justifiable and that it is true that he has died and does not care if he does so again. <br/><br/>As I finish, I would give this movie an 8.8 out of 10 and for one last time I applaud the job Iñárritu did directing and the performance of DiCaprio and Hardy as well as others like Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson. I will leave you with the quote that stuck with me and really ties the movie together. After watching the film really think about this quote,<br/><br/>""Revenge is in god's hands not mine""<br/><br/>Thank you for reading,<br/><br/>David Horvath"

","First of all, know this is a guy movie. Blood, revenge, action. Over and over again. And for you guys, you might get encouraged by that. But I would warn against getting excited, because this film is essentially a let down. Also be prepared for a politically correct lecture.<br/><br/>There were rumours of DiCaprio getting an Oscar for this role. No chance! Why? Because it hardly requires a wide dramatic range. The whole film is one mood throughout i.e. depressing. Endless snow, cold, greyness and savagery. And it actually gets a little tedious.<br/><br/>I think we're meant to marvel at how DiCaprio survives onslaught after onslaught. But it becomes a parody. A bear attack, falling off a cliff, starving, almost drowning. The list goes on. And yet DiCaprio just keeps on going like a Duracell rabbit. They overdid it basically.<br/><br/>I wanted to enjoy this film. And Tom Hardy's predictably convincing part almost saved it. But there's only so much torture, pain and snow I can take. Add to that the politically correct message repeated over and over about whitey taking Indian land.

","How many movies does this one steal from? Let me see. The attack at the beginning is right out of 'Saving Priavte Ryan' with bows and arrows. The scene where DiCaprio's character stays warm by gutting the horse he was riding and sleeping inside it is right out of 'The Empire Strikes Back', and I can almost hear the director saying 'Let's take that a step further and have him actually sleep inside it!' Give me strength. The whole theme of a GOOD WHITE MAN befriending Native Indians in 1800s America is Dances With Wolves. In fact the whole time I was watching this I couldn't help thinking the director was trying to recreate the 'magic' of Kevin Costner's 1990 film and God knows why, as it was pretty schmaltzy to begin with! Then there are the ridiculous scenes in which suspension of disbelief is stretched beyond many films I have ever seen. I am fully aware that this is LOOSELY based on a true story and that Hugh Glass (who DiCaprio plays) actually survived a bear mauling and managed to find his way back to civilisation but in the cinematic version of events we are asked to believe that he also was dragged down a river in freezing temperatures for a few miles when his body had already been put through the proverbial ringer and didn't suffer hypothermia, that a horse he was riding leapt of a cliff with a drop of around 150 feet and that the horse dies but he survives WITHOUT BREAKING A SINGLE BONE. Really? <br/><br/>Then there are the clichés. Dream sequences in which we see his now dead wife, flashbacks to how she was killed.<br/><br/>And the made up stuff. Why oh why do Hollywood-made films insist on making up things in stories 'based on true events'?? There isn't just artistic license here, the writers saw fit to give Glass a part Native American son which he never had, just to have him killed and give his character more reason to go after his killer. And that's another thing, the real Hugh Glass didn't kill the guy because of the heavy penalty for killing a U.S. soldier, which the guy was at the time.<br/><br/>And there is the always irritating to me fact that they insist on casting actors whose accents aren't the actors native ones ie Tom Hardy is English so why cast him as an American? Especially an American in the 1800s? Is he that much of a box office draw? I was quite excited to see this because I loved 'Birdman' so much but this just reeks of a filmmaker trying to attract Oscar attention. It reminds me of when Michael Cimino was given free reign on 'Heaven's Gate' because 'The Deer Hunter' was such a critical and Academy darling, although this is a much better film than 'Heaven's Gate'. I'm giving it 5 stars because of DiCaprio's acting and the absolutely stunning cinematography. The music is quite good too.<br/><br/>Oscar nominations?

However after watching all I could think was, even if this movie wasn't ever made, nobody would've cared. The problem is not with the acting or direction, cinematography etc. I just don't think it was needed to be made as there's nothing great about it. Now I know there are plenty of movies out there, which we don't care about. But when Leonardo DiCaprio is starring in a movie, it's like you must watch it and enjoy. All this movie's about is survival (which isn't highlighted as I'd hoped for) and revenge. The problem is that these 2 things are sort of ignored by the director.

When the unthinkable happens Glass' life is in the balance.<br/><br/>Directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu (Birdman, 2014) over the period of five years in harsh conditions, this film literally changes the history of filming. Let me go through some points on why I think this is the film of the year:<br/><br/>Performances: The performances throughout are all Oscar-worthy, especially considering that this is the first film with Leonardo DiCaprio, since The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). The performances are exceptional throughout and they didn't come out of character one single bit.<br/><br/>Story: The story of the film keeps intact throughout regarding the length of the film. The director knew what story he wanted to do and he stayed with it.<br/><br/>Lighting: There was no studio used to make this picture it was entirely around nature. The use of natural light in this film is the real clincher. The director didn't use any artificial light to take away the landscape.<br/><br/>Atmospheric landscapes: This film is set in the American wilderness and was filmed in Calgary, Alberta. The acting isn't the only thing that makes the film,it is the beautifully atmospheric polar landscapes, from the vast forests to the incredible mountain ranges this film literally has it all. <br/><br/>All in all this is the film of the year and I completely recommend it without regret, and I would go through the flaws at this point but there aren't any this film is flawless. Even though DiCaprio doesn't say that much I hope he wins the Oscar. 10/10 pure excellence, a must see.<br/><br/>*Best performance by a supporting actor The Revenant (2015)."
"mark-durfor","3","11","19","20 June 2016"," Sympathy Oscar for Just Okay Revenant
","Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a frontiersman on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s. It was a particularly dangerous and desperate time as the nearly 300 year old tradition of fur trading was in its waning years. Europeans came to America hoping for gold and silver in the early 1500s. They were disappointed, but found their riches in fur, particularly beavers. By the 1800s, beavers were scarce as they were over-hunted, and they weren't fetching the prices they used to and many turned to logging and working in lumber mills. This particular expedition proved especially treacherous for Glass as he was mauled by a bear and left for dead by his team. Glass made his way home, fueled by anger and his thirst for revenge against John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), the man who left him for dead. The Revenant was nominated for 12 Oscars and took home 3. Alejandro G. Iñárritu took home the Best Director award while the film also won for Best Cinematography. And, of course, DiCaprio finally got his Oscar for Best Actor that many felt was long overdue. It was his fifth nomination for acting as he was previously recognized for his performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, The Aviator, Blood Diamond, and The Wolf of Wallstreet.<br/><br/>At first, John Fitzgerald is just a business man. He wants to stay the course and get as many pelts to take home to get as much money as they can. His decision to abandon Glass after the bear mauling was initially just a logical one taking into account Glass' chances of survival versus how much it would hinder their trek home trying to save him. That logic quickly turned vicious as Fitzgerald's greed and desperation turned murderous. <br/><br/>I thought there were some great cinematic scenes, but most of them were shown in the brief preview. Of course the big scene is Glass being mauled by a bear which looked mostly realistic. As for the Oscar for Best Actor, I feel this was done out of the same sentiment that kept Tom Hanks from being nominated for Saving Mr. Banks or Captain Philips. Most speculated he was omitted because he's already won and he'll probably win again, so let someone else have a shot. This was the opposite. DiCaprio has been nominated and many feel he should have won already, so they gave it to him. I don't doubt he would have won an Oscar some day, but I don't think this should have been the one that got him there. Hardy was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and, had Mark Rylance not been nominated for his performance in Bridge of Spies (rightly nominated and won as I speculated immediately after seeing the movie), he surely would have won for his performance in The Revenant.<br/><br/>I gave The Revenant a hesitant 3.5 star prediction. It dragged and didn't have much of a plot and the cinematography was played out in the preview. I give the movie 2.0 stars but bump it up to 2.5 because of Hardy's performance. It's a renter at best, but wait to catch it on cable and you'll be fine."

There was a lot of laughter amongst the audience, not because the movie is funny, but is is at many times over the top and highly unlikely. Yes the nature is beautiful but I'd rather watch an episode of BBC earth, that is a lot more uplifting. Overall the movie was quite disappointing. I don't get the praise at all.

","*** This review contains spoilers****<br/><br/>I'll start by saying my review may have been more positive had I not read the book first. Before getting to the movie itself, the acting was good, although I think Tom Hardy outperformed Leonardo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>After reading the book I was excited to see the movie, but ended up pretty much hating the film and Hollywood for it's typical over- embellishment and to-be-expected shame on you USA finger-wagging. Hollywood apparently thinks there are no bounds to literary license. Apparently for the screenwriter and director, surviving a grizzly attack in the middle of nowhere in the early 1800s and then setting out to avenge oneself isn't a compelling enough story, so they felt the need to leave the world of reality and add things that will make you scratch your head and say ""why?"" and ""impossible."" First things first, the attack happened on Sept. 1st, but the movie was set in the dead of winter. There is no way Glass would have survived in those temperatures and then to further insult our intelligence they kept tossing him into a freezing river to keep him wet and freezing, yet not an inkling of frostbite to mar Leonardo's pretty face. Also, the bear nearly removed his scalp, but that wouldn't do for our handsome star, instead they removed half of Fitzgerald's (Hardy's) scalp and kept Leonardo looking good. Why set this movie in the dead of winter, which would have made it impossible for Glass to survive? Also, it's not enough to survive a grizzly attack and this change of seasons, let's throw him off a 100+ ft cliff with a pine tree breaking his fall, just because the stupid audience wouldn't find the story compelling enough otherwise. That didn't happen in the book. Also, Glass never married in real life, so why add an Indian wife and son? Again, because the stupid audience wouldn't find his quest for vengeance compelling enough without Hollywood adding a fictional son to be stabbed to death by Fitzgerald right in front of Glass' face? And those awful images of his wife constantly being thrust upon us to draw us into the movie more emotionally again because the truth just wasn't' enough?<br/><br/>Now for the Hollywood sermon you had to foresee about the evil white man stealing the land and animals from the Indians – sermon provided by a chief who didn't appear in the book; and to make the white man look more evil and the Indians more victimized, Hollywood thought ""Let's add a part where the whites steal the chief's daughter and use her for a sex slave to justify all of the atrocities committed by the Indians."" Seriously?! And that's not enough! Let's make Leonardo look even better by having him, while still recovering from a grizzly attack, rescue the Indian girl from the French trappers and escape completely unharmed. The movie is basically a complete work of fiction and should stop claiming to be based on a true story and should have changed the name of the move so there was no confusing it with the book. Why not also change Hugh Glass's name to something more masculine like Dirk Hammer and cast him as a trans-gendered male. That would be compelling right? They even took events that happened to Glass and made them happen to Fitzgerald and Bridger, like wandering through the burned out village and feeding the Indian woman.<br/><br/>They painted Hugh Glass as an experienced scout, again let's build up our Hollywood star, when he wasn't at the time of the attack. Captain Henry was the only one on the expedition who have ever navigated that far west before, yet they build that into Glass's character and have Henry exclaim, ""Glass knows this land better than all of us put together."" And at the end, instead of Glass kicking the crap out of Bridger, they have Capt. Henry do the butt-kicking while painting Glass as the compassionate and forgiving one. They also change the ending. Glass never killed Fitzgerald, but he basically does in the movie, He takes Fitzgerald to the brink of death (he would have bled out within 10 min) and then stops when he remembers an Indian friend telling him that vengeance is God's, so Glass doesn't finish him off, instead choosing to dump him in the river to allow the ""fictional"" Indian chief who's watching 100 feet downstream do the honors. Why? Does that absolve Glass of the murder and make him more honorable? I don't get it. <br/><br/>The overall worst directing blunder was to set the movie in the dead of winter. Only ignorant Hollywood types who have never experienced a cold winter would think it would be possible for a human to survive the extreme temperatures, often while wet, with little to no fire and for months, not a day or two. In the movie, Glass should have been dead from the cold before Fitzgerald and Bridger ever left him. Hollywood ruined a great story by ridiculously and unbelievably enhancing it to use as a vehicle for a Leonardo DiCaprio Oscar run. And then there goes Tom Hardy outshining him. What a shame. Skip the movie and read the book. Stupid, ignorant, preachy, Hollywood!"
"Fella_shibby","9","10","17","28 February 2016"," Hardy adds a lively touch to da film. He's menacing, truly intimidating and sometimes, his eyes speak more than the crawling, moaning n groaning of Leo.
","The opening sequences are fantastic and should be seen on as big a screen as possible. Tom Hardy's character was by far the most multi-dimensional and characteristic. The cinematography was astonishing in every aspect, the acting  was great, but the story was monotonous and slow paced. Good cinematography and camera-work, and superb acting all round. From the films I have seen so far it should definitely win Best Cinematography. The scenery and backdrops are epic in scale and totally immersive. Tom Hardy blows Leo off screen for acting ability in this movie. Leo's role had a lot of crawling and moaning and groaning compared to what Hardy's role where in certain scenes he spoke with his eyes. The natural landscape and some of the scenes are overwhelming and spectacular! Sadly, this film borrows too much from the equations of Saving Private Ryan, (extraordinary opening battle scene) n Gladiator with snow, (the wife and son flashbacks were way too similar and predictable). Tom Hardy adds a lively touch to a rather slow film. He's menacing, truly intimidating and sometimes, his eyes speak more than his actions. I was wondering why a fish would be eaten raw when there is a fire just feet away? The story itself is a typical survival tale, rote and predictable, with more than a touch of Terrance Mallick's inspiration. The Cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is very similar to what he did in Mallick's movies. Mirrione has had a notable collaboration with director Steven Soderbergh n he did a terrific job in all Ocean's trilogy but with Alejandro he gets lazy. He did a lazy job for Babel n again a lazy job for the revenant. This is the type of film you must see in the theaters, the experience is just heart pounding and exciting but in the past there have been better survival n revenge dramas. Sure thing, everyone likes Leo including me. He deserves an Oscar but at least not for this role."
"jeene23","9","5","7","6 February 2016"," Stunning locations and incredible aesthetics
","DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, for roughly 30 minutes, then allows the viewer to not have to hear his voice for the remaining 2 hours of the film. And I'm sorry to say that his attempt to illicit my emotions with just his expressions was a failure and only made me wish the bear had finished him off...sorry. Nothing about this performance screams Oscar, and none of his previous performances do either, which is why he doesn't have one! <br/><br/>Tom Hardy plays Fitzgerald, your standard ruthless, racist, Texas d-bag, which he completely pulls off, with the exception of his voice. If he had hit his mark, then perhaps this was award worthy but instead, as with most of his other roles, he struggled with the accent and he succumbed to mumbling and incoherent speech. A shame really, so close to a perfect performance.<br/><br/>Forrest Goodluck is perfect as Hawk, and honestly he could have pulled off main character status had the film been centered around him! He was flawless!!! I felt what he felt and all I wanted was more of all of it. This kid will have no problem getting work in the future.<br/><br/>If anything the DP deserves an Oscar for the stunning locations and incredible aesthetics in this film but that unfortunately is all it deserves. Cinematography was definitely the 12th man that brought this film to its peak."
"littleging12","8","5","7","28 January 2016"," A Beautifully Striking Art House Film
","""The Revenant"" features the same successful formula of Alejandro González Iñárritu's previous Oscar winning film ""Birdman:"" excellent filmmaking from a very talented cast and crew. It heavily relies on its visceral power, filmmaking technique, committed performances from its actors, and the majestic beauty of its setting to overcome its simplistic story.<br/><br/>""The Revenant"" starts out strong with one of the most well shot and immensely gripping scenes of the year in which Indians attack the fur trappers. The scene was executed to perfection with stunning visuals, gut wrenching intensity, graphic violence, and a realistic perspective the audience experiences first hand through the use of a meticulously engineered tracking shot. Then there was the intense bear mauling scene which was also masterfully shot, though not as ambitious in scope as the opening scene. Unfortunately for ""The Revenant"" its best scenes were in the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>As ""The Revenant"" dragged on it became sluggish, unfocused, and almost inaudible. Although throughout the film it showed signs of life by expertly depicting intense confrontations and beautiful scenery. But at the same time, between the gripping and exciting moments, there were many dull dream-like sequences that failed to give a clear understanding of DiCaprio's Hugh Glass. For the long runtime, Hugh Glass was not properly developed to feel the sufficient magnitude of his suffering. Leonardo DiCaprio's engaging, and somatic performance was enough to overshadow this flaw, and it may even land him his first Oscar.<br/><br/>Then there was Tom Hardy's menacing John Fitzgerald. Tom Hardy's portrayal was good yet underwhelming for Oscar standards because it was difficult to understand what exactly he was saying. Yet maybe this was done on purpose for authenticity but it still made it hard to understand his character and some vital plot explanations. Finally the film felt so self-indulgent in its own style of natural light filmmaking that it seemed like the filmmakers stretched shots and sequences for too long just to show off their prowess.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""The Revenant"" is a well-acted, masterfully shot, slow moving revenge/survival art house film with amazing scenery. The film will definitely win Oscars for its filmmaking craft but falls short of greatness because of its flaws. It may win best picture, but it is not the best movie of the year. ""The Revenant"" did not fulfill its duties as effectively and successfully as ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" or ""The Hateful Eight"" to reach 'best movie of the year' status."
"bert-bril","3","15","28","25 May 2016"," Why is this movie such a disappointment?
","Could it be that you can let one miracle pass but not dozens? Is it because of all those great actors that don't make any difference at all (lots of grunting and mumbling beards)? Or the utter predictability of the story? Maybe I just can't take the never-ending hunger for revenge anymore, a subject Hollywood just keeps revisiting - over and over.<br/><br/>Looks like all it takes to win prizes is some nice visuals, a few good names, professional production. Add a few scenes from American history (maybe some are actually a bit historically correct).<br/><br/>During the movie I could not force myself to stop thinking about the terrible cold and hypothermia and how he makes these fires being fully soaked. There are so many miracles, I cannot just shake those off and believe what happens next.<br/><br/>I feared it would be something like this, gave it the benefit of the doubt, no luck. Still 3 out of 10 - but not for having a good time watching it."
"Danusha_Goska","4","15","28","16 January 2016"," I Laughed Out Loud. Bloated, Pretentious Gore-fest
","I laughed out loud several times while watching ""The Revenant,"" a bloated, bigoted, pretentious, boring, gore-fest that begs to be parodied. ""The Revenant"" is so over-the-top, so ham-handed, I never, for one second, forgot that I was watching celebrated actor Leonardo DiCaprio straining toward his inevitable Academy Award nomination. <br/><br/>I never forgot that his nemesis was played by Tom Hardy, who was struggling to avoid being pigeon-holed as a pretty boy with bee-stung lips by playing an unrecognizable psycho villain. Director Alejandro Inarritu's didactic hand was all over everything. Normally I'm very squeamish and have to close my eyes during violent or gory scenes. There's as much blood in ""The Revenant"" as in a Quentin Tarantino movie. I didn't have to close my eyes once. In fact I laughed out loud over and over. <br/><br/>DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, a real frontiersman (1780-1833). The movie version of Glass was married to a Native American woman and had a son by her. The real Hugh Glass was not. There is a skirmish between white Americans and Indians in the Louisiana Purchase. The whites leave the scene on foot. Glass is attacked by a grizzly bear. He is badly wounded. The party's commander leaves Fitzgerald behind with Glass. This makes no sense whatsoever. Fitzgerald has telegraphed that he is an unhinged, hostile, and aggressive bully who has openly threatened Glass. No sooner does the commander leave but Fitzgerald kills Glass' son and leaves Glass in a shallow grave, even though he is still alive. <br/><br/>Glass arises from his shallow grave and starts chasing Fitzgerald across what looks like the Grand Tetons. In fact the film was shot in Canada, the US, and Argentina. For many long stretches of the film it feels as if the whole point of the exercise is a long slog to find the most picturesque spot in which to bite off a live fish's head. Many shots consist of nothing more than DiCaprio, in heavy ""I've been attacked by a grizzly"" prosthetic makeup, staring into the camera, which was probably an inch away from his face, grimacing and grunting. If you don't like the sound of DiCaprio grunting, don't go see this film. All this grimacing and grunting builds up to the inevitable showdown between Glass and Fitzgerald. Cue the spurting blood. <br/><br/>Little of this is plausible. Glass is frequently seen standing in or walking through water and surrounded by snow and ice. Hypothermia would surely kill any human who attempted any similar stunt. The grizzly bear attack is plainly CGI. There is a much better grizzly bear attack in the 2009 romantic comedy ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" That film used a real bear, not computer-generated pixels.<br/><br/>""The Revenants""'s director, Alejandro Inarritu, was recently interviewed on NPR. He whined about how very, very hard it is for him, a Mexican, to live in the racist United States. He's a Hollywood millionaire. He won multiple Academy Awards for ""Birdman,"" a movie few people saw and fewer people liked. Inarritu is very Caucasian in appearance. But oh boo hoo he has to live in the horrible, racist United States as a Mexican! <br/><br/>Inarritu also whined about the evils of colonialism, which he hoped to highlight in his movie. Because, you know, it's really a bad thing when men hurt, punch, knife, shoot arrows and bullets into, rape and stab others. But, it's a really wonderful thing when Inarritu makes a film showing all these actions in gory, graphic detail, and makes a bucket-load of money marketing those very violent images. Nothing like sincerity and purity of artistic intention. <br/><br/>""The Revenant"" is overtly anti-Christian. Tom Hardy's psychopathic Fitzgerald is the one kind of interesting character in the movie, He is just about the only one who talks. DiCaprio mostly just grunts and grimaces. Though the characters are slogging through the high Rockies, Hardy has Fitzgerald speak in a British-actor-working-under-a-Mexican- director's movie-version of a Southern accent. Southerners should sue Hollywood – why are psychopathic bad guys so often Southern? Even in the Grand Tetons? Anyway. Hardy speaks in this nearly indecipherable faux Southern accent. He's a mean, weird, unmotivated, hostile villain. He talks about God and Jesus constantly. The message is very clear. The white man's God is evil. <br/><br/>A character named ""Toussaint"" rapes an Indian woman. ""Toussaint,"" of course, means ""all saints."" I wonder what Inarritu thinks of what Comanche used to do to white women captives. Google it. And don't blame me if what you discover gives you nightmares. <br/><br/>Glass gets through his travails through repeated visions of his Indian wife, who was, of course, murdered by evil white men. In one vision, Glass sees his son in a destroyed Christian church. There are paintings of Mary and Jesus, distorted by decay. Trees grow in the church. Trees are sacred, see. The church was just evil brought by the white man to hurt the Indians. <br/><br/>At a key moment in the film, a key character makes a profound decision based on whispered Indian wisdom. <br/><br/>Yes, not only are Native Americans spiritual and loving, they also know how to use combs. In ""The Revenant"" the Native Americans have groomed hair, while the whites all have stringy hair hanging in their eyes. Frontiersman needed their eyes – certainly to aim their rifles – and combs are easy to make. The unrealistic hair is just more evidence of the director's heavy-handed strain that took me right out of the movie."

"brianjbean2","5","9","15","19 March 2016"," Disappointing and over-hyped
","This films exposes Leonardo DiCaprio as a mediocre actor. Never at any point is the viewer able to get past his awkward over-acting and be drawn into the film. DiCaprio was entirely miscast in this role. He still looks too young to have a teenage son and the makeup and hair in this film doesn't change that perception. None of it is convincing. He even manages to make the real stunts look fake. Aside from that, the film is terribly slow and isn't over when you want it to be. It's gratuitous to a comical level in its violence, which cheapens it and makes it gimmicky. I actually laughed during the film's climax because it was so absurd. Tom Hardy stole this movie however. Watch this movie for his performance because everything else will let you down, from the acting to the plot and the dialogue. Even the bear phoned it in. Ugh, this movie was so disappointing and it bothers me that so many people loved it."
"sandwich_boi","3","18","35","18 January 2016"," Pretty disappointed
","I wasn't sure what to expect from this film. I didn't know much about it before I went to see it with my girlfriend but I knew it had Leo and Tom Hardy in who I both really like so I was expecting a decent movie.<br/><br/>It has enough to keep you interested right up until Leo becomes incapacitated. Then it gets boring. Long and boring. Now don't get me wrong, I thought the acting was very good but that doesn't do much for me when the story line is dull and dragged out to no end. There are certain scenes which seem to just be thrown in there - like the dreams he has of his wife... I'm not sure if those dreams were meant to be the things that were helping him fight on but I didn't get that impression. Not much was given about the background of the characters so it was hard to feel sympathy for them and in particular, there was barely any relationship shown between him and his son, so when he dies it isn't as sad as it could of been.<br/><br/>The actual story line is the most basic of all time, I am baffled at those who have said it is a great story line. Man seeks revenge for murdered family member. Like that hasn't happened before... Then there is the side story of the Native American looking for his daughter. It felt like that was just thrown in there because viewers couldn't concentrate on a 30 minute scene of Leo on his own so they thought they could distract the viewer temporarily, before getting back to the quiet dullness of the main plot.<br/><br/>Everything just seemed to be slotted in, in a kind of 'oh by the way..' fashion. No depth in any of the characters in my opinion. <br/><br/>All that being said - my girlfriend said she liked it although agreed the plot was poor. She liked the scenery and the acting. I agree with her on those things, but it needs a half decent plot to bring it together which unfortunately the film severely lacked."
"dogviewer","2","18","35","10 January 2016"," Bludgeons you, lies to you
","Pretending to be realistic, the Revenant bludgeons you with extreme, extended close-ups of gore such as a horror film might do. In this case the pretense of authenticity (""based on real-life events"") begs us to suspend our disbelief across too many literally incredible events. The pretense is shredded by various happenings in the film, that go far beyond the limits of reason. Having been badly mauled by the bear, near death and not expected to live, having not eaten for days, our hero lays out in the bitter cold all night without anything but the damp clothing on his back. The hypothermia would have killed any healthy person. Then in his diminished state he goes floating down a northern river in the dead of winter, ice water really, for ten minutes, gets out all wet and manages to survive. So far he would have been dead three times. He evades a chase by a whole gang of Indians firing bullets and arrows at him. Fourth death. He and horse run headlong off an 80-foot cliff. A tree breaks his fall, and he's just fine. Fifth death. It's not an amazing will to live. It's BS.<br/><br/>The captain doesn't take a whole crew out with him in the middle of the night in the dead of winter to hunt down the culprit--just the hobbled, ill Glass. Why?<br/><br/>This is ""real life"" events made into a comic book. The film asks us to be gullible fools. It insults our intelligence. It wants to stimulate us with intense violence, a cheap device used all too often in American films. Why? Because it's easy. It works if you let it. You're like, Wow. It speaks to the teenage boy in you. If you're not a teenage boy, move on.<br/><br/>Don't let the artistic veneer of the film seduce you into believing it's great. It just uses the same cheap shots as all the films shown in the trailers when I saw it last night--all with explosions, gunfight, gore, occult, etc. Worse, the intense, extended violence in this film could traumatize some.

","I love that this film allowed us to see things from the Native American's perspective as-well, and not just the New-American hunting teams perspective. <br/><br/>What many movies lack nowadays is the ability to really showcase character development, though I feel this movie succeeded in this. If you can grow attached to a certain character in a film, then the development of that character is portrayed correctly. I like that. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is my favorite actor of all time, because he is able to smash any role he plays with pure believability. I haven't seen all of Leo's films, but my favorite performances of his were from the movies ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", ""Inception"", ""Shutter Island"", ""Blood Diamond"" and now my all time favorite performance of his is ""The Revenant""; he absolutely dominated this role! His ability to portray a character with such depth is stupendous. He has previously played many good character rolls, yet no Oscar; if he doesn't not get an Oscar from the most in-depth character yet, then I have no idea how he will ever get an Oscar.. Give this man and Oscar already! HE DESERVES IT! 10 TIMES OVER!<br/><br/>I'm not usually one for slow paced films because they tend to drag on and on for eternity, but for the slow paced film this was, it was very intriguing. I love a film that can capture you in the moment and really bring you in on their story. Although, I do believe The Revenant ended prematurely. Though this movie goes for 156 minutes, I feel as if an extra 10-15 minutes could have been added to create a superb ending, making for a near perfect film. <br/><br/>If you struggle to stay enticed by a slow paced film because it doesn't have fast pace action and/or story movement, then I recommend you steer clear of this movie because it's most likely not for you. For those who don't mind if a movie is slow paced because it has a phenomenal story build-up and admirable character development, then I'd recommend the watch!<br/><br/>8/10"

The story was also not very compelling which makes me doubt why so many people seem to think that this was a ""great movie"". I can sum up the entire movie in two convoluted sentences: Leo plays a person who is part of a small group of frontiersmen who are at war with the natives. Leo gets attacked by a bear, almost dies, remains crippled due to the attack for the majority of the movie, watches his son getting killed by a fellow frontiersman while being unable to do anything about it, gets left behind in the wilderness to die (by the aforementioned traitor), seeks revenge, gets revenge, end of the movie. <br/><br/>It was pretty disappointing and totally predictable (the end, that is)."

I also had a problem with the beginning of the film which just jumps right into an Indian battle without establishing who the characters were or why we should care about them, and the ending in which Glass decides at the last moment to let the Indians do his killing for him because that makes him a better person somehow. The Revenant from all prognostications is the film that will finally get Leonardo DiCaprio his Best Actor Oscar, with that I am more than OK with as he should have gotten one a long time ago, however I think he has made better movies than this one."

"lmaldarella","10","8","13","15 February 2016"," A deep and subtle comparison between survival and life
","The Revenant, (n. one who has returned, as if from the dead). The Revenant is a beautiful piece of cinematic art. First I will address the quality of the film. This movie is, in my opinion, unmatched by any other film in history in terms of its cinematography (props to Emmanuel Lubezki). Each scene begins, and sometimes ends, with a breathtaking shot of an equally breathtaking landscape. Each shot is essential to the scene's content. The direction is masterful. Inarritu once again managed to outdo himself. Every single scene has a purpose. Every single shot a meaning. Every word a purpose. The acting is superb. I will not buy into the ""overdue Oscar"" hype. Everyone who has won the Award for best actor deserved it. I will however note that none come close to DiCaprio's performance this year. No one could have brought the emotion that Leo brought to Hugh Glass. With none but a few lines of dialogue, Leo's acting has stunned me like never before. Hardy exemplified evil in a way that I haven't seen since Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs, Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, and Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men.<br/><br/>On to the film itself. I've seen so many people cite this film as simply a revenge western, a biopic adventure, and a survival movie. While it certainly employs aspects from all three of these, it isn't any one. This film is about life versus survival, man vs. beast, and the relationship between parent and child, love and revenge. It accomplishes its goals just as beautifully as its cinematography accomplishes its trip to the Oscars.<br/><br/>The environment of The Revenant is a violent and unforgiving one. It does not care whether you live or die. This is essential to the films success. The entire film is really a case study of the human spirit. Think about the bear. The bear is in the same environment as Hugh Glass. It faces the same dangers and difficulties. It has to eat, drink, and survive just like Glass. And it will do anything, I repeat, anything, to ensure the safety of itself and its children, including kill. In many ways, Glass is just like the bear. Glass is thrust into the brutal world of The Revenant and is forced to survive. Unlike the bear, protecting his child is not enough. If the bears cub is killed, she will not avenge it. She will not crawl from her grave, half- dead, to find the one who stole her child. Glass is human. There is more to life than survival. And he makes that all too clear. The film emphasizes his struggle to survive, but his struggle to survive is fueled by the struggle to live. <br/><br/>The bear attacked Glass because she saw him as a threat to her cubs. Glass attacked Fitzgerald because he killed his son. The difference between life and survival, in the minutes leading up to the haunting ending, is that life demands vengeance, while survival demands only breathing (although this assertion is strongly challenged in the last 15 seconds of the movie.)<br/><br/>All throughout the movie, Glass is portrayed as a bear-like creature. He eats raw buffalo, he grabs fish out of the river and rips into them, he sleeps naked inside an animal carcass. But why? To survive? No, he should have died. By all odds, he would have died. Why didn't he? Because the need to live, not survive, live, drove him out of his grave.<br/><br/>The subplot serves to further reinforce the strength of a parent- child relationship. The Indian chief will stop short of nothing to find his missing daughter. He slaughters hoards of people to find what was taken from him. <br/><br/>The ending. The seemingly unanswered question is this: was Glass staring emptily into the camera because he had not killed Fitz, but rather allowed his fate to be decided by the chief, or was it because he had fulfilled his quest for vengeance and felt no satisfaction? I choose to believe the latter, that after crushing death to find life, and completing his mission, he felt no satisfaction. Life, is more than revenge. His son was gone, he needed to accept this. This point is further reinforced by the grateful nod of the chief and his daughter as they ride past. The chief sought life, and found his daughter. He found life. Glass found revenge. He thought he was finding life, but he only found empty satisfaction. Why did his wife walk away form him at the end? Was she approving or disapproving of his actions? Throughout the movie, her words drove him forward, but, now that he reached his destination, she no longer is there to drive him. I see this as, ""You've completed your mission. But, as Fitz said ""Ain't nothing gonna bring him back"". What will you do now? Will you succumb to death? Or will you truly find life?"" That question rung in my head for the seconds of blackness following his empty and seemingly hopeless stare, and has rung for days after the credits rolled."

","Okay, this is a really good action film, but it's too gory and predictable. Fitzgerald is an irredeemable bad guy. The entire scenario was too good to be true. Leonardo DiCaprio was terrific in acting the part but his character had not 9 but 10 lives in this movie. How is it possible for a person near death to survive so many ordeals? The one with jumping off a cliff and surviving the fall when still very much not in great shape is remarkable and unbelievable to me. Of course, I knew the fate of the captain at the end before viewing the last scenes and DiCaprio's trick to get Fitzgerald at the end was used in a previous movie. This flick reminded me of the one with Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson. Tom Hardy played Fitzgerald very well, but it was difficult at times for me to understand what he was saying."

If you have been watching Iñárritu's films such as Babel, Biutiful, Birdman and The Revenant, you will know what I mean. It's like a one-take shot of 20-30minutes scene and its really cool.

He is left almost dead, mute, water is pouring out of his throat as he drinks and then he has to watch his son getting killed unable to move a limb, only whispering his protest.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a flooding, at some point we have an avalanche, Glass gets buried and rises from the grave, he is born again naked in something that really reminds me of a horse womb.<br/><br/>What is supposed to drive the Revenant is merely a weak revenge plot. Not convincing at all.<br/><br/>To keep the audience entertained violence is used very calculatedly. A chopped of finger here, a bloody bit of an ear there, flying in the air, as the villain spits it out.<br/><br/>Antagonist is pure evil like the hostile nature itself.<br/><br/>Altogether the archaic conflict between man and an evil environment is told in an unsatisfactory way, the movie does not go beyond mere postures.

","I'm not really sure what to make of 'The Revenant'. It has been a week since I saw the film but it sort of feels like a distant memory.<br/><br/>I definitely have respect for the film. You've heard this before but I have to say that the cinematography is pretty fantastic. I was never in awe at its beauty but it pretty much captured the perfect look for the film. I can't help but feel that it looks ""correct"". The long takes and hand-held shots are also pretty impressive. The acting is great all round. Pretty much every actor does an impressive job in the roles that they are well suited for. <br/><br/>However, I wasn't really that engaged. I wasn't bored out of my mind either, but the great craftsmanship can only go so far. The characters aren't very interesting or relatable. This is especially a problem for Hugh Glass. He didn't feel like much of a person, which meant I couldn't feel his desperation or the brutality of the more violent or gory parts of the film. I will admit that there were a couple of moments where I looked away from the screen to see who in the cinema was talking. I'm pretty sure I missed one of the dream/flashback montages earlier on in the film because of this, which could have resulted in me not caring much about the character, but I still feel that we didn't learn much about the character throughout the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, 'The Revenant' is a bit of a disappointment. It is a technical wonder but there was too much focus on making it look real and not enough focus on laying down the foundations that would make it actually feel real.<br/><br/>(In case you're wondering what happened to the people in the cinema talking, it got the point where I had to shush them.

I had the impression he wanted to win another Oscar and tried way to hard to put everything in this movie what he thinks the academy wants. His movies seem to get more and more some kind of strange spiritual parts that i cant relate with. <br/><br/>All other movies he made are at least good (Birdman ...) and two are great (Babel and Amores Peros) but this one was plain bad in my opinion. Birdman wasn't the best film last year but it was cool in its strange way with some great dialogs and only few flaws. The Revenant is just one big flaw ... he tried so hard to make the movie look realistic but completely forgot to do the same with the screenplay. The story is very simple and artificial it reminded me of bad TV shows. I think the basis for the screenplay was ""how do i get another Oscar"" not ""i have this great story to tell"". <br/><br/>The overall acting is very good with Tom Hardy being great. However Leonardo DiCaprio had better performances (Revolutionary Road) but still plays at a high level like he always does.

Innarritu's latest exercise in human misery is two and a half hours of Leonardo DiCaprio suffering capped off by a showdown that finds him getting what he wants -- the death of the man who left him for dead after being mauled by a bear and then killed his son. Does Innarritu use this story to bring any insight into the human condition? Are we given any reason to care about DiCaprio's character other than a couple of obligatory flashbacks that use narrative shortcuts to tell us that he had a wife who was killed? Could the villain, played by Tom Hardy without a hint of nuance or subtlety, be any more of a caricature? Innaritu directs every single shot with a self-conscious sense of self- importance, as if he's pausing to say to the audience, ""Just wait and see how impressed you are going to be with my directorial skill."" Too bad it all adds up to such a boring, one-note slog.<br/><br/>DiCaprio will win what everyone seems to think is a long overdue Oscar for this performance, despite the fact that he's given the same performance in his last ten movies and he's asked to do no more in this one than grunt, moan, and grimace his way through it.

","My wife didn't want to see The Revenant because she thought it might've been a bit blokey with all manner of violence and blood and miscellaneous gore. And in truth she probably wouldn't have liked it very much. So I went with a blokey-bloke , on a sort of mandate but there certainly wasn't any handholding and personal spaces were very much respected.<br/><br/>The movie is about a grizzled frontiersman with good teeth who, in the tradition of cinematic grizzled frontiersman was married to a native American who dies when she is shot and a bird flies out of her. The grizzled frontiersman with good teeth is called 'Glass' and played by Lenny DiCaprio Glass and his mates slaughter gazillions of merkins and they are attacked by vengeful native Americans who force them to row down the river. They get off the boat for reasons that eluded me but there were icebergs.<br/><br/>Glass sees some bear cubs and their mother sees him and, possibly having experience with grizzled frontiersmen with guns (or perhaps she had seen 'Titanic'), gives him an absolute flogging. She ambles off happy that lessons have been learned but they haven't and she returns to give him an even more severer lesson and Glass shoots her and stabs her and she is dead. We are given no information on what happens to the cubs. I hope they survived.<br/><br/>Glass doesn't die but more bad stuff happens to him than you could poke a stick at and he is bent on revenge. Most of the bad stuff is the result of a villain called Fitzgerald and a partial burial.<br/><br/>Other bad stuff happens too and is the result of the French who are likely all called 'Lucky Pierre'. Hey; it's an American movie! Americans hate the French after they sensibly and quite correctly stayed out of Iraq. I know some French folk and the loathing is reciprocated. I digress.<br/><br/>In keeping with the need for white grizzled frontiersmen to be seen as fully rounded, modern, caring sensitive and sympathetic, Glass meets a new native American bestie (with whom he shares Bison Liver Tartare) and saves a chiefs daughter from a fate worse than death involving Lucky Pierre. The bison was killed by a pack of digital wolves. To further prove empathy Glass looks sadly at piles of Bison skulls that appear at random throughout the film. The fate of the skulls he was responsible for are not recorded, but beaver skulls are pretty little I guess and without cinematic appeal.<br/><br/>In truth, the vengeance trail is more than a little Wile E Coyote. Every time he is about to succeed in his quest, something horrid and deadly happens to him but he inexplicably survives to continue his quest for the villainous Road Runner, Fitzy. Armed (presumably) with ACME powder and matches he keeps on keeping on. In a biblical twist, he is born-again! From a holy horse.<br/><br/>Leonardo doesn't have a face that lends itself to looking vengeful.<br/><br/>He has a magic coat that keeps him warm and toasty even after swimming in icy rivers. He is a good swimmer too.<br/><br/>In summary it is as plausible as a Bristol Palin abstinence lecture. But there is lots and lots of really REALLY nice scenery and it was all I could do to stop myself 'ooohing' and 'aaaahing' at the majesty of it. There is a lot of snow and sundry chilliness and you should wear a jumper if you see it, particularly if you are a sympathy-shiverer."

It was about ten minutes after that that I looked over to my wife, she seemed bored out of her mind. As the credits rolled, I asked her what she thought. She went on to list off all her problems with the film, mainly the length and how 'boring' she found it. I on the other hand, found it utterly visceral in the unrelenting grittiness that bathed over my eyeballs. <br/><br/>After a vicious bear attack, Hugh Glass is left battered and beaten. His men try their best to help transport him back to their settlement, yet the harsh environments and tracking Natives on their heels make it near impossible. Three men, including his son, decide to stay behind with him, while the others venture forward. One of those men is Fitzgerald, who only volunteers due to the promise of extra money when they return. Fed up with waiting, Fitzgerald takes matters into his own hands, leaving Glass behind to die. Fueled by revenge, Glass is determined to stay alive, crawl 200 miles and kill the man responsible for leaving him in the dirt.<br/><br/>There's been a lot of talk about the behind the scenes drama surrounding this film. Multiple crew members quit mid production over the shooting conditions, which included harsh cold weather, dangerous stunts and only using natural light. The trials and tribulations of those who created this film, benefits us, the audience. The film is absolutely gorgeous and should undoubtedly win Lubezki a third straight Oscar for the cinematography, a first in the Academy's history. There were multiple moments where I simply sat in awe at some of the beautifully painted pieces of nature that both Lubezki and Iñárritu give us. There were many times during this film that I felt like I was watching a Malick film, which makes sense since Lubezki shot The New World, which feels similar to The Revenant. <br/><br/>There's been a lot of buzz around Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, how it might finally earn him that alluding Oscar statue. Honestly, he deserves it. The man ate raw meat and he's a damn vegetarian. Most of his performance, which is brutally savage, has him fighting for his life. He doesn't say much, it's hard to talk after having your throat slashed by a bear. DiCaprio always delivers great performances in my opinion, this one took him to his utter limits. It's hard to see another performance this year that deserves it more. I pass equal praise to Tom Hardy who stars as Fitzgerald, the ""villain"" of the picture. Hardy always seems to disappear into his roles, this one is no different. He's equal parts menacing and rough. DiCaprio is strong and you need just as strong a performance to support him, Hardy does this in spades. <br/><br/>I'm sure there are people out there that will have the same reaction as my wife. The film isn't perfect, it has some issues. There are numerous sequences that showcase DiCaprio's dead wife, these elements stall the already lengthy film. Had these sequences been cut out completely, or even down to one scene, it would have helped significantly. The film clocks in just under two and a half hours. That is a long film about a fur trapper slowly making his way across some rough terrain. Add on top of that the long take shots that Iñárritu loves to show off and you have yourself a film that feels long. Iñárritu loves to showoff his fancy camera work, he did this almost obnoxiously with Birdman a film I did like. He does it again here, sometimes to great effect, sometimes to annoyance. The camera gets so close to the actors at times that their heavy breathing literally fogs up the lens of the camera. It takes you out of the experience and reminds you, this is a film....<br/><br/>...but what a film it is."

Leo's character is wounded severely by a bear, and is eventually left behind by the group with a few others to take care of him.

","Was it wrong of me to laugh? I just couldn't help but see the protagonist as the Wile E Coyote, with that same stupid wide-eyed look of fear and pain on his face during every action scene. And without giving anything away, one fight scene is Tom and Jerry / Itchy and Scratchy at their finest. Even the fans of this movie surely won't be able to deny that.<br/><br/>Perhaps if I hadn't seen the exact same expressions on Leo's face in the quaalude-fueled fight scene in The Wolf Of Wall Street, I wouldn't have been prompted to laugh so hard. Mind you, it was the same dumb expressions he had in The Aviator that preceded it, and I laughed then too, also inappropriately, I later discovered. And if you weren't playing for thigh-slapping laughs, Alejandro, why did you have the bear roll down the gully and land on top of him? Comedic genius.<br/><br/>I may have even felt bad for laughing if I had some compassion for Glass. But when he's making every misfortune to befall him just so damn hilarious, it's hard to see him in any real threat or pain. Being a monosyllabic ape didn't help either.<br/><br/>In about 24 hours, this movie, its director and its star will win Academy Awards. Which will achieve exactly what the sole intention was from the moment it was conceived. Just as well, because it certainly wasn't entertainment. Although to be fair, I think there's a whole subculture about to pop up of devising 'secret soundtracks' for this movie, where you turn the sound down and replace it with something else instead. Those in the know are surely trawling the Loony Tunes archives as I write."
"stankactorman","Null","22","46","20 January 2016"," Style over substance
","THE REVENANT: I realize what I'm about to say will sound like blasphemy to those who consider Alejandro Inarritu a cinematic god, but I gotta call it like I see it. Let me say at the outset, I fully appreciate the artistry of Inarritu's superb direction, his innovative use of highly choreographed and well rehearsed long takes, the splendor of the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, the severe climatic conditions and the logistical nightmare it must have been to shoot in such inhospitable locations, the hardships the cast and crew endured and on and on. But, I have learned after decades of performing and directing theater, the average audience member doesn't give a crap about any of that and I have to comment as an average audience member. Nobody cares how hard you worked, that you were in rehearsal for five or six weeks, what obstacles you overcame or what your process was to achieve the finished product, we just want to be entertained or moved in some emotional way or be made to think. The problem here is this: Instead of being emotionally involved, we're sitting in the theater wondering 'how did they do that?'. I found many of his choices to be repetitive. Each new scene beginning with an Ansel Adams-like landscape photograph, skyward shots pointed through the trees, the moon shining through parting clouds, rifle barrels entering the frame in extreme closeup and long tracking shots of beautiful scenery. I admit I had to look up revenant: 'A person who has returned supposedly from the dead'. The film ""inspired by true events"" is the survival and revenge story of fur trapper Hugh Glass, as played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who was severely mauled by a bear and after some efforts by his companions to save him, is eventually left in the wilderness to die. We then spend the next two hours watching DiCaprio moan, groan, grunt, crawl and stagger through the film while his will to live is fueled by his hallucinations of his dead wife and son urging him to go on. His son, who's mother was Indian, is killed before his eyes by the villain as played by the mostly unintelligible Tom Hardy. Fortunately the visual images are strong enough that we can figure out what's going on without his dialogue. All of Glass' struggles build to an exciting but predictable final confrontation scene. Revenant may possibly be the best directed movie and it is likely that Inarritu will win the Oscar. But is this the best picture of the year? Not by a mile. DiCaprio, who will surely be considered as one of the best actors of his generation, does a fine job. But worthy of an Oscar for Best Actor? Not in my book. As you may recall, I was not particularly impressed with Inarritu's Birdman. I find that he seems more concerned with style ('Look what I can do!') over substance and therefor, sad to say, I felt nothing. Score: 8. Go, but it will leave you cold."

You must watch the movie without conscious to enjoy. Many scenes and actions are out of nature.<br/><br/>Also it is too long, well one can suppose to see good panoramic scenes nevertheless they are not included.

The cinematography was excellent as was all of the acting, but that's not enough to make a great film. If the plot is hackneyed, then great acting and camera work can't save it. <br/><br/>I was stunned by the music - in a bad way. Is challenging music dead? The producers took a risk of having the audience barely understand most of the dialogue, but they don't trust viewers with challenging music? <br/><br/>What will people remember about this film?

That said however, the real-life story of the mountain man, Hugh Glass, is well-known in Western lore.<br/><br/>Visually, ""Revenant"" is stunning and markedly superior to the 1971 version - as is to be expected with the advances in cinematography in the intervening 45 years - but dramatically it's pretty poor fare when compared to ""Man In The Wilderness"". DeCaprio doesn't even come close to capturing the gaunt suffering of Harris's Zachary Bass and Domhnall Gleeson's performance is pretty pallid compared to the craggy awfulness of John Huston' Captain Henry.

","The best things about this movie are the beautiful scenery and cinematography, the top-notch acting and some interesting dream sequences. But what is it all for? Everyone knows the plot: Somebody killed my (insert loved one) so I'm going to kill him. Have we not seen this a thousand times? Is it really different when shot in the wildernesses of Canada, Montana and Argentina? I almost walked out of the movie after the bear mauling scene. Many have criticized this scene, but what troubled me about it is that a supposedly experienced woodsman would be unaware that you have to flee if you see bear cubs, and if the bear attacks, you're supposed to lie still. Also from what I know an experienced woodsman would be able to tell that a bear was in the vicinity and would leave the area as soon as possible.<br/><br/>The movie improved in the last half because the action heated up and there was more dialogue. Tom Hardy deserves an Oscar and DiCaprio deserves a Purple Heart. There was some minor drama involving a third character. I'm just not sure this simple story deserved the enormous amount of effort that went into making this film."

","Hours of emptiness and snow , i sincerely demand a refund on the lost time. This movie is waaaaay to loooong. Where should i start. First thing , Di Caprice should have died ten times before the end of the movie. Being mauled by a damn grizzly nearly to death and he survived. He was left for dead in a hole while it's freezing , still he survives. Swimming in cold water and not dying of hypothermia , CHECK. Falling from 45 feet cliff without dying CHECK. Left again by the Indian with rotten flesh and not dying CHECK. OK now you begin to think there is some action in this movie. In fact that's the only piece of action you'll get. They filled the rest of the movie with scene of nature from far . I really loved seeing DI Caprice walk for like 5 minutes without any action. Naaah i'm joking it was boring as F. You add to that some Indian gibberish , a lot of vision of his wife flying above him and you get the revenant. It is true that revenir means come back in french. And i going to be very hard to get back from the trauma of boredom that this movie inflicted to me. Last thing : with these kind of weapons, it's just impossible to shoot someone from 110 yard .

"geocapital","3","15","30","16 January 2016"," What's the buzz... tell me what's happening
","I really enjoyed the Birdman, last year and I thought this year's Alejandro G. Iñárritu's work would share some of its virtues... Alas... Based or not on real events, this movie is a 2015 rendition of Rambo II. The main differences are: It's a few decades later, Rambo is played by Leonardo Di Caprio, the director won the Oscar last year, it's located in the American wilderness in the winter, Rambo doesn't show any muscles and (here comes the spoiler) he dies at the end.<br/><br/>The similarities: Glass, the main character is almost immortal. He can get attacked by hundred of (as it's not Vietnam in this case) Indians, animals, can avoid bullets but kill in one shot everyone he needs.<br/><br/>He is also left by his comrades to die, but yet, survives, heals himself in the freezing cold and crawls back for revenge.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a Hollywood movie with everything. A star in the main role, lots of action, amazing visual effects, shootings and of course the protagonist who can't die with anything... until the very end. There is even a Boss fight at the end, as any good (or not) video game ends with.<br/><br/>In the positive side, Iñárritu is a very good director and his technique is obvious in this movie as well. I liked the camera moving from one character to the other as the fight goes on or as people move around coming even too close to the camera. It was an interesting idea, and an interesting modification with the Birdman's continuous camera shooting, but keeping the signature distinct. Di Caprio has evolved to a good actor, but I still believe his best role so far was in Django unchained. In this case, for a large part of the movie he cannot walk nor talk, which might give him the Oscar, as several actors who played people with mobility or other issues, have got before.<br/><br/>So, 3 stars only because the director is good. The story is long and boring, the scenario uninteresting, the fight with a bear a big joke, the healing in the winter also. I hope Iñárritu will give us something good next year."

"johnplocar","9","12","23","9 January 2016"," Hold on, I'm having a heart attack from the intensity here...
","""The Revenant"": Do you want to encompass that feeling of surviving some of the most intense circumstances that could happen to a human being? Well then, I give you ""The Revenant""! I just saw two films about survival; one was legitimately great and the other wasn't, this here is hands down is the great one. Set back in the 1820s when a man, Hugh Glass, is left for dead in the wilderness to fend off against wildlife, ravaging natives and pillagers on his journey to seek vengeance against John Fitzgerald; the person responsible for the wrongs that were dealt to him. <br/><br/>This was an obvious passion project for director Alejandro Inarritu, the cinematography is some of the best that I've seen this year or even in the last few years. I would even say that the camera work done in this movie puts some parts of his last film, ""Birdman"", to shame. This was really something to admire for the effort put into the technical aspects alone. There were moments where I couldn't believe they captured what they did on location with using all natural lighting instead of studio enhancement, which was a giant risk that completely paid off. And any times there was CGI implemented was flawless; all the effects in this film were done with a lot of perfectionism because I could never tell I was watching a film, I saw a man struggling for dear life to make it out alive in a series of awful situations. So many times I kept trying to figure out how they did what they did on the screen, but immediately dropped it because I just wanted this guy to stop getting attacked before I had a stroke from the stress.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprioman, if you don't finally get an Oscar for the grueling process that you must have gone through for this then something is clearly wrong going on there! He did a crazy good job in this film, I won't say this is my favorite role of his, but out of all his performances this is probably the hardest work he's done and it definitely shows on screen. The whole time I was biting my nails hoping that he lives, each and every time something goes south. I could have probably used a bit more comradery between his character Glass and his son, but as it is I thought it worked well for his character to not be so easy to relax. Tom Hardy also does a good job as Fitzgerald; at this point, I'm not fully sure as to where he is even from anymore. Within the same year I've heard him have an Australian accent, two separate British accents, and now a southern/Texas accent. He's always a joy to watch and from the start, you just know that this dude is a bit messed up in the head. When he goes into detail as to whyyou get it. It's always interesting to see what Hardy does next and how adaptable of an actor he can be with 5 different roles in a single year to come out, all totally different going from one to the next. He can be the perfect hero, or in this, the perfect villain. And the climax between DiCaprio and Hardy is at least a heart attack and a half. There is no choreography going on here, it is two men getting down and dirty to kill the other. It is brutal to watch and I couldn't look away for a second, just kept yelling out ""OUCH""!<br/><br/>Now if I have any gripes or criticisms about the film, I'd say that it does drag slightly during the second act and probably could have been cut down a tad. There were some gratuitous shots of trees a number of times as well as some voice overs that could have probably been left out. As it is though, this was still quite the ride. It will end up probably in my top ten of the year, but there are still a number of others that I still have to see first. If this plays near you then I recommend seeing this if what I've said sounds like your cup of tea, it's without a doubt worth the sit."

","So yes the cinematography is excellent. Lubezki (the main camera man) has drawn on all his experience from his work with director Terence Malik - not a static shot to be noticed. <br/><br/>However, and it is a big HOWEVER, the actual screenplay itself I feel is where the movie is let down big time. I just frankly feel that the story asks too much of the viewer. As per Blake Snyders ""double mumbo jumbo"" rule (viewers can only accept one piece of magic per film) Iñárritu expects us to believe three:<br/><br/>1. Glass survives a bear mauling (fair enough)<br/><br/>2. Glass survives a bear mauling AND a post-icy river swim in sub zero temperatures with no pneumonia<br/><br/>3. Glass survives a bear mauling AND a post-icy river swim in sub zero temperatures with no pneumonia AND a serious jump off a cliff on horse back<br/><br/>I'm sorry but I find this absolute nonsense.

","Forget the hype likely brought to you by those who think the Batman films are high art with religious overtones.<br/><br/>This is a silly, over the top, confused, ugly slog that is often laughable. The opus opens with dimwitted trappers in the Rocky Mountains, circa 1820 or so, being attacked by Indians. Rather than take shelter or even lay down to fire back at the arrow shooting Indians, the trappers mill around offering good targets for said Indians who pick off maybe half of their number. The trappers decide to split the scene after a bit and that's that with that for a while. <br/><br/>Along the way home, one of their number gets attacked by a remarkably ineffective grizzly bear. Now the bear has an open season on this guy, bites him a dozen times, mauls him repeatedly yet doesn't kill him which should get the bear the ursine Oscar for the worst performance by a bear in a supporting role. <br/><br/>The boys face a confused crisis - do the trappers stay around waiting for the guy to recover or continue to flee a bunch of lackadaisical Indians who may be vaguely sauntering after them at a leisurely pace? They split the difference delegating a subcommittee to hang out while the majority flee. When the subcommittee withdraws from their nursing duties, the mauled guy gives chase. <br/><br/>So here's a guy who should be dead but he endures more on his trek back than most hale and hearty humans can take. I won't list them all but check this one out. He flees some Indians who may be the the attackers or maybe not (there are many factions none of which are clear) by taking a long swim in a partly frozen river. Huh? <br/><br/>The passengers who hit the water at the Titanic sinking lasted maybe 45 seconds. In water of similar temperatures, this half dead baby faced actor lasts hours emerging no worse for wear. Well, why not. Anybody who can stand up to a sustained grizzly bear attack must view a few hours swim in near frozen water nothing more than refreshing. <br/><br/>Along the way he manages to steal the world's first and maybe only repeating flintlock pistol. These smooth-bore arms are universally tack driving accurate. One guy uses his musket to pick off a rider over 200 m away while our baby faced frozen trapper has no trouble making a 50 m offhanded shot from his galloping horse hitting a rider on another galloping horse. Camp Petty calls these guys. <br/><br/>In the end, the thing wraps up with more Indians wandering on set to fulfill a prophecy of baby face's now dead wife and although he gets stabbed a few more times, he remains doing just ducky. <br/><br/>Grim, confused, miserable and at parts laughable - today's high art."

","Oh what can I say about The Revenant? It's a two and an half hour epic with Leonardo DiCaprio doing his darndest to act like an injured man abandoned and trying to survive in a world of harsh elements and enemies, but unfortunately he's also up against a cast of others whose acting, to put it bluntly, just plain sucks. I've never seen Tom Hardy overact before, but here you have an example of it and it isn't pretty. I guess when you're doing three or four blockbusters a year, one of which requires you to play two different people, you have a hard time putting your heart and soul into your character.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is also up against a script that kept me scratching my head. Everything in it seems borrowed and haphazardly pieced together: the opening action sequence seems borrowed from Saving Private Ryan (only with arrows and hooting ""Indians"" instead of guns and Nazis); the mood seems borrowed from Into the Grey; the main character borrowed from Dances With Wolves (although stripped of all humanity and charm). Nothing seems new here. Furthermore, none of the characters are developed, likable or relatable. They are all fowl mouthed, brutal, murderous savages, including DiCaprio's character, whose only connection to humanity is his love for his son; and in regards to that, only God knows why, since the kid is so miserable, bitter and brooding himself.<br/><br/>The Revenant is visually stunning (I'll hand it that), and if you can suspend your disbelief, you are in for a real treat. Personally, however, I couldn't get into the grand finale, when DiCaprio is sprinting, as nimble as a doe, through the ice and snow, when just a few weeks before in this movie time a great big bear mauled him so savagely that he barely clung to his life, tearing his flesh to shreds and breaking several of his bones--not to mention every thing that happens to him AFTER that--yet he's somehow back to full strength for the obligatory revenge scene. When exactly did his broken leg heal without being set or put into a cast, for example: when he was tumbling helplessly down a waterfall or when he was single-handedly taking on an entire French brigade?<br/><br/>No. Sorry, Alejandro González Iñárritu. You can throw all the finesse in the world into your movie pal, but if it doesn't ring true, I won't be emotionally engaged.<br/><br/>So there you have it: my take on The Revenant."

","The first hour and a half or so of this film is deserving of an 11/10. This film has some of the best cinematography i have ever seen in my life. Along with that DiCaprio gives perhaps his best performance of all time. This is a very visually structured film meaning that there is very little dialogue and a lot of DiCaprios is in a different language anyway. The film takes its time and doesn't clog the audience with excessive exposition. Many complaints on this site are against the depth of all of the characters but after watching it three times you begin pick up on the point of the flashbacks. You see what DiCaprio and this boy went through many years ago and you begin to understand Dicaprios deep connection with his son. Tom Hardy also gives an excellent performance as well. He does not have these flashbacks but that is because the audience can figure out all they need to know about him through his actions. Hardys character did have a role in which more dialogue was given and in every sentence he spoke and every move he made you would begin to dive further and further into the character and understand the extent of his insanity. There are some quick flashbacks of Hardys character that I have yet to decipher. The only flaw that i could find with the movie is that DiCaprio suffers life threatening injuries one too many times. The first hour and a half is one of the best movies I've ever seen with the second have being one of the best films of the year. Phenomenal movie for those who can endure it."

","An impressive synthesis of even poorer audio quality than Brokeback Mountain; considerably duller than Dances With Wolves-and contains about as much high class cinematography as a gratuitous wet fart on the set of the Blair Witch Project. However if you enjoy Leonardo grappling around dressed in the pelt of a bear in the wilderness along with listening to Tom Hardy's incomprehensible slurs for well over two hours- then this film is for you. If, however you prefer something which has more substance, a well articulated and interesting plot and acting that is worthy of an Oscar, I would perhaps avoid this film more so than the bubonic plague. I found the whole film to be utterly painful to watch, needlessly long and an unfortunate and irredeemable waste of time. Watch Star Wars instead for goodness sake."

","I agree with several other writers that this movie turns out to be a disappointment to the exception of the cinematography...i truly don't believe that Di Caprio should get an Oscar for this performance which in view of the plot could have been done by any stupid super-hero type actor like chuck Norris, Steven Seagall, Jean-Claude Van Damme, this is way too unreal for being a good movie in my book...but since everybody seems to be under the opinion that Leo deserves an Oscar for his career, he may very well get it for this one, i think it would be sad, he has done much better movie performances, for example his performances in ""The great Gastby and Django Unchained, or Inception or even Catch me if you can are much better without a doubt.

"thedaver500","10","17","36","9 January 2016"," Visceral, savage, and beautiful.
","The Revenant was fantastic. It's definitely worth seeing in theaters. Movies like this are a truly rare experience.<br/><br/>First of all, the obvious. It is a visual and technical masterpiece. Filmed on location in the wilderness with all natural lighting, this is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. It truly feels like you're placed in the American frontier along with the characters. It's a stunning mix of old, new, and groundbreaking film techniques.<br/><br/>The film makers went through hell in order to create as authentic of an experience as possible. No obvious and glossy CGI special effects here. Even an avalanche was created for real by detonating explosives in a mountain. Also, all of the actors fully committed to look and act the part of hardened wilderness explorers.<br/><br/>However, this movie isn't for everyone. This isn't a romanticized patriotic flick like most Hollywood movies set during America's early history. It's visceral and savage, examining the relentlessness of nature and the harsh reality of frontier life. The fight scenes aren't just set pieces designed to entertain the audience. They're gripping and absolutely brutal. I've seen bloodier movies, but almost none have felt this real. It's obvious that a lot of the stunt work was done by the actors because there are no quick cuts or cheap editing tricks during the action sequences. Even Tom Hardy, who can be seen pole vaulting onto vehicles in Mad Max: Fury Road, was concerned about the safety of some of the stunts he had to perform. That being said, this is NOT an ""action"" film. Much time is spent on the captivating landscapes and quiet moments of being alone in nature.<br/><br/>The story is simple. It's about the fight for survival over limited resources in the wild. It almost feels like a nature documentary because the people are just another species trying get by. Almost all violence erupts from the need for self preservation. The bear that attacks Glass is simply defending it's cubs. And even the villain of the story is driven by fear, not just because he's the ""bad guy"". The acting is all phenomenal. There wasn't a single mediocre performance. I doubt we'll ever see a film like The Revenant made again."

","Like everyone who's following the awards season, I believed the hype surrounding The Revenant. Therefore I was disappointed watching it, especially trying to find anything award-worthy in Mr. DeCaprio's performance. After all, his dialogue through most of the movie consisted of grunts and whispers (a bear in your throat will do that) and the breadth of emotion, other than the connection to his son, was primarily grimaces of pain.<br/><br/>The scenery and photography were great. How much of it is CGI one cannot tell, though I did learn that locations had to be moved from Canada to South America when the Canadian snow melted, so I suppose there was some ""real"" ice and snow.<br/><br/>Maybe I didn't pay enough attention, and a second or third viewing would answer some of the questions: Where was the movie supposed to be sited? Western US, or Canada? Who were the various friendly and hostile natives? Who was running the trading post? But sitting through 2.5 hours again? No. Once Glass begins to recover, the denouement is predictable and inevitable, but still an hour away....and who cares?"

"dcarsonhagy","5","7","12","21 April 2016"," The Never Ending Movie
","I finally got around to watching ""The Revenant"" last evening. It won three Oscars (total) for best actor (DiCaprio); best director; and best cinematography. Anyone who watches it should win an award for perseverance.<br/><br/>The story is about a man and his son, both fur trappers, who get caught in the middle of all sorts of savagery. Their hunting party is attacked by Indians and most of their men are killed. After trying to come to some sort of plan, the remaining parties set on for a nearby fort. DiCaprio's character goes off on his own (to hunt, I suppose) and is savagely mauled by a grizzly bear. He is then left for dead by his own hunting party, and the remainder of the film has him searching for the person responsible for killing his son, a fellow hunter named John Fitzgerald, played superbly by Tom Hardy. <br/><br/>First of all, I was not impressed all that much by this film. I do not understand the rave reviews it got, and am even more turned off by the tales of its over-bearing director. Rumor has it that Tom Hardy choked his ass out!! But I digress. I am glad DiCaprio won the Oscar, but anyone who knows his work knows he should have won for other roles. <br/><br/>I had a huge problem with the ending. The viewer has to sit through almost three hours of watching a man savaged by animals, other men, and the elements, with the only thing keeping him alive--his revenge on the guy who murdered his son. Yet, the ending seemed so contrived to me that it was as though the director said, ""Okay; I've had it with this project. Time to go home."" Either that or it's akin to having sex for better than two and half hours with absolutely no pay off.<br/><br/>Rated ""R"" for graphic violence, rape, castration, and nudity."

","Well acted and well photographed, yet unfocused, as it is told from multiple perspectives (DiCaprio's, Hardy's, and the Native Americans) , while I think Hardy's character was much more interesting and conflicted than DiCaprio's. <br/><br/>Film turns DiCaprio's character into a sort of wilderness superhero, able to survive being mauled by a bear (twice) , hypothermia, near drowning, and, in the film's best scene, a fall from a great height while on horseback. However, its dramatic effect is largely negated by the fact that the scene was shown in the trailer. Even worse, by that point in time, we are positive he will survive, considering all he has already lived through. <br/><br/>There's a difference between resilience, being determined to survive, and being an indestructible (and unrelateable) superhero."

The problem, as in so many movies these days, is one of plausibility. Without giving too much away our hero (DiCaprio) survives not one, not two, not three but about 7 brushes with CERTAIN death. <br/><br/>Colossal loss of blood, wet clothes in a sub zero environment, strangling, smothering, , falling off a cliff, drowning, knives, guns, Indians, baddies, gangrene..................the list goes on and on and all that was really missing was a red cape, a kiss curl and a cameo performance from Stan Lee.<br/><br/>Awards should go to the technical folk and it must've been a tough shoot for the cast but when you boil it all down there's a lot more gravy than meat and potatoes."

The first 35 minutes of the movie are good, then around the second act, it gets crucially dull, then the last 35 minutes are good, but the plot of the script of this movie is not intriguing. The movie could have been shorter and it would have been better in my opinion. The characters were very flat, however, Tom Hardy's character was by far the most multi-dimensional and characteristic.

"bartonj2410","10","10","19","17 January 2016"," Inarritu's tale of survival and revenge is beautifully brutal in its execution
","From the opening moments of The Revenant, I knew this film was going to be special. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's film opens with a mesmerising battle sequence, both brutal and beautiful in its execution, and goes on to tell a captivating story of survival and revenge that will remain as one of the more memorable cinematic experiences I will ever have.<br/><br/>When a party of fur trappers are driven off course by an attack from a Native American tribe, they look to Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), a frontiersman who knows the territory well, to set them on a new one.<br/><br/>After being mauled by a grizzly bear and with his life hanging in the balance, Glass is eventually left for dead by members of his own hunting party, leaving him facing a fight for survival and a chance of revenge, if he can survive the harsh conditions.<br/><br/>The troubles that the film faced during filming have been well-documented, with crew members quitting due to the harsh conditions and locations however, the finished product would suggest to me that it was all worth it because The Revenant really is an amazing piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>I left the cinema absolutely breathless, mainly just because of how visually stunning the film is. There are shots that will leave you opened-mouthed and shots that will simply leave you questioning, ""How?!"". The decision to shoot the film in natural lighting is a brave one and it really adds such an authenticity to proceedings. There's a moment late on in a forest where the only light given off is from torches and it's just glorious.<br/><br/>Cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, really is in a rich vein of form in his career and his work on The Revenant really is up there as some of the best I have ever seen, his wide shots showcasing the vast and beautiful mountainous terrain and his long takes during the opening battle sequence, taking us from tussles on the floor to horseback in one flowing motion, setting the film off in such pulsating fashion. Lubezki has won the last two Academy Awards for cinematography, expect the third one to be his come the end of February.<br/><br/>The film's length has come under a bit of scrutiny but I could have easily sat through a further half hour, I was that engrossed in Glass' search for revenge. The film is a basic tale of survival and revenge yet, through Inarritu's filmmaking choices and narrative, there feels so much more to it all. <br/><br/>There is one intense scene that has already made the headlines for all the wrong reasons and that is the moment Glass is mauled by a grizzly bear. Obviously created through CGI yet feeling as real as anything else in the film, it really is an outstanding moment that I will just have to wait for the blu-ray to see just how they did it.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, The Revenant is just as strong as other departments. Leonardo DiCaprio leads the film as Hugh Glass and it's much more of a physical performance than anything else, using his eyes and facial expressions to great effect throughout. By the end, you feel as if you have gone through everything, from freezing cold conditions to eating just about anything to survive, with Glass. While I don't think this is his best performance, it's still one of such a high standard and I will be cheering him on for the much coveted Academy Award for Best Actor.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is joined by an impressive supporting cast, headed by the always impressive Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald. Hardy again possesses a bit of mumble here though it's not hard at all to make out what he is saying but I did notice more than ever in this Hardy performance just how much he uses his eyes in his acting. Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter are also on hand to provide able support, Gleeson as Captain Andrew Henry and Poulter as the naive Jim Bridger.<br/><br/>I am aware that, like many of the films going for gold during awards season, The Revenant has leaked online however, I urge you to seek it out at your nearest cinema because it really is an immersive cinematic experience that simply has to be seen on the big screen."
"Reznik_T","6","10","19","13 January 2016"," Good but not great
","The opening scene - with all the action and the amazing camera work - is really strong, as well as Leo's scene with the bear, which looks frighteningly realistic. But as the story unfolds, and Leo's character finds himself alone in the wilderness, the movie becomes very slow paced, even boring at times. Not much happens from that point on, and what does happen you can pretty much see coming. Also, to be honest, DiCaprio is not doing a lot in this movie, other than moaning, crawling, running, swimming and shouting. Sure, he does a fine job with the material he got, but there's nothing extraordinary about his performance. Furthermore, there are some great scenes involving animal corpses, but all in all it's an average adventure/drama that's biggest strength is that it was very well shot.<br/><br/>The Revenant might deserve an Oscar for best cinematography. Make-up and visual effects are also outstanding. But apart from that it really doesn't live up to the hype.<br/><br/>6/10"

","First, let me dispense with the good. The scenery is stunning, vivid, real; truly awe inspiring. The scenery is committing a faux pau, by ""Chewing the scenery"" in this film. Revenant is Inspired by true events, true events that might have been exciting to children in 1890 perhaps. The true story is yawn inspiring. A 19th century fur collector is left for dead by his friends after being eviscerated by a bear, quite reasonably I might add, considering medical technology at the time. The erstwhile appetizer for a bear is outraged that they took his gun and kit, so he crawls back to the fort and confronts his former friends and gets his gun back. No one dies, until a decade later the Indians finish off where the bear left off. End of story. How exciting, says my 95 year old Grandfather, who considered watching paint peel entertainment in 1927. <br/><br/>Well.... Hollywood has to spice the story up and make it something more worthy of Leonardo and Tom. After all both men can and have done solid work, so certainly they need the plot to have a little more vim and verve to it. How do you do it? It's tough.... after all in real life the only homicidal actor in the whole event was the damn bear. So Hollywood gives Leonardo a son who tags along on his Dad's fur trapping adventure. Better yet Hollywood lets Tom Hardy eviscerate said son far more effectively than the bear could Leonardo and as a cherry on top, let's the helplessly wounded Leonardo watch his son die hard. There you have it. Leonardo now has the will to live, if only to treat Tom Hardy to the feast of wounds the bear subjected him to. Thus begins a two hour epic journey of revenge that leaves you wishing that the bear and Indians had just killed all the actors at the beginning of the film. The only truth in the whole movie is spewed by Hardy as he dies, when he grimly tells Leonardo that killing him won't bring his son back, nor alas our wasted three hours. <br/><br/>In the end I am glad they spiced up the historical events, because as I said from the start, said historical events were boring and needed some steroids. However, it's a one dimensional movie dominated by the scenery and the facial expressions Leonardo and Tom make throughout the film. We needed more bear...."

The scene with the Grizzly bear was incredible and I found myself wondering how on earth they did it (I have since found out how). No doubt about Leonardo's performance as he was superb but the film over all was dull and often defied reality. No one would have survived time in freezing waters and then coming back up on icy sub zero temperature land.<br/><br/>This film was based on a real person who did survive an attack by a Grizzly but the way he was attacked in this film, he would have been left with a broken spine and paralysed for sure. <br/><br/>I also found a lot of the violence unnecessarily graphic and there is no way that people in the 1800s used modern day profanity, but it seems that many film makers today want to re-write how history was for some bizarre reason.<br/><br/>So over all a disappointment."
"rickyscouture","4","6","10","5 March 2016"," It was...A movie.
","Since there are already reviews on here that have broken ""The Revenant"" down way better than I will, I'll just say this -- it's a movie. If you want to watch something for the experience of having watched it because everyone else is buzzing, you won't be disappointed. It'll give you the few choice scenes to keep you in conversations, but I don't think it has nearly enough substance to resonate with someone looking for something more. <br/><br/>Personally, I find this movie to be extremely overrated. Not in the sense that it's terrible, but in the sense that it's amazingly average. All the criticisms I've read from other people are fair in saying that the character development is flawed and that you don't engage enough emotionally to really care when something dramatic happens. Unless you're an avid movie buff who can survive on almost 3 hours of torture and brutality for an easily predictable ending, I certainly wouldn't recommend this film to you. <br/><br/>It lacks, in my opinion, a strong enough foundation to really make you concerned over any of the characters well-being...Including Glass (played by DiCaprio). You may be able to feel for the physical pain he's suffering throughout, but his emotional journey didn't resonate with me in the least. His deceased wife only exists in glimpses of his near-death flashbacks, and he and his son exchange maybe 10 lines of actual dialogue with each other. The rest of the film can be summed up with a lot of crawling, a lot of grunting, and a slow (but steady) progression from a should-be-dead man to a hobbled guy with nothing to lose and revenge on his mind. <br/><br/>And from the moment he's wronged, you know what Glass's story arc's going to be. There's very little deviation from what you think's going to happen and what actually happens...Save a few close calls and run-ins to break up the monotony of all that crawling and grunting, of course. All in all, I'd rate this film at a 4/10. I didn't love it...I wouldn't recommend it to many people...And I have no intention of watching it again. I think the Oscar really was an ""I Owe You"" to Leo more than it was an actual validation of the film itself. Or maybe this year's crop of movies just weren't all that great. Either way, watch with caution...It may not be as amazing as your friend seems to think it is."

During the last fight I got this sensation inside me, like i was the one being murdered but in a good way. I don't think that the animal cruelty, which bothers a lot of people, was overdone. It was a bit shocking which just further contributes to the realism. Every new shot was even better than the previous and those long ones were utter masterpiece. Nothing I'd change. Acting was very good, DiCaprio and Hardy just keep proving their class. <br/><br/>On the other hand, plot was one of the biggest disappointments I have ever witnessed. I begged my father, who watched the movie in a showing 5 hours before mine not to spoil it for me. But at the end, I don't think he could had even if he wanted to, We all knew movie would end up like that. There was almost no suspense, no cliff-hangers, no twist and no satisfying moments at all. It's simply one very long, dull and empty revenge-seeking journey. I was secretly hoping that Glass would die at the end just so I can feel even a bit surprised but, of course, it didn't happen. The only surprise I had was Hawk's death since in teaser trailer Glass said ""...to see my son"" so I assumed it'd be a revengeful search mission, which I honestly think would suit this movie better with Glass' knowledge of wilderness. <br/><br/>To sum it up, 10 for quality and 0 for plot resulted in a 5/10. Stunning and gorgeous but I'd rather fight that bear than re-watch this. I simply wish that it stood out by something more than just a pretty face."

The Revenant follows Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) as he battles the elements and native inhabiter's to avenge a loss committed by nemesis John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). The Revenant pushes the limits of cinematography and tells one of, if not the most gripping film of the year. <br/><br/>Emmanuel Lubezki created a lived in and natural world. I saw the beautifully shot scenic scenes and the first-person like tracking shots, but more importantly I could FEEL them. An edge will grip any viewer and with environmental shots alone i felt genuinely frightened of this unknown wilderness. The bright orange sparks from fires, the dark blue skies, and the black trees that laid on top of the bare white ground were real, they were unforgiving and beautiful. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives in my opinion, the best performance of his career. For the first time i wasn't watching DiCaprio, I wasn't watching a man with a malice heart, I was joining Hugh Glass on his vicious struggle for revenge. Tom Hardy has been a busy man but he seemingly cannot stop giving great performances with rather rare dialogue. Hardy becomes his best villain (thats saying something especially for Hardy). Hardy delivers a character we hate from the very beginning giving a untrustworthy, selfish, and genuinely dirty man life. Domhnall Gleeson (Andrew Henry) and Will Poulter (Bridger) both give great performances. Poulter breaks out of his typical comedic acting to give a surprising but magnificent performance, one of the best young actors today. <br/><br/>Although the film was inducing and beautiful its script at sometimes fell flat for me. Dialogue at times felt out of its time and a bit too staged but this problem is overlaid by terrific acting, cinematography, and camera direction. Birdman's mind-blowing continuing long-takes are very present in this film creating the most edgy and again realistic scenes I've seen in film. The Revenant has everything Inarritu did perfectly in Birdman and corrected mistakes made in previous films. This film is entrancing but artistic film lovers will fall in love with this film like they did with all of Inarritu's past work. The Revenant pushes every single aspect and limit in filmmaking while delivering a totally unique experience because of this, The Revenant is a excellent film."

","Very disappointed.The Oscar should have been Leo's after his performance in the Wolf of Wallstreet. They just tried to buy their mistake by giving an Oscar for a film where he has 3 lines to say and barely walks!! 2hrs 30 minutes of a man dying in excruciating pain but never really dying. seriously whats wrong with movie makers? OK fair enough some scenes were awesome, like the fight with the Indians in the beginning and the bear scene was amazing!! certainly NOT Oscar worthy! Waste of money and time...oh and very boring at times! Any normal or even the strongest of men would have been dead fairly quickly, but no Glass does not only survive the bear attack. He survives being buried alive, a huge fall, french soldiers, a fall in the river. Wait was I watching superman? cause trust me even superman would be dead!"

","Before I saw this film today, I knew that The Revenant was nominated for 12 Academy awards, so I had high expectations. Then yesterday I started reading several reviews and I got surprised of how many reviews were quite negative. They mentioned the same things like that: ""The movie is way too long for its own good. The movie is boring. The movie is too slow. The movie lacks story and depth. The main character is unrealistic and seems immortal. The movie contains too many repetitive shots of trees and nature. The movie turns almost a parody.""<br/><br/>So when I saw this film today, I had lowered my expectations, but was still really looking forward to seeing this film. To my big surprise, I actually didn't agree with anything of the things mentioned above. Surely it's not everyone's cup of tea because it's more of an art film than a blockbuster giant that's appealing to everyone. <br/><br/>To me The Revenant is: Beautiful - the most beautiful film I have ever seen on the big screen. The scenery's and lightning are absolutely incredible, and it feels so real like I'm right in there. I love the pace and the calmness throughout the film. The story is quite simple without weird twists and turns, BUT that's not needed because that's not how this story goes! I love the simplicity combined with the brutality, struggle and determination for survival and revenge, as well as love. I really felt for the main character.<br/><br/>I love Leonardo DiCaprio in this role. He is perfect and I love him in more mature roles like this. Everyone credit Tom Hardy and yes he is brilliant, as well as all the actors are actually. Everyone fit in so well in their characters. But I would like to give an extra credit to Leo who is definitely not outshined by Hardy. What an actor and what a performance by DiCaprio. I was really touched and impressed by his character as well as his performance. He deserves an Oscar that's for sure. <br/><br/>There is more to this film than just Leo crawling around grunting and the Revenant is definitely not close to a parody as some people say it is. I can't believe people saying these things. It's one of the best movies I have seen and it's been a long time since I've been so touched by a film. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's my cup of tea."

","Very long movie for a thin story! A lot of closeup violence without moving the story forward. Father motivated by revenge but why is the commander of the base so eager to put his life in danger for a ""scouts"" loss.<br/><br/>Closeup filming with wide angle lens to the point where it just becomes tiresome. I wonder how many times the actors bumped their heads into the camera lens.<br/><br/>High point of movie is Bear-Mauling Scene after this fast forward button is your friend!

"tvrdjava","4","9","17","20 January 2016"," it's just not that good
","Leo DiCaprio should've won an Oscar a long time ago. We all know that. He was great in pretty much everything he was in. You can exclude Titanic, but still he was great in it. We see movies that almost seem like they were made for an Oscar. Julianne Moore was the last example. Boring movie with exceptional performance. Here we have Leonardo DiCaprio, who should've have 3 Oscars to his name at least in this god awful boring movie! I was like Elaine from Seinfeld while she was watching The English Patient: die already, just dieeee!!! Movie is not awful like English Patient, but it's waaaaaay overrated. Boring, oh dear lord was it boring! It didn't touch me at all, I couldn't care less about the characters. <br/><br/>Leo will win it, he was good in it, but I liked him better in other movies simply because those movies were way better! Leo great, movie bad.<br/><br/>This director gave us awful, just awful pretentious piece of BS that was Bridman. Now he gave us this. Bore fest."
"sampetreanb","1","9","17","20 January 2016"," Time lost
","Really now, beside the landscape and the performance of Tom Hardy, everything else was boring. I do not understand why and how this movie was selected for so many Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>The story is more than predictable, Caprio acting is limited as his character has its limitation (I do not want to write spoilers), the rest of the team, beside Tom Hardy which in my opinion was great, are below average.<br/><br/>I consider this movie the best candidate for Rotten Tomatoes, not at all for the Oscar statue. Even if Caprio made some sacrifices in order to perform (temperatures, eating, etc.), I do not consider that the Oscar nominations should be awarded for such reasons.<br/><br/>This movie was equal to boring time for me."
"megasmartdani","7","9","17","13 January 2016"," Could be better, could be worse
","Looks like the Internet already found a winner for the upcoming Academy Awards when it comes to the category ""Best Actor"". Stories of how Leonardo actually slept in a carcass and ate bison liver in order to prepare for the role made its round. I think it is certainly most honorable to prepare that obsessively for a role, but that's not what constitutes a great actor - not alone at least, otherwise we could have given Bear Grylls some Emmys already, what actually does not seem like a bad idea either, but back to the Revenant. In the end DiCaprio's portrait of what Glass might have been like is quite intense and gritty, but to me it also seems over the top at times. I didn't really believe any of his relations with the Indians, the Character somewhat falls flat. And that's the next problem this movie is facing. It seems like Iñárritu wanted to mix his story of a man overcoming the odds in the face of death all too bad with a political statement of how bad the white people were and how good and noble the Indians were. To me the characters are all portrayed too black and white, with only little shades of grey in between. Every Indian is good, white men mostly bad. From what history taught us about these days, this holds up to the truth to a certain degree, but still it does not really fit into the story. The movie would have worked perfectly well without Glass having an Indian wife and a son. All this dream sequences and flashbacks about him moaning his dead relatives, were nearby ridiculous at times. Yet one has to remark, that the Indians had some badass moments, that helped to carry the film. As well as the cinematography did. Oh boy, it certainly looks like Lubezki is about to get his third Oscar in a row for this one. The way he captured the landscape and follows the battle scene, this really gets you into the movie. As the credits rolled I was glad, that I watched it in the cinema, mostly because of the stunning visuals, the story itself is a great vengeance story as well, driven by a great cast (cheers to Tom Hardy who seems to be in the prime of his life) but I somewhat feel like it could have been a masterpiece, if only Iñárritu wouldn't have gone too far making it really kitschig and too much of a cliché at times. Still, good movie, recommend watching it in the cinema."
"KineticSeoul","7","9","17","10 January 2016"," More for the experience over the plot
","This is a film that is more about the experience over the plot. So if you are looking for a film with a plot that really sticks out you might be disappointed. What this is, is a survival/revenge film with the core being driven by revenge but most of the screen-time is a man trying to survive in a cold wilderness. When it comes to the cinematography though, there is a lot of effort and risk that went with it. There is quite a bit of one long takes that is just mesmerizing sometimes to sit through. It's like watching art on screen unfold. The scenery when it comes to the wilderness, sparkling lake, the encompassing trees full of color, and even the quietness of certain scenes can really draw in the viewers. The lake, frozen over, disguised itself as a white valley, as if I would be able to walk on water. It was one of the best camera- work I have seen when capturing the frozen woods and mountainous areas. The hallucinations and dream like sequences adds to the artistic aspect of this film. It's like watching a captivating and engaging mainstream high budget artistic film on screen. At least when it comes to the cinematography although it lacks in the story section of it all. Leonardo DiCaprio seems to be doing everything he can to win that Oscar. And this movie is like the perfect set up for that. He gets the chance to show off just about every acting chops in his arsenal. Tom Hardy did a fine job of bringing about his character's accent while also playing a cold and yet believable character. His dialogue at least makes him understandable to a certain degree. Overall, this is not a plot driven film but it's more for the experience. I personally haven't seen anything like this before. It's not a film I would immediately go out of my way to watch again. But it's a highly worth at least one watch.<br/><br/>7.9/10"
"DoctorJackal","3","15","32","7 January 2016"," An Abysmal Waste of Time
","It pains me to see a director fall from grace. I completely loved Birdman and was highly anticipating this film. Unfortunately, Innaritu dropped the ball on this one. <br/><br/>First off, let me say that this isn't a COMPLETE disaster of a film. There is some spectacular cinematography through the duration of the movie, especially in the opening sequence which I wont give away. Also, as seen in the trailer, there's an encounter with a bear that's completely over-the-top intense and will bring you to the edge of your seat. The score is hauntingly brilliant and fits the bleak, desolate setting of the story really well. But the movie literally fails at everything else.<br/><br/>I've never been huge on Leonardo. I used to really admire him a few years ago, but since I started paying closer attention to cinema, I realize he's a competent actor without much else. This movie only solidifies my opinion. I don't care how many animal carcasses Leonardo sleeps in, or how many hearts he eats, or how many times he commits bodily harm; the guy isn't a great actor. <br/><br/>His performance in this movie is quite bad. He seldom speaks, but when he does he bears the look of a man who's trying beyond all belief to be convincing. He makes a very poor attempt at an accent and it's honestly far from an Oscar-worthy performance. I felt really sorry for Tom Hardy, the only actor who made a great presentation.<br/><br/>Not only was DiCaprio's acting bad, but his character was shockingly underwritten. On top of that, I didn't care about his motivation at all because his son had literally no characterization whatsoever. We're supposed to accept his paternal relationship without any creative twists or exhibitions. It's really shallow and disappointing. I can't remember the last time I saw so much wasted potential. Innaritu treats the audience like a bunch of idiots and slaps us over the head with predictable and schmaltzy characterization techniques. Fitzgerald, Hardy's character, was the only person in the story that had any depth or mystery. I found myself gravitating towards him more than anyone else. If the villain is the most relatable figure in a revenge movie, then the script is essentially broken. <br/><br/>Glass, as played by Leo, serves as little more than a punching bag for the movie's setting. It's a dull, overplayed, miserable affair that actually gets laughable towards the end. It's indisputable proof that too much of a good thing can turn bad real quick. By the time the final credits came on, I knew utterly nothing of Hugh Glass other than he can endure a lot of pain. Also, he loves his son, in case you never picked up on it when the director was constantly bludgeoning you over the head with verbal reminders. It's like an episode of the Dick Van Dyke Show set in the American frontier, only there's no heart, joy, or creativity.<br/><br/>Overall, you should save your money. Besides the magnificent score and the shots of the wilderness, this is a lifeless snooze. I have no problem with violence or suffering in film, but when it's all incurred by a poorly acted and boring man, it doesn't amount to anything. It's style over substance with little to offer the viewer. Having said that, I wouldn't be surprised if it won best picture. People seem to have forgotten the value of resounding stories and characters."
"i_ianchev","10","15","32","23 December 2015"," DiCaprio - the Revenant
","I must say that DiCaprio is continuously over the top<br/><br/>To explain the least – Mr. Glass, DiCaprio's character, is a strong source material. But to be able to deliver such a performance, you have to not only dedicate all your strength and stamina, but also have a huge talent – something which Leonardo has in abundance. Combining this with Inarritu's perfect directing skills and Lubezki's paranormal filming abilities – this one had to be the best of the year.<br/><br/>And indeed it is – the struggle between man and nature, the vengeance trip, the human relationships, the environmental message – we all see that in its entire run. I must admit that the rawness of the shots were a bit too much at some times for me, but this indeed made the movie true to the real life of these people at that time and at that place.<br/><br/>The music is by Ryuichi Sakamoto and I strongly recommend it to every open soul which desires to hear something new and vibrant. The costumes are profoundly adequate and the narrative is rich with pristine survival instincts.<br/><br/>But the main character in this film is the nature itself. No matter if we speak about the snow, the trees, the bear or the wind itself – this is what really shakes the viewer in his seat. I purposely didn't pay much attention to the dialogue, but rather enjoyed the ""conversations"" between Glass and his environment. His journey is delicately decorated with flashbacks and dreamlike visions which explain not only the personal story of the character, but also his urge to finish this journey and do what he has to do.<br/><br/>The movie is long enough for you to be able to immerse in the setting, so take your time and don't rush to deduct or explain it. There will be plenty of reasons to do that in the next years which I am sure will prove it to be a classic."
"trublu215","9","15","32","21 December 2015"," A brutal, harrowing, and visually stunning adventure film unlike anything that's been seen before
","The Revenant is Alejandro Iñàrritu's majestic revenge story set in the early 1800s that follows the larger than life true story of Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) as he travels across old America in hopes of exacting revenge against the men that left him gravely wounded and his son dead. The revenge story line is the oldest in the book and, no matter how overplayed, evokes the most emotion especially when the players are right. DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Will Poulter make for some pretty excellent players in Iñàrritu's more visual film and this allows audience members to connect with the film on a more accessible level rather than the cinephiles that this film was made for. Emanuel Lebezki has, yet again, outdone himself. The beauty in each frame is undeniable. The landscapes, the snow, the blood, the violence. No matter how harrowing a situation is, the film is still one of the most beautiful ever made and this is a testament to Lebezki and Iñàrritu. The patience they endured on set speaks volumes to the film that they made. The Revenant isn't fast paced, it isn't action packed, it is a story told through the eyes of a visionary and that may off put some people who are looking for a film like The Hunted or The Grey or any other man against wilderness film. The film is slow and takes it's time in giving the audience something they can sink their teeth into. Instead, they allow the audience to be submersed in this cold and desolate landscape, all while capturing the beauty of the American landscape. The battle scenes are epic. Mostly done through extended long takes, the film is a cinephile's dream. The camera movements, the tracking shots and that glorious bear attack are all beautifully done and shown in the most harrowing way possible. For a film to open with an over 10 minute long take of a battle nonetheless, it is truly captivating and awe inspiring to see filmmakers push themselves to their limits both physically and creatively. But as much as the filmmakers pushed themselves, so did the cast. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a brilliant performance as Hugh Glass. In films before, we've seen DiCaprio fake pain. In this film, you actually feel his pain. With every bite from a bear, every broken bone being reset, every wound being crudely stitched, his performance reeks of perfection and that is exactly what we get from him here. Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald is a typical bad guy here, nothing more nothing less. He's good, he's not on the level of DiCaprio here though. The rest of the cast is amazing, as always with any Iñàrritu film. Overall, The Revenant is a brilliant film that isn't quite a masterpiece but has enough technical achievements within it to set it apart from any other film this year. I definitely recommend it."

And then his horse runs off a cliff and he falls into a tree and survives? At that point I actually LAUGHED OUT LOUD because the plot had become so ridiculous.<br/><br/>I've been reading about this being DiCaprio's Oscar attempt, but I can't imagine that this will get him anything. And if it does, it will be appalling that of all the movies this year, that this piece of masturbatory garbage gets any attention at all except for utter derision. <br/><br/>The plot was completely unbelievable.

"teddiechung","5","13","27","30 December 2015"," Revenge too little too late
","This movie reminds me why ""Cape Fear"", ""Gladiator"", and ""Cast Away"" are great and this one not. The first half hour is crowded with fight scenes and bear attacks which are so brutal that making the remaining 2 hours quite boring. <br/><br/>Look at Cape Fear and see how Robert De Niro revenges his anger on Nick Nolte (the lawyer betrays him). Look at Gladiator and see how the images of the dead wife of Russell Crowe come and go with his fate. Tom Hanks in Cast Away also shows how one man survives in extreme conditions. <br/><br/>The Revenant tries to put these elements into one but fail to be resonant. You either go deeper in Leonardo's history and his dead wife memories and reveal his past, or spend more time and climax on Leonardo's revenge to his fellows. The final duel between Leonardo and Tom Hardy is not fulfilling given the bloody opening. <br/><br/>Leonardo and Tom Hardy are great actors, still cannot save the movie. The survival part is simply too long, and the revenge part is too little and too late. My stars are for the actors only."

The bear attack, isn't only a brutal five minutes, only usurped by Bone Tomahawks death scene for most brutal scenes of the year, it's almost flawless with its use of effects, and the fact that it looks like its a one shot take, just adds to the awe.<br/><br/>Secondly, Glass laying helpless, knowing that he will eventually blink, and then seeing Fitzgerald commit the most abhorrent act, Dicaprios acting here is flawless, and if he does win an award for this role, it will be for this scene alone. Never before have I seen anger, despair, guilt, hatred, and helplessness, perfectly acted without the actor uttering one syllable.<br/><br/>Hardy too is excellent, but it wished he would have left his Bane Accent at home, it rally did take me away from key scenes.<br/><br/>It's an unflinching movie, long shots really putting you in the middle of the film, and if this doesn't win every award going for cinematography, there is something wrong with the world.<br/><br/>An achievement, and then some."

","Please don't pay to watch this film, unless you like wasting your time as well as your money. <br/><br/>However it starts with much promise, the opening scene was incredible, it has to be one of the most immersive spectacular opening scenes I've watched since The Dark Knight. And the visual assault continues as they evade their attackers. We are plunged into more spectacular scenery as a small group of men try to escape the Indian attackers in a vast snowy wilderness where only Leo knows his way around the mountainous land. <br/><br/>Once they progress through the wild, Leo gets attacked by a grizzly bear. This is one of the most important scenes in the film where Leo is left in a critical condition and what a fantastic scene it is. So realistic and intimate you can practically feel the power of the bear from your seat. <br/><br/>Once Leo is left for dead by Hardy, the film ends for me. Be prepared for another couple hours of just snow, crawling and Leo surviving almost certain death experiences. And to be honest, you'll be wishing he had died so you could have left earlier. As for the dialogue, well of what little dialogue there is, it mostly goes to Hardy who obviously decided he's incapable of doing a Texan accent so decides to mumble his way through his lines. <br/><br/>Overall the film is character-less. The whole story is based around Leo's quest to avenge his sons killer. Iñárritu is unsuccessful in making us empathize with Leo. In my opinion, this is ultimately why the film failed. It could have been an incredible film but Iñárritu failed drastically in everything but the fantastic scenery. <br/><br/>Leo will inevitably get his Oscar and for what, a performance which solely contained him just crawling around surviving, Madness."

Leo Dicaprio to win an Oscar? I hope not. The acting was below average and he was barely the actor in a leading role.

","""The Reventant"" offers mediocre, straightforward and predictable plot. The good guy, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), is a 19th century superhero who survives grizzly bear attack and revenges for the death of his son by punishing Fitzgerald, the greedy bad guy, played by Tom Hardy. As expected, there is a fierce struggle between the good and the bad guy at the end of the movie. <br/><br/>""The Reventant"" is not for everyone. There are a lot of brutal scenes with violence and blood. It is a strange mix between the blood, the camera shots and angles from Tarantino's movies such as ""Kill Bill"" with the classical action movies about revenge, like the popular old title with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mel Gibson, or Liam Neeson.<br/><br/>The actors do a fine job in obviously difficult conditions. Unfortunately, the characters are not unique and the dialogs are not memorable at all. I do not remember even a single quote from ""The Reventant"" that stands out. There is no doubt that Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy are brilliant and deserve praises despite the poor scenario. In my opinion Will Poulter was fortunate to play the most interesting character in the whole movie and he also did a good job."

The first few minutes of movie tells how the narration would be. Some say it is a novel way of screenplay but I feel it is the worst movie I saw in recent times. Although the movie had some great cinematography at various scenes, apart from what was shown in the trailer it doesn't have much to offer. Hope Leonardo won't win Oscar for this and come up with far better movie with his acting brilliance."

","This Revenant was purported to be a grueling shoot for all involved- particularly DiCaprio. I didn't realise it would be similarly tough going for viewers. Much like Glass's vocal abilities post-bear mauling, The Revenant is slow, strained and unpleasant.<br/><br/>Glass undergoes every wilderness adversity known to man- plus a few we didn't know. Some of his 'survival' choices are baffling- like choosing to gag down raw bison liver when there was a perfectly serviceable fire four feet behind him. <br/><br/>Everything is hard about this film- including the characters. The effect of this is zero engagement with, or empathy for characters. Without a genuine investment and attachment to characters, The Revanent is simply an R-rated 'Man Vs Wild'. We voyeuristically watch DiCaprio grunt and gnaw his way through storms, animal savaging, human savaging and sub-zero temps that make the Antarctic look like a tropical getaway. To survive these ordeals, he employs techniques straight out of the Han Solo play-book, at one point climbing into a horse carcass for warmth. <br/><br/>I wanted desperately to connect with the story, to cheer on Hugh Glass during his horrid plight; but, at best, I could only admire this film on an aesthetic level. The cinematography is so awing that one can never quite adjust or forget to admire it. It's like a gorgeous wildlife documentary, only with human characters who lack the likability of the usual animals roaming such films. <br/><br/>DiCaprio gives a fine performance, although arguably Hardy's feral Fitzgerald- while not as visceral, is more interesting and charismatic to watch. Again, the lack of likability is a flaw in this film. There's been endless hue and cry about Leo long being denied his Oscar. The Revenant may well be his Oscar snagging performance. He renders Glass's pain and suffering perfectly, but Glass is not a character we care about. He's more like a specimen in a jar being tormented with sunlight directed through a microscope by a 7 year old bully. Glass lacks the 'heart' and appeal typically expected of Oscar winning performances. He is a character as frosty as the icy landscape. That's more of a fault of the storyline than Di Caprio. <br/><br/>I can't help but feel anyone who gets any level of enjoyment from this film (gorgeous cinematography aside) and its violent content is a psychopath, or at the very least, has an underdeveloped frontal lobe. Halfway through the film I became restless for it to end. The stunning vistas kept me there- but like Glass, I was relieved to be outta there!<br/><br/>I love you, Leo, but I preferred you in The Departed- or even Gilbert Grape to this. Cinematography, breathtaking: 10/10. The story and level of engagement with characters: 4/10."

","Shocking, harrowing and gory... yet excellent. This particular film is a one of a kind, and if you can get past its inherit gruesomeness then you shouldn't have any issues enjoying it.<br/><br/>The story line is in my opinion it's strongest feature, I deliberately didn't read the plot before watching it as I wanted to see how it unfolds independently. I had a rough idea of the setting but that was about it. I love this historical period and will always give such films a chance. From the very beginning the story is persistently gripping, you never truly know what we'll face next which leads to constant anticipation. Not to mention the actors involved all do a fantastic job. DiCaprio is undoubtedly a talented and well decorated actor and he continues to display that here. Is this is finest role? Well, that'd debatable but irrelevant considering the film's quality. It is true that Tom Hardy is hard to understand in it, yet for me that just shows he's doing a good job, so many actors down the years have failed miserably in their horrific attempts at different accents, Hardy doesn't in this instance.<br/><br/>If none of that grabs you then the visuals should. It's set in such a beautiful part of the world, overall adding to the already gripping plot. A good old bear scene can't be beaten either! I understand that some people find excessive gore difficult to watch, and if that's you then probably best to avoid this film. For me, I find excessive gore needless and irritating but it doesn't bother me in this context, after all there's plenty more happening with the story as a whole for that to taint my overall opinion. Also, so many people complain about subtitles in English speaking films... I don't recognise that as a valid criticism unless it's completely needless and counter to the logic of the setting. This film uses a lot of subtitled dialogue but for me that just adds to the contemporary setting. Give it a watch, but be prepared.<br/><br/>P.S. I like bears."

","............................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL <br/><br/>*** This review may contain MINOR spoilers ***<br/><br/>This Review is dedicated to my student and dear friend, Luisa Bacca, who has played a key role in focusing International Attention on the rights of Indigenous peoples in Colombia, especially here in Nariño, as a mediator in the ongoing Peace Process between the U.N. High Commission on Human Rights and the Colombian Government! <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio, upon his acceptance of his Golden Globe, used the occasion to express his concern for indigenous peoples and their portrayal in movies. At the time, this seemed a bit difficult to put into context, but now that I have seen the film, it is crystal! And I think there are basically 2 ways to react to REVENANTA straight up, grizzly (No Pun Intended!) true-story Man vs. Nature Action/Adventure, take it exactly as it is reaction, or, an infinitely nuanced ""This Movie is a Metaphor"" approach Need it be said that I am most certainly an Option B person!?!?<br/><br/>That having been said, REVENANT is such an astoundingly overwhelming experience, it is a tad difficult to decide on a starting point! Director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu shows himself to be the perfectionist he is via the numbing, jaw-dropping beauty of the filming locations that provide the numerous impressive visual backdrops seen throughout. The list of locations includes Tierra del Fuego, Mexico, and various U.S. and Canadian ones! As to the veracity of the ""True Story"" aspect of this harrowing tale, who knows? Wikipedia mentions that Frontiersman Hugh Glass' (Definite Oscar-worthy performance by Leonardo DiCaprio) life and accomplishments were often prone to embellishments, and Punke's 2002 Novel apparently plays fast and loose with the truth. Aside from just what IS true and what isn't, Gonzalez Iñárritu has permeated every frame with a level of reality that is truly chilling, both literally and figuratively! <br/><br/>The U.S. was a relatively young country in the 1820's; A vast, mostly untamed and rapidly expanding nation that had doubled its territory just 20 years earlier through the Louisiana Purchase. REVENANT unfolds clearly accentuating the uncertainties of life in the Missouri Territory, where the only existing technological implement in your daily existence was your firearmOh, and probably, in Captain Henry's case, a pocket watch, one would imagine! Their fur gathering/trading expedition comes under surprise attack (Was there any other kind back then?) by considerable numbers of Arikara Indians, who consider their actions as justified, since, in their opinion, it is the trading expedition that is trespassing on Arikara territory.<br/><br/>After both suffering and inflicting heavy losses, the expedition's survivors manage to raft away to safety. After cautiously biding their time on the river, they finally return to terra firma. Soon after, Hall has his ill- fated encounter with a grizzly bear, who, instinctively, simply was protecting her cubs. This scene is, quite honestly, spoiler- proof! No written words could ""ruin"" it for you! It is a bone-chilling vision that you really must experience for yourself! Most certainly, you will be scratching your head, as I and most others were, wondering ""Just how in the hell did they do that?"" Apparently, A Man In the Wilderness (1971) was also inspired by Hugh Glass and his ordealBut I never saw it! There is a 1972 film, which came to mind a few times while viewing REVENANTJeremiah Johnson, A Sydney Pollack Classic with Robert Redford in the title role!<br/><br/>Some of you might be wondering, about now, if there will be any reference to elements mentioned in this review's title. Not to worry! My Review title should be ""crystal"", too, if you take the dualistic viewing approach mentioned early on here. To avoid crossing the Spoiler threshold, let it suffice to say that taking REVERANT in its entirety, it seems to speak to putting our treatment of indigenous peoples in the U.S. into some kind of more rational perspective. Personally, I found the ending to be rather spiritual and upliftingMaybe it's just me!<br/><br/>10*.......ENJOY/DISFURTELA!<br/><br/>Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Espanol, are most welcome!"
"davideo-2","4","3","4","19 October 2016"," Ultimately a massive case of style over substance
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In the late part of the 19th century, explorer Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio-no laughing at that name!) is on an expedition for the fur trade in the wilderness when he is savagely attacked by a bear. Whilst the other members of his expedition team are stoic and try to rescue him, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) decides they should cut their losses and kill him, which he attempts to do when no one is looking, as well as killing his adopted Native American son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck.) After surviving his ordeal, Glass is thrust on a desperate quest for survival-with revenge on his mind.<br/><br/>Director Alejandro G. Inarritu is certainly a hot property at the moment, most notably for 2014's Birdman (Or, the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance.) As befits someone making a name for themselves, he appears to be someone prepared to break away from convention, taking a relatively simple premise and applying a post modern, surrealist touch to it. But whereas Birdman went engagingly off kilter with its material, this appears to be an exercise in self exploration and reflection...without very much at the surface.<br/><br/>In the lead role, and to a large extent the only role, in the film, DiCaprio must carry a sense of isolation and foreboding, in a stranded role similar to that of Sandra Bullock in Gravity or, much further back, Tom Hanks in Cast Away. The problem here is, rather than exploring his individual angst and inner turmoil as he finds the resilience to cope with his ordeal, there's just too much grunting and crawling around, and when you can't relate to one guy for the long time you're with him, there's problems.<br/><br/>For those with a keen interest in visual landscapes, Inarritu has undoubtedly captured some truly beautiful, majestic cinematography that will sweep your eyes onto the screen, even if the story and pacing don't. He's matched this with a dark, moody soundtrack that is as haunting as the screen. The trouble is, the story just seems to be non existent and for a film weighing in at roughly two and a half hours, that's a big problem.<br/><br/>It's all a big case of style over substance, a big, ultimately pretentious piece that badly misfires. **"
"Maskharat","6","12","25","21 December 2015"," Is this Leo's Oscar home-run?
","With the Revenant you will join a group of world class actors and the rising stars on a cold, wet and bloody journey through natural lighted mountains, forest and swamps.<br/><br/>(small 1st plot point spoilers possible)<br/><br/>It's a simple story of a 'Dances of the Wolves' like man who lived among the ""savages"" and is showing the arrogant whites a save passage through enemy territory. It's a story of a man who's lost everything but his son, which he had with a beautiful Indian woman. A clearly ambitious Patrokles-like son, who is forced to keep his mouth shut in order to survive the hate of the whites. When the man loses his son, the problems begins - plot-wise. Since he's lost his only emotional connection, we don't get very much to know his character in later scenes anymore. And a death of a loved one might shock us for a moment, but as the character and as with every film and it's duration, we carry on. What can you offer me next?<br/><br/>Unfortunately even the beautifully conceived wide angle mood shots can't pick up the slack. All acquaintances are short. It clearly overkills the dark, noirish conception of the character. Now I have no clue about the original source of material but a reinterpretation of it would have been good - something like a companion, or even an animal. Think of Dances with the Wolves and how the death of the wolve grabbed our emotional attention, after we've learned how the friendship was build. Another appropriate example might be Nicholas Wending Refn's Valhalla Rising. There again we have a buddy-movie like plot device - the boy, with whom the nameless fighter can connect and defend, which makes him at least more of a three dimensional, human killing machine. The revenant is plot driven, which is such a missed opportunity, because we actually are interested and care for the main character, but are left unsatisfied, and I mean not in a cliffhanger way of unsatisfied. <br/><br/>Mr. Iñárritu co-wrote the script with Mark L. Smith. Now I'm sure that there is a clear set of symbolism which might illustrate certain inner thoughts etc., but this should'nt have been conceived as an art housian film. It should have been written with clear cinematic language, with iconic symbols, with more emotion, rather than too much of the ultra realistic gore. Yes, animals died for this movie and it's absolutely justified in order to depict the survival in nature. Take it or leave it, but your chicken did not die of stroking. I picture a lot of fun and work in the production design process, but as so often today, the script wasn't ready yet and no one cared, because great actors signed in already. The script heavily relied on Hemingway's iceberg principle. Show the tip of the iceberg, the rest is imagination. Well, in this case the polished mood pictures just weren't sufficient for me. Seeing all the twitter reviews about the bad pacing only proofs my point. As film lovers we all know that film is never about the real-time, it's about emotional-time. Scarface is a near 3 hour epic but for us it feels like a short drug intoxication. Why? Because we don't feel the grass growing, but rather a light-speed trip to mars. <br/><br/>To close with a Oscar prediction: Sorry Leo, it ain't work this time. You gave a marvellous performance. You swallowed so much dirt, only Christian Bale can beat you with that. But your character lacked the emotional dept an audience needs that in order to be behind you. No Sir, it was not your preparation, not your dramatic art. Through the setting you were forced to suffer, but any actor in this role would have, so what was there to stand out? Unfortunately the soucre material did not allow you to go in for more."

","After all the praises about this film, I took time to watch all of it. It was basically a film about how beautiful winter scenes and weather can be. Other than the nature scenes, I found this boring, distracting, stupid to the point idiotic in certain circumstances, also where Hardy can hardly be understood and his character is ridiculous, and the fact that Leo's character did not die of hypothermia. You have to watch the movie to see what I am talking about The jest of this movie is the story of a man's survival in the wilderness. I will say that the bear scenes were astounding graphic and very realistic to the point that it was amazing that he even survived the attack. If you want to watch it, be my guest but I will not watch it again. And I would recommend to my friends not to waste their time on this movie. The film I would recommend watching is "" Man in the Wilderness"" 1971, staring Richard Harris and John Huston, who was also the director This film is so much better"

","I just finished reading a series of commentaries by people giving this movie a single star. Take your hatred elsewhere. If you didn't like the film, fine, but because it got hype, it's not your job to lower its rating; it's your obligation to say something intelligent about the filmmaking. This is one of the most visually striking features I've ever seen. The camera angles and the framing of the scenes is spectacular. During the first scene ambush, we get to see what it must be like to suddenly be in the middle of a maelstrom. Arrows are frequently seen as sterile in most films. Here, we get a taste of them being a kid of artillery. LIke ""Deliverence,"" which is another unsettling film, these guys are just in the wrong place. Whether those furs were worth a lot or not, all their work wasn't worth it. Yet, from what we hear, they are people who are the dregs of society and need something to keep them going. Yes, when DeCaprio shows up, we began to see men who, despite their oaths, will look after their own butts. Honor only goes so far in this universe. The story of Hugh Glass is part of history. I, like many others, question the extent to which this guy is pushed to the limits (a lot of Hollywood gimmickry). It takes some real skill to deal with real historical figures. I doubt that a third of this happened. I do know that Hugh Glass was mauled by a bear and that he literally crawled across three states to get revenge. Had he been totally fictional, we would be much more forgiving. In this case, less would have been more, with some compactness and restraint. I will leave it to the experts to get at the technical stuff. This is a highly entertaining film. Anyone that gives it one star is just being spiteful. I suppose they don't like DeCaprio. One even criticized the fact that it took place in the early 1800's."
"partho-sarathi-c","3","10","20","2 March 2016"," No tale to tell... just some gimmicks
","I walked in the theater to watch The Revenant with a lot of anticipation, expecting a thrilling, hi octane show. I walked out exhausted, utterly disappointed and a lot more cynical about the Academy Awards. To begin with, the bear scene was probably one of the most horrifying scenes I have watched on the big screen in a long time. Yes, it does leave an impact and you are shaken. But probably, that was the only thing worth watching in the film. Of course the landscapes were breathtaking, the long shots awe- inspiring, the contradictory depiction of nature at its most beautiful and yet harshest was impeccable. But this was not a National Geographic documentary we had gone to see. We went to see a great tale being told masterfully. Unfortunately, there was no tale to be told. The linear, predictable, revenge story was probably the lamest I have seen in movies in a long time. The seventies' angry young man revenge stories in Bollywood had more meat, metaphorically speaking. Of course, The Revenant had more physical meat of all kinds on display. Horse meat, bison meat, pig meat, fish meat, human meat – you name it, and it was there. And all this graphic display of gore and flesh and violence, all seemed to be just a big fat gimmick than anything else. When you do not have a story to tell, you need to resort to gimmicks to keep the audience occupied. The dialogues were unnecessary. If you watched this in mute, I do not think it would have made much of a difference to your experience. This film has a motley group of characters, all flat through and through. There is no evolution of characters, there is not back stories for us to relate to, there is no point of emotional connect where we start empathizing with them. The apologetically shown snippets of Glass's back story left us wanting more. We would have loved to feel a bit more of his tragedy than just some floating (literally!) fragments of his imagination and dreams. Fitzgerald had better range – when facing imminent death, he tries to have a conversation on moralities with Glass after all his immoral acts – but still not worthy of an Oscar nomination. The rest were all perfunctory. This was technically a period film, but being set in the wild, hardly had any scope of interesting detailing as period films would usually have. The whole premise also feels very fantastical. The catastrophes that befell Glass every other scene seem too contrived. And that he actually survives all that in such inhospitable conditions seems highly improbable. Yes, if it was a movie about miracles, and not the sheer mental strength and vengefulness of the principal protagonist, it would have made more sense. I fail to see, besides a snapshot of a grand vision, what was so great directorially, for Iñárritu to fetch an Oscar for direction. Coming to Leonardo's much awaited acting Oscar, yes, I love him and believe he deserved one for sure. But not for this movie. He has given more nuanced performances earlier in movies such as The Aviator, The Wolf of Wall Street, Shutter Island, The Departed, to name a few. In The Revenant, he really did not have much scope to demonstrate his superlative acting skills given the circumstances his Glass was in. With a lot of well-crafted prosthetics, a face full of hair, a strange language to speak in, all he had to do was crawl and grunt and whisper. Where really did he get an opportunity to ""act""? Go watch it, if you really do not have anything better to do."

","~~~ could be a spoiler, not sure ~~~~~~~<br/><br/>Could have seriously spent 2.5 hrs of my life elsewhere... The movie was one of the slowest movies that I have seen with a lot of redundant parts excruciatingly inserted in it. I found it painfully exhausting and after 2 hours couldn't resist opening my eyes. <br/><br/>This movie is part of a genre which urges all viewers to view it from a certain defined perspective without having itself carefully constructed that perspective prior to the commencement of the actual plot. The director and actors assume that irrespective of whatever your taste you'll somehow comprehend their narrowly defined perspective, and view the movie a certain way. With the intent to appeal to a particular cult of movie-goers, the movie team does not do justice while elucidating or construing their desired perspective to appeal to ALL audience types. As such, for a normal viewer, the movie might appear increasingly bland and exhausting unless he/she adheres to that extraordinary perspective envisaged by the proponents if this movie. For a viewer like me, excluding certain parts and themes, I wouldn't be able to differentiate between this movie and a documentary ""Richard Attenborough's- life of a Northern explorer"". <br/><br/>While the acting was good, I would not describe it as being out of this world. I admired Leonardo's perseverance but it was not in anyway unprecedented and did not enthrall me. Tom Hardy's accent is very hard to understand, especially if you are not American, and sounds almost nonsensical and superfluous in many parts of the movie.<br/><br/>The only elements I truly appreciated were the themes associated with atrocities towards native Americans and the well captured natural sceneries.

"jlarkin4","10","17","39","1 January 2016"," A gritty, brutal, jarring look into the journey of the folklore legend Hugh Glass.
","I had been excited for this film since the first trailer came out, and let me say that it did not disappoint. I was a little worried from a few slightly negative reviews on YouTube. Many of these reviews complained that the film was slow. They're not wrong, but I thought it was slow in a good way. Anyway let me break it down.<br/><br/>The story was very well done. It starts off running with quite a lot of action and conflict at hand. The movie somehow makes you feel like you're with this group in the middle of the wilderness in the early 1800s.<br/><br/>Then there's the bear attack. It was one of the most intense, jarring, even disturbing scenes I've scene in cinema. I have no idea how the hell they did it, but it was excellently executed.<br/><br/>Moving into the second act, the film does slow down a bit. This is a complaint most people have, however I feel otherwise. Many westerns such as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly have a similar slow pace. It's ultimately a good thing though as it draws out the tension more and raises the personal stakes for the protagonist.<br/><br/>Some people also complain about the spiritual visions that Glass has. I didn't mind them at all. It was a good way to forge a greater connection with the protagonist as we see the emotional trauma he's enduring. There are still some visions I didn't quite understand, so I plan on re-watching to analyze these.<br/><br/>Having been shot in natural light, it is perhaps one of the most beautiful looking films I've ever seen. Coupling this with really clean and heavy sound design and some pretty brutal parts made the movie feel real.The movie paints a very realistic portrait of the raw violence that occurred in this time period. By the end of it, you'll be thankful you never lived in the 1820s.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, if you're looking for an action-packed, fast paced adventure movie, you may be disappointed. This is more of a personal survival/revenge story.<br/><br/>And yes, Leo should win an Oscar for this one. There were a few times when his screams were so jarring and meaningful that I almost teared up.<br/><br/>Watch this movie."
"namashi_1","9","17","39","25 December 2015"," Iñárritu Triumphs Again!
","After giving us a Masterpiece & Winning The Academy-Award for Best Director, Picture & Screenplay in Birdman, Alejandro G. Iñárritu returns on celluloid with 'The Revenant'. And the master storyteller triumphs again! <br/><br/>Let me inform you: 'The Revenant' is NOT Meant For The Faint-Hearted. This is a brutal, unforgiving, hardcore film about survival & revenge. This a story filled & driven by blood & bruises. But if you are thick-skinned, don't dare to miss this one. This is filmmaking at its most creative & most relentless. <br/><br/>'The Revenant' Synopsis: In the 1820s, a frontiersman named Hugh Glass sets out on a path of vengeance against those who left him for dead after a bear mauling.<br/><br/>Inspired by the life of frontiersman Hugh Glass, 'The Revenant' is ideally a vendetta fare, that's been shot so gorgeously, you forget you're watching a story thats been depicted on celluloid an endless number of times. Iñárritu creates a World of violence in the wild, where people are butchered, the animals are ferocious than ever. Watching the protagonist struggle after a brutal bear mauling (Which by the way is a Frightening Sequence), is often difficult to watch, as he struggles & how. But at the end, Justice is served & the dramatic climax leaves a superb impact.<br/><br/>Mark L. Smith & Iñárritu's Screenplay is unforgiving. Its a survival tale with vendetta as its wallpaper. The wilderness & the violence have no end here & the narrative remains strong, despite its predictable storyline. Iñárritu's Direction is Masterful. He has handled the film with breath-taking ambition. Emmanuel Lubezki's Cinematography makes 'The Revenant' a visual marvel. The Two-Time Back-to-Back Oscar-Winner has captured every frame, with such beauty, you almost feel you're in the story. A Third Oscar? Well, why not!<br/><br/>Stephen Mirrione's Editing is sharp, although the film tends to drag a bit & is a bit too long (157-minutes). Some trimming would've only enhanced the impact more. Ryuichi Sakamoto, Alva Noto & Bryce Dessner's Score is brilliant. Art & Costume Design are flawless. Action- Sequences are raw & brutal. CGI is perfectly done.<br/><br/>Now to the Performances! 'The Revenant' features Two of the Finest Actors of their generation coming together: Leonardo DiCaprio & Tom Hardy. And they more than rise up to the occasion. Leo is phenomenal as the struggling protagonist, who must avenge the death of his son & bear any numbers of consequences that come his way. Its a committed performance, that has great layers. Hardy is despicable as the chief villain, delivering a marvelously evil performance, that haunts you. Of the supporting cast, Domhnall Gleeson stands out with an impressive act.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'The Revenant' is Visually Dazzling, Fabulously Acted & Impeccably Made. A Must Watch!"

","After reading the plot it seems to be an adaptation of the movie, ""Man in the Wilderness"" starring Richard Harris, who while moving overland with a boat in tow is attacked by a bear. Upon hearing the attack the boat crew kills the bear. However, the scout, Zacary Bass, played by Harris, is severely mauled,and near death. The Captain leaves two crew members to bury him when he dies. Because he is slow in dying the two crew members become impatient and decide to kill and bury him but neither has the courage to do so. They agree that he is near death and will not survive the day so they place him in a shallow grave and bury him alive. Bass escapes from the grave and he struggles for survival among the various Indian tribes and eventually is well enough to track the Captain and crew to seek revenge for the way he was treated. It is rare that an adaptation receives the reviews this movie is generating. Is it because there is a whole new generation of movie goer who are not aware that this film is an apparent copy of a good entertaining film that also had a great star? Because of its lack of originality I did not deem the movie beyond a 3 star. Leonardo DiCaprio, I am sure is superb in the movie and it will be entertaining but I won't waste my time or money to see it in the theater but rather wait for it to appear on DVD or TV. I am sure other ""critics"" will have a differing view but it is what it is."

","This movie showed amazing cinematography amid majestic settings from the opening scenes and throughout the movie. With direction of the photographer following individual characters in the line of battle, the audience is on the edge of its seat figuring out what is going on from the start, as Journeyman, Explorer, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) leads a troop of Fur traders cross country along the Northwest (North Dakota, actual location). <br/><br/>This true survival story from the early 1800's made me describe the movie roughly, as a cross between Jerehmiah Johnson (Robert Redford), The Patriot (Mel Gibson) and Deliverance(Burt Reynolds). With those titles, if any of them tripped your trigger, then you will very much LIKE the Revenant!<br/><br/>There are good lessons of character in this movie for which are brought out in the way the badly injured Glass is treated by his troop after being viciously mauled by a huge bear. However, it is the vision and voice of his deceased wife and son that keeps Glass going in hard to believe scenarios. <br/><br/>One of the best movies that I've seen in a long while for this genre.<br/><br/>Expect Best Movie, Director, Cinematography and Best Actor nominations by the Academy."

","I had high hopes for this film given fuss about it and Leonardo's turn. I was not impressed by either especially the film. The film is BORING and if one enjoys seeing Leonardo grunting and crawling from one scene to another than that is another matter. There was almost zero development of the characters and much style and good cinematography to hide this. Style and cinematography which we have seen before - think True Grit, some Tarantino films The director tried to elevate it to something spiritual at some point by superimposing some Indian chants, wisdom over a flickering night sky and some goings on. It was so derivative and predictable especially if one had seen the film Gladiator, a much superior film which was truly about the journey of a tortured soul physically, mentally and spiritually that managed to be engaging on all fronts. This film tries hard to be that but fails. The Revenant tried to be 'factual' and real (laughable) and showing the horrors of hunt or be hunted by being in the midst of action without being engaging. In doing this it impinges one of the worst horrors on the viewer - Boredom."

","First of all, I very much like survival movies in the wild. I also am interested in the history of the era and location. The trappers, the Métis, the different Indian nations and bands, the voyageurs, the men, the (indigenous) women,... And the film starts promising with great photography and a fitting score. Everything seems set for a breathtaking movie. Alas, it soon turns out that the characters are totally underdeveloped. Especially the main character and his son. We know little about them except for the tragedy that befell their wife / mother. It leaves us in the cold with not even a carcass to hide in. The revenant is a caricature of groaning and limping. Not such good acting at all. Then Leonardo deserved it far more in other films such as ""J. Edgar"". The opening battle scene is spectacular, but largely unrealistic. The motivation for the attack is also ambiguous and far-fetched. A historical travesty. The daughter of the Arikara chief was supposedly kidnapped by a group of voyageurs, apparently as it turns out later for the sake of lust and sadism. Why would the voyageurs deliberately make enemies in such a way while there was much more to be gained by a Marriage 'à la façon du pays' with an Indian woman of importance? This was far more the custom with them than with – what the director would call – ""the Anglos"". The relations between the French-speaking voyageurs and the natives was in general a lot better than between the Americans and the natives. The voyageurs needed local allies and suppliers of food far more than the Americans with their forts. In fact one of the reasons for the Arikara war was that the Americans undermined the position of the Arikara of middlemen in the fur trade. But Hollywood has to give it a spin and introduce and outside source of absolute evil. All of the other protagonists have rational motivations – even John Fitzgerald and mother bear. Then the film becomes simply ridiculous when – after being badly mauled by the bear and having had to recover for a lengthy period – the hero stumbles upon the kidnapped girl and frees her from the camp of voyageurs (who else?) while the Arikara supposedly attacked the Americans to steal the pelts to trade them for horses from voyageurs in order to be able to catch up with the kidnappers, who must have left easy tracks in the snow and barren winter landscape. Go figure! Finally when the revenant has recovered from his terrible wounds and infections he goes after John Fitzgerald for a two-way slaughter party of gaping wounds. I guess there was not enough blood yet for an Oscar-worthy movie?"

","Probably the most pointless, if not stupidest, movie I have wasted time on this year. <br/><br/>All I saw was: the bear was ramming into, slapping, gnawing at Leo's face, neck, body, hands and legs. At one time it was literally CHEWING his hand and leg. However, in that freezing weather, without any medication, proper care or food, after being choked and put through the mental anguish of seeing his son killed right in front of his eyes, he managed to make it all the way to his first meal. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie was, like everyone said, nothing.<br/><br/>I saw Leo was PLAYING PITIFUL to be considered for an Oscar!

"peter-stead-740-486963","5","7","13","15 January 2016"," Over the top
","4/5 for cinematography, 1/5 for story.<br/><br/>There are too many plot holes to list them individually, but in general they follow the ""looks- great-but-makes-no-sense"" type flaw. It starts with the attack on the camp by the local tribe. Leo and his son are a little way off but run to the rescue, for some reason through water, even though it's much slower and louder than running across the land to the side of the stream. The attacking tribe seem to have no sense of strategy and risk killing their own as much as the trappers. The trappers for their part seem very slow to realise they need to hit the deck when arrows start killing every other man. You get the idea about the drama that follows, lots of scenes wading needlessly in freezing water, which would have made them hypothermic, lots of sheltering under sparse trees even though there are much thicker clumps of trees nearby, lots of camp fires which would have alerted the hostile tribe to their location, lots of things making no sense at all - it's like no one has any survival instinct.<br/><br/>On this point, two big plot holes really spoil the movie. Leo would have definitely died of those bear wounds. No question. His back is shredded, not to mention his throat, and he would have passed out from blood loss. The freezing cold would then have finished him off. The leader of the expedition trying to stitch him up just looks ridiculous.<br/><br/>Second plot hole - why Tom Hardy, left to guard the near-death Leo, does not just kill him as he is concerned he is a burden in a hostile area. He seems to need to him to acquiesce, okay so he has some kind of conscience, but then is interrupted by Leo's son, and kills him instead. He then could just have tied up loose ends, killed Leo and claimed to his returning companion the son ran off from grief, but no, he leaves Leo alive, which he obviously needs to do otherwise there is no rest of the film.<br/><br/>It's too OTT to be described as grim and the cinematography is too gorgeous for it to be boring, but in a way that's what underlines what a really badly thought-through story it is.<br/><br/>Missable if plot-holes bother you. Birdman was genius, if you haven't seen it, watch that instead."

Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy Zombi-Flicks and splatter movies and I love tough westerns, but the Revenant would have been better if it wouldn't take itself so f***ing serious an Mr. Inarritu would have cut this down to 115 minutes. Its just like the doctor said in ""The Marathon man"": This dent is dead, there is no need to torture it anymore, I have to drill a fresh one.

","In a land where hypothermia isn't a thing, where fire can be started and maintained under any conditions and last all night long without being tended to, where broken legs be damned, where plot lines are half explained and loosely woven together, comes this epic tale of survival, revenge, and camping out in the chest cavity of a horse THE REVENANT! The performance by Tom Hardy and to a lesser degree Leo saved this thing. Will Poulter was also good. A little suspension of disbelief is fine, enjoyable even, but glossing over what it would actually take to survive the conditions portrayed in this film is a bit much. It is incredibly unlikely that anyone could survive Leo's ordeals, starting with the bear attack. And can a brother get a date/place stamp every so often? The characters seemed to go from the heart of the Rockies to the high plains in a matter of hourson foot. The storyline with the Native American chief guy looking for his daughter, and Leo's back story of living and breeding with the Pawnee could have been fleshed out more, there is something more there, but instead we got a sprinkling around the edges and not much more. Not a terrible movie, but there is no need to run out and see it."
"joeravioli","7","7","13","10 January 2016"," Revenge is a dish best served cold, wet, and bloody
","The first bit of this review is spoiler-free. I'll let you know when the spoilers start, so for all you die-hard cinephiles who have managed to stay off Wikipedia for as long as you have, don't worry -- I have your interests at heart.<br/><br/>The Revenant cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki opted to film only in natural light, often leaving the crew with only 90 minutes of specific light to shoot long, arduous scenes. While this proved to be a difficult policy to maintain, it really shows on the big-screen, the natural light complementing the intricate juxtaposition between beauty and brutality that Lubezki and Iñárritu so meticulously maintain throughout the film. As a Canadian, and one blessed to live so near to the Rocky Mountains, I see many a shot that is vaguely recognizable, from the frozen lake with snow-capped peaks in the distance to the mountains silhouetted against the Northern Lights. Lubezki revels in the natural beauty of unspoiled wilderness -- as he should.<br/><br/>But what The Revenant taught me is that beauty is desensitizing, especially if one is inundated with it in a repetitive and unrelenting manner, eventually taking on a (beautiful) monotony. Each scene is done in exactly the same manner: <br/><br/>1. Beautiful nature shot for approximately ten seconds 2. Setting shot 3.Tracking shots<br/><br/>While this strategy is at first riveting, its repetition becomes all too clear after about the first hour or so. I was left in a dull state of certainty as to what was to happen next, amplified by the film's predictable narrative and false profundity.<br/><br/>Now, that isn't to say that the Revenant doesn't initially succeed. The first hour or so of the film is more transporting and disturbing than any CGI-infused blockbuster. Up to the midway point of the film, I was ready to proclaim it the best film of the year. Despite Dicaprio's lack of a need to act (he mostly just crawls around and screams), he crawls and screams quite well. If that's what the Academy is looking for, I'd say for sure, give him the Oscar that he's supposedly been deserving of for so many years. But acting in general is not something I am prone to appreciate, as I find that the best actors/actresses only succeed when the audience doesn't see them as an actor/actress.<br/><br/>I LOVE gritty filmmaking, and The Revenant is as gritty as it gets. We see Dicaprio getting rained on, beaten to a pulp, soaking wet, falling off cliffs, crawling around with a broken leg, dirty, ragged, you name it. The environment that the film depicts is harsh, Iñárritu refusing to compromise his wonderfully maintained atmosphere of mud, blood, and water for the sake of the audience, and we are so much the better for it. Sure, it's tough to watch, but it's not so much imposing as demanding. <br/><br/>[*SPOILERS FROM HERE*] <br/><br/>The Revenant becomes extremely predictable after the first hour. Dicaprio gets mauled by a bear (the scene is brutal), and left for dead by John Fitzgerald (Hardy), who kills his son right in front of him. It's undeniably disturbing stuff, especially when Iñárritu decides to throw in some gore to spice things up. Dicaprio then finds his dead son, and then the film segues into a tiresome, revenge flick that echoes man's immaturity while attempting to demonstrate some sort of profound knowledge of the human condition. In truth, The Revenant is as emotionally corrupt as its characters. By the end of the film, Dicaprio has come such a long way, seen so much, and yet, he is the exact same man that he is before.<br/><br/>I hate to quote Shakespeare, but ""the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance"", and this film fails to realize that. And yet, it sees fit to assume a certain undeserved intelligence (through the use of symbols and flashbacks).<br/><br/>Technically, the film is a masterpiece despite its repetition. Narratively, the film has a flawless beginning and a solid ending. Thematically and intellectually, the film is a mess."

","It started off quite well, although a bit too violent for my tastes. Promising characters, beautiful scenery, some action, some sharp dialog.<br/><br/>But half way through I'd thoroughly lost interest.<br/><br/>Problem one: the plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense. From what I've read in other reviews, it seems this is because elements were added on top of the story it was based on to make it more exciting/dramatic.<br/><br/>Problem two: most of the characters aren't believable, making odd decisions. They're neither likable nor interesting, so I don't care what happens to them.<br/><br/>Problem three: for a survival drama, it needs to be plausible that the main character could actually survive. There are multiple moments where he's clearly dead, superhuman will to live or not. It just makes it silly. It would have been more plausible with a fantasy/sci-fi element to help out, but that wouldn't be a survival drama, would it?<br/><br/>It's a beautiful movie, although far too violent for my taste, and it's a shame to waste that on such a terrible story."

Hostility from the Native American Arikara Indians leads to an ambush of the hunting party. Only about half of the hunters manage to escape on one of their rafts, salvaging as much as they can while still under fire from the attacking Arikara. Henry leads the escaping party, knowing that they are still being pursued by the Pawnee. The party is further slowed down when Hugh Glass , one of the experienced hunters, stumbles on a mother grizzly bear and her cubs while he is separated from the rest of the party."
"john_seater","3","9","18","15 January 2016"," Routine plot, average acting, bad cinematography, historically inaccurate
","The plot is a routine revenge story. A guy gets mistreated. His son is murdered. He overcomes obstacles and gets even. Yawn.<br/><br/>A routine plot is turned into a ridiculous one by the small events throughout. The movie opens with a bunch of hunters wading through the Everglades, except that it is somewhere in the northern Rocky Mountains. Or at least is supposed to be, though I don't know where one would find Everglades-like water amongst the pine trees anywhere in the Rockies (where I have done extensive backpacking). This fascination with people wading or swimming in frigid mountain water in winter pervades the movie, showing up again and again. I've waded in that water. It is COLD. My wife used to call it ""screaming cold."" Yet in this movie people flop into the water, get completely soaked, and then just walk away as if nothing happened. In reality they would very shortly freeze to death and become encased in ice. Floating down the river while fully clothed, including being wrapped in a bear skin as in one scene, would drown you in no time.<br/><br/>The scene shifts back and forth between the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains. Start in the mountains, move to the plains, go back into the mountains (why?), back to the plains.<br/><br/>The acting is competent but nothing special. DeCaprio's acting mostly consists of grunts because after the bear mauling he cannot talk right until near the end of the movie. I can do that. Do I get an Oscar? Over and over we are treated to interruptions of the action for scenes of nature, especially views of the tops of trees from the bases of those trees. Is that supposed to mean something? It interrupts the story for no obvious reason.<br/><br/>There are these Indians around, looking for our hero and his friends to attack them. The Indians are ""Rees,"" i.e., Arikaree or Arikara. The problem is that those Indians lived in North Dakota, not in the Rocky Mountains and certainly nowhere near the Yellowstone.<br/><br/>This show is just another ho-hum Hollywood mangling of history. The characters are uninteresting and flat. The acting does nothing to make the characters more than that. The plot is predictable except where it is so silly as to be hard to imagine. Overall the show is mildly entertaining if you are bored and don't have anything else to occupy your time."
"inspektorr","10","15","34","26 December 2015"," Visual experience like no other
","I have no intention repeating what other reviewers have said about this film, but I do want to chime in with an often overlooked aspect of The Revenant - cinematography.<br/><br/>First of all, the whole film is shot on digital 65mm Arri camera with not a single medium or telephoto lens. Everything is shot with wide angle lenses and the framing is done basically by moving the camera either further away or very, very close to the main actors.<br/><br/>This super-close framing combined with wide angle lenses creates an incredible immersive effect, where you simply cannot help but physically feel the cold, the water, the dirt, the blood splatter, the nature. Many times during the movie the lens itself gets splashed in blood or dirt, it fogs up from the breath of the protagonists or even gets kicked during fight scenes. Also, the faces are so close they get distorted from the wide-angle lenses, which in turn creates an even greater effect of honesty. There are no masterfully lit beauty shots here. Instead, it's all very, very, very rough and very real.<br/><br/>Also, the movement of the camera is incredible. The huge sweeping 360-degree vistas right in the middle of massive combat scenes create the effect of the viewer being ""in the middle of action"", it is almost as if you're turning your head to look around. The fact that the whole movie is made with only natural light is an interesting factoid, but it's important because the DoP Emmanuael Lubezki suddenly isn't confined in his framing by where the artificial lights are placed. He's free to move any where and any way he wants and that sense of liberty is definitively something we don't get to see very often.<br/><br/>Every one of these visual aspects add a new layer of authenticity and what you end up with is an incredible movie that can almost be described as ""an experience"". It's a ride that's hard to forget and is certainly something that anyone interested in film-making is going to want to take a good, hard look into."

"mmaggiano","3","13","29","10 January 2016"," Endurance, Cinematography... and Zero for Story
","The Revenant's story is flat and difficult to accept as realistic or mythic. It may be magic realism but that doesn't make this particular story an effective narrative- its strengths lie in the visual trip it takes you on. However, what story it does have ruins that visual trip, unlike in the best works of Malick or Tarkovsky, where the natural imagery and the dreaminess better compliment the narrative, and vice-versa.<br/><br/>It's not realistic, despite being 'based' on a true story, because it keeps the main character alive past all biological possibility. (For those who would quibble with the 'true story' factor, the actual story of Hugh Glass doesn't have the main character defy death ten times over. Furthermore it's a 'true story' of a mountain man doing something extraordinary. This usually means it's a tall tale.)<br/><br/>And if Glass' death-defiance is meant to subtly show the main character as a kind of undead or supernatural being (or ambiguously or liminally so), that idea is not developed interestingly. Even worse, if Glass' endurance and death-defiance are supernatural, then his determination is irrelevant and the theme seems to be: 'family love powers magic revenge'. That's an F for story to me. I suppose that there could be some sort of grand allegorical meaning, but since the story doesn't work on the literal level, that potential is irrelevant to me.<br/><br/>Although others may see it differently, the highest score I can give a narrative film with a zero for story is a 3 out of 10. I find it sadly amusing that after Birdman, with its examination of the perils of ego, Inarritu follows with an egomaniacal stunt of his own."

Filmmaker Alejanrro Gonzalez Inarritu - who co-penned the screenplay with Mark L. Smith based on Michael Punke's novel - continues to prove his mettle as a director to be reckoned with in a truly epic taking of a formidable recognizable western - the vengeance drama. With echoes of THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES, DiCaprio gives blood (literally and should finally score that elusive Academy Award for a tremendous performance) as frontiersman/tracker Hugh Glass whose expedition with a troupe of fur trappers leads into a harrowing survivalist quest at vengeance and redemption when he is brutally attacked by a bear (one of the film's most unsettling moments) only to witness venal Hardy (worthy of an Oscar himself) murder his Native American son (Goodluck) and left for dead himself. With a will to pursue his traitor with enough vigor and forthright to move a mountain, Glass' ascent to revenge is to be slaked by the film's audience as well. Shot with painterly skill by Emmanuel Lubezki, a grand score by extraordinary trifecta Bryce Dessner, Carsten Nicolai and Ryuichi Sakamoto, and vistas to be only dreamed of by production designer Jack Fisk who makes smart skills of using the wintry, pristine outbreak of foreign land feel alien and all too ethereally beautiful and equally haunting.

","Based on a book of the same name by Michael Punke, this is the tale of frontiersman Hugh Glass and his battle against the harsh climate of the Montana and South Dakota in order to exact revenge.<br/><br/>A revenant in European folklore is a corpse rising from the dead and terrifying the living and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is outstanding as his journey has him straddling the border between alive and dead. The acting here is largely physical and as he jumps in the icy water, is buried alive and eats raw meat, his suffering is incredibly vicarious to the view. It is a film of both survival and revenge; in essence they are both interrelated as it is his desire to avenge his son's death which is keeping him alive.<br/><br/>The cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki is just stunning as the entire film is shot in natural light and most of it in that ""golden hour"" shortly before sunset. The landscape is visceral and you can almost feel the chill of the Midwestern air through the cinema screen. And though the grizzly bear scene may well be artificial compared to the rest of the film it was certainly no less intense.<br/><br/>But in a strange way, the problem with The Revenant may well be its photography. The film is in love with the scenery so much that it becomes an art installation at times and the overlong run-time can possibly be blamed on this. I also had issues deciphering Tom Hardy's American accented dialogue on occasion and this is a problem in a film where relatively few lines are said. There is also an awkward spirituality aspect to the film which appeared to be crow-barred in simply because the film is set in Native Indian territory.<br/><br/>It is a terrific cinematic experience visually and this will probably get Leonardo DiCaprio his Best Actor Oscar. However, it is certainly not the best film of the year. To misquote Thomas Hobbes, The Revenant is nasty, brutish and long."

Not to say I don't like gore, I have been known to like my fair share of bloody dramas. Its just that this film just seemed to be ""beating a dead horse"" so to speak, amongst other things to that poor dead horse.

","Leonardo DiCaprio won a Golden Globe for his performance as Hugh Glass in The Revenant, and the movie is nominated for a dozen Oscars. If these awards were for fortitude alone, the accolades would be well-deserved, as cast and crew have spoken at length about the physical hardships they faced in filming this movie. ""The elements sort of took over,"" DiCaprio told Wired interviewer Robert Capps. One must wonder, why did they undertake such a difficult and potentially perilous project? Perhaps they did it because younger audiences today haven't grown up knowing about the privations and violence inherent in the settlement of the West—there was life before Disneyland—and need to have the blood and guts smacked in their face. In which case, the movie is a success. It's based in part on Michael Punke's novel The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge, set in 1820s Montana and South Dakota along the Upper Missouri River. If they want to give cinematography awards to Emmanuel Lubezki for this film, I will be standing in the front row cheering. It is a beautiful film—with breathtaking views of the western United States (and Canada, Mexico, and Argentina)—shot with a deep depth of field worthy of a Sierra Club coffee table book. Snow-melt rivers, star-spangled nights, forests that pull you into the sky. It's just that we're shown unspeakable violence, then astounding beauty, then unspeakable violence, then astounding beauty, then unsp. . . .you get the rhythm. In fact the violence was always so gruesome that it became (I hate to say this, since human and animal lives were purportedly involved) borrring. The beauty that followed it began to feel like heavy-handed ironic commentary, losing any capacity to soothe. The sound design and music are emotionally apt and compelling, I thought (score by Carsten Nicolai and Ryuichi Sakamoto. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu, who wrote the script with Mark L. Smith, did not conceive of Hugh Glass as anything more than a character bent on revenge. Glass pursues this hollow quest for pretty much two hours and thirty-six minutes. What I like to see in a character is some growth, some change, some ""ok, this is awful, but I can rise above it"" (or not). But while DiCaprio may well be capable of a meatier performance, the film doesn't ask it of him. We learn nothing by watching it except that having an angry mama-bear drooling over you is really disgusting, but wait a sec, now she's going to fling you around like a rag doll again. And drool some more. For good reason, we don't like the Frenchies, or the single-minded Indians, or the dim Americans. Everywhere they appear, Lubezki's beautiful landscape is soon tainted by blood, usually human. Please. A little nuance. But, as Manohla Dargis says in a New York Times review, Iñárritu ""isn't given to subtlety."" The word revenant means ""ghost,"" and it was clear why the ghosts of Glass's murdered wife and son keep reappearing and where they will lead him. And I won't even mention the many, many instances in which the viewer Sees What's Coming a Mile Away."

Aside from a moment when DiCaprio's character gains insight into the pointlessness of his behavior, this is an unexceptional survival and revenge story gussied up by how-did-they-do-that? cinematography, portentous music, and a performance that screams ""Look what I went through to get my Oscar!""

","After being nominated for 12 Oscars I knew I had to watch the revenant and it is a great film. The premise sees a man seek revenge after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by his men. Leonardo di caprio is one of the best actors around and he continues in this film, this is probably his most physical performance ever and I really did feel sorry for his character as he went through this emotional journey. Tom hardy plays the villain in this film and he is great in this film being a rugged bad guy who is truly menacing. Domnhall gleeson fresh off of his appearance in star wars the force awakens is really good in this film and delivered a good secondary character to root for. This is definitely will poulters best role ever and he was really good in this film. The story of the conflict between di caprio and hardy is really good and easily the most interesting part of the film. However, there is some bizarre secondary plot involving some aboriginal people that just really doesn't fit in the film. The script had some decent dramatic dialogue, but it does lack the depth of some other films that holds it back. The style of this film is incredible, the action scenes are crisp and smooth and the cinematography being beautiful. Also the score totally encapsulates this films tone. Overall this is a great film that deserves its plaudits."

The length of the movie: it is just to long and predictable. For the half of the movie Leonardo just crawls and limps. The way (and what) he survives is incredible with great dramatic scenes. The story doesn't get to me: main character suffers and yearns for revenge but I can not identify with his feelings. Maybe the reason is the same, duration of the movie. The revenge and ending: after a long and torturous struggle for survival one would expect great comeback and revenge that would made up for all that. But it the end Glass just does what is expected leaving me with unsatisfied desire for something more to happen."
"burlesonjesse5","7","6","11","11 January 2016"," VIEWS ON FILM review of The Revenant
","Leonardo DiCaprio was good enough to win an Oscar playing Howard Hughes (from The Aviator), coked-up stock broker Jordan Belfort (from The Wolf of Wall Street), and foreign gunrunner Danny Archer (from Blood Diamond). The Academy felt otherwise. Now it seems he's the undeniable favorite to win Best Actor for 2015's The Revenant (my latest review). I call it a sympathy vote. Academy voters have been blackballing Leo for over 20 years so I guess they're calling it truce and just handing him the golden statuette. His performance in ""Revenant"" is a solid dose of physical acting (with few words) but I don't think it's his best work. He claws, he moans, he bleeds, he aches, and ultimately he suffers. I suppose that's good enough to take home the prize at this juncture.<br/><br/>Anyway, DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, a hunter venturing from wintry South Dakota to Big Sky Montana (circa 1823). He gets mauled by a bear, his son gets unjustly murdered by his party's frontiersman, and because of his bloodied condition, he is mistakingly left for dead by his military peers. Barely ambulant, Glass goes on a long journey to find the vigilant who took his boy from him. Leo's character gets put through the wringer as he gets shot at by arrows, goes down a waterfall in icy temperatures, sleeps inside a gutless horse, and eats the raw carcasses of slain bison. Chameleon Tom Hardy (brilliantly) plays Hugh's antagonistic foe, Forrest Goodluck plays his native American son, and Domhnall Gleeson (About Time, Star Wars: The Force Awakens) plays his captain, Andrew Henry. In veracity, I took in The Revenant's mostly brisk, 2 hour and 36 minute running time and was reminded of a more foreseeable version of 2013's Snowpiercer. Granted, this is minus the futuristic elements and train ride vibeology.<br/><br/>Now if you haven't seen the trailer to The Revenant, I implore you that it literally gives the whole movie away. Sacrilege! And if you go into this winter release without hearing any early advance about it, you'll still find things pretty darn predictable. No matter. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu takes a straight ahead and straightforward revenge thriller and injects it with his brilliant direction. He gives his main lead a series of feverish dreams and hallucinatory flashbacks to stew upon. He also combines the dirty, the violent, the bilious, and undercuts ""Revenant"" with sights/sounds of swallowed up nature. You can tell he uses his own style but hey, why not steal a little from his buddies too. There's a small bit of Terrence Malick going on here (stills of trees and animals) and residue courtesy of Alfonso Cuaron to boot (camera near the actor's faces with long takes happening all around them). And despite the film never sustaining the power of its opening battle sequence (between a tribe called Arikara and Henry's hunting party), you're still entertained while being drawn along with Emmanuel Lubezki's brilliant cinematography plus a harrowing musical score by three different composers (Bryce Dessner, Carsten Nicolai, Ryuichi Sakamoto). Rating: 3 stars."

","this movie was wonderful, i had high expectations for it and it didn't disappoint me it lived to my high expectations.<br/><br/>The Revenant could be just one more survival story, but Alejandro Iñárritu directed a movie that can be described as a great cinematic experience. I've really enjoyed its dark but beautiful atmosphere created by director Alejandro Iñárritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (both Oscar-winning). The soundtrack just emphasizes it perfectly. Outside of some brutal scenes, the movie is visually superb and will take you to the beautiful landscapes of the Far West. You should be ready for some extreme scenes of violence, though.<br/><br/>Some of the most incredible things about this film, is by far the cinematography and the sound design/mixing. Visually this movie is a masterpiece. I say this because i've never seen a movie with this style of filming. It's unique and refreshing to watch, especially because their is not a lot of innovation when it comes to unique style in cinematography. The sweeping, continuous shots that go on and on are a Emmanuel Lubezkis trademark and they work beautifully. The absence of music for a lot of the movie and the sound of the falling snow, or the wind rustling the trees, or water flowing down the river is absolutely beautiful. For some of the scenes, even if you close your eyes and listen, you get the sense of where this film takes place."

","I don't write movie reviews very often so believe me, it has to be something that really stands out to make me write at all.<br/><br/>This could have been a great movie. It has great visual effects, great acting, good story line, and more. However, the sounds were horrible. This has to be the worst music I have ever heard in a movie. There were times in the movie where the sounds were so annoying that I had to cover my ears to be able to watch the movie. At one point the screeching sounds where so ear piercing that I was just about to walk out of the theater had it not changed. Other times I could barely understand the actors talking because background sound was stepping over their voices.<br/><br/>The worst part about the background sounds and music was that it just continued on and on throughout the movie. It just never seemed to stop! What was supposed to be the natural sounds of the forest was also extremely loud and out of balance. I don't know why the normal sounds of nature were amplified so much but the ones in this movie were certainly not natural.<br/><br/>I don't see how anyone could give this a high rating. Maybe they watched with their ears plugged. How it got so many nominations is beyond me. Just goes to show that politics also has a hand in the Oscars."
"TheWanderingBohemian","8","11","24","2 January 2016"," Another Inarritu's masterpiece!!
","Harrowing, gripping, brutal, bold, harsh and a visceral depiction of one man's willpower. Murphy's Law kept slipping from one crap to the next, to the next and the protagonist survived somehow every time, I'm not sure about if one should call that luck or the exact opposite? The Revenant is a beautifully shot film, much of it will remind you of the works of writer/director Terrence Malick. Inarritu's masterpiece, a tour de force, if I've ever seen one. From the amazing opening shot, this movie immediately hooks you. The movie is a brutal depiction of man against the wild. a survivalist story that can sometimes be difficult to watch, as some of the scenes can be quite gruesome. the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy are spectacular. Effectively it transports us to another time and place, while always maintaining its worth as a piece of visual art. You don't just watch ""The Revenant,"" you experience it. The camera movements, the tracking shots and that glorious bear attack are all beautifully done and shown in the most harrowing way possible. For a film to open with an over 10 minute long take of a battle nonetheless, it is truly captivating and awe inspiring to see filmmakers push themselves to their limits both physically and creatively. <br/><br/>PS- It provides an immensely absorbing experience to those who have an affinity for the wilderness. It'll be highly ludicrous of Academy if Leo doesn't get his first Oscar for this."

Leonardo is unconscious about half the movie and washing him struggle for one hour+ is boring. The script is not very original and very straightforward, you always know what is going to happen and there are none or few surprises. The acting is superb but the script really failed to capture me.

","Taking a look at online news sites,I noticed a story about an ""infamous"" scene where Leonardo DiCaprio fights a bear in his new film,which led to me getting ready to go bear hunting with DiCaprio. The plot-<br/><br/>1823:<br/><br/>Losing half their men in a surprise attack from the Ree Indians during a hunt for wildlife pelts,the group find themselves being slowed down by experienced hunter Hugh Glass,who along with the attack from the Ree was also badly hurt from a sudden attack from a bear.Wanting someone else to get their hands dirty,the leader of the gang decides to leave Hugh behind with Jim Bridger and his son Hawk Glass who are told that they will be rewarded for killing Hugh. <br/><br/>Doubting the boys,fellow outlaw John Fitzgerald gets the leader to give him permission to stay.Once the rest of the gang have faded away,Fitzgerald starts trying to kill Hugh. Desperately trying to save his dad,Hawk fights back but is killed by Fitzgerald.After killing Hawk,Fitzgerald believes Hugh is minutes from dying,so he decides to leave him for dead.Shaken out of his near- coma like state by seeing the dead body of his son on the ground,Hugh Glass pulls his broken,torn legs off the ground and sets his sights on getting revenge on everyone who left him and his son behind. <br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Gliding along the battle fields,co-writer/(along with Mark L. Smith) director Alejandro González Iñárritu & cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki immense the viewer in a harrowing world,as tightly coiled tracking shots pick up the sliver of blood dripping out of Glass,with Iñárritu lingering on each aftershock that Glass suffers from every stabbing and bullet wound.Firmly holding on to the belief of filming in real locations and using nothing but completely natural light, (which led to the movie taking months longer than expected to be filmed,with crew members quitting over the delay) Iñárritu shows that all the trouble was worth it by using the natural locations to give the title an extraordinary rustic beauty.<br/><br/>Iñárritu releases the delicacy offered by the location in a precise manner,as lone flickers of light from the trees keeps Glass from sinking into the freezing river and endless blizzard.Finding darkness in the beauty of the location, Iñárritu brilliantly stabs the delicate appearance of the location with a blunt-force documentary intensity,which goes from a breathtakingly brittle bear attack,to the blood of Glass & Fitzgerald splattering against the camera.<br/><br/>Partly adapting Michael Punke's novel,the writers offer a brief glimpse of the wild west sunset by giving Glass's relationship with his son a touching tenderness which haunts the entire film.Pulling the knife out of the ""traditional"" glamorous aspects of the revenge tale,the writers drive their Western into a decaying Film Noir world,where every step Glass takes for revenge leads to him losing pounds of flesh as his torn apart heart struggles to survive in the dead to the wild wilderness he has been left in.<br/><br/>Pulling the ""challenges"" he had with Iñárritu onto the screen,Tom Hardy (who during a heated ""debate"" wrestled with Iñárritu!) gives a chilling performance as John Fitzgerald,whose icy eyes are peeled away by Hardy to reveal a blood-drenched psychopath,with each gruff line Hardy drags out displaying Fitzgerald's complete lack of soul.Taking on the role with a seriousness which led to him eating raw animal meat (despite being vegetarian) and sleeping inside an animal carcass, Leonardo DiCaprio gives an extraordinary performance as Glass,thanks to DiCaprio keeping the memory of Glass's son buried right at the centre of his heart,which stays burning as every other piece of Glass's heart is ripped,chewed and spat out,with DiCaprio making each of Glass's shaky steps hit the ground like concrete,as Glass begins his walk for revenge."
"Serge_Zehnder","8","11","24","21 December 2015"," A Rare Experience
","It is one of the most beaten clichés of movie-marketing to call in the viewer to experience something unusual. When in truth there are very few filmmakers who are able to pull off something like a sensory cinematic experience. <br/><br/>Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu is one of those rare directors. His movies defy narrative conventions (""21 Grams"", ""Babel"") and also visual templates (""Birdman""). Now he has achieved his next big step. A big budget adventure story that is reduced to its most minimal plot-elements while being a truly immersive experience that manages to give a tangible sense of a long-gone era.<br/><br/>Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a tracker who assists a band of fur-trappers in the early nineteenth century. He is attacked by a bear along the frontier of Montana. And after being left for dead finds himself amidst an unforgivable wilderness. <br/><br/>The screenplay written by Mark L. Smith and Iñárritu is a starting point for a film that relies first and foremost on the image and is therefore reconnecting with the era of silent film and the most fundamental roots of the medium. Iñárritu who tried to avoid as much as possible the trappings of computer effects has production designer Jack Fisk, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, costume designer Jacqueline West and his actors pull out all the stops. You are left with images, sounds, faces and languages that force you to reflect on your life two hundred years after the events shown here.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio manages, not unlike Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away"", to hold the screen with his presence in a performance that is mostly wordless. From teen-heartthrob to superstar to character actor; DiCaprio's trajectory seems to be about choosing his projects according to the challenges they face. And it must be said that his devotion to the portrayal of an archaic character whose prime motivation is survival is as simple and riveting as can be.<br/><br/>Before he began shooting ""Birdman"" Iñárritu sent his cast an image of Philipp Petit, the high-wire artist who walked between the towers of the World Trade Center. It was a symbolic gesture of what he and his collaborators were trying to attempt with their movie. ""The Revenant"" represents another high-wire act by this Mexican iconoclast. It is a successful attempt to resurrect not only a forgotten time, but also some often neglected qualities of cinema.<br/><br/>May it jolt all those timid formula-makers out of their slumber."

If you remove Dicaprio, you have nothing left, except nice shots of the great American nature. <br/><br/>Furthermore, as often, the ''Hollywood state agency'' found a way to distort history and pictured the French as cold blooded native peoples murderers. <br/><br/>FRANCIS PARKMAN ARGUED, ""Spanish civilization crushed the Indian; English scorned and neglected him; French civilization embraced and cherished him.""<br/><br/>Unlike their competitors, the Spanish and the English, the French often established excellent relations with native peoples during the conquest of the New World."

","Usually one expects good things from Leonardo DiCaprio, especially when coupled with the man of the moment Tom Hardy. Whilst they both deliver stellar performances, dead cert for Oscar nominations, the film itself is only of an average calibre. For 135 million one expects to see a dazzling display but the film only displays normal effects, it would seem that the only reason it cost so much was Iñárritu's insistence on natural light leading to a much longer than usual filming schedule, which drastically inflated the budget. We are shown a fighting bear that is supposed to make for a dramatic scene but the CGI already looks dated, not to mention unnatural, and I ended up watching the clock for the scene to be over, as I noticed others doing too. The storyline itself isn't anything special or that we haven't seen done a million times before. If Leo and Hardy weren't starring in it I imagine so called 'critics' would be calling this an average film. The film would also not break even without their star power."
"Red_Identity","Null","10","22","27 December 2015"," Beautiful, poetic, and immersive
","Much will be said about this film. Whether it is a disappointment or not. I've never been huge on Inarritu. I've always felt his films take the melodrama and contrivance way too far, even if I don't hate any of his films. The first of his that I loved was Birdman, and now I can add The Revenant as his second and his most accomplished film to date. I feel like many will not take to its pacing. It's pretty much the most plot-driven Malick film that the director himself never made. Technically it's breath-taking, with really beautiful and powerful cinematography that will surely blow you away. But then again we all knew that. If there's one aspect of the film that perhaps is flawed, it is the editing. I do feel like the transitioning of scenes at times felt a little off, and because of it the film as a whole can sometimes feel disjointed. I think this, in particular, makes the film feel like it is dragging in its second act. The biggest surprise here is how strong the actual narrative and screenplay is. I didn't know much about these people, the novel, or the plot summary of the film, but I think that the screenplay does a really wonderful job of letting us into many of these characters' heads and really permeating the entire film's atmosphere with intense psychological dilemmas that really haunt the screen. For such a physical film, it's also very much an internal one, and that essentially applies to Dicaprio as well. I've always been hit or miss with him, but this is the best I've ever seen him, and I think that's because it's a role that is totally unlike so much of what he usually does. He has to physically inhabit this character completely. He surely gives it his all, and it's visible all across his face. It's a role very much not driven by dialogue, and instead it's a completely soulful performance. If he was to win an Oscar for this, then congratulations to him because he would be completely deserving. The other standout is Tom Hardy, another actor who is usually hit or miss with me but who also delivers some stunningly good work here. He's chilling, and he should definitely be in contention for an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this film is one that needs to be pondered more to see how it fares with time. The great thing is that, so far, I cannot recommend it enough. It's very much a humorless, miserable film, with only bad things happening to characters we care about. In that respect, similar to Inarritu's previous films, and yet none of it rang false here. It's far from perfect, it remains a daunting, exhausting, overwhelming, yet beautiful, poetic, immersive experience, and those adjectives alone make it one of the best, if not the best, films of the year."

","I have now seen this film twice in four days and the second viewing affirmed what I thought after the first, This is an exceptional piece of cinema. The caveat to that is that folks who like to be spoon fed their entertainment may find it difficult viewing in places but be assured it is exceptional for a number of reasons in my view. Not least the casting, from the Hollywood mega stars(Leo&Tom) to the relatively unknown (to me) Native Americans. The other most important ingredient is the setting, harsh in the extreme.. All played their roles superbly with an unbelievable sense of the time in history when it is set as much as we can really understand what life was really like then. I would assume, pretty 'brutal' by the standards of modern western society. I had no trouble hearing and understanding the dialogue but often it was not greatly of consequence whether understood or not because there is a continuous sequence of events which leads to a fairly likely conclusion. On first viewing I did have a sense of wondering what was going to happen next most of the way through and unlike some reviewers I was not 'bored' for a moment, so much of what occurred was so dramatic as to be a constant chain of surprises, knowing from the meaning of the title what the final outcome would be.I should point out that both viewings were on the biggest screen of my local complex and I sit fairly near the front to get that totally imersive experience.I don't know where the filming took place but wherever, it was a good platform for early 19th century 'back of beyond' USA and that coupled with the unrelenting precipitation of snow or rain gave the whole thing a feeling of great authenticity.I have noted one or two reviews have been very picky about details but for me it was an outstanding piece of drama presented to the highest production values in a staggeringly beautiful if somewhat bleak, at times, setting.

""The Revenant"" stars Leonardo Dicaprio as Hugh Glass, a fur-trapper in the 1820s who is brutally mauled by a bear and is left for dead by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy is a gritty role), causing Glass to seek revenge while trying to survive in the treachery of the western wilderness. Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu strikes again with amazing directing that organizes the look and feeling of the film perfectly. Innaritu doesn't tell you a story, he puts you into it and makes you connect with a film instead of view one. Cinematogrpaher Emmauel Lubuzki (who deserves his third straight Oscar) crafts beautiful shots of both his subjects and the natural setting the film revolves in. It's an amazing work of art that Lubuzki makes, giving ""The Revenant"" a beautiful visual appeal. ""The Revenant"" is all about nature, more specifically man vs nature, man vs man and man vs self. Hugh Glass encounters all three challenges and experiences nature in many forms, nut just from nature in the wild, but human nature of all types. We understand Glass's feelings through his eyes and through his encounters with various native Americans (who are also enemies of the fur trappers). With spectacular acting by Leo and Tom Hardy, ""The Revanant"" delivers a magnificent artistic vision of survival and conflict while engaging viewers in a cinematic experience like no other that tests the questions of life."
"liquidb_84","5","7","14","11 January 2016"," Dissonance
","This was one of the first movies that I've gone to see in theaters in a very long time. It is too bad that the experience left me dissatisfied.<br/><br/>I am a natural skeptic, and I think that this skepticism is what kept me from enjoying the movie. I can accept plot holes, inconsistencies, and the hero escaping unending deathlike scenarios in your average over the top action movie, but in a movie that was filmed in such a realistic way and touted to be based on a true story, these types of things really bother me.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie had me hooked. The quite stalk transitions into one of the most epic battle scenes that I've ever seen. It was truly awesome. The first hints of highly exaggerated drama, and where the experience turned sour for me, came with the bear attack. This was a scene that most people loved, but it was the first scene that tore me out of the movie and into the realm of criticism.<br/><br/>For starters, this movie is beautifully filmed, and adding CGI, even animation this good, really took me out of the story. The bear mauling also seemed highly exaggerated. There were literally minutes of the bear tossing DiCaprio around and biting and shaking every inch of his body. I'm sorry, but no one could survive something like that from an animal that large. Even if he wasn't dead immediately every bone in his body would have been broken and he would have been torn to shreds and bled out in minutes.<br/><br/>The seasons/landscape in the movie also seems highly inconsistent, or maybe I just don't understand the geography/time-line that they were traveling through, but they go from wooded forests with little to no snow to frozen tundra with nothing around them, and then back and forth, and I just did not understand where the different characters were at any given moment.<br/><br/>I love how this movie was filmed, but if you are going to go through all of the hassle to get untouched nature scenes in real light and tell a tale based on a true story, why not make sure that there aren't glaring inconsistencies and truly unsurvivable moments for the protagonist. Here are some more that I noticed: - Multiple gun shots from muzzle loading rifles/pistols without reloading. In any other movie this wouldn't bother me/I wouldn't notice, but really you only have one shot before you have to spend 30-60 seconds reloading one of those things. This kind of inaccuracy was really glaring to me.<br/><br/><ul><li>DiCaprio ate raw meat, and dove into freezing water for his role in this movie, but he couldn't start a fire with flint? It seemed fairly obvious by the way the scene was filmed that the fire was started off screen by someone else. I would think that a movie trying to realistically portray the struggle to survive would at least try to show how hard it would be to really start a fire with flint. If DiCaprio was willing to undergo the other struggles of survival, why wasn't he able/willing to learn to start a fire? - DiCaprio struggles out of a freezing cold river and can barely move, cut, next scene he has a roaring fire but there are barely any usable fire materials in sight. How did he build a fire? - What is with Tom Hardy's accent? I appreciate his dedication to the role, but where is this accent from? I had a similar problem with his accent in Lawless. He is consistent with it throughout the movie, but is it just a made up accent, or is it based off of how some people talk/talked in real life? If it is I certainly haven't heard it before.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>DiCaprio's leg was severely broken and we never see it set. When/How did his bones magically set themselves and heal? Especially since he doesn't have a source of food throughout most of the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When they find out DiCaprio is somewhere outside of the fort they send a party of 20-30 people out to look for him, but when a guy steals all of the money out of the fort safe they only send a party of two? - Why all the scenes with the dead wife? He didn't even have a wife in real life, and I don't think any of the scenes added anything of worth to the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Reading through other reviews it sounds like the story in the movie isn't even close to the story in the book. I really hate when they say based on a true story, but it doesn't even come close. What am I supposed to believe? In the end I just choose to believe none of it, which completely defeats the purpose of it being based on a true story in the first place.</li></ul><br/><br/>Despite all of the things that I disliked about the movie, there were a couple of redeeming scenes. In particular I enjoyed the beginning battle scene, and I think it is something that everyone should see. I also loved the primal scene, where two starving strangers are staring each other down while eating the raw meat of a fresh kill. This scene along with the following scene where they are catching snow out of the sky in their mouths were two of my favorites."

","This film tells the story of a man in the 1820's, who sets out with a group of men for a fur trading expedition. He is attacked by a bear, then left for dead by his men. After he witnessed his son being killed, he sets on a long journey to live for revenge.<br/><br/>There is so much buzz around ""The Revenant"" so I had high hopes for it. However, I was thoroughly disappointed after just ten minutes. It is excessively violent and graphically gory. I think there is no need for ten minutes of fighting and five minutes of bear attack, when one minute each is already enough to convey the message. Most scenes drag on and on, what could have been told in ten seconds are often dragged to minutes long.<br/><br/>Another thing that I dislike is the fact that all actors have long unkempt hair, covering most of their faces. This makes character recognition an intense mental challenge! Thirdly, the story is not engaging or interesting. It only involves Leonardo walking around in snow most of the time. There is nothing to captivate me. I watched the whole 2.5 hours of ""The Revenant"", and I was thoroughly bored."

"guilhermejunior","6","5","9","1 April 2016"," Don't believe the hype
","The Revenant was a long awaited movie, not only due to the special effects and panoramic pictures, but also due to the famous role the actor Leonardo DiCaprio plays in it. A strong hype was noticed coming from the fans of DiCaprio, especially when considering, that after many great roles, and 5 nominations, he never got the chance of giving an ""Oscar-Winner Speech"". Personally, I am a huge fan of DiCaprio, and his work through the last years. He is, in fact, one of the actors that have made nothing but powerful roles, that stick in the viewer's minds. ""The Revenant"" hasn't failed when it comes to give him a role, that people will remember, but unfortunately not as the best one. In the movie, Leonardo DiCpario plays Hugh Glass, an American frontiersman in the 19th century, who gets severely attacked by a bear, and then left to die by his expedition-colleagues. After this disaster, the remaining 2 hours of the movie consist in Glass trying to get back to civilization by himself, and seeking revenge for his son, who got murdered by Fitzgerald, played by the great Tom Hardy. Although quite original, the plot is extremely empty, which leaves the audience in a constant boredom throughout the length of the film. Despite the fact that DiCpario (and the great Tom Hardy) managed to come up with the expectations for their acting, ""The Revenant"" wasn't a movie that should get rewarded with a ""Best Actor Oscar"", not because DiCaprio played Hugh Glass badly, but simply because the whole journey he made by himself, didn't require much of him, mainly due to the lack of dialogue. To summarize, it was a well developed movie, but the 12 nominations it got, were definitely not fair."

Watch it if 'Nat Geo' is one of your favourite channels and also if you have the time and patience.

"chemingineer","6","5","9","3 March 2016"," A Pompous Exercise in Film-making
","The Revenant is an intense but excruciatingly long film. It recounts the true story of the incredible return of Hugh Glass, an ace fur trapper, who was left behind as ""dead"" by a treacherous accomplice after being badly mauled by a bear. Without subtitling, barely a sentence can be understood of the heavily accented drawl. Not that Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Hugh Glass has much to say; most of the time he is grunting or grimacing. Other than that he also bites into live fish, eats raw bison liver and sleeps inside a dead horse. It is definitely not an Oscar winning performance.<br/><br/>While the snowscape is exquisitely photographed, it can hurt your eyes. There are some stunning sequences, among them the bear attack. Despite the film being so long, not much footage has been devoted to Glass's miraculous recovery. It defies belief, even if based on a true incident. The director has tried to inject some doses of mysticism, but it comes across as a pompous exercise in film-making. What linger at the end are not the travails of Hugh Glass, but the sad eyes of the native Indian chief searching for his abducted daughter."
"Gamma-Rat","3","5","9","24 February 2016"," Disappointing
","Having a passion for both movies and the great outdoors it will be of no surprise that I've been very excited about the release of The Revenant for quite some time. In the hands of a talented Director and arguably Hollywoods best acting talents on board what could possibly go wrong?<br/><br/>I can't overstate how disappointed I was with this movie, to all the reviewers on here who give 9 or 10 star ratings i feel the need to say that the Emperor really has got no clothes on.<br/><br/>I agree that The Revenant is a visually stunning movie and if thats all it takes to make great entertainment for 2 hours I suggest you save the price of your cinema tickets and go enjoy your local woods or beauty spot for free. Personally I believe that great cinematography, acting and CGI are all irrelevant if the plot is second rate, and here in lies my great problem with a movie that had a really incredible, albeit rather embellished story to work with. <br/><br/>If as some reviewers have written this is a story of mans resilience against the harsh forces of nature, then why did the film makers feel the need to discard some of the most interesting elements of Glass's story pertaining to that. For instance how he used maggots to eat away at his infections in order to avoid Gangrene or the raft he fashioned to travel downstream without dying of hypothermia, a condition that Decaprio,s character seemed strangely immune to. Instead they add a rather laughable revenge plot that even Charles Bronson or Steven Seagal would have considered too cliché. When will Hollywood learn that killing the bad guy who killed your loved one, is not just a very dissatisfying and predictable narrative its also downright insulting to the intelligence of the viewing public. Lets not forget to add in the clichéd ghostly appearances of his lost loves, people who had literally zero character development, to complete the disappointment. The only saving graces of this movie is the well paced and interesting opening battle sequence and Tom Hardys performance, proving yet again that he is among the very elite of acting talent. Its a great shame the script writing didn't match his contribution.<br/><br/>My advice to anyone considering going to see this movie, is to leave after the first half hour, go straight home and watch Deliverance or Into the Wild or even go look at some trees, it takes more resilience than Hugh Glass himself showed in the wilderness to get to the end of this film."
"tmwest","5","5","9","21 February 2016"," What about a new story or a new way of telling it?
","Considering the fantastic reviews and prizes this film is getting I have to say it is not my cup of tea. Great cinematography, good actors, impressive fight with a bear, savage scenes...But what about a good story or better said a new way of telling a story? To say the story is conventional is an understatement. It reminds me of Dance with Wolves when I would like to see something like the wronged The Hateful Eight. The film leads you into thinking you are seeing something new because of the unusual beautiful scenery and the savage ways of the characters.It is like a candy in a new wrapping, when you open it is all the same..."
"dsobrien-72510","4","5","9","17 February 2016"," Annoyingly unrealistic
","So I, like most other reviewers, really enjoyed the amazing cinematography in this movie as well as the incredible locations... for that alone this movie deserves recognition and praise. I've never felt so up close an personal in a movie before. For this I give the movie 2 points.<br/><br/>The acting, at least the physical components of acting, was clearly excellent. I give the movie an additional 2 points for acting - especially by our two main characters.<br/><br/>But,<br/><br/>My mind just couldn't accept the situations that our hero Hugh Glass survived in this movie depiction of a story with apparently true elements. Survival under such conditions is simply not possible. My key example would have to be complete immersion in a river with water temperatures in the 32 to 40 degree (F) range for - what must have been at the very least - 15 to 20 minutes and perhaps longer. In these water temperatures, a person would have about 10 minutes before their movements would be weak, uncoordinated and ineffective; certainly not sufficient to drag ones self out of the water up a steep bank, collect wood, and start a fire. And I'm just talking about the water immersion! Moving from water at this temperature to winter air temperatures in the 20's or 30's, with everything you're wearing soaked, is not survivable. I could highlight the completely unbelievable nature of most of the situations experienced by Mr. Glass, but I think my point is made.<br/><br/>I wanted to suspend belief, I wanted him to survive, but the situations depicted in the film were just too extreme.<br/><br/>So no additional points because of this, in my opinion, fatal flaw.<br/><br/>As others have highlighted, the otherwise single track story line with largely undeveloped back-story and lack of dialogue also earned no additional points for my movie rating.<br/><br/>I wish had those 2 and a bit hours and the $16.38 I used up to see the movie back."
"glassvision","3","5","9","16 February 2016"," Unoriginal, Derivative Rehash Of Multiple Similar Films
","PROS <br/><br/>1. The film is technically brilliant. There are numerous stunning, very complex sequences that made me wonder how they pulled it off, with ambitious use of cranes and jibs. Much of the camera-work is mindblowing. There's a Native Indian attack on the hunting party near the start that appears to be shot in one long take without any edits and it's incredible to watch, Indians are shot and fall from trees, arrows are shot through people's necks, people fall from horses, there are knife-fights, gun-fights, and it's all shot in one long take that goes on for ten minutes. Of course there ARE edits, but they are cleverly masked, I think during the various whip pans. This sequence - for it's ambition, scale and scope - is almost on a par with the opening of Saving Private Ryan. The grizzly bear attack on DiCaprio is technically amazing too. Incredibly realistic. <br/><br/>2. The Native Indians are portrayed in an interesting and fresh way. They are shown to be intelligent, dynamic people. The performance by the elderly Arikara chief is especially powerful. <br/><br/>3. There's an interesting interplay between the various ethnic groups in this film. The French are portrayed as drunken, racist, corrupt rapists. The American frontiersmen are a strange assortment of Irish-American looking people with ginger hair, a few black people and a cockney - similar to the type of demographic mixture you see on a pirate ship, or the crew of an old sailing ship - or like the ship in King Kong for example - it's almost the exact same demographic mixture as those guys on the ship in King Kong, And Prometheus. And The Force Awakens. And Spectre. I guess it's a demographic reflection of the film's intended audience. <br/><br/>CONS <br/><br/>1. The film becomes more contrived as it goes along. The film is about DiCaprio overcoming one implausible challenge after another. He's attacked by Indians - but survives, he's mauled by a grizzly bear for 5 minutes - but survives, the French find and hang from a tree DiCaprio's Pawnee companion but fail to spot DiCaprio - who's camping in a big tent just a few meters away. He falls over a cliff on his horse - but survives (the horse dies), he's washed downriver in the rapids and is heading towards a 300M drop but at the last moment inexplicably steers himself into a tranquil off-shoot river and survives. He also nearly freezes, starves and bleeds to death but always pulls-through at the very last moment. DiCaprio faces death every 10 minutes yet survives the most ludicrous injuries and accidents - meanwhile everyone around him dies in a flash. <br/><br/>2. There are annoying and pretentious dream-sequences depicting DiCaprio's Native Indian wife and son before they get killed. DiCaprio experiences continual dream-sequences / flashbacks depicting his loving wife watching over him from the afterworld which are impossible to relate to because his wife and son are just ciphers who have very little screen-time so we never get the opportunity to develop feelings for them like we do for DiCaprio and to a lesser extent with some of the other characters such as the friendly Pawnee Indian and the elderly Arikara chief. <br/><br/>3. Much more could have been made of Native Indian mysticism. The imagery in the film tried so hard to be mystical and profound but it just came across as hackneyed and derivative. <br/><br/>4. Tom Hardy keeps letting people go - he's on the verge of killing someone then he let's them go for no reason other than to allow the story to continue. So he's got loads of witnesses to his crimes running around the wilderness and he goes back to the fort where he can get arrested and be testified against by the multiple witnesses he allowed to go free. This is one of the more blatant flaws that ruins the film. <br/><br/>5. Tom Hardy is horribly miscast in this film - he's not menacing or depraved enough for the role, he delivers his dialogue in a mumbling Texan drawl that's barely understandable - you can't understand 95% of what he says. His performance is comical, cartoonish and overacted. I would have cast an actor 10-15 years older than Tom Hardy - Tom Hardy is too similar in looks and demeanour to DiCaprio to provide an engaging foil. <br/><br/>6. Bizarrely - whilst much care and attention has been paid to the outstanding cinematography and direction (the blocking in some of the long, complex one-take scenes is jaw-dropping) there appears to be massive technical errors on the soundtrack. I noticed Tom Hardy's dialogue was out of sync a couple of times. <br/><br/>IN SUMMARY <br/><br/>The director - Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu - pulls off massive technical ambition perfectly, but maybe because of this, the film feels artificial and contrived. As the movie progressed I started to get the terrible feeling that I had seen it all before - and I had! He's copied the story - I've seen this story so many times before: Badlands, Deliverance, Southern Comfort, The Proposition, the recent film about wolves with Liam Neeson - all remarkably similar in theme, tone. The Proposition seared itself into my memory because it dared to be different and dared to be new and it succeeded in doing that. These qualities are missing in The Revenant, it's a rehash of a rehash. There's no substance to it, and absolutely no soul. Everything is pinned on the fancy camera-work and clever digital effects - but beyond that - there's nothing there. I'm sorry to say this - but I can only give The Revenant 3/10."

","In 1823, a party of trappers under the command of Captain Andrew Henry hunt for pelts in the unsettled wilderness of the northern Louisiana Purchase. When Arikara Native Americans launch a surprise attack on the party's camp, many of the trappers are slaughtered and the survivors flee on a boat. At the recommendation of the party's guide and most experienced hunter Hugh Glass, who has knowledge of the area and natives, they abandon the boat and begin the journey back to their outpost, Fort Kiowa, on foot. The decision bothers some, particularly John Fitzgerald, who is hostile towards Glass's half-native son Hawk, as he was partially scalped by natives years prior.<br/><br/>While scouting ahead, Glass is ambushed by a grizzly bear after disturbing her cubs. He manages to kill her but is badly mauled; the party discover him close to death and carry him on a makeshift stretcher. Fitzgerald argues that Glass will not survive his injuries and that they should kill him to speed their journey. Unable to kill Glass, Henry offers payment for several men to stay behind with him instead. Fitzgerald, Hawk and the young Jim Bridger volunteer. Henry has Fitzgerald promise to stay with Glass until he dies and give him a proper burial.<br/><br/>Once alone with Glass, Fitzgerald reveals his intention to smother him. Claiming that it will save Hawk, Fitzgerald pressures Glass into compliance. However, Glass watches helplessly as Hawk arrives during the act only to be killed in the ensuing struggle. When Bridger returns, Fitzgerald says Hawk is missing, and Glass is too injured to protest. Later, Fitzgerald lies that the Arikara are nearby and that they must abandon Glass; he drags Glass into a shallow grave. Bridger hesitates but flees with Fitzgerald, leaving Glass with his canteen. Glass crawls out of the grave and walks through the woods for days, haunted by visions of his deceased Native wife. He escapes the Arikara, whose chief is searching for his kidnapped daughter Powaqa, by floating down rapids.<br/><br/>On their way to Fort Kiowa, Bridger realizes that Fitzgerald lied, but Fitzgerald intimidates him into silence. When they arrive at the fort, Fitzgerald tells Henry that Glass succumbed to his wounds and that Hawk was likely attacked by the Arikara. Henry pays Fitzgerald his reward, but Bridger refuses payment.<br/><br/>Glass encounters Hikuc, a friendly Pawnee who shares bison meat with him. Hikuc too has lost family, but says that ""revenge is in the Creator's hands."" The two travel together on horseback, and Hikuc builds Glass a shelter during a blizzard. Glass wakes to find Hikuc hanged by a group of French pelt hunters. He infiltrates the camp and sees the leader raping Powaqa. He frees her, kills two hunters, and retakes Hikuc's horse, leaving behind Bridger's canteen. He encounters the Arikara again and escapes by galloping off a cliff, killing the horse and injuring himself further. He survives the night by sheltering inside the horse's carcass.<br/><br/>At Fort Kiowa, a lone hunter arrives carrying Bridger's canteen. Believing it was stolen from Hawk, Henry organizes a search party and leaves to find him. Fitzgerald, realizing that Glass is alive, steals the fort's money and escapes. Henry's search party discovers Glass and brings him to the fort. Furious, Henry charges Bridger with treason, but Glass assures Henry that Fitzgerald lied to him. Glass insists on joining Henry to find Fitzgerald. After they split up while tracking him, Fitzgerald ambushes Henry. Glass finds him dead and scalped.<br/><br/>By pretending to be dead, Glass ambushes Fitzgerald and shoots him in the shoulder. He chases him into the woods and they engage in a bloody fight on a river bank. Glass is about to kill Fitzgerald, but remembers Hikuc's words and pushes him downstream into the hands of the Arikara. The chief, accompanied by Powaqa, scalps and kills Fitzgerald but spares Glass. Glass walks away and collapses. He has a vision of his wife, who smiles at him before disappearing into the woods. <br/><br/>You peoples should watch this movie.It was phenomenal 10/10!!."

Saying that this man is hardcore is an understatement. What he endears is a testament to how resilient the human spirit can be. So who better to play him than the legendary Leonardo DiCaprio.

Aside from the insanity that is this story and Leos superb performance, this film has a lot to offer. Most noticeably is how the film itself looks. Shot in all natural light, 'The Revenant' is able to bring a sense of realism that few films have achieved. It's a beautiful film to behold that effortlessly sucks you into its world.<br/><br/>Honestly, if I were to rate this film from a technical stand point it would most definitely receive a perfect rating. Everything done behind the camera is flawless. The standout being Inarritu himself. There are some scenes in this film with so many moving parts it's a wonder how he is able to control them all. We have fights between white men and Indians that flow so naturally that you can practically feel like you're there. <br/><br/>Yet I found myself ultimately disappointing with this film. Perhaps this my fault. Coming straight off 'Birdman' I found the next film that Inarritu was making and kind of went crazy. I saw this films story line along with the director and all star cast and have been losing my mind waiting for it ever since. I held this film up like many people were doing with 'The Force Awakens'.<br/><br/>That being said, as I watched I found some very obvious mistakes. The film never felt like it quite made it to a final draft. The problem with this film is that we don't learn one single thing about our main character. He is certainly the most determined human being of all time but what do we really learn about him? There seems to be nothing making him a man other than a convoluted back story with a side of vengeance. There is so few character traits that we can actually point to that make him human.<br/><br/>This makes the lengthy two and a half hour run time drag at times. He tries to survive then runs from Indians over and over and over again. There is a point where this just isn't exciting any more. And it left me longing for some actual character moments from him. In fact the only characters we really get to know aren't in the film all that much. What's stranger is that, through the entire run time, a tribe of Indians is on his tail for absolutely no reason. Yeah they are looking for a stolen girl but why on earth are they following the company that they demolish at the beginning of the film? Obviously she isn't with them so why on earth didn't they investigate literally anyone else?<br/><br/>The subplots in this film made so little sense that switching back to our relatively bland main character came as a breath of fresh air. The film never really felt like it was fully thought through. There was so many things that didn't add up that following the repetitive journey of DiCaprio became, at times, a strain. But somehow, it remains a good movie. It's gritty, hard to watch, but most of all an absolute spectacle and landmark in film making."

","Greetings again from the darkness. ""Keep breathing."" A flashback in the opening sequence has Hugh Glass whispering the phrase as advice to his young son Hawk, the product of Glass and his beloved Pawnee bride. The phrase has a recurring role throughout the film  possibly serving as a courtesy reminder from director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu to the moviegoers mesmerized (and nearly traumatized) by the incredible brutality of what is on screen.<br/><br/>It's a master class in filmmaking by those at the top of their game. Inarritu is the reigning Oscar winning director for Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), and he has re-teamed with the reigning Oscar winning cinematographer from that movie, Emmanuel Lubezki. Two of the finest actors of their generation, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, strip away any semblance of pampered movie stardom to deliver ultra-realistic performances in a story ""based in part"" on the true to life novel by Michael Punke.<br/><br/>An early action sequence is startling in its ferocity as Arikara surround and attack a group of hunters and trappers, and the whoosh of arrows – many of which find their mark – abruptly drag us into a world that we are unfamiliar with and certainly unprepared for. It's early 19th century U.S. frontier, and just about everyone and everything can kill you. Providing just enough time for us to pry our fingers off the armrests, Inarritu stuns us with what is undoubtedly the most fantastic grizzly bear attack on a movie star ever filmed. In what appears to be a single take (which also happens to be the number of breaths I took), Mama Grizzly treats Leonardo the way a young puppy treats its first chew toy. Scratched, chewed, tossed and stomped. This scene is savage and brutal, and sets the stage for the true, yet still unbelievable odyssey of survival by frontiersman Hugh Glass.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy excels as the calmly psychotic villain Fitzgerald, though some of his early hillbilly-tinged dialogue is difficult to catch. His hulking presence fits with our imagined look of the frontiersman of the era  tough and unforgiving nearly beyond belief. His bullying of youngster Jim Bridger (played by Will Poulter) and power struggles with Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) are at frightening levels of intensity. Fans of Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds will smile as they recognize the name of mountain man Jim Bridger  though that's one of the few smiles offered by this 156 minute gut-wrenching ordeal. It would not be surprising if DiCaprio's mantel sports an Oscar in a few months. He is that superb in a role that has nothing to do with good looks or charm.<br/><br/>A tale of survival. A quest for revenge. It's both of those, as well as a reminder that nature can be both beautiful and brutal. Some of the photography is almost poetic, and often reminds of the work of director Terrence Malick. And in the blink of an eye, that moment is shattered by the torrential force of river rapids carrying Glass over the waterfall, or his taking a horseback ride off a steep cliff (one of the most dramatic shots of the film). The journey of Glass is unknown in distance or time in the movie, but there is no question as to the numerous struggles with the elements and the raw physicality required to persevere. If you can avoid diverting your eyes, there are visuals here that will be sincerely appreciated – even as you squirm, cringe and moan throughout.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, the film was shot on location in Canada and Argentina using only natural lighting, and emphasizing aspects of nature that often are overlooked. The sound of arrows, bears, and even DiCaprio's breathing are profound and crucial to the overall effect, as are the animal skin garments and other costumes. It's impossible to tell where CGI meets reality, but the visceral experience will be quite unique for most viewers  and not soon forgotten."

","Let me start by saying that I cannot believe someone actually gave this wonderful film one star in his review. That tells me that the reviewer has some sort of grudge for doing this.<br/><br/>This movie is what cinema is all about, gripping, captivating and extremely scary in many parts. I believe this work from the wonderful director reinvents the adventure/survival/revenge genre. My jaw was on the floor several times, especially with THAT bear scene. How it was filmed to be so realistic is a mystery to me. Just wait till you see it. In all my life I have never seen anything like this, so for someone to give it a one star review leaves me bewildered and wondering what goes on in some people's minds. This is a magnificent film and I have given it ten stars for the amazing experience I had watching it."
"robsta23","9","8","17","8 January 2016"," Great Acting and Visuals
","This film seems unlike any revenge film to come before this one. It is incredibly well-shot, it is brutal and intense, well-acted, and it takes place in the early days of America when Native Americans and Caucasians didn't get along so well. Tension between these two very broad groups is what drives the action in the film's opening sequence, and it is a motif throughout the film.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, a man who raised a young Native American named Hawk on his own after the boy's parents either abandoned him or died in a battle. Glass fights a bear and miraculously survives to be buried alive by Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) who wants to cash in on this ""service"" since he has somewhat of a feud with Glass and does not want to see him live. It is unclear whether Glass is okay with this since he technically ""makes a deal"" with Fitzgerald, but Glass gains the will to fight for survival once he realizes Hawk was killed by Fitzgerald.<br/><br/>A huge chunk of the film is devoted to following Glass' journey to return to his community, and this proves to be visually beautiful, but also causes the film to feel slow at points. There are incredible shots of Glass in relation to the land around him, which proves to show scenery and landscapes in a poetic manner. One impressive shot is a tracking shot which moves from an extreme wide shot which focuses on the mountains with Glass as tiny as an ant in the distance and eventually moves to a close-up on the same character. There are many long takes in the film that are executed brilliantly, some during action sequences and some when Glass is simply walking on his journey. However, as the story follows Glass on his journey, some of the scenic shots go on too long and seem monotonous since we understand that Glass has to go a long way, but the film keeps reminding us this with more and more scenic shots that don't move the story along.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is at his best here, and will probably receive his fifth Oscar nomination for acting. Whether or not he will actually win the award as fans often complain about, his performance in The Revenant will live on in history. Glass' desperation comes across very convincingly even though DiCaprio does not even need to speak throughout a lot of the movie. That's the real acting - when actors can express emotions and motivation clearly through body language rather than how they handle dialogue.<br/><br/>Every action sequence in this movie is incredible. Most are done in just a few long takes which means these sequences needed to be really well-choreographed in order to get the shots right. And these sequences were on location rather than in a studio, so one has to respect the direction and the cinematography that was done with amazing effort outside in cold environments.<br/><br/>If there is one thing to take away from The Revenant it is the visuals. It's funny that not many movies are done this way today even though filmmakers know that film is a very visual medium. Innaritu understands this very well as we can see in Birdman as well as in this movie, and hopefully he inspires the next generation of filmmakers to follow in his footsteps.<br/><br/>3.5/4.0"
"Cowpotamus","9","8","17","28 December 2015"," Revenge is a dish best served in the beautiful cold.
","The Revenant weaves history, nature and war into a beautifully shot film. This slow burning tale of revenge does not rely upon dozens of dialogue heavy scenes, but it instead focuses on the quintessence of its subject. I am glad that Iñárritu strays away from a history lesson, as it allowed a tender era to unfold in a brutal light without insulting the audience with tiresome exposition. <br/><br/>The Oscar dodging Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a powerful performance. From start to finish, he puts everything into the character of Hugh Glass, a man of the American frontier who seeks retribution for the death of his half-native son. Tom Hardy is Fitzgerald, an unusual aggressor in that he never truly inflicts harm for pleasure, but his actions are rather a circumstance of nature, war and innate survival. This again isn't entirely what we hear, but it is what we see – many glances, expressions and explosions of anguish tell us of burgeoning conflict without a word.<br/><br/>I feel The Revenant achieves greatness in these scenes. The bear mauling, Glass' speechless days injured and his subsequent hunt are beyond enchanting. The supporting cast do what they need to and they do it well, but their scenes are often stolen by Leo and Hardy's masterful performances. The past is alluded to in spiritual scenes, and although gorgeously meaningful, some only exist to retell recent toils in a confusing fashion. Nonetheless, Iñárritu has directed yet another masterpiece, soaked in blood and snow, and it would not surprise me if Leo and he return from The Oscars with a golden man in hand. They certainly deserve it."
"Yadir","8","9","20","10 January 2016"," Great!
","So, where to start? <br/><br/>The beauty of the shots: basically every scene was stunningly beautiful. The nature had such a raw and rough and wild atmosphere. In contrast to the wide shots of nature there where a lot of close-ups to the characters. You felt like you were standing right in front of them. In the action sequences you were so close to everything that happened: you see the perspective of one character and only his. You don't get an overview what's happening. You're close to some very graphic scenes (contrast: beautiful shot composition - brutal scenes the shots show). A lot of long takes (hello birdman) were used and it helps to stay in one scene (I hate scenes with 15 cuts in 10 seconds). Inarritu also lets the camera stay with the actors. You see their faces when they learn new things, how they react to it.<br/><br/>I loved the spare use of music. There was some much tension in a lot of scenes, adding music would have ruined it. But when the (great) music was used it underlined the moments perfectly.<br/><br/>The actors were great, Hardy's performance especially. Also it seems like you just have to add Gleeson to your movie and it will become great.<br/><br/>So all in all a great film. It sometimes feels long, but never boring. I expect it to only grow with more viewings."

","""Nature red in tooth and claw"" Tennyson<br/><br/>The 19th century's romanticism and growing naturalism inspired Tennyson to describe in these lines the dark side as Darwin would change forever our benign view of man and nature. Director/writer Alejandro Gonzalez Innarritu and writer Mark L. Smith adapt Michael Punke's novel in a naturalistic way that makes the 156 minutes seem as long as it must have taken noted explorer Hugh Glass (Leo DiCaprio) in the 1820's to recover from being buried alive in the wilderness he helped open.<br/><br/>After being mauled by a bear and left for dead by his comrade in trapping, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who also murders Glass's son in front of him, Glass drags himself 200 miles! back to civilization to exact revenge. Although it is a survival/revenge story, with the usual formulaic occurrences, DiCaprio and Hardy succeed in making it real, tortured, and visceral in the extreme. <br/><br/>I can try to guess how much discomfort DiCaprio went through for this Oscar-worthy performance, which lacks only the variety and nuance of speech that characterizes frequent Oscar winners. What the role demands and delivers is the almost insane will to survive and revenge.<br/><br/>A heavy dose of naturalism (not just realism but realism with bedrock of rawness and violence) is best exemplified in the mother bear protecting her cubs by savaging Glass, a tour de force scene. The Pawnee Indians also illustrate the harsh world with one chief briefly cataloguing what the white man has taken from the tribes.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the cinematography by Tree of Life's Emmanuel Lubezki is stunning in sharp grey to reflect the winter conditions that contrast with the snow. Rarely does the sun shine, and in figurative terms it shouldn't because this is a grim world where animal pelts are a man's riches, and a life can be lost for a simple miscalculation or an indifference bred of Nature's seeming carelessness for human life.<br/><br/>Glass accepts, as all must, Nature's final demand: ""I ain't afraid to die anymore. I'd done it already."""

","This is a typical revenge movie. But the director was taking out revenge against the audience. Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio gave good performances, though not Oscar worthy. Other actors played their parts, got paid and went home. This 2 1/2 hour movie contained 1 1/2 hours of material and 1 hour of nature scenery that added nothing to the story. His would have seen a fairly decent film if these extraneous scenes were cut. The music droned on and made me want to go to sleep. That being said, many people leaving the theater seemed to like the movie. Though one couple walked out at the 1 1/2 hour point not to return. I would not recommend seeing this movie unless you've seen everything else and are bored."
"danielstorer","10","10","23","9 January 2016"," The Revenant is a cinematic masterpiece that most likely will be remembered for years to come!
","Alexandre Iñárritu did it again! Birdman was an extraordinary film and Iñárritu followed it up with The Revenant which is a fantastic film! It has breathtaking cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki which is even more impressive when you look at the challenge that Iñárritu decided to tackle: filming it entirely in all natural light. This just added to the realistic nature to the film and made it visually breathtaking.<br/><br/>This film is partly based on true events in the 1820s and stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a frontiersman named 'Hugh Glass', who is brutally mauled by a bear leaving him seriously injured and out to get revenge on Tom Hardy's character 'John Fitzgerald' for something that took place just after his encounter with the bear.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gave an outstanding performance showing his struggles, turmoil, and general survival. His performance was very visual involving very little spoken words and when it was, it was mostly another language than English. This has to be one of the best visual performances I have ever seen from an actor in film, it was incredible seeing this character go through what he went through!<br/><br/>Tom Hardy also gave a brilliant performance as this cowardice, backstabbing, liar who does a great job at making you show disdain for the character. Glass and Fitzgerald have a defining scene at one point in the film showing them fighting against each other with quite a lot of brutality to the fight that left me on the edge of my seat with its intense and unsparing nature. I feel that this along with the bear scene are some of the best from 2015.<br/><br/>Now speaking of the bear scene, it will go down as one of the best scenes in cinema history. It was incredible how realistic and intense it turned out to be! The CGI on the bear is the best I think I've seen for an animal: making for an extremely believable bear that I was finding hard to believe wasn't real! DiCaprio's performance is also one to be acknowledged for this scene with the pain and desperation of his actions as he struggles to survive. Extraordinary!<br/><br/>However, I did have one issue worth noting and that was a choice of words towards the climax of the film, I don't want to give anything away but I feel that was an underwhelming remark within the situation. But overall this film is fantastic and I would definitely recommend watching it!"
"chaos-rampant","Null","10","23","3 January 2016"," Traveling far outside but seeing one thing
","The blueprint here is simple. A world that lies in wait and summons unexpected violence that wrecks lives - it can be an Indian ambush, a bear, or a greedy little man who will do anything for quick profit. A world of immense beauty, inscrutable in workings, that we try to subdue to our satisfaction.<br/><br/>DiCaprio as our ability to coexist and adapt to the land, the Fitzgerald character as that nature in man that only wants to please itself and to grab. It's not just a meaningless violence that visits them. We're made to note Indians out in search for a daughter that was stolen, a bear that was only protecting its young. Meaning, there's agency behind the random cruelty.<br/><br/>Other filmmakers, Malick for one, would be content to evoke different ways of framing the question posed by this world so that we would end up hopefully with a whole cloud of floating realities. (Malick no doubt knows that agency as what the Chinese call the Tao). Inarritu is plot- and action-driven and reflects in the gaps instead.<br/><br/>I mean this is a film where two hours in we still have shenanigans like DiCaprio crashing down from a cliff. It has a clear causality. One event precipitates the next. So when the Indians spare a pointless death in the end, it registers as plot contrivance instead of spiritual realization that severs the cycle of suffering. We ask, why would they spare him? Which is the wrong question.<br/><br/>This is just not a very astute work and it comes down to perhaps one thing; how the camera breathes life into the world. It is Malick inspired, most obvious in the dream scenes. But it rests on a poor understanding of him. Malick - like Tarkovsky before - frees eye from world, the eye that recalls and reflects from the world of events with its clear causality, so that the eye can float in and out of lives, entering events, memories, urges, anticipations in a seamless flow that encompasses a bigger whole. <br/><br/>Inarritu has no notion of this yet. Birdman showed that he might be coming around but no dice. This one frames events as action or dream; its idea of visual poetry is to embed characters in beautiful vistas and have that surround from the outside. It enters this one guy and we have revenge and regret. Oh there are a few continuous shots, an impressive one early; but it's just elaborately choreographed action. The shot ends with the Indian chief whispering a plot point to the camera about his stolen daughter.<br/><br/>No harm in seeing this one. But it would be even better if it propels you to study Malick beneath the soliloquy as a master of the floating eye. Further back it was Jancso and Tarkovsky. It's on discoveries of people like these - people who'd be deemed too abstract and would have gone jobless in Hollywood - that this one rests. <br/><br/>You'll know this if you track down a previous retelling of the same story in the Richard Harris film. The most notable difference between the two is that one uses the naturalistic camera of the western, this a more abstract one. But as commonplace in its use as the other was then."

However, if you regularly spend time outside or go on vacation a lot, I reckon nothing beats reality and this movie will show you little new.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is its story, which is non existent. While you may argue that about half an hour of the movie is action packed and fun to watch, the overall quality of the plot is just not there. The plot is predictable and to me there was too little time to identify with the characters and feel for them. On a side note: Leo did a great job (as did Tom Hardy) but this is not the type of movie that allows you to win an Oscar for acting.<br/><br/>In conclusion: match your expectations if you want to go see this movie.

"MattBirk","9","15","38","8 January 2016"," A Story so Intense that it would make Bear Gyrlls' Compassionate!
","The Revenant may be marketed as a revenge-thriller, but it's really about Hugh Glass (Leo) vs nature. Nearly the entire movie is about Glass battling Mother Earth and struggling to survive the night. And I gotta say it was both breathtaking and stressful. Day after day seeing him struggle with simple tasks and knowing the insane journey he has in front of him is taxing. The amount of punishment the man goes through is enough to make Bear Grylls compassionate.<br/><br/>Some people might try to water this one down and say it is nothing more than a revenge flick. That may be true to some extent, but it is more to the movie than just that. It's a man vs nature and his struggle to survive for one last cause (that cause obviously being revenge). There is also a message about white men vs Indians that can't be ignored. It's something we have seen before, yes, but it doesn't make it any less sorrowful or profound.<br/><br/>The middle of the film does get a tad repetitive as we watch Leo struggle for shelter and fight the cold again and again. This would be a major drawback if the movie didn't look this beautiful (fingers crossed for a Best Cinematography Oscar). The location mixed with the camera work seems to make the cold jump off screen. The movie might not have hundreds of characters, large-scale battles, or fantasy-like elements, but this truly is an epic.<br/><br/>I can see how a lot of people might be turned off by the movie (a huge chunk of the movie his Glass literally wandering the wilderness day and night), I still stand by my statement that it's one of the year's best and deserves to be seen on the big screen!"

","One problem I've had with Hollywood movies is that they constantly look the same . Primary colours to the fore while action scenes are overly edited and other intensified continuity technique to the point you're watching a MTV trailer rather than a action sequence . Add to this just about every film nowadays must feature Tom Hardy and you're in danger of exclaiming ""If you've seen one film in the 21st Century you've seen them all"" . On top of that THE REVENANT is directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu who made the overrated and painfully esoteric BIRDMAN from last year and this movie seemed like more typical Osccar bait material so I went in with low expectations and came out pleasantly surprised <br/><br/>!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! <br/><br/>Apologies for using the word ""pleasantly"" in the last paragraph because this isn't a pleasant film in anyway and this is in no way a criticism . If you're going to see THE REVENANT simply because it stars Leonardo PrettyBoy don't say you weren't warned because I'm warning you now . This is THE NAKED PREY for the 21st Century and whereas Cornell Wilde's film was slightly hamstrung as to what it could get away with in 1966 the studio system has moved on and not much is held back . If you think four legged mammals are cute and shouldn't be used as a food source then again avoid this film like he plague because it'll give you nightmares . That said it was the bipeds of this movie that gave me nightmares<br/><br/>Mexican director Inarritu really does something special with this movie and makes a truly cinematic film . I've disliked his previous work but does something memorable here . The initial Indian attack is shocking probably because it doesn't contain the usual Hollywood hallmarks of close-ups and quick edits and is genuinely shocking . He also films a bear attack that had me falling out of my seat gasping ""How'd he do that ? "" because it looks like it was done in one take with a star actor , not a stuntman , being savaged by a real bear . Indeed I never got the sensation I was watching a bunch of actors appearing in a movie which is miraculous considering the big name prolific cast but real characters trying to survive the twin cruelties of the natural world and human nature . Also worthy of great praise is the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki which gives the scenes a cold , stark look perfectly capturing the environment it's set in . The editing by Stephen Mirrione shouldn't be overlooked either and several scenes feature characters finding themselves underwater but it's done so seamlessly like the bear attack it's easy to forget how much hard graft went in to realising these scenes <br/><br/>The film isn't without the occasional flaw . Inarritu overplays his hand sometimes and the art-house credentials are a bit overdone . Also because of the material of a solitary figure trapped in a hostile landscape the story does run out of steam a bit towards the end . There was also something else I noticed and that is Hugh Glass constantly has the ability to make fire . I'm guessing he has a piece of flint on him but surely the landscape is too cold and wet to find effective kindling material ? Whatever . But these are minor flaws . That said I do notice a lot of negative comments on this page and I wonder if the people making them are disappointed in what they got rather than what they thought they were getting ? As it stands I found THE REVENANT a brutal and compelling story of real life survival and have no shame in saying it's the most impressive film of the year so far . I expect it to sweep the board at this year's Oscars' and deservedly so"

","I cannot fathom how this awful movie won awards! Leonardo DiCaprio did his worst acting ever; the directing was horrid; and the scenery was dark and undefined throughout. Many parts were slow and drawn out to show ugly gray or white scenery or for reasons I could not ascertain. Tom Hardy said that God was a squirrel. The camera remained on him for about 30 seconds, as if he'd said something profound. A very obvious mistake the director made throughout was overlooking Leonardo's well manicured nails. He is in the wild for days/weeks. His beard grows, hair grows, lips get all nasty looking, yet those nails remain perfectly manicured. Okay, now imagine you are freezing and left to die in a grave with a little dirt thrown on you. What would you do first? Yes! You would try to find your son, but then you would build a fire! Instead, they show Leonardo throwing on his furs and marching off into the woods. All Leonardo did in the movie was grunt,groan, and make the same faces over and over. He had very few lines to say. However, when he should have absolutely screamed his lungs out, he made not even a grimace. That was when he was getting into the freezing water to keep from being seen by the Indians. With open cuts and freezing water, he should have had a huge facial and physical reaction, even if he didn't want them to hear him scream in pain. From there, this director has him seen floating along in the icy river longer than a human can survive without drowning from hypothermia. When Leonardo finally gets out of the water, he is not even shivering. My husband caught a part where Leonardo shot twice without reloading. I mean, was this director smoking crack the whole time this was being filmed?! And he and Leonardo got awards! It floors me. This movie didn't even make enough money to cover its budget! All this money and time spent on a movie and it is pitiful. A great movie about a sniper can't get an award, but they award this trash?! The actor Tom Hardy is the one who did the best acting. HE should have gotten the best actor award! Some of the other actors were good also. I will never go to another movie directed by this incompetent director. Elitests in Hollywood gave him an award, the film an award, and Leonardo an award. I'm the movie goer. Therefore, my decision is what counts. Only Tom Hardy would have received an award from me. If I could, I would take all 3 awards and give them to the sniper movie by Clint Eastwood, which was shamelessly blackballed by those same Hollywood elitists."

DiC. writhing around on the ground after first: being torn apart by a bear, (which was the only good part of the movie), secondly: beginning to heal, fourthly; after someone, (and I won't say who), gets knifed, and finally after he and his horse go riding over a cliff and he gets ejected into a tree. (Maybe the story could have been called JOB, Part II). Oh, and I forgot the audio sucked and it was difficult to understand what little was said. The bear scene was cool I'll admit, but what dope would stand around doing nothing after seeing baby bears running around? You gotta know WHO is around the corner and she ain't happy."

"hwoarangthedoorbell","9","6","12","18 January 2016"," Art Come to Life
","Alejandro González Iñárritu is on an absolute roll. For what is essentially the second year in a row, Iñárritu has put out arguably the most ambitious and well-crafted film of the entire year. The Revenant is art come to life in the form of a genre-bending survival/revenge epic.<br/><br/>First things first, I believe Leonardo DiCaprio has given the best performance I have seen out of him. While there isn't the humor or charm in his character that there was in The Wolf of Wall Street's Jordan Belfort, DiCaprio manages to make a turn against type as introverted bilingual woodsman Hugh Glass. While Leo has been known to turn on the charisma with his previous characters, he gives a more reserved performance in The Revenant and primarily uses physicality and body language to inform the audience of his Hugh Glass' state of being. It plays very well against the confrontational and loudmouthed antagonist that is Tom Hardy's John Fitzgerald.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, Tom Hardy is magnificent here as well. There's been a lot of talk about Hardy upstaging Leo in his own film, though I wouldn't go as far as that. Hardy gives a magnificent performance as Fitzgerald, but is given much more dialogue and traditional characterization than Leo's Glass. Other supporting actors such as Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson turn in terrific performances particularly in the second half of the film.<br/><br/>One of my favorite things about The Revenant is how it is shot. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki captures an impressive amount of beauty and detail utilizing only natural lighting throughout the course of the entire film. One of the best examples of this is the tracking shot of the opening assault on the camp (in particular where it begins to follow characters in combat). The Revenant might not be one of the best-shot films of the year, but one of the best-shot films in the last decade or so. Set to the backdrop of a haunting primal score by the impressive trio of Japanese musician Ryuichi Sakamoto, The National's Bryce Dessner, and German electronic musician Alva Noto, The Revenant is transformed into a feast for the eyes and ears.<br/><br/>The narrative of The Revenant is fairly straightforward, though it is delivered in the most interesting, raw, and violent ways possible. Much like a favorite film of mine from 2013, Lone Survivor, every bit of violence is felt because of how it is presented. Every gasp, cringe, and wince from the audience is well earned because it isn't too over-the-top and it isn't over-saturated like many action blockbusters tend to be.<br/><br/>I can't really think of too many negatives against The Revenant, however I can say that this is not a film for everybody. It's a brutal film that goes at a pretty slow pace, so those who were planning on watching this because they thought it was Leo vs. Bear like the trailers suggested, will probably be turned off. The Revenant is a film that also utilizes silent techniques and forces the viewer to look beyond what is being said. This works for some times and not for others. Personally, I feel as though the surrealist dream sequences are a bit unnecessary and break up the flow of what is essentially a fairly realistic take on a survival/revenge story. Though, seeing how much this film is able to do right, it is a rather small complaint that I have there. Overall, The Revenant is a film that deserves your attention. If you are not opposed to a more slow-paced style of storytelling and enjoy survival movies, The Revenant will be able to deliver in spades and then some."

","In the Eighteenth Century, in Louisiana, a group of fur hunters under the command of Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) is attacked by Arikara Indians and the few survivors escape by boat through the Mississippi. The experienced hunter Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), who knows the area since he was married with an Indian and lived with her in her tribe, feels that the Arikara are following the boat and tells that it is better off hiding the fur and walk along one week to their fort through the mountains. However Glass stumbles with a grizzly bear and is severely wounded before killing it. He is carried in a stretcher and the hunter John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) suggests killing him since he is near-death, but Henry offers an amount to the man that stays with him. Glass's Indian son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) and the teenager Bridger (Will Poulter) offer to stay and Fitzgerald, attracted by the award, also volunteers to stay. However he tries to kill Glass and stabs to death Hawk. When Bridger that was fishing returns, Fitzgerald lures him telling that twenty Arikara are coming and he does not know where Hawk is, forcing Bridger to leave Glass behind. Now Glass begins his dangerous journey of returning alone to the fort seeking revenge against Fitzgerald. <br/><br/>""The Revenant"" is an original, fascinating, brutal and realistic film with another great performance of Leonardo DiCaprio. Supported by wonderful landscapes and the music score of Ruiji Sakamoto, the viewer does not feel the 156 minutes running time in a perfect pace balancing drama and adventure. The scene of the struggle between Glass and the grizzly bear is impressively real and mesmerizing. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""O Regresso"" (""The Return"")"
"PWNYCNY","6","6","12","14 January 2016"," Fancy cinematography concealing a conventional story.
","What kind of movie is this? Under all the grim yet starkly beautiful exterior scenery, there is a conventional story. Although the story is set in the western US of the 1830s, which at the time was wilderness, the movie plays more like an action comic. The main character is indestructible and his nemesis, named Fitzgerald, played by Tom Hardy, comparably sinister (although far less intelligent). Nothing kills the main character, whose name is Glass, played by Leonardo De Caprio. He's shot, mauled, stabbed, starved, frozen, beaten, buried alive, caroms over waterfalls, and lives. And if that isn't enough, he is also cajoled, belittled, humiliated, and mocked without lapsing into despair. This is stretching literary license to the limit. It also takes away whatever suspense there may be as to how the story will end. If an enraged grizzly bear and aggressive Native Americans can't kill him, you know that the bad guy doesn't have a chance. It's just a matter of time. So, the ending of the movie is a foregone conclusion. De Caprio is good as Glass, the man with a mission. He is a metaphor for suffering and self-righteous anger. (Why he is angry will not be revealed here. For that, watch the movie.) This movie shows to what lengths a person will go to survive, at least according to Hollywood. The problem is: we know Glass is going to survive. Regarding Tom Hardy's performance as Fitzgerald, it's part John Wayne doing Rooster Cogburn, part Jeff Bridges doing Roy Pulsipher from R.I.P.D., with a dose of Foghorn Leghorn filling in the rest, except nastier and dumber (even dumber than Mr. Leghorn). There's no way that a dullard like Fitzgerald is going to fool anyone as to his nefarious purposes. He would have done better if he had just worn a sign saying ""I am a bad guy."" Now, the movie does offer some useful tips on how to survive in the wild. 1. According to the movie, if you happen to be stuck in the middle of nowhere with a dead horse, that horse could still save your life. To find out how, watch the movie. (hint: you must be familiar with a horse's internal anatomy) 2. Never shoot an enraged grizzly bear, stab it instead. (Apparently, for some reason, the movie maker believes that a bullet is less effective than a knife as a weapon.) 3. Never deny a Native American's request for a horse. It could lead to serious problems. (But problems can be avoided if you are willing to trade for a woman.) These are just a few of the many things this movie teaches on how to survive in the wild. Thus, the movie provides a useful public service."

","Okay, I liked Birdman, a simple story told complexly and imaginatively. But something was off here, no matter how well shot or how well acted, again, (Tom Hardy is world class). I get the idea of the biblical Revenant, a ghost, the unkillable, the undead, but it almost got funny, like a cartoon character who is constantly beaten up, stabbed, shot, mauled by a bear, and still doesn't die, or maybe dies but comes back as an avenging spirit, maybe doesn't know he's dead or? It was just too much and suffers in comparison with movies such as Jerimiah Johnson, Aguirre - the wrath of God, McCabe and Mrs. Miller. And the whole revenge thing is confused, the son getting killed after his wife is killed and he is mauled by a bear after they all escaped from a major attack!?!? And it was way too long, like Oscar contender long, no matter how beautiful the cinematography. And boy, his healing powers....or did he even need them if he wasn't alive, spooky/sloppy."
"westfield-john","6","6","12","10 January 2016"," Doesn't live up to its hype
","Despite the fact, that the ambiance and the amazing landscapes are once more breathtaking, I couldn't get the same feeling of warmth, as DiCaprio showed. Whether it was the stony and innutritive background of humping and drinking bearded men which don't bear any humanity for the sake of money, or the ever for blood pacing Indians. For me, there has been too much space in between these plot lines, ""The Revenant"" didn't came close to share any ideas or personality from any of its actors, perhaps just DiCaprio. Don't expect something like ""Dances with Wolves"" where this has been done brilliantly. It's a mere survival story, with bland interruptions of monotonous doing but reasonable actors, and breath taking nature shots. Well, for those who argue this could be the next Oscar, indeed, it is the next step in career for DiCaprio, who managed to perform through this whole movie without his money making lady-killer smile. OK, lets get a hot cup of chocolate with magic marshmallows, and review the scenery once more. maybe I will find some chunk of gold I did miss before. 6/10"

And yes he is, although I would like him to loose the mad max, and batman villain voice every once in a while.

"mukava991","Null","6","12","3 January 2016"," Inarritu in Winter
","Alejandro Inarritu has made gripping movies set in such places as Mexico, Tokyo, Morocco, Barcelona and Manhattan and now he conquers the Canadian Rockies and Tierra del Fuego (standing in for the U.S. Rockies) in winter with this tale of brute survival, loyalty to loved ones and humane principles and the limitations of revenge. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives another of his super-charged performances as a white fur trapper who, in the company of his half-breed son and other trappers hunts for a fur trading company in the years immediately following the Lewis and Clark Expeditions that jump started U.S. expansion west of the Mississippi. En route he runs afoul of an emotionally damaged and brutal fellow trapper (Tom Hardy) and encounters a sympathetic Indian who is looking for the killers of his family.<br/><br/>There are similarities in look, theme and situation to earlier Westerns (""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" ""The Searchers,"" ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller,"" ""Jeremiah Johnson,"" ""Dead Man"") and even an Eastern (""Dersu Uzala"") and a Mid-Eastern (""The Passion of the Christ""). The mostly male cast is appropriately grizzled, bearded, unkempt and squalid, with Hardy notably vanishing into grungy dishevelment with a dead-on Texas accent to boot.<br/><br/>Gore is everywhere from the earliest scenes, as is fantasy. It is impossible to believe that DiCaprio or any human being, no matter how fit, could survive the bear attack that sets the tone for the grueling survival narrative that follows. Further tests and trials are no more convincing, but DiCaprio gives it all his actorly oomph to make it seem believable. His struggle takes on a mythological quality after a while; you don't believe the literalness of it but you are carried by the spirit of it. Over the course of more than two hours he is repeatedly mangled, frozen, crushed, starved, drenched, sliced and punctured. He probably even dies for a while before emerging reborn from the bloody slit of a horse carcass he has gutted and into which he has crawled naked to keep from freezing after the animal and he fall off a cliff into a snow bank.<br/><br/>The sparsely swelling chords of Ryuichi Sakamoto's musical score complement the intensity and obsession of the journey."

","The terms ""immersive"" and ""visceral"" are often loosely used, but THE REVENANT has taken strong ownership of them, and all it takes is director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's sharp and creative directing and maestro cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's distinctive camera style and seamless edits that take us through the landscape, up close and personal. THE REVENANT is one of those films that will be talked about for generations to come, whether it be at a film school among students and experts or at a coffee shop among aficionados who've just seen one of the most incredible films ever.<br/><br/>The character Hugh Glass is a legend when it comes to the history of the frontier, these are the times before the things we often associate with wild wild west. Writer/director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and co-scribe Mark L. Smith take source from Michael Punke's novel but they put a fictional twist of their own on this actual historical character, played in the film by the great Leonardo DiCaprio. In this film, Hugh Glass has a mixed race son because he was once had native-American wife, Glass and his son join fur-trapping business that got attacked by the natives, one of the people in their expedition is John Fitzgerald, played by Tom Hardy. One day, Glass gets mauled by a bear and left for dead by his team members. Fitzgerald is one of the three staying behind to care for Glass and to give him a proper burial should he passes. But Fitzgerald kills Glass' son and takes off instead, an event which then motivates Glass to survive in his relentless pursuit of revenge.<br/><br/>Whether it be interior like ""Birdman"" or outdoors like ""The Revenant,"" Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a director who's committed to taking the audience to fully experience because he understands the wide range and the scale and he also fully understands the stories of these characters and he smartly conveys them to you. Yes, it's a primal existential survival story, yes it's also a revenge and redemption story, yes it's also father and son story, but the way Alejandro films it, the way he tells it, makes THE REVENANT more nuanced than that. And just like how this film manages to transport you to a land and time that's rarely tackled in cinema, it also successfully transports visual spectacle to a new height that's never before seen nor felt. The sequence in which Leonardo DiCaprio's Hugh Glass gets mauled by a bear, for example, it's as if you could feel Glass and the bear's breath. This is also why Lubezki is one of the greatest of all-time because his cinematography aims to make you feel like you're present there, you see the angles, the edges of the screen, everything about it is very welcoming, very inclusive.<br/><br/>This is Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance yet, one of the things that makes him a great actor is that he's clever in his rhythmical movement and facial expressions, he's on point, he knows how to make a scene more emotional or more intense, this is an actor who gives his all for his characters, and you see that dedication once again in THE REVENANT, working in toughest most uncomfortable conditions, he even strips down naked, Leo's devotion to this character, Hugh Glass, is admirable. Tom Hardy also gives an equally outstanding performance as the villain, Fitzgerald, who's only looking out for number one, what matters to Fitzgerald are himself and his ambitions, he doesn't have a problem with kicking integrity or honor to the curb if need be. And so when Hugh Glass ultimately gets in the way, it's kill or be killed mode for Fitzgerald and Hardy, with his sturdy intimidating stature, accomplishes that.<br/><br/>THE REVENANT is a beautifully shot film, much of it will remind you of the works of writer/director Terrence Malick, whom Emmanuel Lubezki collaborated with several times including ""The New World."" There's something majestic, something grand about THE REVENANT and at the same time, there's also something inspiring and hopeful about it. THE REVENANT is a work of art, a masterpiece."

","I am extremely surprised with the tepid reactions by so many on this sub. I absolutely loved this film, and I was expecting to react as many here have instead. Maybe this is because I love Lubezki and Malick and find this to almost be a Bizarro-Malickean film (I might make a post to expand on that later).<br/><br/>A lot can be said about the stunning cinematography, great performances, and moving score, but while those elements helped immerse me in the film and made it an entertaining two and a half hours (that felt more like just two to me), the film's themes are what really struck me. I've only been home for thirty minutes since seeing it this afternoon so bear with me.<br/><br/>There are the obvious themes about survival and revenge, but I also think the film explores other ideas through these main themes -- namely cooperation, selflessness, tribalism, destructive selfishness/greed in man (and its relation to tribalism/racism/etc), and others that I need to put a finger on still.<br/><br/>I think there's a reason that there are there are different nationalities and tribes present in the story (US, French, Pawnee, Arikara, Sioux in dialogue). I think there's a reason that neither are truly friendly to the other, with the Sioux killing Pawnees and the Americans not showing much compassion to the French (and vice versa and intermixed and so on). I think it was similarly purposeful that Glass has a half-Pawnee son, that he is assisted by the lone Pawnee man, that his rescuing of Powaqa ensures he does not suffer the same fate as Fitzgerald, and that the young boy (Bridge?) also survives to the end of the film. Imagery that I think also highlights these themes include the scene where the lone buffalo is abandoned by the group (similar to Glass) to be killed by a pack of wolves, Bridge feeding the lone surviving Native American woman, the scenes with Glass and the Pawnee man, and even the bear and her cubs relate to survival and a group dynamic.<br/><br/>This isn't the most articulate presentation to my impressions of the film, but these are the ideas that are swirling around in my head thirty minutes after seeing it."

Also there are some other themes than revenge dealt with in this film, such as native Americans, and the exploitation of their lands.<br/><br/>We're constantly introduced to stunning visuals of nature, wonderful single-take scenes, alternated with some singular dream sequences. <br/><br/>I remember that, when they adverstised the film, they constantly paragonated this to Tarkovskij films. After seeing the film, I can say that the influence can be spotted well. <br/><br/>The gore level is quite high, gratuitous and realistic. I feel like it's more gory every time I see it. I don't really like explicit violence depicted in films, but that's just necessary in this particular movie because of the story. <br/><br/>Speaking of casting, I feel it was perfectly done, and no one seemed in the wrong place. I'm not sure we can call this Leo's best portrayal, but he definitely acted well, together with his antagonist, Tom Hardy. The music wasn't a stroke of genius, but fitted in the film well, and added emotional layers to it.<br/><br/>Lastly, The Revenant is a great film, and soon made it to my personal top 10.

"eferrorfile","3","4","7","21 February 2016"," Over-hyped - too long for what it is
","I had really high expectations for this movie. I like Leo's movies and he's a great actor, but somehow this movie just wasn't that good. No idea why, but I couldn't help but feel like the crew wasn't 100 % present while making this. Really impressive scenery and a few nice, well executed scenes (the bear-scene was amazing!... That's about it. I need to say that Tom Hardy was a big disappointment this time - he kept mixing up his accents and was also a bit hard to hear properly, but that's probably intentional. In a movie that is this big, the accent-thing surprises and makes the whole thing seem unnecessary amateurish. <br/><br/>This movie really had the chance of being a true gem, but feels nothing else than a rip-off. I would like to get my money and wasted time back now, please."

","3 for the cinematography. 1 for the film itself. A big boring yawn of seen it all before. Basically 2 hours of dicaprio stumbling about in the snow and sucking his dirty fingers.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy, save from turning into Yosamite Sam toward the end with his over the top western frontiersman drawl, is great as the baddie. But the trailer shows all the best bits of the film. The bear attack is brutal. The dead horse (nick the idea from Star Wars) is interesting. But essentially its all the stuff that happens in-between that is the killer. Boring. Pretty but boring. By the end you just do not care if the the main character actually ploughs through his ordeal and gets his much justified revenge or not. You just want the film to end."

","So this is the big film that Leonardo DiCaprio is supposed to finally win an Oscar for, well, time will tell I guess but I don't think it's on of the best films I've seen him in and I'll happily not watch this again if I can help it. Not by any stretch of the imagination an awful film but it's loooooong, and not much happens for the bulk of the film. It's absolutely one of those films I had to watch but will happily never watch again. <br/><br/>DiCaprio is part of band of fur trappers, he has an Indian son (sorry, native American son). Much like ""Saving Private Ryan"" the opening of the film is rammed full of action. The fur trappers come under attack by a native American tribe (Indians). A lot of the fur trappers are killed, some escape - obviously the big names in the cast are the lucky ones; DiCaprio, Hardy, Poulter, Gleeson etc. After escaping the trappers need to head back to their base, unfortunately DiCaprio gets mauled by a grizzly bear and practically killed. It looks like DiCaprio is going to die (a vision we are treated to a lot in this film) so Hardy, Poulter and DiCaprio's son stay to stand watch with the plan to bury him when he passes away and then join the others heading back. Hardy decides to try and speed things up, he tries killing DiCaprio but the Indian son catches him at it and tries to stop which results in him actually being offed by Hardy instead (witnessed by a near dead DiCaprio). Hardy tells Poulter a few lies and convinces him to leave the body so they trundle off. At this point feel free to go make yourself a strong coffee or two, you'll need them and you won't miss much (unless you like trees). Alone and near death DiCaprio drags himself through the frozen wild frontier, he gets chased, shot at, followed, even falls off a cliff and sleeps in his horse (much like Luke Skywalker sleeping in a TaunTaun) on his adventure back home to seek revenge against Hardy for killing his son. There are a lot of flashbacks to try and make the audience feel something for DiCaprio but like the others in the film character development is missing and the flashbacks that there are don't serve to give the characters much depth. Equally there are a lot of long shots of nature and in particularly trees... lots of shots of trees: trees standing still, trees swaying, trees that are big, trees that are small, trees in the dark, trees in the light, trees with snow, some trees with leaves, trees, trees, trees. After each near death experience DiCaprio manages to find strength to continue like a rubbish superhero that just can't die. To cut a long story short he gets back to home base only to find that Hardy has cracked a near impossible safe, stolen a shed load of money from the captain of the trappers base and left to be rich south of the border somewhere warm. Rather than a whole troop of trappers hunting down Hardy to get their money back DiCaprio and Gleeson decide to go alone. They find Hardy, Gleeson dies and DiCaprio engages in a fight to the death with Hardy. The end, thank God for the credits. <br/><br/>The acting in the film is authentic enough although it does sound like Hardy has a mouthful of chewing tobacco inhibiting his speech, for the most part of the film he has the most lines while DiCaprio probably got paid per moan and groan. The pace of the film isn't great, maybe it's a conscious decision to be symbolic of the wide open spaces, but, maybe it's not and I'm just hoping there was a clever decision behind the long/wide shots of trees and more trees. Noticeably the film is dark, I don't mean dark like a good horror/slasher film, I mean dark like dirty and dimly lit. You could probably cut this film up and make a great action packed hour long feature but instead you'll have to sit through the best part of 3 hours of not much happening. It's a case of style over substance for a lot, and the style that stands out if the cinematography, maybe the cameraman should be the Oscar nominee rather than DiCaprio because some of the swooping shots are quite clever. I've mentioned that the opening of the film is like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Star Wars: Empire strikes back""; other comparisons I could make it ""Apocalypto"" as it's a constant journey (difference being I enjoyed watching that film more than once and despite the language barrier I understood what the characters were saying) and maybe ""I spit on your grave"" because DiCaprio is tortured constantly yet still manages to pull himself together to seek revenge (albeit he avoids being raped). <br/><br/>So, ratings, I'd struggle to give this more than 6 out of 10. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a film expert but I do have a qualification in film studies so can appreciate some of the work the crew have put into this. However I'm also no fool, this wasn't a fun vehicle for suspension of disbelief and I wasn't entertained and on the edge of my seat at any time - even the bear mauling could have been nastier. Thanks for the experience, but I've done it once and thankfully don't have to do it again. A long film does not always make a good film, I wish the bear had of being successful because then maybe I could have avoided watching trees swaying, trees standing still, tall trees and short trees, trees, trees, trees, trees."
"Rob_Taylor","6","4","7","8 February 2016"," A tale of revenge... done boringly.
","I left off reviewing this movie for some time. I wanted to mull over what I had seen and come to an understanding of what it was that bothered me about the film.<br/><br/>See, I liked the movie as I watched it. At least, for the first thirty minutes or so. However, once the revenge trail was well and truly set out upon, things started to go downhill.<br/><br/>At the end of that viewing, I was left in two minds as to how I felt about the movie and that was why I decide to wait until I had time to think things through before commenting on it.<br/><br/>Now that I've had that time, here are my thoughts: Firstly, everything about the movie screams quality. Quality acting, quality cinematography, quality effects and so on. If I had to make a film, I'd hire everyone involved in this one... with one exception.<br/><br/>The writer. Hugh Glass' tale is one of revenge, albeit heavily altered from the facts of the real Mr. Glass' exploits. So why then, did the writers see the need to push the survival element so hard? Sure, the tale of survival is astounding, but the heart of the movie is about revenge. That is what drives Glass on in the movie to overcome all obstacles placed in his way. Yet that revenge plays second fiddle to the ""man vs. the elements"" story that appears here.<br/><br/>What this means to the story is that there are altogether too many scenes of narrow escapes and ridiculous survivability going on. In fact, the movie is 90% this and little more.<br/><br/>What's that? The real Glass survived similar travails? Well, yes he did, in so much as no one story about him agrees on much of anything. Yet this isn't a factual account. It is cinema, and in cinema, we expect to be entertained. Incredible escapes are one thing, but when they verge into the ridiculous, they have gone too far.<br/><br/>Bear mauling...fine. Trek through hundreds of miles of frozen wilderness... fine. Wading and swimming through icy rivers in the winter and not getting hypothermia... wait, what? Riding a horse off a cliff and surviving the eighty foot drop with no broken bones... hang on a minute. Happening on a friendly native to help him... right. Rescuing a native woman from the French... huh? It goes on and on. The more you ponder it, the more ludicrous the whole thing becomes. Glass in this film isn't just a tough survivor, he's indestructible. He makes John McClane look like a pansy.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong, everything is done well enough to make you buy the tale at first glance. But it doesn't hold up to scrutiny. Everything is contrived. Actual survival elements are ignored when they aren't convenient to the plot, such as the lack of hypothermia. In other words, the more you think about it, the less coherent it is.<br/><br/>I don't think I'll watch The Revenant a second time. It isn't that kind of film. Unfortunately, it doesn't know what kind of film it wants to be either. It's one of those films you will watch and then forget within months. And when you catch it on regular TV in a few years time, you'll frown, then recognise it, make that ""Oh this thing!"" face, and promptly change the channel.<br/><br/>A lot of praise has been heaped on it for its technical merits, and rightly so. But story-wise, it is a mess. And, ultimately, shouldn't we be watching movies for the story, not how well they are made? <br/><br/>SUMMARY: Cinematic equivalent of ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" Looks fantastic, but ultimately fails due to excess in the story department - and not in a good way. Too much contrivance and coincidence. Plays the ""Look at me!"" card too often. A tale of revenge lost in the survival motif. Not as good as it thinks it is."
"luke-a-mcgowan","5","4","7","8 February 2016"," What an ordeal
","Oh thank God it's over.<br/><br/>Those were the words I uttered out loud when ""DIRECTED BY ALEJANDRO G. INARRITU"" mercifully appeared on screen at the conclusion of this 2.5 hour test of human endurance - and I'm talking about the audience as much as the fictional characters and real life crew. The Revenant is as much an ordeal to sit through at times as it must have been to live. So much of the film is ""LOOK! ACTING!"" and ""LOOK! CINEMATOGRAPHY!"" that nothing is ever enjoyable. Of all the films I've ever seen, The Revenant is the one I can say, 100%, that I will never watch again in my life.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio has done much better work than this. I never bought his relationship with his son. Hugh Glass is a near-zombified character that bears none of the energy of Billy Costigan, Jordan Belfort, Howard Hughes, Arnie Grape or Frank Abagnale. DiCaprio groans and mutters throughout the movie, sometimes spitting in the screen he's acting so hard. That's just it - DiCaprio is acting, and he's acting really well but he's not performing. I never bought him as a person for a moment. Compare the grief displayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor in 12 Years a Slave to the ""grief"" shown by DiCaprio here, and the soon to be Academy Award winner comes up drastically short.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is completely incomprehensible half the time as Fitzgerald, but gives a much better performance than DiCaprio does. His eyes seem to pierce the audience when he tells a story, and unlike Glass, he feels like a real person who might have existed. The film is infinitely more interesting when the film is following Hardy, Will Poulter or Domhnall Gleeson, the latter of whom gives a commanding performance as the group's captain. <br/><br/>The film's screenplay has its moments but for the most part there's not a lot of dialogue and that which exists just services the story and leaves the storytelling up to visuals. The cinematography is impressive, especially the gimmick that Lubezki found to justify his third Oscar in the use of natural light. There's some beautiful stuff to look at in The Revenant, even if 2 hours and 36 minutes is an awful lot to take in. At times I felt like I could have been watching The Lord of the Rings. Then I wished I was watching The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is for the most part very impressive. The bad visual effects stood out - fake CGI animals most notably. The bear was impressive even if the elks were not. There was some horrendous dubbing where Native American dialogue clearly does not match the movement of lips. I don't really think characters breath steaming up the camera creates any sense of authenticity. Costumes, production design and sound design are excellent, but the film's biggest coup is to the makeup artists who create some of the most gut-wrenching wounds I've ever seen in film. The editing is competent but there is a good twenty minutes of self-indulgent indigenous pretentiousness that could have been shaved from the film. I would have enjoyed a basic revenge story to the revenge story plus DiCaprio's stupid dream sequences.<br/><br/>If Alejandro walks home with his fourth and fifth Oscars to put beside the three he already has, I'll be incredibly disappointed in how shallow Hollywood is. The best way I can describe watching The Revenant is if I were judging a child's oral presentation where the child is so obsessed with giving the best performance he can that he starts to annoy me. By the end, I'm so overwhelmed with information and it has been so long, I just want it to be over. I can't fail him because he's done good work, but boy do I not want to reward him for it."

Someone is insane.<br/><br/>If someone wanted us to know what pain is, he should know the Middle Ages (this one too is in the Middle Ages) is full with pain, stupid people and bloody stories.<br/><br/>I think the Oscar should go to the bear in this movie, if insisting with bringing the movie to Oscar.<br/><br/>I watched today on Youtube some movies much better than this, so I'll tell you this: try to find something better to do with your time."

","Great picture, good direction by Inarritu, and two giants in the lead roles: Leonardo Di Caprio and Tom Hardy. But behind a formerly perfection there in no heart in this movie. Beautiful nature, rocky mountain, snow like in The Big Silence, but i can't live one real emotions, neither during the famous bear scene: the bear is incredible real, but so cold, as if Inarritu is more focused in achieving a perfect fight instead of an emotional fight. For this reason i found the movie a little boring due to it's long duration - 2 hours 36 minutes. My favorite scene is the final one (but i don't reveal what happen). Now i'm curious to see ""Man in the Wilderness"" (1971), the first movie about the adventure of Hugh Glass starring Richard Harris and John Huston."
"mysmartha-20265","10","4","7","1 February 2016"," A Visceral, Visual, Mystical Masterpiece
","I've seen The Revenant three times and intend to see it again. It's a flat-out masterpiece.<br/><br/>This film is widely misunderstood, in the way many great works have been. When I read comments like ""non-credible plot twists"" and ""boring,"" I remember that critics called Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 ""very wearying."" Missing the message, they called Hemingway's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, The Old Man and the Sea, ""boring."" They called Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby ""not too probable.""<br/><br/>If you're looking for a feel-good Hollywood movie that does your thinking for you, then no, this probably isn't your film. <br/><br/>If you're looking for philosophical depth, breathtaking cinematography, and cutting edge film making, go buy a ticket. <br/><br/>The Revenant is a classic hero's journey, and it's a shamanic one as well. DiCaprio's character, Hugh Glass, is ripped apart physically and mentally. Along the way he is healed and reborn. By his journey's end, he's transformed. <br/><br/>We all have our own bear to fight in life. We all have the choice to give up or go on. Ultimately, we all must examine our motives.

","""The Revenant"" is an adventure for revenge that is violent and crude but also so beautiful. Iñarritu invites the audience to let themselves be shaken and taken on a journey for survival, in one of the most spectacularly and beautifully filmed movies of recent years, with a breathtaking cinematography and scenery. Leonardo DiCaprio giving us, once again, a great performance and every time I watch his movies, I understand why I am one of his fans since way before ""Titanic"". The jokes about him never getting an Oscar, I think will stop this February. This movie has a really powerful story and although a bit overlong, is nonetheless a stunning achievement, and one of 2015's best movies."
"ellscashncarry","7","4","7","16 January 2016"," Technically great but lacks substance. Also, Hardy > DiCaprio???
","Given that virtually all the pre-awards hype since September has been about DiCaprio's performance and potential first Oscar, I'm going to split this review into two parts: DiCaprio & the film.<br/><br/>The film: A beautiful film with insanely good cinematography and camera-work, an excellent score and superb acting all round. From the films I've seen so far it should definitely win Best Cinematography. The scenery and backdrops are epic in scale and totally immersive. The camera-work also helps really place the viewer in the film and has some different and quirky ways of shooting which I definitely respected. The score (as with Bridge of Spies) is also excellent and matches the film perfectly. I'm very surprised it didn't get a nod for Best Score. Finally as mentioned, the acting across the board. Tom Hardy in particular is fantastic and absolutely nails his character. In fact I'd argue his is the most memorable character and best performance in the film. Whatever the case I'd certainly place him above Bale (The Big Short) and probably Rylance (Bridge of Spies) too, in terms of the films I've seen so far, and would love to see him win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>However... a film can't stand up on its sound, acting and cinematography alone. The story needs to be of a top calibre as well if you are to be considered for Best Picture. And it is here where I feel the film falls down a little bit. Don't get me wrong, I've given it a 7 and thought it was good. I certainly respect Iñárritu for what he's achieved. But did it blow me away? Was I wholly immersed and engaged in the story? Did I find myself empathising with the characters? Unfortunately the answer to all these questions is no. I can't really say I was gripped by the film, I thought it started well but actually got worse as it went on and by the end I find myself looking at my watch as it began to drag. Additionally there were a few scenes which got my back up... firstly on two occasions Iñárritu filmed scenes which I found myself thinking were totally unrealistic, which was odd given how expertly most of the scenes were shot and set out. one where French soldiers don't see what's happening to one of their men 20 feet away and in plain view... and the other where horseback native-Americans fail to shoot him from mere metres away. Additionally I thought the final scene felt a bit cliché and was far too 'James Bond' style for a film like this. It felt a bit obvious and a somewhat of a cop out.<br/><br/>So in summary, technically it's great but as a story, there's better. Iñárritu should certainly be considered for Best Director given what he's managed to achieve here but the film in my opinion should not win Best Picture.<br/><br/>DiCaprio: First off let me say that yes Leonardo Dicaprio should win an Oscar. Should he win one this year, for this performance however? I'm not so sure. Let's analyse what a performance worthy of Best Actor should be... The actor should create a memorable character, a character that stands out as the best thing in the film, they should put in a performance that has you mesmerised from start to finish. Take Eddie Redmayne last year... What he pulled off was nothing short of spectacular. He became Stephen Hawking... by the end of the film you forgot you were watching Eddie Redmayne as he had totally transformed himself, not only physically but mentally, verbally, in fact in everything he did in that performance. It was well and truly worthy of a Best Actor win. I wasn't too fussed about There Will be Blood as a film but Daniel Day-Lewis' performance and the character he created still lives in my memory even though the film itself has been long forgotten. Ask yourself, what's the first thing you think of when you think about The Dark Knight? It's Heath Ledger... that's how good his performance was!<br/><br/>Now going back to DiCaprio. Can those of you who've seen it really say he's the thing you will remember about the film in years to come? As I stated earlier, in my opinion it was Tom Hardy's character and portrayal that is the one which sticks out for me, not DiCaprio's. Don't get me wrong, he is excellent and doesn't put a foot wrong. But did it excel? Did it do what other actors haven't done this year? No. The film studio has spent lots of time and money hyping up his performance this year, long before the film had been seen. We were told how he'd slept in carcasses, been subject to extreme conditions and generally put through his paces. DiCaprio himself has told us that it's the hardest film he's ever had to make. But do these things mean he should win Best Actor? Just because your director makes you sleep in an animal carcass or subjects you to horrible conditions and filming hours, does not mean you yourself have done an incredible job with your character. It simply means your committed to your job and the role. I'm not saying I'd fancy it, I totally respect him for what he's done and he did an excellent job with the character, but realistically he spent a good 3/4 of the film crawling/walking and breathing heavily. I'm not convinced another actor wouldn't have played the character just as well. And for that reason I question whether he deserves an Oscar specifically for this role, despite how difficult it may have been to do. I honestly went into this, wanting it to be one of the best performances I've ever seen. But when you strip back all the hype and all the pre-awards material that's been pressed upon us and just judge the performance itself, I don't think it's a stand-out."
"mhmt_korkmaz","5","4","7","16 January 2016"," Remarkable scenes with an immortal protagonist
","If you can tolerate the exaggeration of the survival capacity of a human being, romantic dreams during extreme violence, unbreakable bones, non-infectious scars, ultimate resistance to hypothermia etc., then this movie could be watched as pastoral symphony of winter scenes. There are impressive wilderness shots like the struggle with the bear, buffalo herd with the wolves etc., but these are not very original and difficult with today's technology. Leonardo DiCaprio played better roles than this one and I think he has already deserved an Oscar. Art direction, sound mixing and editing are excellent. Photography is outstanding. Unnecessarily long and boring."
"blue2gnt","10","15","39","22 December 2015"," One of the most beautiful films about ugliness I have ever seen
","This is the best film of 2015 by about 200 miles, and the best frontier epic I've seen in 25 years. It isn't dissimilar to 1990's Dances With Wolves, but The Revenant is a story that actually happened (or close to it) and the minor liberties taken with the source all make sense when you read about the saga as it was documented, and are totally justified when you see the end result.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is having quite a year. Mad Max: Fury Road was the best film I had seen this year until this one came along, and despite how good he was as the lead/hero, his portrayal of a totally corruptible villain is far better, and is the best performance in the movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>Fortunately for DiCaprio, Hardy isn't competing with him as the lead actor here and while Hardy's performance is extremely dialog-driven, Leo's is the exact opposite. Within the first half-hour he's almost entirely lost the use of his voice and spends the remaining 2 hours illustrating that acting is as much about line delivery as about facial expression and body language.<br/><br/>A couple of the more minor casting and crewing decisions seemed strange when I first read about them, particularly Domnhall Gleeson in the role of the Army Captain and Ryuichi Sakamoto's appointment to create the score. I've never seen Gleeson play any masculine characters in a convincing fashion but he does it extremely well here, and although Sakamoto created two outstanding film scores for 'Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence' and 'The Last Emperor' they were both in the mid 1980's. He's worked with Inarritu before but this is his best work since he won the academy award in 1987 and the best film score I've heard all year. He had some assistance with this one, which seems to be a roadblock to his getting a nomination for this movie, which is a shame.<br/><br/>On the topic of awards, DiCaprio and Hardy certainly deserve their probable nominations, but I think The Revenant has a better chance at snagging the two sound design Oscars (particularly the one for sound mixing) and the award for best cinematography. The latter is, for me, the biggest lock of the year in a year where many will be rooting for DiCaprio as much during awards season as they do for his character in the film.<br/><br/>Emmanuel Lubezki has again delivered the most beautiful film of the year, and has included quite a few of his usual impressive camera tricks. Visually and thematically The Revenant evokes 2005's The New World, and in addition to the same amazing imagery he captured in that film, this one is a technical jaw-dropper. There are several long-take action scenes that owe as much of their impact to the visual effects and choreography teams as they do to Lubezki's camera but he's the one who brings it all together. To win the Oscar again would be his third win in a row and provide some tangible support for my feeling that he's the greatest film photographer in the world and possibly the best one ever. No one has won the award more than four times and the two men who did win four took an average fourteen nominations to get there. Lubezki has two wins from just seven nominations in a relatively short 32-year career behind the lens.<br/><br/>The Revenant is the type of movie that I had to take notes for because by the time the credits rolled I had forgotten at least a couple of the technical puzzle-pieces that combined to make it so great. Nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Makeup and Best Editing would all be deserved in addition to those mentioned above. I would not be surprised to see the film enter February with as many as 10 Oscar nominations. The combined efforts of about a half dozen of the most talented artists and technicians in the business are at play here. 10 out of 10 starts; one of the most beautiful films about ugliness you'll ever see."

We don't need to be told how to feel for it's a visual medium so let us get atmosphere first from the visuals.<br/><br/>The faces of the indigenous actors were wonderful and lent a note of authenticity and really the performances overall were very good. It was the survival of the central character which lacked credibility, not the acting (people die from hypothermia quite quickly when exposed to the elements yet our profoundly wounded and infected hero just keeps going!). Also the two 'wild' scenes made for exciting viewing (not specific as don't wish to spoil).<br/><br/>The plot is fine.

The grizzly bear scene was beyond the best animal attack scene ever. But more credit still needs to be given to the remake. The snowy winter scene with the rough water rapids was remarkable.

The movie was not very good, in a lot of ways rather boring. The bear scene gets all this rave but frankly, it really wasn't all that. The bear even looked kind of cgi. the story itself was a bit much to swallow. The guy might as well have been in the crucible with the beating he took. Then he makes this magical comeback in a matter of a few days. Tom hardy's character must have been too busy preparing for legend or something because his role simply was not very well done. Furthermore he always sounded like he had marbles in his mouth. with all the hype people tried to give this movie I was expecting much much much better. Maybe with less expectation it would have been more enjoyable. But given all the hype it was a huge let down. I would not pay to see this film, i do not recommend it to people i know. If you want to see tom hardy in a better movie go see Legend. This is not the next inception block buster movie."
"tynblu503","2","9","21","21 January 2016"," Boring
","I wanted this to be great - I should have known better, especially since it was nominated for an Oscar. The criteria theses days for an Oscar seems to be that the movie must be long (check) and boring (check). This certainly delivered. Don't waste your time or money. I saw this at an RPX so I am twice as upset since they charged an extra $7.50 (per person). It was sold out in two theater's so I had to wait until Sunday night. All I can say is don't believe the hype/Oscar buzz. I fell for it and I am sorely disappointed! I felt the same way about Kings Speech. I gave The Revenant a chance because Leo was in it and he's a great actor. That is why I gave it two stars instead of one."
"Genti22","10","21","61","25 December 2015"," One of the year's best
","The Revenant is one of the best movies as far as cinematography goes.The natural shots they were able to take are amazing and mesmerizing.The visuals are beyond perfect and that ""Bear scene"" is so great that it's hard to believe how they were able to do it.The movie is gritty and also intense while still being very interesting and gorgeously shot with top notch performances and directing. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of the best,if not the best performance of the year by a male in a leading role and I truly hope that this time he actually gets to win an Oscar for this.He's so committed to the role and it shows especially in some of the more brutal scenes. Tom Hardy also nails the role perfectly and gives almost an equally great performance as Leo.His voice is weird though but by now we're used to him having different voices on different roles,even though sometimes is hard to understand what he's saying. It does get brutal though and some of the things that the characters have to do to survive are beyond disgusting but reasonable and understandable for the situations they're in. The soundtrack is also very good but it's not what you take away from the movie the most,because the amazing cinematography and the style of the movie,the direction that Alejandro G.Iñárritu goes including here the two amazing performances of the leads are what you take away the most about this amazing cinematic achievement. At 153 minutes it is a bit too long but that doesn't take away from the movie that much because this still remains as one of the best movies of the year with some of the best performances,cinematography,visuals a really good score and memorable scenes that are bound to stick in your mind for a long time after."
"quick_connor","9","12","31","30 December 2015"," Unlike Anything I have Ever Seen!
","(No Spoilers Here)<br/><br/>Honestly I am astonished at the lower ratings this film is getting, are you kidding me! Right off the bat in the beginning I could tell this film was going to be something special. <br/><br/>First off the Direction from Alejandro González Iñárritu, and cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki is some of the greatest film work I have ever seen! The way the camera moves throughout the film is unparalleled. The feeling immerses you into the film that uses nature as its main star. Definitely see The Birdman duo getting a 2nd straight Oscar nod this year!<br/><br/>As for the acting, yes everyone asking will this film finally get Leo his first Oscar? I can honestly say for now yes! The reason I say for now, is because there is still a few months up to the Oscars and I am sure more films will arise as contenders, but for the time now, I personally haven't seen a performance that betters Leo's Hugh Glass for The Revenant this year. What he offers in this film is shear acting! If there is a better performance for an actor this year, please by all means tell me, because this will be hard to top people!<br/><br/>That being said I believe there will be another actor nominated for his performance in this film as well. Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald, Tom was superb as the frontiersman and in my opinion definitely deserves a nod. <br/><br/>The plot is a pretty straight forward revenge story, but never the less the amazing acting, direction, camera work, and natural capture of a extreme cold wasteland will immerse the viewer into a film I think is unlike anything ever seen<br/><br/>I give this film a 9/10 and as always enjoy the show!"
"metalfreak19","9","5","10","20 January 2016"," Haters only have one argument:
","""This film is boring because he is crawling around and grunting for 3 hours. But the cinematography is good, tho."" <br/><br/>Geez. Go back to your over-hyped cookie cutter Hollywood bullshit with lots of unrealistic action scenes and childish jokes. Yes, this movie is slow, and there isn't much of a story going on. Yes, the most part of Leonardo DiCaprio's acting is crawling on the ground and grunting. And yes, the cinematography is outstanding.<br/><br/>The point of this film is showing the struggle the protagonist has to go through to get his revenge, and I think the movie delivered this point in a brilliant way. Your lack of patience doesn't make a movie bad. But that seems to be the crowd nowadays. They want a 90 minute cliché film with a lot of action, boobs, funny lines and a ""mind-blowing"" plot twist at the end.<br/><br/>Also, saying that DiCaprio was only crawling and grunting shows that you people have no idea about acting. He didn't talk much, and that makes this character even harder to portray: with facial expressions. I'm not saying the performance was Oscar-worthy, but it was very good. And the other actors, especially Tom Hardy, did a great job, too.<br/><br/>This film is very much about atmosphere. And I'm not only talking about the filming locations, camera work and editing, you also need some empathy to feel what Hugh Glass must have felt. That's what makes the movie interesting and also suspenseful. Yes, I thought that movie was very suspenseful, believe it or not.<br/><br/>Next thing is, of course, the camera work. The amount of absolutely outstanding one shot scenes is amazing and shows the high professionalism of the cast and crew. Did you guys even notice that the whole battle scene at the beginning was ONE SINGLE SHOT? And also every other scene in the movie lasted very long. You feel like you're in the middle of it all. I know this is not new, but they do this on such a high level here, it's amazing.<br/><br/>I know this ""review"" reads more like a defense of the movie, but I couldn't keep this to me after reading all the ""opinions"". If you don't like slow movies, it's OK. But don't say a movie is bad or boring just because it's slow. Assuming that being slow makes a movie bad, ""Dead Man"" and ""Only Lovers Left Alive"" by Jim Jarmush are also bad movies, right?"
"benjipad","9","5","10","8 January 2016"," Hugh Glass endures the brutal reality of nature
","The Revenant is, to say the least, a visually stunning journey of survival, deception, and Fatherhood. Directed by Academy Award Winner Alejandro G. Innarritu, the film follows Hugh Glass (played by Nominee Leonard DiCaprio), who after a brutal encounter with a bear, is left for dead by John Fitzgerald (played by nominee Tom Hardy), and depicts the grueling reality of nature that Glass must endure, in order to avenge both his son's death and his deception. Inarritu incorporates many of the elements of his previous films, such as making the scenes appear to be taken in one shot and telling different stories while overlaying them, to make one main story, which are seen in films like Birdman and Babel, and allows his direction to shine, in order to make a beautiful film. DiCaprio gives a shocking performance, in the way that he rarely speaks and if he does, it is in a different language, proving that actions speak louder than words. Along with STUNNING cinematography, The Revenant is a powerful film that is truly beautiful and given the harsh conditions that the film was shot in, and the fact that the only lighting used was all natural, makes this film on the best of the year, 9 out of 10 stars."
"nezar-nael","8","5","10","8 January 2016"," A Visual Masterpiece
","The Revenent is the second film I've watched this year, and I must say, what a great start! <br/><br/>From the second the wide landscape footage of shimmering water appeared into the cinema screen, I knew this movie was going to be extraordinary. The cinematography is unbelievably beautiful, the actors (Dicaprio, Hardy, etc.) played an insanely amazing performance, and the directorial cuts were inexpressibly good. Wouldn't be surprised if Iñárritu won director of the year another year round. <br/><br/>While exploring the uncharted wilderness in the 1800s, legendary frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) sustains injuries from a brutal bear attack. When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home to his beloved family. Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry terrain to track down John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), the former confidant who betrayed and abandoned him.<br/><br/>One feature that brought this film to my liking was the sense of realism. The film was so immersive that you connect with the characters that most need help and you grind your teeth and clench your fists with the characters that deserve the savage taste of revenge.<br/><br/>When the snow falls and the blizzard resolutes the gloomy-like forest, we all start to shiver. When the blood-thirsty tribes kill with the most unlikely of weapons we squint our eyes and squeal in revolt.<br/><br/>This film has it all. The love. The hate. The remorse. The repulse. The pain. The revival. A great cinematic beginning of the brand new year of 2016. Enjoy it and don't miss out."
"MrSelfPaid","9","10","25","24 December 2015"," Beautifully shot, brilliantly acted, carefully directed movie.
","To start with, a movie like this should be viewed multiple times to understand and absorb the little details the director tries to reveal. Every landscape shot, every breath exhaled, every bite taken, is all done in such a way that it flows like poetry.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly simple, but it is the journey our hero has to undergo to seek redemption that grabs the viewers attention and demands all of it. <br/><br/>The acting is almost perfect. The question is, what does DiCaprio has to do to get an Oscar? <br/><br/>The director injects a little bit of mysticism in many scenes that have underlying themes that somehow relate to what the hero is going through.<br/><br/>The movie is two and a half hours long but the time flies by because the editing compliments the story.<br/><br/>Other aspects also help to make to make this movie great.<br/><br/>Go see it!"
"kennethdavis-1","2","13","35","10 January 2016"," Needs subtitles (but so do a lot of Americans.)
","Symptomatic of a lot of American movies of late, The Revenant's greatest disappointment is the inability to have speaking parts clearly audible. Indeed, some of the accents employed are so thick I think they spent a lot of time with their mouths full of cotton wool. The character, Fitzgerald, was so bad I didn't understand a word he said.<br/><br/>I may buy this movie off the reject pile at the DVD store but don't expect me to see it again on the big screen.<br/><br/>Visually the scenery is fantastic and highlights the somber mood of the story, a few bright days serve even more to emphasize the darkness.<br/><br/>In fact I was so disappointed I walked out. DiCaprio may be worthy of an Oscar, this movie as whole should not be nominated."
"abisio","10","13","35","29 December 2015"," The most spectacular move of the year (and no FX)
","I am not a fan Iñárritu; but I concede I saw all his directed movies since AMORES PERROS. I went to THE REVENAT with doubts; mostly because having seen the original about 40 years ago, still remember it as boring and depressing. However; when I saw this version trailer; the images were so amazing that I felt the urge to see it. Well, I was not disappointed at all. <br/><br/>The story is pretty much the same but told in much more bearable way (the original Richard Harris spent 90% of the movie alone). But are the images and effects that stand out; created by using wide angle lenses on close ups and moving the camera on 360 degrees; creating immersive images that easily transmit to other senses. You feel the cold, the water and the suffering. <br/><br/>If Iñárritu tried to demostrate that nature is the greatest and most spectacular (and dangerous) thing in this world; he succeed. The digitally created THE FORCE AWAKENS should hide ashamed of what has been achieved with a camera and some lenses. <br/><br/>Just the Indians or the Bear attacks; completely compensates the price of the ticket; but there is more from where that came from in this incredible movie. <br/><br/>The acting is superb. It required very humble and committed actors to accept these roles. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy is terrifying in a character that pure selfishness and not allow a hint of sympathy. Di Caprio in his most physical interpretation until today is outstanding. You are able to feel his pain and suffering. <br/><br/>In brief; if you want to see the most spectacular images or the most terrifying fight man vs nature. Just go and see this movie."
"Seraphion","7","8","19","24 December 2015"," A great gem for the eyes to see
","Hugh Glass is a military scout. With his Indian half-breed son Hawk, he serve in with John Fitzgerald, and Jim Bridger under Commander Andrew Henry, tasked to hunt animal pelts. They have to face both the Indians and the French. While hunting, Glass returns back to camp after hearing a commotion when the Indians attack. They flee to the river as the attack kills 33 men. Fitzgerald suggest a route but Glass suggest an opposite route. Henry listens to Glass and they rest for the night. At first light Glass goes ahead first as Hawk remains with the company. But Glass enters a Grizzly bear's domain and gets attacked viciously. He manages to kill the beast, but his throat is injured badly, making him unable to speak. The company finds him and carries him. Fitzgerald suggests to leave Glass as apparently they can't save him. Eventually Henry gives up, but he insists that Glass die naturally, promising money for three men who stay with Glass. Hawk and Bridger volunteer, and surprisingly so did Fitzgerald.<br/><br/>But Fitzgerald gets impatient, offering Glass a quick death if he just blinks. Glass closes his eyes for some time, and when he opens them Fitzgerald considers it as blinking then tries to kill him. Hawk catches Fitzgerald and the two struggle, but eventually Fitzgerald kills Hawk. Bridger comes and Fitzgerald convince him to bury Glass alive in a shallow grave. He stops as Glass is neck deep. Glass crawls out of his grave, surviving on eating bits and pieces until he can stand again. Able to walk, Glass meets an Indian man carving meat from a dead beast. Glass begs for some and the man gives, but he faints after eating. The Indian is actually pursuing his daughter Powaqa's kidnappers. He helps Glass after he explains his ordeal. The man builds Glass a makeshift shelter when they face a blizzard. When Glass wakes up the man has gone. Glass finds a French trappers' camp, and waits until nightfall then readies to steal a horse. A French man brings an Indian girl and rapes her near Glass. He rescues the girl and they escape on a stolen horse, but Glass dropped the flask Bridger left him.<br/><br/>The girl leaves Glass and The French pursuers catches up on him, so he runs off of a cliff, killing his horse. As another blizzard looms, Glass removes the horse's entrails and use the carcass as a cocoon. One of the French wanders into Henry's fort, bringing the Bridger's flask. Henry wonders if it's the missing Hawk, so they set out to find him. They instead find Glass himself. Henry rides back ahead but Fitzgerald had already gone with the company's money. Glass reveals the truth, asking supplies to hunt Fitzgerald. Henry goes with him. As Glass spots a camp's smoke in the wilderness, he and Henry check it out from opposite directions. But Henry meets Fitzgerald, who then kills him. Glass finds the body and uses it to lure Fitzgerald out. He succeeds and they fight a bloody melee. Glass finally has the upper hand and readies his killing blow. But he spots a band of Indians up the river and remembers the words of the previous Indian man that revenge is in God's hands, and he lets Fitzgerald floats on the current to them, who kills him.<br/><br/>Another great movie this month, The Revenant (2015) is full of great work in acting, directing and effects. The story is like other revenge movies, although I don't think the movie was clear enough at it. There's a lot of unnecessary footage if we see it story-wise. There are quite a lot of other story elements which are not concluded in the end.<br/><br/>But I must say again that the movie is a gem technical-wise. It's a beautiful sight to see. Inarritu was very kind in supplying us with another trick up his sleeve. Here you see a lot of mind bending close up shots of crazy stunts. They are enabled by the help of moving camera and impeccable timing execution that lets it require less editing.<br/><br/>There are many moments where the movie builds up suspense with the camera closing up on the actors, pans away, rotates to view the surroundings, and suddenly we have them getting shot at point blank. The special effects are done well that the stunts achieved their intended effect. Many times I was left behind as I was wondering how did they rigged the stunt that just happened when suddenly the movie just shoves another crazy stunt in my face.<br/><br/>The cinematography is great. Emmanuel Lubezki is really looking like he's aiming for another Oscar. Aside from the great job on the main story elements, there are also very pretty photography in this movie. Lubezki did a great job in capturing the spirit of the location to insert into the movie.<br/><br/>The acting overall is just superb. Leonardo DiCaprio did great in handling the dominant focus his character has as the entire movie mostly centers on Glass. Tom Hardy managed to bend himself into yet another believable character, despite the original reasoning of his apathy to Glass' ordeal remains unclear. Domnhall Gleeson's star is clearly rising steadily, as he secured roles in three acclaimed movie this year so far; here, Star Wars Episode VII, and Ex Machina. Will Poulter nicely adds depth to the whole story, as with the native American cast.<br/><br/>For me The Revenant (2015) deserves a 7 out of 10 score. It would have been more enjoyable for the ordinary people if there's less duration that only contains silence. I did enjoy the movie though, yet I don't think many other ordinary people will too."
"jtindahouse","6","8","19","23 December 2015"," Beautiful but not for everyone
","Alejandro González Iñárritu who directed last year's Best Picture winner 'Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)' has returned with his next film 'The Revenant'. The films couldn't be further apart in nature. I remember saying when I reviewed the former film that it wasn't going to be for everyone, and despite the films being worlds apart, this fact remains the same. 'The Revenant' is a beautiful film to look at, but it's a tough film to sit through. There's a pretty amazing true story being told here, but it's being told in such a slow, drawn out way that it lost a lot of impact for me. <br/><br/>The buzz around town is that the time may finally have come for Leonardo DiCaprio to get an Oscar for his performance in 'The Revenant'. Personally I would be disappointed if this turns out to be the case. Don't get me wrong he delivers a very fine performance here. But of all the charismatic, layered performances he's given over the years, this was not his best work. People will justify it saying the filming conditions were immensely tough and that he put in the hard yards for the role, however the I believe any actor given this role could have come up with a very similar performance. There was nothing DiCaprio did here that no one else in the business could have pulled off. That hasn't been the case in other roles he's nailed.<br/><br/>Be prepared going in to 'The Revenant'. Be prepared to be very patient. It's a long film with not a lot happening for the most part of it. The flaw for me was how much time was given to each aspect of the story. The survival aspect takes up 95% of the time, which granted was a great way to show just how harrowing of an experience it would truly have been and the determination it would have taken, and the ""revenge"" aspect is just rushed in at the end almost as an afterthought. For mine the ratio needed to be closer to 80-20% for the sake of an audience who are demanding a more satisfactory ending."
"jordan2240","7","7","16","9 January 2016"," Spectacular, yet spectacularly slow
","The visuals in this film are stunning, and it absolutely draws you into the atmosphere. I can't imagine what all involved went through to capture some of these scenes. It deserves to be seen on the big screen, and, perhaps, is the only way it will really be appreciated since the cinematography is really the star here. What action there is is spectacular, but the film moves along at an extremely slow pace. In one scene where characters were sleeping, I heard snoring, which seemed rather appropriate. However, when I continued to hear the same snoring during other scenes, I realized one of the patrons near me had fallen asleep (and slept through most of the film). A man sitting next to me also spent a large amount of viewing time with his chin on his chest. I personally fought off sleep a time or two as well, but never succumbed.<br/><br/>In short, the filmmaking itself is a spectacle to behold, and the special effects are fantastic, but this isn't an action epic, so I'd suggest not going to the theater tired. Oh, and I'd also suggest eating BEFORE you see this, because you might not have much appetite afterward. Reasons will become evident if you see the film."

The set pieces look amazing but also gives you a good picture on how cold and desolate this place really is that there all struggling thru.<br/><br/>It goes from bad to worse when the main character gets attacked by a bear and is severely wounded by that. While to sick to move he witnesses his son getting killed over racial differences and he himself is left for death.<br/><br/>Barely recovered he goes after the killer and will do anything to survive so he can avenge his son's death. Writing it down like this it seems very ""black and white"" but there are a lot of Grey areas but they are more subtle like in facial expressions or things not said.<br/><br/>I got in to the movie pretty fast and was somewhat surprised it has a 2 and a half hour running time because the time just flew by.<br/><br/>Highly recommend it.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it,go watch it now.<br/><br/>An awesome western/adventure."
"westyrcp","2","3","5","20 December 2018"," Very Questionable
","Historically extraordinarily inaccurate - it is honestly not representative of the real Hugh Glass, the mountain men and the Indians. Even the landscapes are inaccurate based on where the real Hugh Glass was. As an fictional action-adventure piece for the masses I think it does pretty well even though it stretches incredibility to impossibility in many of the scenes.<br/><br/>My greatest worry is it sets up for the next generation silly Indian/trapper stereotypes. For example, the depiction of mountain men and/or trappers as being totally helpless and defenseless in the great outdoors - nothing could be further from the truth. A muzzle loading single shot hand gun cannot be fired several times in rapid succession from horseback. And in that era the Indians never attacked a trapper camp of that size - they didn't have the manpower and they couldn't afford the casualties. Otherwise -- enjoy the movie."

","By they, I mean the producers. Many things have been said about the flaws and the triumphs of this film.<br/><br/>Like many contemporary films the actors are unable to convincingly portray the period they are set in. Films like Fury, Ain't Them Bodies Saints, and this film has acting which fails to account for the times in which they are set.<br/><br/>The manner of speaking, the worldview, their reason, and their nature is still in the 21st century and it's very distracting to a viewer who knows better.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy's character is terrible. (And I like Tom Hardy) He sounds and acts like a man you would meet in rural Missouri today. The English isn't archaic enough across the board. That goes for all the actors.<br/><br/>Also, the little speech by the Indian discussing with the French how they've stolen so much land... This is South Dakota in the 1820s! Ok? There were barely any Indians much less European settlements out there. (Especially by the French!). It was large wide open territory with few people per sq acre. You could walk for days without seeing another living person! To this day barely anyone lives there! And the Indian nations that did exist we're still autonomous! In another scene, Tom Hardy talks about Texas Rangers! In the 1820s! Texas wasn't even independent yet!<br/><br/>Please, if they're going to make these kind of films they need to drop the pretense of the modern mind and not only take the time to learn about the setting, but the actors need to do some research into the speech, worldview, and culture of the times. This isn't camp. If they're going to try hard to make a serious film, hit all the marks."

","'The Revenant' to me is one of 2015's best films and deserved its hype, its critical acclaim justified. It is easy to understand why the audience reaction is more divided, but to me the low ratings are too harsh. The visuals, direction and acting are so brilliant that even if the film didn't impress me it still would have gotten no lower than a 4 or 5.<br/><br/>Its best assets are the visuals and direction. Simply put, 'The Revenant' is one of the best-looking films of the year and a thing of sheer beauty. The settings are rich in atmosphere and the lighting remarkably natural, but it's the cinematography that shines brightest, it's both intimate and immersive. Iñárritu's direction is even better than in his outstanding direction in 'Birdman', some of the best direction of the year.<br/><br/>Acting is marvellous, everybody showing great commitment. Leonardo Di Caprio got his only Oscar for his performance here and it was more than well deserved in one of his best films and performances, a performance of emotional intensity and honesty that is most agonisingly poignant. Tom Hardy excels in bringing brooding menace to his role, and Will Poulter is impressive too.<br/><br/>'The Revenant' has much more to it than those things. The action is brutally tense and the story, while deliberately paced and very simple, immerses the viewer in how gripping it is, being intense and emotional. The characters are strongly realised.<br/><br/>Film fares least in the script which is not bad at all but occasionally a little garbled. This is such a minor criticism however and not enough to bring down my rating.<br/><br/>In conclusion, brilliant film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

However, I am also giving this movie a ""5"" because I did not like it.<br/><br/>The opening scenes are exciting, but disjointed. Who are these people? Where are they? What are they doing there? Why do the Native Americans care? The bear attack is genuinely exciting and, for me, the highlight of the film. The problems is that there are two hours to go.<br/><br/>The film is dark. The sun surely shines under the Wyoming/Montana/Dakota sky, but rarely in this film. A lot of ""squinting"" is necessary.<br/><br/>The dream sequences are unnecessary and poorly edited. <br/><br/>There is some character development, but not much. Glass is obviously respected, but it isn't clear why. Fitzgerald's character seems to morph by the minute. The other characters simply pass through the scenes. And everyone looks like everyone else! It isn't clear why the Arikaras are so intent on capturing Glass. It isn't clear who, exactly, got back to Fort Kiowa. The intervention of the Pawnee who comes to Glass' aid strikes a positive note, but what does his brief involvement add to the film? And, who exactly were the Voyageurs and what were they doing there? And what did the sexual assault add to the movie? My biggest gripe is also my highest praise: The cinematography is magnificent but, oh so, languid! By the end of this long movie, I was numb. And bored.<br/><br/>Leonardo won the Oscar for his portrayal of Glass, but he has been better in a number of other films. But, there is no denying that he got into his role.<br/><br/>I bought the BluRay. I will watch it three or four more times, at full volume and with closed captions, to see if I can better understand it and appreciate it. I think, however, that it will take a ""director's cut"" to bring clarity to this film, if that is even possible, and it will take the patience of Job to sit through it."

","One of the worst movies I have ever saw. Complete boredom and pure stupidity.<br/><br/>Spoilers!!!!! Started off well, beautiful scene where Leo and his son out on a hunt and a river running through foggy trees. Then a nice battle scene with the Indians trying to take the trappers pelts. Then it went downhill from here into movie hell.<br/><br/>Hugh (Leo) then gets mauled by a female bear who has her cubs. Its winter Bears hibernate. Bear cubs come in the springtime, not winter. They usually are grown at winter time. After Hugh Glass kills the bear he falls down a hill where the dead 500 ilb bear falls on top of him. It doesn't kill him. DAMN the bad luck could have saved 2 hours of boredom.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy kills Leo's half American Indian son in front of him. Setting up the original plot, revenge. Then Leo gets buried alive, still survives. Goes floating down whitewater rapids after getting mauled by a bear. He has a bear skin on, Wouldn't it fill up with water an drown him. No of course not, be to logical for this completely stupid film. Damn the bad luck. Washes ashore completely wet and lights a fire. More stupidity. Once again damn the bad luck, he doesn't die from hypothermia.<br/><br/>At this point I lost all interest in Leo's character. He's obviously immortal and will get his revenge.<br/><br/>So the villain better be good. Tom Hardy was the villain. He tried to talk with a Texas accent. You couldn't understand him. He mumbled his lines. Horrible villain. Tom was just a stupid man trying to make a living stealing and killing whoever crossed him. Nothing interesting in his character either. He's also a rapist.<br/><br/>After Leo rides a horse off a cliff into a huge pine tree, he still survives. He got mauled by a bear earlier. Lives inside a gutted horse for a while the crawls and grunts his way to the Army barracks.<br/><br/>Inside the Army barracks is Tom Hardy. But Tom robs the barracks and only 2 people (Leo and the captain) look for him. Why wouldn't the whole barracks look for him? More stupidity from a stupid movie.<br/><br/>Finally a mauled Leo, who can barely walk, fights Tom. Wounds him and leaves him for some random Indians to kill him. Getting his revenge and this 2:30 minute bore-athon to finally end.<br/><br/>After the movie ended I stood up and said ""wow an overrated piece of garbage."" Everyone sitting by me agreed. Guess wasn't the only one bored by this dull movie. Surprise the director gave us Birdman, the worst movie ever to win best picture.<br/><br/>In real life Hugh Glass had no wife or children. He also got mauled in August and made it back to the barracks in early October. When bears get ready for their long nap.<br/><br/>2 stars due to the amazing cinematography. Amazing looking film. Just boring watching Leo grunt, crawl and sleep in the snow. Living when logic says he should be dead."

","Um, yeah, there is no way he could have survived that. Maybe, maybe he could have survived the first attack, but I don't think so. However, it was ""game over"" after the second attack... He would have needed a medi-vac and a level 1 trauma center immediately and he still would have died. Do the more positive reviewers realize there was no medical care, no antibiotics, no hospitals, way to do blood transfusions in the 19th century? What does it matter? He would have died then and there. Anyone with basic medical knowledge or who has watched a couple of Nat Geo docs on real bear attacks could see that. The antagonist was correct in his assessment of the situation, why demonize him? They had to have him kill the son I guess in order to make him a real bad guy because leaving Dicaprio behind was the right choice ... I don't even want to go on about this. I have seen some very excellent, very humorous reviews of how unbelievable and ludicrous this movie is. I'm glad Dicaprio got an Acedemy Award, but he should have gotten it for The Aviator or even Gangs of New York. For this, no. He had a better chance of surviving the sinking of the Titannic in 30 degree water for a day than surviving 45 minutes after that bear attack."

"bob the moo","Null","3","5","6 March 2016"," Handsomely made, compelling in its brutality, but narratively a bit too simple
","It is good to be wary around this time of year because with the Oscars and many other awards imminent, there is a tendency for studios to release 'worthy' films – many of them are really good too, but a lot of them are 'worthy'. It is hard to say which one The Revenant is, but it does certainly seem like a film where everyone went through a lot of physical hardship. I don't read around films much, so I'm guess on that, but the on-location shoot and freezing conditions seem too tangible for them not to have made the shoot a long and challenging one. If so then it paid off because this aspect of the film is by far the strongest element – the brutality, the fight for survival, and the contrast of these tiny people against the vastness of the landscape.<br/><br/>As such it is the technical delivery which is really the star. It is a consistently impressive and handsome film - whether it is the CGI bear of the opening 30 minutes, or cinematography which manages to have both nimble movement in/around the action as well as taking in the sweeping vistas as it reproduces the cold onto the screen. This aspect of the film carries it a long way, because for the most part this is a dialogue-free affair as Glass pulls himself from death to try and get revenge on another character. As a journey it is a tough slog and unfortunately it partly becomes that for the viewer too, because the film does have a slow pace and is essentially a slow crawl to its target. It does enough with the atmosphere to ensure the viewer is in the mindset where this works well, but it is not the type of film that one would throw on for a relaxing Friday night in. It is an odd feeling, but for me the time did not drag, and I was help by its single minded and consistent brutality, but at the same time it was not a story I felt gripped by in the detail of the character – more the overall experience.<br/><br/>The story does have the constant theme of parents and children. Of course this is the motivation for the revenge plot, but it is also behind the group of Native Americans who are also integral in the film; and of course the bear attack itself is a parent acting in defense of its cubs. This element is interesting but it doesn't always work. In the main plot it feels just like a plot device (which it is) and the floaty other-worldly connection to the dead wife doesn't chance that. The other father, hunting his daughter, doesn't bring a great deal to the film in terms of emotional content and, being honest, the only parent/child relationship that I really felt for was the bear cubs left behind by the death of their mother (I know, typical liberal watching people die but getting teary over the animals).<br/><br/>The cast match the sense of brutality, and they wear it well in their characters. DiCaprio of course gets the headlines, but others are just as strong and one could argue that Tom Hardy really gets the best of the film as he gets all the good lines, has the most tangible character, and where the film has standout scenes, he is mostly in them. The technical delivery is the overall star though, because it is a film that is handsome, very well made, and has a lot to like in the look, atmosphere and sound work throughout.<br/><br/>In this way it is more than worth a look, and it is compelling in what it does, even if at the same time it is not as strong in the characters and their stories as it is in the creation of this atmospheric struggle to survive."
"anteksw","9","3","5","22 February 2016"," A Visual Marvel
","It has been over a month since I saw this film at the cinema... and I'm certainly glad I had the chance to experience it on the big screen. The visuals are so strikingly captivating that they stayed with me to this day - I wouldn't have a problem with saying that this is some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in film, especially if you take the natural lighting into consideration. If you're anything like me and you appreciate innovative camera work, you'll be amazed with the shots they managed to capture in 'The Revenant'. But besides being a visual marvel, does the film succeed in being a compelling tale like Iñárritu's previous works?<br/><br/>Well, yes, it does... to an extent. We follow Hugh Glass on a harrowing journey as he fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead, and what we get is essentially a simple revenge story. This is one of those films that absolutely excels in some parts, yet barely delivers in others. After the amazing opening sequence and the terrifying bear attack which was just simply masterful, the film felt like it slowed down... and although I wasn't taken out of the story at any point, I definitely felt that there were some pacing issues. It's not by any means a ""boring"" film - as it crafts tension extremely well and feels consistent with it throughout, but with the addition of slightly pretentious dream sequences and a reliance on style over substance (or in this case, beautiful imagery over narrative) the film unfortunately starts to drag a little.<br/><br/>In regards to DiCaprio's performance, it was great as usual, but was it Oscar-worthy? This was a role that clearly relied on physicality rather than emotion - which is what I felt the character was lacking where it seemed necessary. If this performance wins Leo an Oscar it'll feel like it happened purely because the Academy believes it owes him one. Besides, Oscars don't define good acting, as many great actors have never won an Oscar... but I digress. Tom Hardy pulled off a decent job as usual, Domhnall Gleeson was absolutely fantastic despite his limited amount of screen time, and I was pleasantly surprised by Will Poulter's also small but memorable performance. All in all, I can't really complain about the performances, and despite a lack of emotion on DiCaprio's part, his energy and drive still kept me at the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>If I were to rate this film based purely on its visuals and cinematography, I would give it a perfect 10 out of 10. However, due to its flawed pacing and other minor negatives (such as out of sync dialogue) I cannot give 'The Revenant' a perfect score. Iñárritu decided to showcase physical brutality instead of emotional brutality he incorporated in his previous films such as 'Biutiful' or 'Birdman' - which I found to be more effective and far more emotionally powerful. That being said, 'The Revenant' is still an incredible achievement in filmmaking and provides one hell of a compelling journey. It is a simultaneously mesmerising and suspenseful piece of cinema that not only showcases breathtaking cinematography alongside a beautiful soundtrack, but also displays the dedication of one of the best directors working today."

","Well, well, well. I watched The Revenant on the recommendation of a friend who is usually spot on with his films. The film opens in great fashion, with an attack by the natives. The cinematography for this scene and the Bear attack was fantastic. The cast is extremely strong too, and the back drop is stunning a visually beautiful film, and that is where it ends. After the Bear attack,the film is one of the most boring films I have ever seen. If not for the above I would have given it 1/10. I have never seen such hype over such a bland film. There is no meaningful dialogue at any point of the film. There is no epic musical score, which a film like this craves, and worst of all, an extremely threadbare story. The Revenant is almost the abandoned love child of Wolverine and Last of the Mohicans. The entire film is extraordinarily unbelievable, with Glass being the man who can't die. If you want to watch two and a half hours of watching someone crawl around the floor, growl and dribble then head to your nearest city centre on a student night. It'll save you £25."
"greg-32117","3","3","5","15 February 2016"," Revenant = Empty shell
","I went to this movie with high hopes. The trailers looked awesome and, after such classics as Inception, I would see anything with Hardy and Di Caprio. I left at the end of the movie, though, terribly terribly disappointed.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; much of the movie is very strong: the sound design, the visuals, the strong sense of realism. As a travelogue for the wild mountains, it is superb.<br/><br/>However, when I enter a cinema to watch a movie, I enter a contract with the director: I will give you my attention, reactions and engagement if you give me the opportunities to engage. I therefore expect that a director will give me character development, mystery, surprise, plot development, unexpected twists or one of the basic (and ancient - decent story telling is not a modern thing) elements of good stories. Engage me, Mister Director! Give me a reason to care! Make me remember - and rave about and love! - your movie for years to come! Let me know that part of your craft is a desire to please the audience! However, Revenant gives me none of that. Apart from one delightful, terribly short - and brutally terminated - moment of humour, there is nothing in this movie to engage me. There are no human connections, no surprises with the plot, no character development, no suspense, nothing that asks me to care.<br/><br/>The characters remain flat and unchanging throughout and the end is obvious from early stages. The movie is a brutal, hyper-realistic and bleak exercise in portraying a series of events without ANY concern for the audience. It is, ultimately and sadly, tedious. It should really have finished after 1.5 hours, but dragged on for many dull minutes of Di Caprio being forced (by the director ultimately) into one life-threatening situation after another.<br/><br/>As a technical exercise, this movie is superb. As a human story, it is empty and without heart.<br/><br/>Avoid."

","It remains hard to believe that Leonardo DiCaprio has won an Oscar, as he is in Hollywood one of the few actors who year after year a ""risk having 'performance. For some he could get the statue as (The Departed, Catch Me If You Can), others are in terms of film less dividends despite its good role (The Aviator, The Great Gatsby). The fact is that he has no Oscar stand in his trophy case full, even if there may come with The Revenant finally change.<br/><br/>The film tells the (remarkably true) story of adventurer and fur trader Hugh Glass. The viewer is thrown directly into the action with a beautifully filmed battle scene between the traders and the indigenous population. Glass and what is left of his group managed to escape by boat, but that all the drama begins. After finding a place to go ashore to explore the Glass project. In the forest, however, he encounters an angry grizzly bear attacking him to protect her little ones. Glass gets injured while so that it does not appear that he will survive. A number of men, including John Fitzgerald, indicates that it will continue to Glass in exchange for a nice sum of money. Give too much of what happens next, would be a shame. Without giving much price comes down to Glass still is left and he should see a way back to employment through the rugged landscape, where danger of nature and man constantly lurks.<br/><br/>DiCaprio has after the attack the bear very little text in the film, since he can not talk his injuries. But he knows every feeling that Glass has his eyes and his grunts and groans make it clear. DiCaprio and his will to live are at the heart of the film. But Tom Hardy as Fitzgerald is almost as impressive. Hardy plays him thoroughly bad, but surely you can understand his motivation somewhere.<br/><br/>But the best of The Revenant is that the wonderful acting hand in hand with the images of nature that take your breath away and continued to emphasize the bar the circumstances in which Glass is located. To make this as to capture (everything was filmed in natural light), were cast and crew during the filming also through hell. But these difficulties were worth it, the end result proves. Few movies you know as to give it the feel of nature as Inarritu's The Revenant. Not only in acting terms, we are dealing here with a special film as just be little, in cinematic terms it really is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Review by FilmTotaal"

","The Revenant tells the story of Hugh Glass, a frontiersman who is mauled by a bear and then left for dead by his hunting team. Following this, Glass goes on a harrowing journey through the wilderness to find and take revenge upon the man who left him to die. The Revenant is not so much a film as a simulator. As Leonardo DiCaprio lives in the wild, we live in the wild alongside him. We remain fully engaged in his story and thanks to the stunning direction, every scene in involving and we are there with the characters ever step of the way. Want to know what it's like to live in the Alaskan wilderness? Look no further. As for DiCaprio, he needs that Oscar now. He doesn't say much throughout the film, yet he remains an emotionally devastating, engaging and fully believable force of nature through the entire movie, and as a physical performance it's truly astonishing. The Revenant is not an easy watch. It's brutal, hard hitting and unbearably intense. To add to that it's also a pretty sad movie as well. You may not enjoy it, but most will be moved by it.<br/><br/>It's not as good as Birdman, Alejandro González Iñárritu's last movie, since it's too long and at times is just a bit too much. It's not necessarily a film I'd be up for seeing again, but it's a monumental achievement. The lack of plot is effective and allows the film to focus on the hugely gut wrenching survival stuff while the themes of the movie are subtle, but they're definitely there. This is deep in some ways, but thankfully without shoving it down our throats. DiCaprio is backed by several other fine performances, but even with DiCaprio's amazing acting an argument could be made that Iñárritu is the star of the show alongside cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. With some of the most amazing cinematography of recent years, and some of the most consistently involving, mind numbingly intense direction of the year, The Revenant is a visual marvel. Overall, it's a really, really good film with many incredible moments. It's bleak, breath-taking, powerful, ferocious and harrowing. And that's just the bear attack scene.<br/><br/>9/10"
"dougmx","5","3","5","27 January 2016"," Boring
","I have to say that this movie was completely unoriginal and boring. There was nothing new with this film, and it had an incredibly shallow storyline. Don't get me wrong, the cinematography was gorgeous. That being said, if I wanted to see beautiful cinematography with no storyline I would watch Planet Earth, but in watching that I would also learn something about the world. There is nothing to learn from this film, and at the end of it you realize you never developed any emotional connection to a single character.<br/><br/>I have the utmost respect for Leonardo DiCaprio, and I truly believe that he is one of the best actors of our time. As always, his performance lives up to expectations. That being said, good acting doesn't make a movie good, let alone great, and this movie wasn't even good. <br/><br/>If you want to watch a revenge film with virtually no storyline, but with good acting and beautiful cinematography, then this is the film for you. If you want to watch a film that is so original and exciting that it draws you into another world then look elsewhere. I honestly wanted to like this film, but it was so cliché that...well just see for yourself. Go ahead and watch it, but don't have high expectations because you'll be disappointed."
"olivera-vrabac","5","3","5","26 January 2016"," Message of The Revenant? (Contains several spoilers throughout the text!)
","I finished watching this film with mixed feelings. I loved its mood and aesthetics and I cannot get it out of my mind. Yet I did not like the film itself and I will explain why in the following. <br/><br/>First of all, the most positively striking aspect of the film is its cinematography. Emmanuel Lubezki's style is so extraordinary and recognisable in other films as well, it is a whole different feeling to watch. On one hand it increases identification with the characters but it is also very smooth, flowing and takes you deeper into the action without you even noticing it at first. My favourite example is the vapour of breath on the camera. The other aspect I loved was sound, including music. The score turns certain scenes that lack emotion in image into a mood, a feeling itself, which is quite amazing as not many composers achieve this aim. Also sometimes you can faintly hear a tone, not a real melody and still that one tone causes extreme tension. Back to the sound itself, it is very visual and authentic, meaning you could watch many scenes, mostly the violent ones with your eyes shut and the sound would just perfectly tell you what is happening.<br/><br/>Whether that is a good thing or not is subjective. It may have been a means to create realism but then again - sometimes sound or image, but not both, is perfectly enough. Personally, I thought the violence in The Revenant was downright disgusting and even though it depicts the main character's suffering, it is just too much, too blatant, seemed too meant for the effect of luridness. (SPOILER:) E.g. taking shelter in a horse (!). I was probably just blind to that symbolism.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD: As so many people are expecting DiCaprio to get an Oscar for his performance in The Revenant, this being his fifth nomination, I was paying attention to that as well. DiCaprio has a very unlucky role here - it is at least the third time the character he is playing is having visions of a tragically deceased wife (Shutter Island, Inception, ...) - and the rest of the time his character, Glass, is dying and/or suffering. While he portrays that extraordinarily well, what I mean to say is, the character itself is rather stoic, not one that is ambiguous. He is fighting for his life, but where is the character development or dilemma etc?<br/><br/>The mood of the film itself is fascinating, as said earlier, supported by the score that is very faint at certain times and heavy in other scenes. The film is a constant shift between contemplation and violence, sometimes even intertwining. The probably most memorable scene depicting this is the one in which Glass (delirious) is standing in front of a devastated church, with its bell ringing from the wind; a piece of Christian culture, slowly taken over by nature with trees growing between the stones. There, he suddenly sees his deceased son who is slowly approaching him and then hugs him. Glass cries and in the next shot you see him hugging one of the trees. This scene enhances such an aesthetically beautiful balance between life and death, culture and nature, but also the tension of the setting, with the two cultures fighting each other, one built on Christianity and art, the other living in and with nature. The scene depicts grief and revives the symbolism of the tree stretching throughout the entire film - all in all, it had a very deep impact on me.<br/><br/>At last, I am trying to figure out what this film is trying to tell me. It depicts both mankind, both nature, in their ways; both can be very cruel and very kind. My concern is something Fitzgerald utters near the end - that Glass's journey, from the point he is left alone, is all about revenge. He has nothing to lose or to go for but to avenge the murder of his son. Yes, he does say in the end that it is not up to him to take revenge, but up to God. He does change his mind about killing Fitzgerald, as the Ree suddenly appear - a sign fate or God as Glass interprets it. But that does not justify the fact that he had put his own and the Captain's life at risk just to get revenge instead of 'putting it into God's hands' right from the start. Maybe this act of not killing Fitzgerald but letting him be killed might be seen as the character development I was so desperate to find, but it is still far from satisfactory. Assuming Glass defeats death and keeps going in order to seek revenge, this is a story of the weakness of man. There is no message in that, except that we are weak and affective.<br/><br/>In the end I was wondering if I might not simply be too young for this film, just having started university. Studying philosophy and film I would have expected to cope with it more easily, but found it very disturbing and unsatisfactory instead. It gives no answers. Perhaps it is not trying to, just telling a story. But then it would be telling a 2.5h tale of revenge and that, again, is not very full of meaning."

","Starting with ""Titanic"" in 1997, I grew up watching Leo's movies. He is a great actor; I hope no one denies that. This year marks his 6th Oscar nomination for Best Actor. But to say that he should win an Oscar for his portrayal of the bear-mauled hunter/fur trader Hugh Glass in ""The Revenant"" is an overstatement. <br/><br/>This is, after all, an award category for best acting, not for physical suffering. I applaud Leo's dedication - freezing in the cold, eating raw bison, sleeping inside an animal carcass - all of which was difficult even to watch. Leo's lines were minimal due to the fact that his character's throat got ripped open by the bear. His acting also lacked depth; besides a very strong will to survive, I did not see anything unforgettable.<br/><br/>Nominated for Best Supporting Actor, Tom Hardy, on the other hand, dominated the screen. Hardy's John Fitzgerald was not only believable but also relatable. Hardy, down to his facial expressions, gave us a flawed and vulnerable villain.<br/><br/>I'm not discrediting the movie all together. The film, aesthetically speaking, was very enjoyable. Director Alejandro Iñárritu insisted on filming in natural light with simultaneous sound recording, and production took 9 long months. I have to give major props to the entire cast and crew for surviving such harsh conditions.<br/><br/>I would rather Iñárritu win Best Director (but I'm really rooting for George Miller on this one) than having Leo win Best Actor. I know I am not of popular opinion this year. It was sad to watch him lose in 2015, but I want him to win one day for the best performance of his career, and this is not it."

By watching the film you will learn some survival techniques but really, is this what you want? There is walking and more walking with some gore (the highlights) in a bleak environment. Kudos to DiCaprio to have survived the filming in these conditions, but it wasn't deserving of a Golden Globe and certainly will not be deserving of an Oscar, although he will probably win it. The dialogue is non-existent, but grimaces of the painful experience seem to be what the film underlines. The film is way too long and quite boring. A DOWNER."

","A slow, struggling movie with a purifying taste. The sun comes in to the picture, rising when the killing starts. It was very deep but slow. The chilly atmosphere fits perfect for the screen, the harsh storms, the never ending snowfall, the dreams of the dead loved ones form part of the weight which the protagonist carries all the journey and after a while we also start feeling this burden and carry on with him. But in my opinion the film is too long and slow. By the end of the movie I have noticed that I merely forgot the scars the grizzly bear left on Glass and that bear attack was a crucial point in the picture because lead to the main injury, the issue why Glass could not protect his son, Hawk from Fitzgerald. If you love Leo D you must not miss this movie. Thank you for reading."

","The Revenant is based on true incidents. It is a rough hewn and visceral film of survival and revenge.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass a member of a fur trapping expedition escaping native Indians and who is viciously attacked by a grizzly bear. Gravely injured, a small party is left behind to care for him which includes his half Indian son and callous John Fitzgerald played by Tom Hardy who dislikes Glass and especially his son.<br/><br/>After some time Fitzgerald leaves Glass for dead and kills his son and goes off to rejoin the main party. Glass does not die and wants vengeance.<br/><br/>The film was shot in natural light and has wonderful cinematography, the CGI bear attack was very well done. Director Alejandro Iñárritu is on a high after his best Director Oscar win for Birdman last year.<br/><br/>However looking at this, I just felt it was a well made, sturdy but overwrought and lengthy revenge flick. In fact with a heavily male cast I regarded this film as a box office risk, one of the only major female characters that it does have is seen to be getting raped.<br/><br/>This is a gruelling picture of survival in harsh conditions but strangely empty despite the pained performances from DiCaprio and Hardy.<br/><br/>I actually found when Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) set out to apprehend Fitzgerald at the end rather laughable as it was so incompetently done. Not only was Fitzgerald allowed to escape from the fort as he was not guarded, nor was the money which was also stolen by him but he does not take a garrison with him when searching for Fitzgerald. It was a rather blunt attempt by the script to have a final fact to face showdown by the two protagonists."

The film is visually stunning. I don't think I have ever seen such a beautiful movie. The landscape, the scenery, everything was just perfect. However, that's about all. The storyline isn't great and in parts is extremely slow. Some scenes were just weird such as when Dicaprio's character sees his departed wife/lover floating above him and then has a conversation with her in a language we can't understand and there's no subtitles. Very strange. Another failure is the lack of hatred towards Tom Hardy's character. The whole film is about Leonardo Dicaprio's character seeking him out for revenge after Tom Hardy kills his son. The lack of hate means audiences don't really care enough if Dicaprio gets to have his revenge or not. Leonardo Dicaprio acting is very good despite the fact he hardly speaks, simply grunting most of the time. I think he'll win the Oscar but it's certainly not his best film. The bear scene is extremely well done and certainly is one of the best parts of the movie. Overall, I was disappointed."
"The-Sarkologist","6","3","5","16 January 2016"," Vengeance will be done
","I'm not really sure why I went and saw this film, or what to even expect. I guess the title attracted me a little, namely because it refers to a mythological undead creature who returns to enact revenge upon somebody. The idea is that the revenant has had such an injustice committed against it that it cannot rest in peace until that injustice has been rightened, and the injustice usually involves some sort of murder (either against the revenant or somebody close to it), and the vengeance usually involves the murder of the perpetrators of that injustice.<br/><br/>Basically that is what this movie is about, though the main character, Hugh Glass, isn't actually killed (but he comes pretty close to being in such a state). Basically he is a member of a fur trapping party that is attacked by native Americans (who are hunting the kidnappers of one of their daughters) and are forced to flee across the wilderness back to their home base. On the way Glass is attacked and mauled by a bear, but manages to survive – barely (and I must admit that the scene where we was being mauled by the bear was brilliant). However it becomes increasingly clear that it is going to be difficult, if not impossible, to get him back home, so they leave him with a couple of others until help arrives (or until he dies, whichever comes first). Mind you, one of the guys, Fitzgerald, isn't a big fan of Glass, so when the others have left, he kills Glass's son, and then buries Glass alive.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is basically Glass crawling his way across the frozen wilderness seeking to avenge the murder of his son. In fact the first half of the movie is the lead up to him being left for dead, and the rest of the movie is him (and the others) making their way back to the fort. To say that it does drag on a bit is an understatement. Okay, it doesn't drag on in the sense that it is boring, but it does feel that it probably could have been a lot shorter. Mind you, we are talking about a movie that goes on for about two hours, and I'm not sure how much of the movie was needed (though I suspect that the original idea could have been a lot longer). Still, I guess the length of the movie is supposed to give us the impression of how sparse and empty this wilderness is, and the amount of time that it actually takes to return to civilisation.<br/><br/>A part of me also felt that there may have been a couple of anachronisms. In fact for much of the movie I was trying to work out in which year it was set, and the reason that I was a little confused was because the Indians were seeking out some French fur traders (and these fur traders appear every so often). The odd thing I found is that the French had sold the Louisiana Territories to the United States in the early 19th Century, though I suspect that there were probably still a number of French fur trappers lurking around their afterwards (it is unlikely that all of the French living there packed up and went home as soon as Napoleon sold the territories to the United States).<br/><br/>In the end it was an okay movie. At times it felt like a western, though with most westerns the underlying theme is the idea of taming the west and bringing civilisation to the wilderness. In this film it is a battle against the wilderness and the wilds, but also the desire of one man to seek vengeance against the murder of his son. In a way he is over coming the harsh reality of the empty (and cold) wilderness to see vengeance done, to overcome the human limitations (we are always confronted with the reality that this is a cold and desolate place). The fact that he manages to survive the freezing climate to finally confront his enemy goes to show the length that some people will go to to seek vengeance."
"Lubezki","10","12","32","24 December 2015"," Deep-rooted, barbarous revenge tale aided by a staunch DiCaprio performance and breathtaking visuals
","It was just over a year ago that renowned Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu brought us ""Birdman"", a fantastic and audacious dark comedy that deserved every one of it's 4 Oscars which included Best Picture and Best Director. He's a filmmaker that has built up a reputation for being very nihilistic and bleak in his approach to his work, often leaving viewers feeling rather inhospitable. And whilst ""Birdman"" was a drastic and welcome change to his style, with ""The Revenant"" he has crafted a sprawling, violent and visceral epic that is an experience like no other.<br/><br/>The film is set in the 1820's and follows American frontiersman Hugh Glass who is mauled by a Grizzly Bear whilst hunting in the frigid, mountainous landscapes. Left for dead by his fellow hunters and witnessing his son killed by one of them, he embarks on an agonizing journey through treacherous winter conditions as he seeks revenge and justice.<br/><br/>The opening sequence sets the tone right from the off, as we're introduced to Glass through a stunning dream sequence in which his wife and son are present. Many familiar with Terrence Malick's work will immediately find semblance in the way a majority of scenes in the film are put forward; dainty close-ups projecting a wide array of human expression and emotions, and appreciation of the beautiful nature that surrounds them. Shot in pure natural light, cinematographer Emmanuel 'Chivo' Lubezki masterfully captures every facet of the awe-inspiring but harsh exterior which almost feels like a character of it's own. In a growing list of sublimely lensed films by Lubezki, this may be his most impressive and personal work to date.<br/><br/>DiCaprio has made no secret of the tribulations that he endured making this movie, going as far as to saying that he almost died a couple of times. And watching him as Hugh Glass, it's not hard to understand why it was such a difficult shoot but which I think will ultimately turn out to be very rewarding. He immerses himself fully into the role, whether it be crawling on rough terrain, relaying maximal anguish and pain or trying escape from the glacial waters, it's a role like nothing he has ever taken on before. It's the perfect example of a part that is dependent on the actor being able to transmit their character's identity to the audience in an almost 100% physical manner. DiCaprio embodies Glass with the utmost devotion and this may finally be his ticket to long awaited Oscar glory.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast also do very solid work. Tom Hardy's intuitive and fierce charisma jumps off the screen once again as an unhinged and villainous entity. His disheveled appearance also gave him an extra layer of cruelness. And Domhnall Gleeson, who's enjoyed a great year, ends it with another impressive turn as the stout Captain of the hunting troupe. <br/><br/>This is not a film for the faint-hearted; it's savage and austere. Yet amongst all of the brutality, one cannot ignore the lyrical visual splendor that is present in every frame. Iñárritu isn't afraid to show his spiritual hand here; in fact he embraces it. It's a story of survival. It's a story of one being able to find peace with themselves. And it's a story of what nature means to our world and how stunning and savage it can be. ""The Revenant"" is a spellbinding piece of cinema."
"Ben_Cap","9","11","29","11 January 2016"," The wilderness can be a brutally lonely and beautiful place.
","The Revenant is an almost seemingly impossible movie to make. Long stretches of quiet, lonely time in a world that seems so distant from the one that we live in now. But behind the task of bringing the wilderness to life and giving it the screen time it deserves, is a story almost too good to be true. If there is one duo capable of taking on this task it is the director and cinematographer, Alejandro G. Iñárritu and Emmanuel Lubezki. They brought this movie to life in ways I wound never have imagined. You really feel like Hugh Glass is right there next to you. When he gets injured you feel it, when he succeeds its like you do too. On top of an already beautiful looking movie from top to bottom,the cast is also at top notch. Leo turns in a terrific performance as Hugh Glass, aside from it being a bit overplayed in certain spots and the fact that it is difficult to not see him as the most famous actor on the planet, it is one of his most memorable performances. Will Poulter, and Domhnall Gleeson also turn in strong supporting performances but the real display here is from Tom Hardy. While he has always been good at playing the villain, never has he been so right for a role as this one. You will truly grow to despise his character and love every second of it. While their is not much writing to speak of, the two and a half hour run time seems to fly by. Iñárritu is cementing his name as one of the top directors going right now, and this movie really shows off how far he is willing to go. There are so many little touches that make this move feel as real as possible, from only using natural light to the long cold shoots, Iñárritu pushed these actors to the brink, and I think the movie is better for it. Back to the look of the film, it really is one of the best looking films of all time. Everything is captured with great expanse and fluidity. Some long shot scenes without cuts are mesmerizing and jaw dropping. These two got it right last year with Birdman, and they have taken the talent and moved it outside of the theater. It may be difficult to watch other movies for a while after viewing the Revenant. Nothing will come close to the expansiveness of Iñárritu's wilderness. The realism alone will make most other movies look silly. One of the few problems I thought plagued The Martian was that I never really felt alone up on Mars. Contact always seemed far too accessible. In the Revenant There is a real feeling of desperation and loneliness that is incredibly hard to accomplish. This movie is a real cinema masterpiece, and while not a perfect 10/10 it is still a must see movie this year."
"kmylwnas","7","11","29","3 January 2016"," Beautiful filmography and direction but not flawless
","Glass (Leonardo Di Caprio) is a scout working for a company that collects and sells fur pelts. His task is to protect his group and guide them safe. Things go bad once they are attacked by Indians that want to steal their pelts. 33 out of 45 die and the rest, along with Glass and his Indian son Hawk are left trying to get back to the fort safely. Fitzerald (Tom Hardy) is not keen of Glass as we understand from the very first moments, and he is actually the villain in this story. Not long after the attack Glass left the group to scout the territory and is viciously attacked by a grizzly bear. He's found almost dead and after given some basic medical care he is carried by his peers, on their way to the fort. The Indians that attacked them are still searching for them, and they are on foot, and after seeing it is almost impossible to keep going with having to carry Glass all the way, they assign a smaller group of 3 persons to assist him. His son Hawk, a young kid and also Fitzerald that actually volunteered (for a fee) to safely bring Glass home. Of course bringing him back was never his real intention so at the first opportunity he tried to take the life of Glass through suffocation and kills his son Hawk for trying to stop him. Then lied to the other kid that was accompanying them that Indians were coming and left on a hurry leaving Glass to die. But Glass is not dead yet and this is where the movie actually starts, with Glass trying to save himself, return to the fort and of course get revenge from Fitzerald. <br/><br/>The photography of the film is amazing, the direction of course too. The acting is perfect from both our leads (Di Caprio and Hardy) and we already know that Di Caprio is a candidate for the Oscar. As much as I'd like him to get it (cause he deserved one so far) and as much as I liked his performance, I'm not convinced for an Oscar. Definitely a candidate though. Hardy on the other hand could easily get one for a supporting role too. <br/><br/>My score is 7/10 for the movie cause, as much I liked it, I found it too long and had many inconsistencies in the script that I could not overlook. <br/><br/>First of all this guy should be dead. But even if he isn't, he should be crippled. We see him crawling for most of the second act, after he was left for dead. My thought was that how is he going to pull this off while crawling the rest of the movie? Well, to my surprise, he started to stand and then walk just a few scenes later! Although we do not have a time reference, it is obvious we are only a few days apart from the day he could not walk or catch a breath or move his hands. It would make much more sense if he would be able to stand and later walk AFTER he crawled all his way to the Indian friend he made, that fed him, carried him on a horse and fixed his wounds with affection. <br/><br/>I also do not understand why he was eating raw meat (and vomiting with disgust) when fires were lit all around him. It would take a moment only to get some cooked meat. Also, why would they act like crazy when they found water, when they had fire anytime they wanted and unlimited snow all around? Why wouldn't they store some meat from the huge animal they were eating (it is freezing cold so it would stay in edible condition for months) and had to eat roots only one scene later? Those things and a few more led to a 7/10 score. But if you can overlook those and let Mr Inaritu carry you away with his vivid direction then you are definitely going to receive at a great cinematic experience."
"mirkobozic","8","16","46","26 December 2015"," A breathtaking disappointment
","Leo Di Caprio stars as Hugh Glass, a man who survives a grizzly attack, falling down a waterfall, an attack by the Indians and falling down a cliff (while on his horse) just in order to get back at Fitzgerald(Tom Hardy). This being a Hollywood film, it's not very hard to guess who will have the last laugh, in spite of all the obstacles that one could only survive in CGI. And don't even get me started on Glass' ability to miraculously recover from each near- fatal injury in no time and just keep crawling and panting through snow and ice. Even if one looks past all that (if you want real life, you don't go to a cinema in the first place anyway), the other flaw of the film is that you don't really feel anything for the characters. With everything favoring your sympathies for Glass, he doesn't pull it off, since he hardly say anything for the whole duration of the movie, and his relationship to his son doesn't come off as emotional/warm enough in order to justify going through so much effort to revenge his death. That being said, there's one thing though that I enjoyed immensely- the breathtaking photography that makes you easily fall in love with Canadian forests and mountains. If you ignore the ridiculous plot, this comes off as a true love letter to the marvels of nature and its cruel beauty."
"CinemaClown","Null","12","33","23 December 2015"," Extremely Bleak, Exceedingly Brutal & Exceptionally Cold-Blooded
","Extremely bleak, exceedingly brutal & exceptionally cold-blooded, The Revenant is that savage beast that charges at you with relentless fury, mauls you from head to toe without mercy, and leaves you utterly bruised, broken & helpless in the freezing cold of a harsh winter. Absolutely uncompromising with its content, unflinchingly raw in its depiction, and pushing its cast & crew to their limit, Alejandro G. Iñárritu's latest is one of the most harrowing films ever made.<br/><br/>Inspired by true events & based on the novel of the same name, the story of The Revenant takes place in the 1820s and follows Hugh Glass, a frontiersman who, during the expedition of the uncharted American wilderness, gets viciously attacked by a bear and is left for dead by members of his hunting team. In an effort to survive, Glass endures unimaginable grief & extreme winter conditions in order to bring vengeance upon those who betrayed him & also murdered his son.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu who's distinguished for his ruthless, evocative style of filmmaking, bleak subject matters, and themes relating to death, loss & redemption, The Revenant exhibits all these trademarks and is quite possibly his most distressing film to date for Iñárritu here aims to capture the pain & suffering in the harshest of conditions in the most unforgivable manner possible, and delivers a cinema that's undeniably difficult to endure but also hard to look away from.<br/><br/>The script packs in an icy cold revenge dish set against the backdrop of remorseless surroundings in an era marred with conflict, carnage & cruelty. The punishing cold, desolate locations & lack of civilisation brings an authenticity of its own. The whole film is shot using only natural light and with Emmanuel Lubezki behind the camera, each frame is crisply photographed, the cold colour palette is brilliantly utilised, and there are several long takes that make you wonder how those sequences were filmed with such effectiveness.<br/><br/>Clocking in at 156 minutes, The Revenant is a long film to sit through but the drama manages to be so absorbing that its lengthy runtime is barely felt. The slow pace allows it to be a more immersive experience, and also helping the ordeal is its arresting cinematography which works in contrast with the unadulterated brutality that's on display here. The background score is mesmerising and emits a sense of warmth but it makes its presence felt only intermittently. However, those flashback scenes don't add much to the story and should've been left out.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, The Revenant features an excellent cast in Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson & Will Poulter, and this is one aspect that plays to Iñárritu's strengths as a filmmaker. DiCaprio delivers a powerhouse performance that makes the viewers feel every bit of agony his character undergoes in what is, without a shadow of a doubt, his toughest on-screen work to date as this actor gives his all to play his role from inside out. Hardy is no slouch in his supporting role and plays the antagonist with great restraint, while Gleeson & others do well with what they are given.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Revenant is another gritty, unrelenting & audacious piece of filmmaking from Alejandro G. Iñárritu that finds the director in sublime form and also happens to be his most direct & accessible film to date. Definitely not for the easily distressed, this thrilling story of survival & retribution is destined to upset many viewers with its graphic nature of storytelling but for those who can manage to stay on board, it will be rewarding on more levels than one. Marking another artistic high for both Iñárritu & Lubezki and catapulted to a greater level by DiCaprio's extraordinary performance, The Revenant is one of the finest films of 2015 and certainly one of the proudest in the careers of its cast & crew. Strongly recommended."
"Zubacz","8","14","40","21 December 2015"," A harsh, brutal and engaging depiction of one man's willpower
","The trailer for Revenant is very misleading. It would have you believe this film is full of fighting scenes, battles and generally action. It's not. It's mostly about one man's struggle against nature. Overcoming his weakness and injuries in his drive for revenge and survival. The majority of the film is slow-paced and focused on the incredible willpower of the protagonist. <br/><br/>Seeing this film on the big screen can be overwhelming. The brutal, realistic scenes, close-up shots of actors' faces, perfectly showing the struggle and pain they experience, and the incredibly harsh environment, make for one of the most memorable cinematic experiences this year. As can be expected from DiCaprio and Hardy, the acting is phenomenal. One can almost feel the pain, the cold, the hunger and the fear they experience. The camera captures all this perfectly, as well as showing beautiful scenery and biting winter weather, all filmed using only natural light. <br/><br/>The plot, despite being quite simple, keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats, rooting for the hero's survival and admiring every time he manages to get up and keep going. <br/><br/>The one criticism would be about the realism of all the misfortune, that befalls DiCaprio's character. There are points where it is really too much for one man to endure and the opinion of the antagonist, that ""there is no way he could survive that"" seems quite correct. <br/><br/>Another thing to note: this is not a film for the squeamish. The graphic, bloody scenes involving both humans and animals do not hold back in realism."
"ulysses-th20","5","8","20","21 December 2015"," Always Too Many Leo Pin Worms
","Leo is a decent actor and has hardly ever been great. The cinematography and/or wilderness was a huge bonus as it adds a vast mystery to this story. He did alright in this one. The movies he's been in may have been Good, but his acting no so much. Although, he was pretty good in...that wallstreet movie and D'Jango Unchained but that's it. I think (I can't at the moment think of others). As to detail to Revenant, it is boring and tedious, never really developing anything but Leos character' retribution or revenge. The bear scene was good but not movie-making magic, as another review says. While I appreciate the ordeal the real man had to endure, the movie simply lacked character."
"slydon13","6","8","20","21 December 2015"," Would be great without any actors at all - just scenery
","The stars of the movie is the scenery and the cinematography (even though I'd never want to go to any of those sites). It was beautiful in a way 'Dr Zhivago' was but the Russian epic had other things going for it too.<br/><br/>The story was 'Tarantiono does Grisley Adams'. The violent opening scene is an echo of the starting scenes to 'Saving Private Ryan' - shocking violence, retelling what were once portrayed as bloodless. While this was an action movie it was no thriller. Knowing the running time and that some of the main characters had to die, was my guide but I wasn't invested in the outcome. The end came as a welcome relief and if they are editing for a shorter version - less DiCaprio would be my preference.<br/><br/>The bears were beautiful and almost too believable with every hair distinguishable. I confess, I was rooting for the bear! Right was certainly on her side.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy has had a hell of a few years from 'Loche', 'Peaky Blinders' and 'Legend'. He was easy to watch because his character clearly didn't give a '*&%$'.<br/><br/>D Gleeson was almost unrecognizable in 'Star Wars Ep VII' and is the new hope for gingers everywhere.<br/><br/>Some people think the movie will have trouble making back the budget because the handsome stars keep their clothes on but in fairness, depressing doesn't sell. Look at 'The Road'! I say - imagine it without the woeful drama and just enjoy the majesty on the big screen<br/><br/>For those of us who don't lead a charmed life like DiCaprio, we don't need to pay 6 -10 for another 3 hours of it. That's why Christmas is so popular - its an invitation to be happy."

The main story can be explained in less than 30 seconds as there is no story. What really annoyed me that he was so injured that no way he would have survived and then he makes these miraculous recoveries with no help, no medicine in freezing cold. Once I somewhat accepted it, they threw him off the cliff and he was STILL okay.<br/><br/>Unwatchable."

There are so many other great films where he deserved an Oscar for. This is not one of them.<br/><br/>I still can't get over the incredibly unrealistic story portrayed here.

","I expected much but to be honest was bored. I am more than capable of appreciating a long, largely gloomy film about existence and survival (the road came to mind during this film and I thought that was brilliant and very moving) but I found this film ultimately tedious. There was no character development so I simply didn't care what happened to Leonardo Di Caprios's character. Scene after scene started with him face down in the snow, moaning. An internal monologue and more of a back story might have helped. There were also many plot holes such as the scene where he found himself above the river (at least 200 fatal feet high) and suddenly he was down in the water. He then found himself propelled for some time through ice-filled water which should have killed someone with the injuries he sustained from the bear attack. Scenes began with potential menace but then nothing happened. I checked my phone thinking it must be nearly over and, with an hour to go, bailed. Still don't care what the outcome was. Definitely not an Oscar deserving performance, or film but no doubt I will be proved wrong!"

Leonardo Dicaprio absolutely knows what hes doing as everything he does, whether thats professionally or personally just gets better and better and better. Although its not much of a speaking role for him (especially in the middle part of the film) it doesn't matter because of what he goes through in the movie. It really is his fight for survival and how he is determined to get to his destination is where his acting is just mind blowing when he is up against nature and the elements. <br/><br/>At the time of going to the cinema there were only late showings in IMAX but I will definitely go and see it in the format for my second viewing. <br/><br/>An incredible piece of film making which actually makes you 'feel' like you were there. A top notch cast as well with Domnhall Gleeson, again like Dicaprio, just getting better in everything he does. Everyone behind the scenes saying that this was without a doubt the most difficult shoot they have ever done, but boy oh boy every bit of hard work is up there on screen.

So predictable. The frustrating part is how they stretch the ""Leo healing"" part of the movie. It was just way too long. So many unnecessary plots.<br/><br/>The movie to me was entertaining, except the ""healing Leo stretches"" that just makes me wanna FFWD the damn thing.

","""The Revenant"" is the Angry Super Model of the Oscar Season<br/><br/>The Oscar for best cinematography goes to Emmanuel Lubezki for ""The Revenant."" <br/><br/>""The Revenant"" is the best looking film I have seen in many years. The depth of the shots is overwhelming; the mountains and the snow in the film are amazing to look at. Unfortunately, the plot and characters don't live up to the look of ""The Revenant."" The film is vacuous and lacks substance, much like a china doll. <br/><br/>DiCaprio is good as Hugh Glass, but like the best player on a team that doesn't win a championship doesn't deserve an MVP award, DiCaprio doesn't deserve a best Oscar nod for his performance in ""The Revenant."" The other characters are flat and underdeveloped, and the acting is crushed under the beauty of the photography. <br/><br/>Certainly, John Fitzgerald played by Tom Hardy has his moments, but he doesn't bring the character up to the level of pure hatred. For a revenge film, you need someone like Bill McKinney who played Captain Terrell in ""The Outlaw Josey Wales."" Now that was a character you love to hate. Fitzgerald didn't have enough of a past for us to fully appreciate how despicable he is. Thus, the revenge tale is not charged enough. Besides, Fitzgerald had a point when he told the Captain that he didn't trust Glass as a guide since Glass had failed to detect the Ree surround the trappers early in the film. <br/><br/>While Hugh Glass is a man of few words; his son Hawk is practically mute. There are decent flashbacks that demonstrate their relationship, but what of the son in the present? There is little to go on. And the role of the Captain might as well have been left out of the film. The actions the Captain takes are heroic, and at the same time, incredibly stupid.<br/><br/>There is little tension in the film other than the violence of some of the moments. There are no revelations of Glass's tracking acumen, no feeling of impeding doom felt by the evil Fitzgerald who thinks Glass is dead, no surprises in the chase and nothing revealed that is a surprise at all. All that is left is the beauty of nature and the inevitable cruelty of humanity. None of that is surprising. <br/><br/>Rating: Matinée<br/><br/>See it for the scenery, but don't expect to be surprised by the action or enthralled with the characters. <br/><br/>Peace, <br/><br/>Tex Shelters"

","I am very surprised this is being considered for awards. This will probably be my shortest review to date.<br/><br/>I do love period movies. I also really like Leo DiCaprio. But, not this one. The most unlikely thing I noticed was the good performance of Will Poulter, who was Gally in ""The Maze Runner"".<br/><br/>Mainly, there were two parts to this movie. ""Wake me when Glass gets to the Outpost"" and ""Wake me when he gets the bad guy"". <br/><br/>The bear attack scene was good. The relationship he had with his son seemed genuine. Flashbacks to Glass and his wife did not seem genuine. <br/><br/>Kudos for the acting when not able to speak, but it still didn't connect emotionally.

","The Revenant is directed by critically acclaimed and 3-time Academy Award winning director Alejandro G. Iñárritu and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson & Will Poulter.<br/><br/>Left for dead by members of his hunting team after being mauled by a bear, and betrayed by his confidant John Fitzgerald, Hugh Glass sets off on an incredible path to redemption. Journeying across a vicious landscape and in great turmoil, Glass pushes his body and spirit to breaking-point. <br/><br/>With his experience travelling across Europe in his younger years, Iñárritu has acquired a rather large and passionate mindset for visuals and interestingly intricate locations in his filmmaking. With Birdman blowing away movie-goers and critics alike in 2014 with its beautiful camera work and long, steady shots, with superb acting all accompanied by a smart screenplay; Iñárritu had to return with strength. And he has. The Revenant is already gaining major attention from The Academy with 12 Oscar nominations and 3 Golden Globe wins. If that doesn't convince you, take it from me; this is how you make a movie about survival. This is how directors should start shooting action sequences and entire movies all together. Long and smooth shots which never cut unnecessarily, settling you right into the world with no noticeable jogs or jolts that could pull you out. You can see everything that's going on around these characters. I'm sure there are filmmakers that are already taking notes, given the success of both this and Birdman. Not only is this Iñárritu's influence, but cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has the eye for nature, and using what we've been given, to ultimate effect. It's worth noting that everything; every word of dialogue, every scene of violence, every shot of scenery, was shot in natural light. Only once was an exception made, for a campfire scene. Meaning each day of shooting had to be carefully planned ahead of time to make sure that those vital hours of light were used. This is one of many reasons I love Iñárittu's work. Maximum realism, results in an immersive experience.<br/><br/>The screenplay is significantly convincing, and although around 40% is spoken in Native American languages, it manages to keep you connected to what's happening on-screen. Iñárittu is one of the writers for this movie, amongst Mark L. Smith and novelist Michael Punke, who wrote the story this movie is loosely based on. I'd like to read the novel and see how this adaption varies from the original story. <br/><br/>The acting by all members of the cast were outstanding, but with 2 Academy Award nominations being tied to DiCaprio and Hardy, you'd be wanting to know if they deserve it. My answer; Absolutely. Both are neck and neck with each other throughout the movie, and fall into their characters with extreme intensity. DiCaprio has stated that this was the hardest performance of his entire career. With all the things he had to learn and do to become Hugh Glass I'd say he should definitely take the Oscar. Whether he does or doesn't, will not affect my views. The same for Hardy. Impeccable skill is on show here, by everyone, it would be a shame if it didn't win, but it's already gained huge amounts of attention so that's fine by me.<br/><br/>Music by Ryuichi Sakamoto & Carsten Nicolai is fabulously soft and subtle, yet energetic and expeditious when it needs to be. It was used as a part of the overall sound design for the movie, and was added with the natural sounds, not slapped on after, so to speak. This is something I think that filmmakers should also think about doing more often, weaving the music through the visuals without singling out anything until last minute. It really adds to the overall viewing experience, and makes for a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>The visual and special effects were barely noticeable, which isn't a bad thing. They look real, feel real, sound real. The bear scene is brutal. And I mean brutal. If there's one thing I can say about this film, it's that it's brutally violent and gory. Again, not a bad thing. This helps with the realism and nature of this story. There's never a distraction.<br/><br/>My verdict; The Revenant is another masterpiece by Alejandro G. Iñárritu and showcases the finest acting, and passion for filmmaking. This is a definite must-see. <br/><br/>""My heart bleeds. But revenge is in the creator's hands.""<br/><br/>The Revenant, 9/10."
"dave-mcclain","6","4","8","9 January 2016"," ""The Revenant"" has greatness within it, but is not a great film as a whole.
","Sometimes two movies come out at the same time and share a lot of elements even though they're completely unrelated. For example, the parallels between two films which both came out in limited release on December 25, 2015 (even though one went into wide release before the other) are striking. I'm referring to ""The Hateful Eight"" and ""The Revenant"" (R, 2:36).<br/><br/>Both movies take place in the 19th century American west, are set completely in the wilderness and include a lot of snow. In both films, men die by shootings and stabbings, women are abused and even killed, someone takes a drink and ends up spitting out blood, at one point, there's a naked man wandering in the cold and, later on, someone is hanged. Each movie even contains a brief scene in which someone catches snowflakes with the tongue. I could go on, but suffice it to say there's an unusual number of similarities between these two films, considering how different they are. While ""The Hateful Eight"" is a completely fictional tale with multi-layered characters, an interesting story and even some light-hearted moments, ""The Revenant"" is an even simpler story, which is mainly about one man, and is dead serious – and even semi-fictional.<br/><br/>""The Revenant"" is the film adaptation of Michael Punke's 2002 novel of the same name, which is inspired by a true story. The book takes some liberties with the truth. The film takes even more. The truth in the story is that, in 1823, fur trapper Hugh Glass was attacked by a grizzly bear and left for dead by his companions, but, having been abandoned, he still managed to limp, shuffle and crawl over 200 miles to Fort Kiowa in present-day South Dakota.<br/><br/>This is another one of those movies (like ""In the Heart of the Sea"") which, rather than just telling a fictional story with fictional characters, takes an incredible true story and uses the names of real people, but also inserts main characters which weren't part of the actual story, changes the motivations and fates of the real people and tells a story of half-truths. Well beyond taking dramatic license, films like this often leave many people with a perpetual misperception of historical events that will never be corrected. (I'm saying all this now, because doing so during my plot summary would result in spoilers.) Leonardo DiCaprio plays Glass, an experienced hunter and guide who once lived with the Pawnee Indians, married a Pawnee woman and, in the movie, has a teenage Pawnee son (Forrest Goodluck) with him on this particular expedition. When the men come under a sudden and brutal attack by a group of Arikara Indians (Rees, for short), they run for their boats, carrying as many bundles of their beaver pelts as they can get away with. Having lost over 30 men in the attack, Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), the leader of the quasi-military hunting party, rallies his remaining men and orders them to start heading back to their trading post at Fort Kiowa.<br/><br/>With the journey barely underway, Glass is attacked by a large brown bear protecting her cubs. He is mauled so badly that the men in his party hold out no hope for his survival. It becomes impossible for them to carry him over the increasingly rough terrain, so Henry leaves Glass in the care of his son, Hawk, the young Jim Bridger (Will Poulter), and experienced trapper John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). ""When"" Glass dies, they are to bury him properly and then catch up with the group. Fitzgerald, unfortunately, is a man who only cares about protecting his own hide and selling as many beaver hides as he can. He soon takes actions which prevent the two young men from staying and looking after Glass.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie remains focused primarily on DiCaprio's character, but tells three stories simultaneously. Glass basically wills himself to survive and improve enough to try to get himself to Fort Kiowa. Still badly injured, he literally drags himself toward his destination, doing his best to survive in spite of his wounds, the rough terrain, the worsening weather conditions and lack of food. He also has to make sure that he steers clear of the Rees. They continue to be a presence throughout the film, as their chief (Anthony Starlight) leads his men in search of his missing daughter (Melaw Nakehk'o), whom he believes was taken by white men in the area. Meanwhile, the men who left Glass behind are making their way back to their trading post, unaware that Glass is still alive – and is coming for his revenge.<br/><br/>""The Revenant"" is a great achievement in some ways, but not a great film. The main reason to see this movie is the acting, especially DiCaprio's performance. Leo completely immerses himself in his character's suffering and deserves an Oscar for everything he went through to deliver such a powerful performance. The problem with the movie is that it's almost all about the central character's physical and emotional pain, making for one depressing movie. The scenes of the bear attack and one harrowing escape from the Rees are both remarkable, but dragging out this character's suffering for as long as co-writer and director Alejandro González Iñárritu does, makes for an unnecessarily long movie. However, the movie's eventful final thirty minutes did help justify the time I had invested. Seeing this film is an endurance test – physically, emotionally and intellectually (for those of us who know how the story really unfolded) – but seeing Leo portray his character's endurance so effectively is just this side of being worth it.

","So ""The Revenant"" is not a landmark film. It will not be remembered as a one of a kind, as a cinematic masterpiece, or as a total disaster. It isn't either because it does have some striking photography, and now I understand why I am not going to be spending Winter in Canada or the most northern states of the U.S. It also cements the fact that humans are one of the meanest species on the planet both on and off the screen.<br/><br/>To summarize, Hugh Glass has some rotten luck. His wife and son are killed. He's mauled and barely survived by a scared and testy Grisly. Then, he's left for dead by two men who were supposed to take care of him, and in ways that asks for to believe in the impossible and put Superman or any of the Justice League super heroes to shame, he makes it back to the fort, defying hypothermia, frostbite, every possible infection in the world, and other angry humans. Oh yes... he's alive at the end.<br/><br/>It is an impressive production when we consider what the actors and the crew probably had to go through. It looks cold. It feels cold, both in its physical presentation and its connection to the audience. With the exception of Hardy's thrilling performance as the insecure and treacherous hunter, we are witness to the lead actor (or his stand-in) enduring some of the most difficult situations you can torture a human being with. We are to believe that he had to consume some raw meat and fish, being bounced around by what I assume were some type of actors inside a bear rug skin, subject himself to some inclement weather (I sure hope he packed his moisturizer), in addition to riding horses, shooting guns, avoid arrows, and swimming in freezing river waters.<br/><br/>The score was fitting and unobtrusive. There were a couple of moments when it got loud, but I suppose it fit the scene. Unlike the deafening interruptions of the gorgeous music in ""The Danish Girl"", this was bearable. We survived it. The fantastic composition, all done with natural light was at some moments, breathtaking. I wanted to run and buy the companion coffee table book. Then, I remembered that I had seen a similar and arguably, more beautiful and spiritually resonant set of visuals in that Malick movie that came out a few years ago.<br/><br/>There was some good work by the supporting cast, particularly Gleeson, who managed to steal the role of best villain in ""Force Awakens"", and he's now proving his versatility here, as a leader with strict discipline but enough heart and fairness to protect his charges. Will Poulter is just standing around and not doing much, trying to hold his own against Hardy, who is as threatening as the surrounding environment. One look is enough to freeze us in our tracks, pretty much like that wild grisly. I was left wondering whether the mama bear could have stood a chance against Fitzgerald.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to admit that this was a difficult production. It's all up there on the screen, but I was also wondering how much of it was necessary. It seemed to me like they could have filmed half of it in a more welcoming environment, with the help of some good blue or green screen. Also, the movie was a tad long, with some of moments which lovingly portrayed the savage beauty of the north, adding at least another 30 minutes that the film didn't need. If we had all those beautiful shots, why didn't we get more of the aurora Borealis? Last but not least is the whole premise that there was just too much violence, yet it felt distant. Maybe the audience just got numb and shut down because 20 minutes into the film, we stopped caring about what would happen to them. We knew he would make it, and we had little emotional involvement to care for Glass, his mates, or the indians."

","The people who run Hollywood have a stake in re-writing history in ways that benefit them. Alas, that means our ancestors will be portrayed within a narrative that is fake and seeks to perpetuate certain myths, which, in turn, are used to achieve political goals. If you are not tired of the narrative about evil Europeans who bring misery to noble Indians, you might want to waste over two hours of your life. The only reason this film is that long, apparently, is the writers' desire to make the protagonist endure every calamity they could imagine. He survives a bear attack, a fall down a massive waterfall in icy water, being fired upon a million times, jumping off a cliff Rambo style, surviving for hours without warm clothes by recreating a scene from Empire Strikes Back, and finally being stabbed several times with a knife. He is a mix of Rambo and John McLane. The whole thing is strangely comical. Finally, the film is disappointing in terms of emotional payoff. I felt nothing. What a waste."

Unending disconnect from reality for me...the fall into the tree, that did it for me. By that point, I laughed out loud.

","My popcorn tin was heavier when I binned it than when I collected it. Why did I throw up when watching The Revenant? There isn't that much gore to speak of.. What's worth a loud unflattering speech is the wooden spoon of pseudo-philosophical pretensions AG Iñárritu gags the audience with for 2 hours and 26 minutes. I sat with that warm tin on my lap even through the 10 minute credits, contemplating.<br/><br/>Consider that Glass' chief motivation for returning from the grave (gravely wounded really) is his love for his Pawnee son, with whom the only memorable scene shared is patting him down from an outburst against Fitzgerald's (Hardy) ferociously racist taunts. He only becomes that much close to him after Fitzgerald coats his rusty knife with the teenager's gastric juice, in a powerfully screamed-out scene.<br/><br/>Consider how much running time we spend watching Glass wander wistfully into the afterlife, despite knowing full well he'll overcome his bear wounds for a showdown or the film wouldn't be funded. He eavesdrops on whispers by his murdered wife's wraith, only to wake up and cauterize his torn-open neck with gunpowder; Iñárritu wants to both have his bison liver and eat it. How much can you cheat the narrative? <br/><br/>Most redundant of its sophistry is the Darwinian symbolism, as Glass evolves from being bruised and buried, to a crawling creature, to a one-legged limper, to a biped man to a horseback riding gunfighter... In Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity, evolutionary symbolism at the end served a purpose of literalizing how survival is a prerequisite for evolution; we wouldn't be writing reviews on IMDb if Neanderthals hadn't scrambled Mousterian tools 300,000 years ago. Here, Glass gets wounded and persists only to become the same man again.... not even a wiser fellow.<br/><br/>Above everything, the over-ballyhooed bear attack is dampeningly underwhelming. Not-to-spoil anything, but you remember it, how you give a cat a bowl of milk, the bowl gets swirled around a bit with only a few licks of milk spilling over the edges.. Yeah. Oh, it's not even all in one long continuous take as it's been touted to be, there's a very visible cut soon after Glass arms himself with a knife. What it isn't is even 1/10th as visceral as the jaguar-mauling from Mel Gibson's Apocalypto. What it is is ten times more pointlessly protracted and thusly expensive.<br/><br/>On the other hand, The Revenant is filmed with such hypnotic beauty. Lubezki's camera floats around inordinately, (pans more than it tracks) and he seems to find heavenly imagery in every 360° plane. Nature has never looked better in a Hollywood production. There's a grim fairytale (& Ron Fricke-esque) edge to the proceedings. The wide-screen frames are filled with towering forestry, snowmelt and dew drops dripping off the damp lushly colored leaves in close-up. Negatively charged oxygen reaches for your lungs off the screen. When the film slackens to luxuriate in wonder, never is it boring; it's only catching its breath.<br/><br/>The editing is often fabulous. From flame-to-flame match cuts in the snow, and most memorably, Glass' labored breath fogs the lens, dissolves into clouds floating in the mountain ranges which are then viciously consumed by Fitzgerald's pipe smoke.<br/><br/>But Ho! there... characters' lives are risked for this virtuosity. There's a scene in which Jim Bridger, the story's most conflicted entity, when finding their way to camp with Fitzgerald, happens upon a massacred Native village, huts still smoking. Him and us, (but not Fitzgerald) see a surviving lady, for whom Bridger leaves a parcel whose contents neither we nor her know to be; she's seen Fitzgerald stomp around and cuss, she's surmised his inclination towards violence. She has to choose between 1) staying safely alive by hiding a little longer, or 2) bowing to the logistical limitation of Iñárritu needing to pan around, show her to the audience discovering bread in the parcel and pinching off mouthfuls, then urgently cut to the next scene. Does she play it safe? Not if The Revenant is going to strike a balance between manipulative and masterful.<br/><br/>Still, despite the objectionable, emetic and offensively on-the-nose endeavour, Iñárritu deserves an Oscar again, if only for the scene in which Glass eviscerates a dead horse he's ridden off a cliff, and the camera smoothly sails around from the horse's back as its viscera are scooped out, travels in a long take, timed to the action, to find Glass snuggling into its steaming 'womb' then conclude with a close-up of his face. Wow!! (No matter how many takes and fired crew members it took)<br/><br/>The most human performance is by Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald, consistently flawed and gleaming with gallows humor. Don't be surprised if during the final snowy showdown, you're rooting for him to cut down pretentious.<br/><br/>DiCaprio, well, he..... works the hardest. You know that clip they play at the Oscars, your most electrifying moment during a performance, DiCaprio's here is effectively a grisly series of those. My two favorite are him trying-to-not-blink to save his life, and him crawling out of a shallow snow grave, and mortared between his teeth, equal parts spit and grit. Despite my reservations, I'll cheer a lung out for either clip.<br/><br/>You can almost hear the voices in his head (his Birdman?) yell in Calvin Candie rhetoric; ""Eddie Redmayne, that new kid, he gimped hisself out last yur, won that Oscar for it.. What are you gonna do, Huh!?!""<br/><br/>Such a troubled production, he ate real raw bison liver, yet still he required 5 stunt doubles and 3 photo doubles... that there is a metaphor for the whole movie.<br/><br/>While the film is never boring, calling it entertaining would be flattering it. No exhilaration derives from watching a man ride a horse off a cliff; the experience is very akin to staring into an open wound, waiting patiently for it to a cicatrize into a scar. 7/10."

Tom Hardy spends most of the movie talking like he's got a mouthful of hardtack and even when you can clearly understand him, isn't really saying much. The director, to me at least, seemed to understand how little plot and story there actually is in the movie by using scenes of a river or clouds as links between scenes and then lingering and lingering on those scenes of a river or clouds.

Frankly, I couldn't wait for the movie to be over.

And DiCaprio's Hugh having to go through the last three once, twice, thrice, endless times. Which is the purpose of the movie, but it kind of makes it a torture flick.<br/><br/>The story is simple enough. Hugh is attacked by a bear and left for dead by his team, who is in the run and in disarray after being attacked by natives. Hugh will try to survive by himself, and in his journey will have to confront all kind of situations. And some animals. Lots of animals, actually. And bad weather, snow, blizzards, and lots of people keen on making him disappear from the face of the earth.<br/><br/>It all sounds gritty, dark, violent. And it is. And it is done with detail. It is obvious that lots of work have gone into making the picture as beautiful (in its misery and death) as possible. And all the actors (a basically manly cast) do a great job, with Leo mumbling, grumbling and spitting his way through the two hours and a half the pic lasts.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the movie is basically an empty beauty, too much in love with itself and way overlong, making Hugh's fight to survive descend into repetition. In the end the movie feels like a dissertation into how to make characters suffer."

","This film is the worst!!!!!! I caught this when I was on a movie binge. I was super excited to see it because of the surrounding buzz. The film is trash. Leo received a pity Oscar because of the internet. His performance is about the same as it ever was. I would look to Tom Hardy as the films saving grace, but just another generic role in a based on true story film. I ended up finding myself fast forwarding through parts of Leo's overacting. Pure trash manufactured for the masses and something to fill out the award shows. I'm not gonna waste anymore time on it and you shouldn't ether. If you're a Tom Hardy fan I suggest ""Bronson"" or ""Locke"". They will be a much better ride than this flat generic film."

However, he take a massive amount of physical punishment. This goes on to such an extent that I became desensitised to the character's pain by about half way through and really stopped caring when he was winged for the the umpteenth time.<br/><br/>A good adventure film, a bit low on action for such a long film.

","""The Revenant"" opens with two absolutely jaw dropping scenes, the second arguably topping the first. They alone are worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>The first is an extraordinary battle scene that feels like it was filmed in one take. The camera puts you there, on the spot, in the midst of the carnage. It makes you feel as though what it is allowing you to see is really going on all around you, not around it.<br/><br/>The second scene is impossible to speak of without using hyperbole. It is unlike anything I have seen before. Yes, I am talking about the bear attack scene, easily the greatest film moment of 2015, and one of the greatest scenes of any film made in the new millennium so far. This will surely top the list of ""how the HELL did they do THAT?"" moments in movie history.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is solid, but not quite up to that standard, but that standard is so high, this shouldn't be taken as a negative.<br/><br/>The performances by DiCaprio, Hardy and Gleason and also top notch, and ensure that the movie is never just about its set-pieces."

","In a way it is a film for nothing, except an Oscar for the main actor.<br/><br/>We are in Pawnee country some time in the 18th century, at the divide where the French and the English more or less meet. With the Indians in- between, around, behind and in front, at times under (a couple of feet under) or even over (from their horse-backs).<br/><br/>The French are trying to play it commercial and buy pelts and other Indian natural products but they can't always have their terms and at times are obliged to give some horses, even when the season is advanced and the horses are the guarantee to survive. Some will die.<br/><br/>The English are more in burning the Indian villages and looting what's left and even killing the survivors, even when there are none. Kill them twice for good business. <br/><br/>Add to this the fact that some Indians, especially those who have managed to get horses can become a real permanent pressure and an arrow is silent, efficacious and reloading is easy. Think of an arrow sniper in the trees.<br/><br/>Then you have the unhealthy, sick, vicious, criminal minds on the European sides. On the French and English sides they may consider an Indian woman is like a pet you take away without asking for permission. And the film widely shows how the English with their forts are rotten from the inside by the thieves, the immoral beings who take advantage of the frontier to realize the worst trends in their personalities: they can kill, rape, steal and many other things as much as they want.<br/><br/>This film is the fight to the finish between two such English ""pioneers,"" one being on the sinning side and the other on the punishing side. They call that vengeance, and vengeance;, as is well known, is always on God's side, and sure enough the assassin, murderer, thief and a few other things, among them rapist, will be finished by the Indians who will pass on their horses leaving the good one to die in the snow since he is wounded and his horse, if it is still there, has been left behind several miles of deep snow away.<br/><br/>No salvation, no real vengeance. Just violence for the sake of surviving and for the pleasure of shedding blood. That shows the resilience and the viciousness of human beings. They love destroying, killing and a few other things like that.<br/><br/>Really a film for nothing, except an Oscar for the main character, oops! Sorry actor.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
"mtbgtown","5","2","3","2 July 2016"," Oscar to DiCaprio hurts acting
","Let's face it: everything Leo did in this movie I could have done. Eat raw meat, raw fish? No prob. Crawl inside a (fake) dead horse? Brave bad weather? What did he do that the average actor couldn't do? I literally laughed out loud when he swung his wobbly arm trying to chop a branch with a tomahawk. You see the muscles confused when called upon to do this manual labor. Toss him upon a pile of supermodels and he's a natural, but grab a shovel? Which end? Compare Leo with Spencer Tracy or Steve McQueen, two actors from real life. They worked, served in the military, etc. When they do things, I believe they are doing things. Leo's Oscar lowers the standard of acting excellence to whoever can bear extreme conditions when they're otherwise used to yachts, caviar, and Wolf of Wall St. living. Inarritu worked around this for the sake of the DiCaprio brand, but imagine Keaton spitting and screeching his way through Birdman. Are you saying he would have won? Let me put it to you this way, and then I'll thank you for your time: Leo Dicaprio cannot act."

","Alejandro G. Iñárritu .... Yet another film that is critically acclaimed for reasons that escape me.<br/><br/>All the hallmarks of his films are in this one: - It's overly long... Did I mention that it's too long? - The story is shallow and borders on non-existent - It's far-fetched (many other reviewers point out specific areas) - You find yourself thinking about whether to abandon the film half way through, but convince yourself to keep watching because it must either get better or something interesting is about to happen. But that fails to materialise.<br/><br/>The film making was pretentious in the extreme. Leo was good and it was refreshing to see him playing a different character. He seems to be the same character in most of his films. I don't think he deserves an Oscar (full stop) but this is probably one of his better performances. With that said, the role and the film itself was largely Oscar-bait. <br/><br/>Overall, it was very boring and lacked magic. It was very visceral, but I felt that it was trading substance for style. Don't bother, though it's not as bad as the dreadful 'Birdman.'"

Length, without any new development, it is really uninteresting, I has to recognize all the same the magnificent decorations which my recalled reservists sometimes those of the Lord of Rings! In brief, this movie would have been able to be better a lot! It is not really worth that everything the praises that the press had made for him."
"Semisonic","7","2","3","10 April 2016"," A spiritual journey from nowhere to beyond
","Iñárritu's been a hot commodity lately, and his Birdman was a movie well deserving its fame, a perfect combination of intricate style, witty multi-leveled delivery and free spirit that made it such a unique joy to watch. A year later, the maestro is back with a new story, way gloomier and deeply rooted in symbolism.<br/><br/>In a way, The Revenant is the Birdman's dark twin. Both films concentrate on the problems of a person struggling with finding a new path in his life after the old bridges have been burned. This time, however, looking back is only a source of sorrow and grief which can hardly be a guide on your way forward. In fact, there is no way forward for Hugh Glass, just like there is no reason for him to live. And when the last tiny thread tying the hollow present to the beloved past is forcibly torn, Glass' will to live comes back once more - just to drag back to the void those responsible for it.<br/><br/>Throughout the film one can't shake off the feeling of illusiveness of everything that happens on screen. This time Iñárritu relies heavily on various visual tricks like filming through a fish-eye lens or a camera that dashes around the scene like a trapped animal. Combined with a dark troubled score, this produces a sense of discomfort that builds a glass (no pun intended) wall between the audience and the characters, not letting us too close to them and preventing an emotional participation in the events of the film. At times, The Revenant feels like a dream you got caught in, unable to wake up, and the only thing you can do is to simply follow the path charted by some grim mastermind.<br/><br/>However, the director's brilliant and truly Oscar-worthy intentions are constantly foiled by one thing this film has been praised the most for: Hugh Glass himself. The unnatural vitality of the character portrayed by DiCaprio requires some suspense of disbelief, but is not a problem per se since it's clear that he's drawn forward by something stronger than mere human nature. But Leo himself simply belongs too much to the world of the living to fit this role. He's been too alive through all his career, and this time, working so hard for that Oscar, he, in my opinion, simply failed to show us how it feels to be dead inside and be pushed forward by a greater mission. Unlike Tom Hardy's John Fitzgerald, who actually felt like a savage power with no real humanity inside, as if it went away with his scalp.<br/><br/>Can't say that The Revenant is a bad movie. On the contrary, it's a fine piece of cinema well-thought and well put together. However, in an attempt to take the place warmed by Dead Man by Jim Jarmusch, it kinda missed and fell into a pit nearby. But the pit is shallow, and Leonardo DiCaprio is so good at crawling, which allows the film to remain entertaining, albeit at the cost of a blurred concept."
"tyiannoulis","6","2","3","27 January 2016"," Little scenario and boring. Great photography
","6 stars to this movie I give because scenario is little. Films focus on the effort of Dicaprio to survive (who plays very well) Too long scenes with no meaning, that is the reason that film is 150 min.If Dicaprio wins an Oscar that will be for his effort to be honest. I read that more of the scenes are real and took place in real conditions. The truth is that we have seen him in better films. For one more time his face is very expressive and that is why Leo is one of the best actors. Now the for of the movie: I give 10 stars for photography with all of my heart. Great photo shooting focusing on the magic of nature. Nature is like a canvas."
"oOoBarracuda","6","2","3","25 January 2016"," The technical are the only aspects to take away from this one.
","Google defines revenant as: a person who has returned, especially supposedly from the dead. It is safe then to say that I was a Revenant after finishing Alejandro G. Iñárritu's big budget 2015 film. Strapping in for a 2.5+ hour film, that I was ensured would be pure cinema mastery, The Revenant proved to be a grave disappointment. All of the buzz from critics and fans only assure me that herd mentality is alive and well, and far more prevalent that even Friedrich Nietzsche could have envisioned.<br/><br/>The audience is introduced to explorer Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) early on in the film. A legend in his own right, Glass is charged with making sure his fellow fur trappers get home safely, as he is the one who knows the open country best. Joined by his son, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) who is half Native American, Hugh is no stranger to tragedy. His Native American wife was killed by white soldiers, devastating Hugh and set him on a vagabond lifestyle afraid to call anywhere home too long. Along the journey, a long (seemingly endless) winter ensues and the group is forced to make difficult decisions to get home safely. Glass is seen as the most knowledgeable in regards to traveling which upsets another group member, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) who almost always disagrees with Glass's assessment of whatever situation is at hand. After being viciously attacked by a bear, Glass is rendered incapacitated, unable to speak, and reliant on the group to return him to full health. The more brutal the winter becomes, the more Fitzgerald wants to leave Glass for dead and make headway along with the men, taking their firs to a big payday that awaits. Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), unable to pull the trigger and put Glass out of his misery, splits the group up, leaving Glass, Hawk, and the young Bridger (Will Poulter) to care for him and return home. Seeing an opportunity, Fitzgerald volunteers to join the boys and Glass along the way. After a scuffle with Hawk, then tricking Bridger, convincing him there are Native Americans on their trail ready to kill them, they leave Glass behind to fend for himself. In abandoning Glass, Fitzgerald goes against Captain Henry's orders that if Glass should take a turn for the worst, he is to have a proper burial. Believing he will die, Fitzgerald goes about traversing the wilderness with the unwilling Bridger (who sees what kind of man Fitzgerald really is). With nothing but anger and will power assisting him, Glass vows recovery with the notion that he will hunt Fitzgerald down over his betrayal. Forever dedicated to the memory of his family, Glass fervently searches revenge as vengeance overwhelms him.<br/><br/>Sadly being overshadowed by DiCaprio, as the belief persists that he is overdue for an Oscar, Tom Hardy performs exceptionally well in this film. He plays a simple, yet greedy man capable of evil incredibly convincingly. It is not easy to pull off such opposite personalities, yet Hardy's brilliance as an actor makes it look easy. DiCaprio, on the other hand, plays his part in a perfectly mediocre way. There wasn't a lot to the part of Hugh Glass. Anyone can feign revenge and freezing. Why this part was seen as such a difficulty escapes me, but ""it's his year"" they say. The cinematography was a thing of beauty, but how could it not be? When you have billions of billions of dollars and are using the great outdoors, you better turn out a fantastic product. The infamous bear scene was incredibly juvenile, as the CGI bear looked ridiculous against the real life wilderness. I understand Iñárritu's genius, as a I was a huge fan of Birdman, but he took everything that was good about Birdman and overdid it to the point of making it look ridiculous. What I do not understand is why Iñárritu chose to allow condensation and blood to splatter the camera. This was an odd decision as so much work was taken to establish realism; to then remind the audience that ""this is just a movie, see?' was a peculiar maneuver. This film was also over the top in its use of gore. What is interesting to me is that the same reviewers that criticized Quentin Tarantino's Hateful Eight for over the top violence, have no problem for that same imposing gore in The Revenant. Just goes to show, if you are viewed as an artist, like Iñárritu, instead of a director like Tarantino, you can get by with a lot more in Hollywood.<br/><br/>What can be learned from The Revenant? Revenge should be left up to God, or the world, or Native Americans-whichever you prefer. If you are thinking, ""ok, lots of movies share that message"" so was I, but for some reason, I thought this movie would tell it differently—it does not. I trusted that The Academy saw something in The Revenant that I needed to see too; I remain unsure of what that ""something"" is. There are more problems than positives in The Revenant, and I am only left hoping for another Boyhood awards night; the movie everyone thought would win every award it was nominated for, yet only took home a single award. I am ever more convinced with each Best Picture nomination that I watch that The Academy really missed the boat on giving a nod to Carol."
"Robert_duder","7","2","3","22 January 2016"," I get it and yet in a way I don't
","I absolutely understand the critical acclaim heralded onto The Revenant. If you begin to look deep inside the inner working of The Revenant you can't help but be impressed. They shot 100% using natural light, the cinematography is stunning, the camera work beautiful, the performances gritty and real...the film from a film making standpoint is a masterpiece. However from a pure cinematic entertainment standpoint it is a very, very, very long story about a guy stumbling through the wilderness for two hours and exacting revenge for another half hour. The Revenant is a piece of art, it was made to be so. I don't know how anyone could defend it for it's brilliant script or multi-faceted characters because neither one is true. Don't get me wrong, Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic in the role but he's fantastic at showing a man surviving, not for giving this historically powerful character. It is like seeing a beautiful painting that is just stunning but staring at it for 2 1/2 hours. I guess what I'm getting at is there isn't a lot of substance to it and I cannot agree that it is anywhere near the best movie of the year because it is successful in one area of film making.<br/><br/>Does that mean star Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't deserve an Oscar? No not at all. DiCaprio is mesmerizing in this role. He shows an intensity and a fear and this grit for survival that is really quite powerful. He desires vengeance enough to survive the very worst conditions possible. The bear attack is definitely brutal and really something to remember in the beginning. Tom Hardy is what Tom Hardy is nowadays. He does a funny voice and acts odd and that's his role. His character is essentially the villain and the focus of DiCaprio's vengeance but very underdeveloped character and not a lot of scenes considering. There are a few other half decent supporting roles that are almost cameos more than anything such as Will Poulter and Domnhall Gleeson.<br/><br/>One thing I am certain of is that director Alejandro González Iñárritu deserves his Oscar nod. The man has incredible style and if you watched The Revenant with no sound on, I think you would likely be mesmerized by the world he creates. As I mentioned before the setting and camera work is brilliant. I could go back and watch this again just for the little details in the background. The Revenant is a beautiful piece of art but from an entertainment standpoint it misses the mark in several ways. It has some intense climatic moments (the bear attack and the end scene) but what is in the middle leaves you scratching your head more than enjoying the concept. It's a two and a half hour film that was at least an hour longer than it needed to be. It certainly wouldn't be my choice for best picture but for those wild and crazy critics, I do understand. 7/10"

The trailer was slow, with DiCaprio dragging himself through countless acres of backwoods forest, as a slow heartbeat keeps time. I was ready for this movie.<br/><br/>To be perfectly honest, I love all the Academy Award movies. I watch them all as soon as they are made available, make my own predictions and prepare myself for the inevitable. Surely THIS is the year Leonardo DiCaprio earns one, right?<br/><br/>Marvel as an unwashed DiCarprio drags himself through countless minutes of winter wonderland forest, with minimal dialogue and lots of people and animals dying. Really, was that last horse dying necessary to the plot of the movie? Come on now. I love all types of movies, blood and guts, plenty of animals being dead, but this seems a bit over the top.<br/><br/>You know why DiCaprio never wins an Oscar? Because with every movie I see him in, I don't feel like I'm being immersed in his films. You are always aware of Leonardo DiCaprio in all of his movies - and that makes it difficult to give him an Oscar. He doesn't fade into any story that he plays in, becoming the character fully. <br/><br/>In all honesty, I like Tom Hardy's performance a lot better, and I expect that he will win the Oscar for best supporting actor/actress in a movie. His performance is top notch, the accent thick, and the character 100%.<br/><br/>I love DiCaprio's movies, and we have high hopes for the young man. But this movie isn't it."

"crpetersen","9","1","1","10 February 2020"," Brutally beautiful
","'The Revenant' is directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu, and it is a true story set in the 1820s about a man named Hugh Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The movie is about how Glass gets abandoned by his partners in the middle of the woods, severely injured, and how he throughout the entire movie, seeks revenge on the people who were responsible for abandoning him. That's about as much as I can say without spoiling too much.<br/><br/>This movie was absolutely brutal, there were fight scenes that got me clenching to my seat in suspense, especially the climax of the movie. This movie was also extremely harrowing and emotional, and even more so when you know that it is based on a true story. There were rarely any happy moments or nicer moments where you could pause and relax because Glass' journey was not an easy one, it felt like nature was almost constantly against him.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was incredible, and it is also the movie where DiCaprio finally wins an Oscar, and he truly deserves it. His character is a man with few words, but the acting really shines with his body movement and facial expressions. Tom Hardy plays the antagonist, John Fitzgerald, and, though this isn't the best performance he has given, he does a great job here.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the cinematography. I'm immensely impressed by how beautiful this movie is. There were shots from this movie that I couldn't stop staring at, I was perplexed by how amazing everything looked. And the score for this movie also really emphasized the brilliance of the visuals. The moving camera and long shots that were frequently used were also impressive, and it really makes you feel like your running around with everybody else during the battle scenes. The CGI used in this movie was also incredible, at one point the movie features a bear, and it looks absolutely photorealistic.<br/><br/>The only problem that I have with this movie is that the flashback scenes feel a bit confusing and messy, and sometimes the movie can feel a little boring, also due to its long runtime. But otherwise, this movie was superb and definitely worth the watch."
"fernandoschuck-80098","6","1","1","22 September 2019"," Excellent cinematography work
","Well, the feeling while watching this movie is like traveling around with the main character in north american landscapes along 1800s. The plot is really simple and not much explored despite its length (around 2h30) and even some acting problems because of the lack of plot elements and excessive emotional distances presented for the characters, in such a way that I didn't personally get convinced of Di Caprios acting as Hawks father, except on the scenes that depict him as a kid in his village. Apart from that it felt like watching Rambo/Terminator like movies due to the craft of strong/appealing scenes in order to catch the viewers attention during this looong movie. Would say a film made just for Leonardo DiCaprio act during 2h30 and possibly win the Oscar - as he did. Not say the depiction of french as rapists, americans as men who work for their families and of the native americans as part of the scenario only.<br/><br/>Besides the pointed not so great and worthy of any film prizes the strong points of this movie are its scenarios, camera work, photography, and atmosphere created that really pushes the viewer closer to the hardships experienced by its characters, which gives some substance to the movie.<br/><br/>As Inarritu did before with Birdman - also a film crafted for Oscar Awards community - I would say he masters the hacks and drills to direct the movies to win this prize and that's it."

","The Revenant is simply said a beautifully shot movie with some amazing performances from the cast.
I can only say, just watch it, its brilliant.
Its a story about survival and revenge shot in the most beautiful surroundings, with a beautiful soundtrack.
Leonardo dicaprio won an oscar for his role in this movie and its hard to say if the oscar was deserved or if it was because he was nominated several times before and didn't get an oscar.
But he does play his part really well.
The only downside of this movie is that it does get a little boring from time to time and feels a little stretched in certain scenes.
Because of that it didn't get a 9/10 but an 8 but still a beautiful movie that i will watch again and again in the coming years."
"mgruebel","7","1","1","14 July 2019"," DiCaprio CAN act when he wants to
","One of the worst bits of acting I ever saw was DiCaprio as King Louis Quatorze in ""The Man in the Iron Mask."" But then, one of the better bits of acting I have seen was DiCaprio as a man who gets mauled by a bear, watches his son get killed, falls off a cliff with his horse and then has to use the animal as a bivouac ... and so forth. Only reality can bring on such a series of life- and sanity-threatening events, and yet a human being is strong enough to survive and make it back to civilization, such as it is.<br/><br/>The film tries to be ultra-realistic with settings, costuming, and language, and it mostly succeeds very well. The generally excellent camerawork is marred by a few strange choices. For example, when characters are breathing heavily in the cold, there is condensation on the camera lens (more likely, on a glass plate held in front of the camera!). If this is to elicit a 'documentary feel,' well, that would work if the movie were set in 1933, when Technicolor film cameras existed, but not in 1823. Pretending there was a camera catching real life in 1823 actually has the opposite effect: it takes you out of the story thinking what I just said above, and that diminishes the experience of the film.<br/><br/>Not perfect in all respects, but very worth seeing for those who can handle harsh violence, scalping, (simulated) distress and death of animals, and so forth."

","The Revenant is a film I wish I could have seen in the theaters. It's so nice to get big films like this which make a historical setting and all it entails... feel real. You feel like you are in this time period. Everything about this film looks amazing and is shot masterfully. Leonardo Decaprio's acting is amazing, as is Tom Hardy's own performance. There's several stirring sequences and themes that are hard hitting. However, this film drags on and outstays its welcome. It's sluggish pace goes past world-building and into excess. By the time, the final confrontation is happening, you just wish it would be over. At least, I did. It can also be ridiculously over the top. It's first battle which is a one-take would be impressive it it wasn't just one person getting backstabbed and then backstabbed by another for five minutes straight. The terrifying grizzly bear sequence just keeps going, and so does the last fight scene. Movies need to know when to end and how to pace themselves. And this film does not. Despite those gripes, I feel giving this film anything less than 8 is a disservice, even if I didn't not much enjoy it. The director, the cinematographers, and the actor's truly made this film."

Pure magnificence. Clean and pure images of nature being nature: a cruel indomitable mistress. The photography was, unfortunately, mostly padding. It had moments it was necesary, but most of the time it felt just like padding.<br/><br/>The story is solid, with a lot artistic licenses (i.e. lies) over the real tale, but in general the plot and story are solid, but have a problem: they are easily forgotten. You have no idea of the time passing between scenes because the movie refuses to tell you and a revenge tale like this really required to track the time better.<br/><br/>The acting was amazing, although I found the weakest being Poulter (seriously, how do you get work?) followed by DiCaprio. Tom Hardy ate Fitzgerald And Gleeson was born to be Henry. I am not saying DiCaprio do not deserve an Oscar, but this movie was not the reason he deserved it. If you give me rotten meat to eat i could vomit too, where is my Oscar? He deserves it for other movies (I adored him in the Departed and it was the greatest actor in Titanic), but not this one.<br/><br/>In short: Entertaining, well done, beautiful movie that you will forget the moment you see any other movie with a plot.

","""The Revenant"" is a visual and visceral triumph. There are magnificent landscapes, rushing rivers, raging waterfalls, brilliant skies. You truly feel enveloped by nature and sense the constant struggle that the main character, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), endures as he battles the harsh elements. Nature puts Glass, an experienced fur trapper, through a lot, but his fellow man turns out to be far more vicious. DiCaprio's performance as Glass is truly grueling; he has relatively little dialogue (mostly because he's struggling to survive), but he transmits every emotion in the book as he endures agonizing physical and emotional pain, and ultimately, spiritual enlightenment. ""The Revenant"" has some tense, well-staged action scenes amid spectacular scenery and set to a lush symphonic score. Tom Hardy is pure evil as vicious trapper Fitzgerald, Glass' enemy and the object of his vengeance. Hardy's and DiCaprio's scenes together fairly crackle as these two characters battle it out in some epic fight scenes. Some of the dialogue and plot is hard to follow, perhaps because the film goes for authenticity over clarity in some aspects. However, it offers stark beauty and at times, dreadful terror."

The violence is probably one of the most realistic portrayals of this kind of conflict in cinema history. Sadly, the characters are rather one dimensional and we can't really warm to any of them.

","Spoilers! Lots of them!
The first half hour or so of this is totally rivetting, especially on the big screen.
The skirmish/battle scene is one of the best I've ever seen, genuinely terrifying, with the confusion and terror being perfectly rendered on the screen. 
And of course the bear attack, real edge of the seat stuff. 
The do yourself a favour and go home - you've had good value for you money, and if you stay you're about to waste two hours of your life.
What's wrong? It's just silly basically.
The ironically-named Mr Glass (he's indestructable, hence the irony) is so badly injured by the bear he can only move his eyes. Then he can just barely crawl through the woods. Then suddenly he's walking with the aid of a branch. Then he survives a near-freezing river experience without a sign of hypothermia. Then he's jumping on a horse's back. I can't do that and I'm really fit, no bear-mauling damage at all!
Next he has a magic musket. Muskets fire one shot. Then they have to be reloaded. But Mr Glass has acquired the world's first self-loading musket, because it seems able to fire at will, without requiring powder, shot, etc.
He rides of a cliff into the top of a tree then subsequently falls to the ground. No damage, obviously. Mr Indestructable! Then he climbs into the stomach of his dead horse to keep warm, the stomach I presume being around 6 feet or so in length. Gee that was a big horse!
Finally arrives at the fort, almost immediately goes back out to find his arch enemy Tom Grumpy Hardy. With one person accompanying him. Why? Why not 20 men? 
Next he props his shot dead pal on a horse (as a decoy) by putting a branch down the chap's jacket. Why doesn't the dead man simply fall of sideways, or slump off forwards or backwards? No idea. It's magic! 
I really wanted to like this movie, I like Leonardo di Caprio and also Tom Hardy, and the cinematography is good. But this is just daft, silly, an insult to one's intelligence. It's not a fantasy film after all."

","People do not like this movie because it is good- they like it because other people tell them to like it. It is not a good film. It is one of the worst films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I spent two hours on a pile of trash- I was forced to watch it, really, I never wanted to- but I went ahead anyway, and I'm glad I watched it, because now I can warn you about it. Do not watch this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie is boring. But it's also too exciting at the same time. When I saw this film, I thought it had been made by a crazy person, because there was no plot as far as I could tell. All I saw was a neverending cavalcade of images- men running through the snow, getting bloodied up- shadows and lines and whispering, and big burly bearded pioneers. It was like the anti-violence therapy that Alex gets in A Clockwork Orange. I realized that this was a film that cared more about its visuals than its core message- it spent billions on renting and props and setting and cameras- but spent almost nothing on making the characters likable or having any lines. They could have made it a silent movie- nobody ever talks, except for a few seldom occasions. Some screaming, and a grizzled old pioneer tells a crazy story about a dead chipmunk or something- but that's it. The script mast have been three pages long. <br/><br/>I don't like Leonardo DiCaprio- I had never seen a film with him in it before this one- so I didn't need to be confused about which grizzled old pioneer he was. But I was so confused. All the bearded mountain men looked identical- I couldn't even tell the protagonist from the villain. I didn't even know there was a villain until the very end, when they meet up with each other. I did not know what was going on. All I saw was snow and men and blood. Everything about it was unclear. <br/><br/>It was disgusting- he falls off cliffs, gets eaten by a bear, swims in sub zero water, eats a stomach or something- this is a snuff film, not a historical drama. I do not want to watch a man come near death for two long hours. But even the most action packed scenes did not excite me- strangely, they bored me. I was bored by this movie. It's not a good movie.<br/><br/>It was made by the same stupid idiot as Birdman- I should have guessed- and we can see, in the first scene, that it is made by the same idiot as Birdman. The first scene has a bunch of pioneers stumbling around, setting up camp- and it's all taken in ONE SHOT, and the perspective of the camera sways around the actors, zigzagging- and then they get attacked by some indians, and they run around, and the camera follows them, instead of just staying still- all just in ONE SHOT- and then we get some cuts, which are nice, because I hate that ""one shot"" business that the guy always gives us. He did it enough in Birdman- he didn't need to do it here.<br/><br/>Also, they added Native Americans in- even though the guy in real life DIDN'T HAVE ANY INDIAN RELATIVES- in fact, the guy who made this movie was criticized for how historically inaccurate it was- how dramatized it was, all in the hopes of getting some more cash from gullible suckers- how much unnecessary violence there was in it- and how he just added some Indians in there to be politically correct. How sad. How sad. There do not need to be any Indians. Not racist, it's just that there shouldn't be any Indians if there WEREN'T any Indians. This film is absolute trash from the gutter. Do not watch it. It is a waste of money."

"zkonedog","5","1","1","26 February 2017"," Not Terrible, But Potentially Very Overrated Depending On Taste
","When I first saw the promotional materials for ""The Revenant"", I wasn't all that excited. Wilderness/survival films aren't usually my cup of tea, and while I can appreciate the acting of Leonardo DiCaprio, his presence in a film doesn't usually vault it to the top of my ""must-see"" lists. But then, slowly but surely, ""Revenant"" became the film that any self-respecting film fan ""must see"" in order to accurately judge this cycle's Academy Awards. It even strongly positioned DiCaprio to win his first Oscar. So, I climbed aboard the hype train and finally went to see it. While it isn't a bad movie by any means, I left the theater thinking it has the potential to be very disappointing to people who don't really know what it is about or what it tries to accomplish.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Revenant"" is the story of Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), a fur trader in 1820s America. The basics of his character are that he's a bit of an outcast, having married an Indian woman (now dead) and having a son with her. He also happens to be the best scout of his trading group, so he's still accepted by Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). However, when Glass sustains horrific injuries after being mauled by a bear, he is left behind with fellow trader John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). Fitzgerald isn't nearly as sympathetic to Glass as the others, however, and basically leaves him for dead. But not so fast...as Glass proves again and again his determination to survive even in the face of insurmountable odds.<br/><br/>I think the major misconception I had about this movie was that it would be a dramatic epic...but it isn't. It looks like an epic and has been touted as an epic, but at its core that isn't what ""The Revenant"" is all about. It's actually more of an artistic picture, filled with long, lingering, and beautiful cinematography, some strange/bizarre dream sequences, and just that overall sense that the ""look"" of the film itself was more important than the story/characters.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong...the cinematography in ""Revenant"" is some of the best I've ever seen on the big screen. That's why I can still give the move a three-star rating, as it is a visual treat in the way it portrays its wilderness setting. Seemingly around every corner is a new adventure or obstacle that must be faced, and all of those scenarios are filmed in a unique, rollicking style.<br/><br/>However, I was just expecting a bit more of a fleshed-out story and maybe some better- developed characters (this seems to start off as a character study of Glass but then morphs into a simple revenge tale). In terms of acting, I also don't quite understand why this is ""the movie"" to (maybe) finally get DiCaprio his little gold statue. His performance is good, but I didn't find anything spectacular about it. Personally, I thought the best character/acting of the whole piece was Tom Hardy's brooding, violent Fitzgerald, as I felt that he was creating emotional drama instead of just reacting to the next obstacle along the way (my evaluation of Leo's performance).<br/><br/>So, overall, ""The Revenant"" didn't live up to it's hype for me. I was decently entertained, but that was about it. Now, someone who has a keener eye/appreciation for pure cinematography than I might find it utterly riveting, but that just wasn't to be for me.

","I love this period of history, and this movie gives us a feel for what it must have been like.<br/><br/>There is something awe inspiring about that push out from the eastern seaboard of America just before and after the War of Independence. It took amazing characters to enter that vast wilderness and face its dangers including some of the most formidable warriors ever to twang a bowstring.<br/><br/>To be honest I enjoy this aspect of American history more than Westerns, which are usually set at a later period. ""The Revenant"" captures the harshness of the times and is simply an amazing looking film. The actors and the crew suffered for this one and it shows.<br/><br/>Now with that said, there are a couple of things that did bother me. When you have watched thousands of movies over more than 60 years, your ears become attuned to language that suits the times. As Somerset Maugham once said, it has to sound right. There are a number of phrases in ""The Revenant"" that jar the ear because I know they only date from a few decades back. ""The kid's been beating himself up"", just doesn't sound very James Fenimore Cooper. I put this down to the fact that none of the key filmmakers were born before 1960 including the guy who wrote the book.<br/><br/>Does it wreck the movie? Well no, but it is a point worth bearing in mind when you go to make your historical movie - maybe you need a bleary-eyed old film buff to give your script the once over. <br/><br/>The other thing that bothers me a little is that this is based on a true story and it didn't end quite like it does in the movie. In fact it seems that the real Hugh Glass was a little more forgiving than Leo's character - but then we wouldn't have had that epic MMA fight with blades at the end.<br/><br/>The film has plenty of wince-inducing scenes that make you wonder how they were done; the bear attack in particular. And I'll certainly take that tip about gutting and crawling into an animal carcass if I ever lock myself out of my car on a cold night.<br/><br/>Despite the occasional anachronism, ""The Revenant"" is one of those movies I will enjoy watching more than once, no doubt discovering rewarding new elements each time."

","This movie has an utterly convincing opening scene along with some of the best cinematography I've seen in a 21st Century film .... character development not so much to the extent that when Hawk dies ( thus propelling the narrative thrust of the tale ) we probably don't care as much as we should since we don't learn much about him. Tom Hardy's badass may be the sole characterization that keeps the simplistic story afloat as most of the peripheral players are sketches that are never fully fleshed out. The movie seems a bit long but has scattered well constructed action vignettes featuring Leonardo as "" Glass "" proving he's anything but by enduring a bear mauling, freezing, suffocation, being buried alive, going over a cliff and waterfalls plus some other stuff so that at some point you expect him to rip off his buckskin to expose the Superman logo which would also provide some product placement studio crossover exploitation.At one point he's so damaged that he can't walk or talk, pulling himself along on his arms, reprising his quaalude crawl in another flick, perhaps honing his specialty as the actor that can crawl convincingly. Fortunately a night in a quick built sweat lodge is good for what ails you. Overall, generally entertaining with stunning visuals to make sure you keep watching."

","Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy star in this 2015 drama based on the novel and inspired by true events. This takes place in the 1800's and DiCaprio (Titanic) plays Hugh Glass, a frontiersman who leads a hunting expedition. Soon, Glass is injured by a bear and left for dead by one of his men, John Fitzgerald (Hardy) who not only betrays him, but murders his son. Glass struggles to survive the wilderness while regaining his strength and health to find Fitzgerald. This is a great film with suspenseful and heartfelt moments, DiCaprio definitely gives an Oscar-worthy performance and there's beautiful, remote settings. The film also shares similarities with ""The Grey,"" ""Deliverance"" and ""Cast Away."" I recommend this."
"robinwright-59089","7","1","1","27 May 2016"," Revenent remake of ""Man in the Wilderness"" from the 70s
","I liked this film, mostly, and I get where the director is coming from as he uses pictures to give us HIS impression of the cruelty of Nature. DeCaprio has been better in his other films in my view. Everything is so bleak, so damp, so dark and depressing the way the director shoots in the Wintertime without much color adds to this harsh view of Nature and of America's early struggles to settle the land. There is an intensity about this film, a mood that is pervasive and deeply negative and sad. Inarritu is no Nature lover and no lover of American history. He is clearly pointing the finger at the white man for the atrocities done to the wildlife, like the bloodbath scene where beavers corpses run red rivers of blood through the snow, and Indians whose ghostly appearance and homelessness add another visual argument against the settlers. Bart the Bear also takes some revenge against Americans through his/her vicious attack on DeCaprio/Glass. Those were some violent but intriguing scenes to watch. <br/><br/>But I thought Man in the Wilderness was soooo much better. And its message was far less political, more human, more pure survivalist, far more in depth character development. Rent it if you can. It's an oldy but goody. It's really interesting how similar the two protagonist's names are: Glass in Revenent and Bass in Man in the Wilderness. <br/><br/>The Nature in the older version is so stunningly beautiful that I still remember this 30 years later. I think this is more realistic than Inarritu's bleak pictures, and more dangerous. It's because Nature is so beautiful that people get themselves into trouble. The allure and distraction leads to letting one's guard down in a place that can easily kill you."

Granted, during part of the film all he does is lying down, but even then, the acting he does with only his facial expressions is immensely powerful.

After being attacked by a wild bear, Glass' luck turns from bad to worse, as his crew leaves him for dead.

"anabel813","8","1","1","11 April 2016"," American Frontier, Man v. Man or Man v. Nature?
","One of the most recent controversial questions in Hollywood is—did Leonardo DiCaprio deserve an Oscar for his role in The Revenant? My answer would have to be yes. Leo's portrayal of Hugh Glass, a frontiersman in the 1820's, who after being mauled by a bear is left for dead by the film's antagonist, one of his own frontiersmen, was powerful, striking and memorable. DiCaprio's commitment to playing this role is undeniable. His dedication was so complete that he became almost unrecognizable in the transformation. <br/><br/>Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu, who previously won an Academy Award for his movie Birdman, directs The Revenant. The film contains many beautifully vivid scenes of the wilderness and the frontier, switching settings between many landscapes including tall trees, green woodland, and turbulent riverbanks to the white cold mountains and icy, panoramic terrains. <br/><br/>At its core, this is a revenge movie about a guy who perseveres no matter what comes at him, (and a lot does); he sets out on a path of revenge. However, the film also portrays the many relationships between the American frontiersman and the Native American people. On one side, we can see the hostile, violent and warfare interactions between both peoples almost at every scene. But we can also see the goodwill and compassionate friendships between some characters. In the main character, there is an established relationship with a Native American woman with whom he has a half Native American son. Their relationship and bond is the one that holds the movie together and makes the viewer sympathize with the characters. There is also the character of Bridger (played by actor Will Porter), who shows sympathy and kindness to Native American characters throughout the movie. I enjoyed that we got to see different points of views towards the Native American peoples. Tom Hardy plays the role of the antagonist that Glass seeks for revenge, John Fitzgerald, a man who is not only malicious to the Native Americans but who only looks out for himself and will put an end to anything that stands in his way. Similar to Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy was almost unrecognizable in this role. <br/><br/>The film does very well at depicting the struggles at the frontier. There's a constant ambiance of violence and hostility that can be felt from just watching most of these scenes. The film depicts an accurate account of man vs. nature. Nature almost seems to be its own character in the film, one who the main character has to fight and is in constant struggle with. Having to survive freezing weather, attacks from animals, and struggling against raging waters, the main character finds a huge obstacle in Mother Nature. Now beware, the movie is R Rated for a reason. There are a lot of violent, gory, bloody scenes and also a rape scene. DiCaprio's character goes through one too many ordeals. And you're stuck wondering ""what else can possibly happen to this guy?' Bad luck doesn't even begin to cut it. Or maybe we should say good luck because somehow he makes it out alive, time and time again. Most of the scenes were excruciating to watch. Especially the bear scene when Glass first gets attacked. <br/><br/>The film, though very violent, juxtaposes tender moments between father and son, and Glass and his wife. The scenes that tug at the heartstrings are the flashbacks and the metaphors spoken by his now deceased wife. These flashbacks help with the sentimentality of the story. And it also doesn't hurt that they are beautiful and aesthetically shot scenes. <br/><br/>The Revenant is a high-intensity film that will leave you at the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. Along with great landscape visuals and strong acting, it makes for a must watch movie. This following quote spoken from Glass to his son, Hawk, captures the overall vibe of the movie, ""I will be right here right here. As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight. You breathe, keep breathing."""
"Jerghal","9","1","1","11 April 2016"," A Cinematic Tour de force
","The Revenant really is a cinematic tour de force. The landscapes and vistas in this film are just gorgeous to look at but at the same time it's a very raw, gritty and gruesome experience. I think the Revenant puts a final stop to pointless arguments that 35mm film is better than digital cameras. Originally planned to be shot on film they decided to shoot 60% on Arri Alexa XT's and 40% on Alexa 65 (65mm size 6.5K sensor). The colors are vibrant but natural, and the play of light and darkness is sublime. Also the absence of film grain (an advantage of shooting digital) removes the veil between the audience and the captured images. I bet when this comes out on Ultra-HD in HDR that this will be a reference disc often used to demo the capabilities of those OLED flatscreens. Soundwise we're in for a treat as well. The rumbling of waterfalls, the roars of the bear and rustling of the wind through the trees is brilliantly mixed and mastered. There are 630 VFX shots in this film and I can tell you, you might spot a few but most are perfectly executed and absolutely invisible. The scene with the bear, might god...looks so real. As for the acting, an Oscar well deserved for Leo. And Tom Hardy is quite excellent as well. So a movie I very highly recommend, though it is as harsh as it is beautiful, it surely is one to put on the bucket list."
"BeneCumb","7","1","1","9 February 2016"," Protracted plot and violent floundering exalted by direction, camera-work and 2 fine performances
","I tend to appreciate Alejandro G. Iñárritu and I have begun to notice Leonardo DiCaprio's strengths, but I am pretty sure that without vast advertising and multiple wins and nominations I would have postponed The Revenant for much later. But now I have seen it and I cannot say it was boring or disappointing... but no wow! either.<br/><br/>Apparently there are still more elements I liked: direction, cinematography, magnificently created scenes (e.g. fighting with bear, riding into the ravine), two eminent performances (DiCaprio and Mother Nature - yes, nature here was no supporting actor, but a leading one), wide use of non-US actors (seemed that US ones were in minority), but its sparse plot stretched into almost 2.5 hours and long staying on violent scenes diminished the total value for me, I felt sometimes that I was watching Discovery channel... Plus the thing that some actors were so ""defaced"" that they were difficult to recognize, Thomas Hardy included; well, the latter is a good actor, but I am a bit hesitant regarding his Oscar nomination for his John Fitzgerald.<br/><br/>All in all, Mr. Iñárritu and others knew how and managed to do well, but it is hardly a movie you would multiple times, unless you masochistically try to feel ""abandoned but wild"" while sitting in the warmth on the sofa and ponder on and over how one could survive in the 1st half of 19th century when eating raw fish was not eating sushi and raw meat was no Boeuf a la tartar..."
"RResende","Null","1","1","30 January 2016"," Blood and Snow. Bear and Flesh.
","It's wonderful to follow the path of people who are never afraid to try, no matter how comfortable and applauded they already are in whatever they are doing.<br/><br/>So here we have Iñarritu who has been working on story layering from the beginning of his career, first with the wonderful Arriaga as a partner. Together they have created 3 films with some of the best writing ever in the history of cinema, layered writing, stuff that is now kicking in and becoming the standard of film (and TV!) stories; the kind of bricks we use to remember our own lives.<br/><br/>After their collaboration Iñarritu did Biutiful, which almost as strong in its territory as you can get, but almost intentionally stripped of any of the layers that had been so masterfully built in the trilogy. Somehow it looked as though Iñarritu (and Lubezki) was actually ""just"" the visual vessel to which Arriaga poured his dreams. But Birdman tells otherwise, and indeed builds a whole new version of layered stories, meta-narrative and ways to dream.<br/><br/>Now Iñarritu gets into Herzog's territory, using the Biutiful approach: to have the story as quiet and simple as possible, here nearly absent, and get you to enter the journey by means of visual enchantment. Something like cinematic hypnosis. You're simply enticed to follow it, move along, survive with the character, suffer with him. The trick is simple: we are always with Dicaprio, we are him, we suffer what he does, and we aim at the same things that he does. So here we get the concept of classical hero revived and recovered, supported by the , as usual, brilliant photography of Lubezki (what a master...).<br/><br/>This is a wonderful experience, which in my opinion balances the graphic violence as the conductor of the story as Wook Park does in his trilogy of revenge. But it falls a little short of what Herzog did in the 70', and i suppose the reasons are relatively easy to identify. Leonardo is no Klaus, not as crazy as him, and not as ready to travel to Madnessland with a one way ticket as Kinski was willing to do (and did). And the whole production is not about a bunch of guys living the madness they are trying to film. This is probably as risky a film as you can get from Hollywood, but it is still Hollywood. This is an almost extreme film about an extreme (real) story, which is unbelievable, except for the fact that it actually happened.<br/><br/>I'm guessing that if he keeps doing what he has done after Babel, next time Iñarritu will reward us with a multi-layered narrative complex gem like Birdman. But the time after that maybe he will loose his mind, Coppola-style, and maybe he will really go up the river where this time he only washed his feet. Maybe he will actually spill the blood over the snow, instead of just enacting it. Someday maybe he will complete an opera house in the middle of some jungle, although i don't think Iñarritu is the type of artist who needs to leave his writing table to change our lives.<br/><br/>Dicaprio will probably get an Oscar for this one. I think he is a clever actor who senses where talent is and goes with it, in the tradition of Brad Pitt. But i don't think this is superlative acting, merely competent moaning. He has had more demanding roles already.<br/><br/>4."

","The Revenant is certainly a beautiful movie, worth seeing on the big screen, but probably only once. It's entertaining, but not in a repeatable way. I can't imagine people wanting to see this movie multiple times because it's just so goddamn brutal and punishing.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a gruesome and intense battle that rivals Saving Private Ryan and its depiction of D-Day. And just when you think you're safe to take a few swigs from your flask, our ""hero"" gets mauled (not raped) by a female bear protecting her cubs. The scene is supposedly a very accurate depiction of being mauled by a bear. That's nice, about as nice as ordering an appetizer of four fried wontons and getting five.<br/><br/>The good captain inexplicably leaves our hero behind with the one man who has consistently expressed his racist hatred for our hero's son, and who has consistently expressed his belief that our hero should be put out of his misery like a horse with a broken ankle.<br/><br/>I was reminded of a few other movies: Jeremiah Johnson, with its holy-hell vengeance; Antichrist, with its slow brutality in the woods; Ravenous, for the lovely scenes of eating raw meat; and Papillion, for its fabulist mythology.<br/><br/>We get a lot of grunting and crawling, an occasional slice of the supernatural, brutal amoral greed, and a search for tenderness in a world that just doesn't give a damn. For anyone wondering why people chose to live in the wilderness in such terrible conditions, just watch The Revenant."

","The Revenant is one of the most beautifully shot movies I have ever seen. The opening scene alone will make you wonder how the hell they did this. There are so many creative shots with sweeping camera angles and beautiful vistas. For that alone I'd recommend seeing it.<br/><br/>As the story goes, its based on true event. The real story of Hugh Glass is an incredible story about the will to survive and the need for revenge. The Revenant portrays that very well. At times it's brutal, savage, and unforgiving, like what frontier life was probably like in the early 19th century.<br/><br/>The acting is all well done, from Dicaprio as the lead to Hardy as the villain; they were all convincing. The only knock I have about this movie is the pacing and length. I knew going in being familiar with the story that there were going to be slow parts, a wounded man clinging to life and traveling through the wilderness was bound to have slow parts.<br/><br/>Visually alone, I think most cinemaphiles will have a lot to like about this movie as well for people who are interested in the the time period.

","There are many people in the world, and there are many films in the world. So, it only makes sense that everyone's definition of a good film would vary, and that everyone would watch a film for different reasons. Most people watch movies for fun. To kill a Friday, to be entertained, to laugh a little. Fewer watch films to experience the craft of it all. To follow the Oscars, to admire cinematography and direction, and to take in all the things that make films great. Until I saw ""The Revenant,"" I believed that those were the only two reasons worth discussing, as they were the two most prevalent in our society. But this film is not just for entertainment, nor is it something to watch just to feel smart. The Revenant is viscerally powerful and terrifyingly real, and something entirely new that I've rightfully heard called ""visual poetry.""<br/><br/>Maybe it's the breathtaking, masterful cinematography - ambitiously and successfully crafted using only natural light - that categorizes this film as such. Perhaps it's the direction, which causes everything about the film to appear so seamlessly realistic that the audience is forced into the world as if we are experiencing its horrors right along with the characters (most unique and effective is Iñárritu's purposeful emphasis on the camera: at three points, Hugh Glass fogs the claustrophobic lens with his breath, and during the perfectly envisioned ending, Glass stares right into the camera, all the pain and suffering he has felt represented in his eyes as they stare, haunted but finally peaceful, straight at the audience). And maybe its the performances, so unbelievably nuanced and emotionally devastating by DiCaprio (gunning for an extremely deserved first Oscar in perhaps a career-best performance), Hardy (in the conversation for a very worthy first nomination in a wonderfully villainous but 3-dimensional role) and Gleeson (proving once again to the world that he's the next DiCarpio by appearing in four Oscar-worthy films in one year). Whatever heavenly combination of sheer craft, storytelling capabilities, and divine intervention brought this revolutionary film to the screen, I am eternally grateful. It is not simple entertainment, although its narrative is riveting. It is not your usual Oscar bait, although any and all Oscar wins would be monumentally deserving. The Revenant is what happens when every aspect of film is brought together perfectly and seamlessly constructed to create one horrifyingly real but astronomically memorable experience."

","The scenery was gorgeous. It is amazing that the director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, went through the trouble of filming at locations that must have been extremely difficult for the actors and crew. However, by doing this, he kept the authenticity of the story. I appreciate an effort such as this, as opposed to CGI. All of the actors were strong and convincing. And, I can forgive the lack of continuity in a few scenes. My issue with The Revenant was time. This movie is too long. It drags at many places, making it boring. It could have been trimmed by thirty to forty-five minutes without losing any of the story. That would have made it a much more ""edge of your seat"" exciting film."

","After winning the Oscar for Birdman last year, Alejandro González Iñárritu takes the viewers into a much different setting with The Revenant. The Revenant is the story of Hugh Glass, remarkably portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is left for dead by his fellow fur- trappers after he encounters a bear which terrifyingly mauls him. The scene is undoubtedly one of the boldest, gut-wrenching and wonderfully captured scene the Hollywood has ever done.<br/><br/>There is also a sub-plot here, which shines light on the Natives (Arikara) about how they once held all of America and are now just an endangered species on the brink of extinction as one of the natives says in the film : ""You all have stolen everything from us. The land, the animals.""<br/><br/>One of the recurring theme in the movie is that how the elder member does whatever he can to protect his family. This theme is not only restricted to humans, but also to the animals which is understood when the bear slashes Glass in an attempt to protect her cubs. The skulls of the bulls, which appear many times in Glass' visions, symbolize the same theme. Bull or bison, is mostly referred in Native Indian traditions to a strong,powerful animal which never backs down from a struggle and always strives to protect it's family. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy plays a brilliant villain, who though isn't always wrong, but has little to none redeeming qualities making him a cold- hearted, harsh and an uncompromising villain. The rest of the crew don't have major involvement in the plot but play their roles perfectly. <br/><br/>The aspect of the movie that excels and stands out most is its beautiful cinematography. Emmanuel Lubezki has once again done an incredible job capturing beautiful imagery and landscapes completely immersing the viewer in the setting. I could feel every cold breeze as it passed, every splash of water and an overwhelming feeling after looking at the beauty of nature.<br/><br/>In conclusion, The Revenant is a pulse pounding,absorbing and visceral journey which perfectly captures the time period and the setting. It is a pure survival story providing a simple plot which is perfectly executed with every actor playing their roles perfectly so viewers can connect to them and every shot is gorgeous enough to move the viewer inside and keep him seated for this incredibly epic and mesmerizing journey. <br/><br/>The Revenant deserves a 9/10."

His films are generally not my cup of tea –even though his talent is undeniable. This time around, however, he truly outdid himself and actually showed that he can soar at the same heights as Kurosawa himself. <br/><br/>The Revenant is a revolutionary piece of film-making in how they managed to use natural light, breath-taking camera angles, incredible action sequences, long shots, stunning locations and previously unseen special effects. <br/><br/>The pace, length and rhythm of the movie are exactly what they need to be for an epic tale of this magnitude. The performances by the entire cast are memorable, and Lubezki's camera-work is peerless. <br/><br/>In short, I find it hard to recall a movie as engaging, realistic and groundbreaking as The Revenant.

","When i left this movie I had trouble putting my finger on exactly what I thought about it, but the one conclusive statement was 'Meh'; although annoyingly i couldn't really capture why. It has most of the ingredients I usually dig in a movie. The acting is good. The characters have depth. The story is good. The intro scene with the pelt hunting was awesome directing. The main character is a total bad-ass! Everyone is believable, although it took a little while to get used to Tom Hardy's characters voice, which at first it was hard to understand. It overwhelmingly felt like a Terrance Malik movie (which for the most part I dig). It was brooding and nature was as much of a main character in the film as the actors were portraying. I guess my main gripe was that it was too long. Not the movie as such, but most of the scenes or shots. They just felt like they took too long. Lingering shots of sky, or trees or water, or actors but just a few seconds too long than I think they needed to be to make me feel differently. When done consistently throughout a 2.5 hour film, i think it threw off the pacing in a weird way. It's worth watching definitely. It's pretty and dirty at the same time.

","Finally a movie worth writing a review about, I give this movie 10 stars for the following reasons. The acting was stellar, Leonardo and tom's best acting thus far. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking, you actually feel like you're there, you can almost smell the ice and mud. I felt transported back to the 1800's. This story is about frontiersman, Hugh Glass, who get's gravely injured and left for dead by his comrades. What comes next is a tale of survival, tears, pain and the ultimate revenge , What a combo!<br/><br/>From beginning to end I was at the edge of my seat. I even caught myself holding my breath a few times. There are a few scenes not for the feint of heart so children beware! I foresee many Oscars for this one. BRAVO!!!"

","So great movies this year, but only a few were phenomenal, and one of the phenomenal film of this year is ""The Revenant"" , directed by Alejandro González Inarritu. The plot of this movie is very simple: A man is left for dead by two people and one of them killed his child, and this man, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is going for revenge. When the film starts, I knew this movie will be great. I was right. The acting is incredible, with a powerful performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, probably is going to win the Oscar for this performance, a perfect acting by DiCaprio, who suffers very much for this role but it worth it, because I was incredible fascinating by this performance. Tom Hardy is also very good, one of the best role of his entire career, and he deserves to be nominated for best supporting actor. The image of this movie is incredible,is amazing, because this movie was filmed only with natural lights, the fire, the sun, the moon, incredible achievement. This movie look so real, that when the main character is in the cold water, is like you are in there and this blew me away and this cinematography by Emmanuel Lubeski is one of the best that I've seen. In this movie is a scene, involving a bear, that almost killed the main character, and I was asking myself:""how they do that"", because it was so tense, so incredible, is one of the best scene that I've seen this year, an amazing scene, shot beautifully. The star of this film is Alejandro G.Inarritu, who directed this film with passion, with beauty, is a Oscar-worthy, and I think that he is going to win again for best director. ""The Revenant"" is a brutal, violent and rough movie, but also is beautiful, the views are breath-taking, with powerful performances and superb directing, a Oscar-worthy for Best Picture of The Year and my favourite movie of 2015."

There are so many good things I can say about this movie, but I will keep it short. There is no way that this film should have lost to Spotlight.

","Webster defines revenant as someone who comes back after death. (So reincarnation is real?) In 1823, frontiersman Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) is left for dead after a vicious attack by a bear that was only protecting her cubs. Glass somehow survives and must find John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who killed his son and who abandoned him.<br/><br/>I had reservations about watching this movie as I knew I will follow Hugh Glass, who will endure much pain for a very long time. Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Yes, Leo DiCaprio was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor. However, if truth be known, Leo DiCaprio should have won that award for Blood Diamond, or The Great Gatsby and possibly many more. He is that good. When a performer raises the talent level of all those around him, and does that often, he or she deserves the Oscar. Think about that, Academy. This cast performed beyond all expectations. And let's give some kudos to Director Alejandro G. Inarritu who put all this together and won the award for Best Director. Kudos.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is Glass' determination to survive the elements, Indians, and his own weakened health. One wonders how some of those scenes were done as they are simply breathtaking. Watch a horse and rider (Glass) go over a cliff into a tree. Wow! Glass swimming against a strong current. Hey, and let's not forget about the cameramen and the work they did. Outstanding. <br/><br/>Aside from all the survival tactics employed by Glass to survive, the plot is a simple one: Get healthy and find and kill Fitzgerald. <br/><br/>Subtitles were used generously mostly in the beginning and let's face it: they were not necessary. Also the Fitzgerald character (Hardy) was practically the only one to use F-bombs a lot when he didn't agree with the decision, by Glass, to abandon the river boat, hide the furs and walk back to the fort. <br/><br/>As I watched, I had the feeling that that here was DiCaprio winning the Best Actor Award. And it was sometimes hard to actually realize that Hugh Glass was a real person who lived through all this, and it was probably much worse than depicted as we saw on the screen by DiCaprio.<br/><br/>So when all was said and done and Oscars were awarded for Best Director, Best Actor, best Supporting Actor (Hardy), something was missing: The film did not get the award for Best Picture. Sad. (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, mostly in the beginning."
"eliuson","8","3","6","10 April 2016"," Nature reigns in a harsh environment
","As of now, I've watched it 3 times and I plan on seeing it one more time Plot: A furtrapper is left for dead by members of his own team after being severely attacked by a grizzly bear. At first sight, it might appear this is too simplistic and yet it makes for gripping storytelling.<br/><br/>What makes this compellingly unique? First off, Alejandro González Iñarritu and Emanuel Lubezki have created a visual oddisey unlike anything I've ever seen, Each frame symbolically represents spiritual awakening and yet it paradoxically separates itself from being one by positioning the human element at it's core in which our sinful nature encompasses our hatred, the need to survive,making a means (in which capitalism is cemented itself) which in turn gives us the relationship between man vs man, man vs nature eventually leading up to us being the weaker element in comparison to the vastness of the universe.<br/><br/>Secondly, Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom hardy are at their absolute best embodying the aforementioned elements. We witnessed Leo's odissey of recovery through the vastness of nature believing it means him encountering God though as it meant redemption given that a handful of flashbacks serves the idea of him regretting what he had turned into and what mankind has turned into, nonetheless he thinks avenging the death of his son portrays the very notion of spirituality and yet Tom Hardy's notion of survival is by making of means out of anything embodies the very opossite of Leonardo Dicaprio and yet you emphatize with him given the harsh conditions he is going through. Hardy even thinks of God as a squirrel, it is clear that this character has an understanding of life in terms of making his way through a harsh envirnment yet he is so naive and disingenous about his way of life.<br/><br/>This juxtapostion leads to a very grueling fight between this two main characters in which nature embraces its own very elements seeing this men fighting for nothing. We are mere dust, there is no time for redemption, no spirituality. As Leo stares into the camera we realize that his journey meant nothing to him and yet it reaches cosmic significance.<br/><br/>A phenomenal masterpiece!"

","Amazing movie.<br/><br/>The atmosphere and photography were amazing. Plot and suspense as devices to ""driven ""art are terribly overrated. A movie ( or a book) don't even need a plot to work ( in fact we have several examples of non plot driven director and writers, just out of my mind Cassavettes and Bunuel) atmosphere is much more important.<br/><br/>The criticism of the movie saying it lacked suspense says more of the spectator than of the movie itself. If you are expecting suspense from every source of art you partake in soon enough you will be disappointed. There is a limited amount of stuff that can astound us. Great plot driven movies are very very very rare.<br/><br/>In fact the modern audience is much too spoiled. They not only expect never ending entertainment (complaining that the movie is slow even if takes little breaks from action) but also have a high expectation of ""twists"" and meaningful endings.<br/><br/>This movie goes directly into cinematic history greatness, it has a dash of everything.

It was filmed on set in parts of Southern Argentina and British Columbia. I certainly think DiCaprio deserved the Oscar for this performance. The bear scene is a little bit hard to watch at times, but overall I would say this is a beautifully made film.

","This movie is simply a journey through the minds of director Alejandro G. Inneritu and Emmanuel Lubezki, fuelled with creativity and flair from the offset. The cinematography in this film is gorgeous. It is an honour to watch such a spectacularly filmed movie, it's almost like a dream. Although some shots may seem repetitive (low angle tree shots) the shots seem relevant and important to the film as it focuses on the harsh reality of nature and the environment in which we live in. The representation of the 19th century is also a brilliantly executed aspect of this movie, showing the viewer what times were like in the era and how difficult it was to earn money.<br/><br/>The narrative of this film is simple yet underestimated. Revenge is always a tricky topic to cover for film makers, as sometimes it can end up being somewhat far fetched or cheesy, but this time, it was really effective and had me hooked from the moment Hugh Glass' journey to find Hardy begins. The acting is always the crucial part of any film, and in this particular film, it needed to be the best performance for all involved, which would be tricky as DiCaprio and Tom Hardy have had extremely impacting careers. As for Tom Hardy, this was undeniably his best 'Supporting Actor' role, showing the fierce, unrelenting nature of his character and in end, rewarding the actor with his first Oscar nomination. For DiCaprio, I believe it was up there with his best performances, but the lack of dialogue from his character could not mean that it was his best unfortunately. This does not in any way mean that his performance was anything other than world class and he deserved all credit received from this film, if not more, for me, The Wolf of Wall Street was his best, closely followed by his short spell as Calvin Candie in Django Unchained.<br/><br/>Overall, the film showed positive signs in all aspects, notably visual effects, make up and costume design, as well as the obvious directing and acting, but it was not perfect. However, I would recommend the film to any passionate film fan, especially fans of cinematography and directing."

Hugh Glass fights for surviving the bitter cold after he is left behind by his team in 1820s.He survives the bitter cold and seeks shelter and warmth inside body of a dead horse after he removes all organs. I love the scenes where Hugh crawls into dead horse empty on the inside. I enjoyed when Hugh makes friends with the native American and enjoys sticking out his tongue and making happy sounds. The scenes when Hugh sees his young son dragged and killed are done very well.

","The Revenant is truly something to behold. It's beautifully shot and maybe even more impressively directed. This could have easily gone awry in the wrong director's hands, but Alejandro Iñárritu makes it look too easy.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio plays a fur trapper in the American Northwest in 1823. He and his crew are on the run after escaping a Native American ambush. One day, after going off on his own, he is attacked and savagely injured by a grizzly bear in a scene that will stay with you for a very long time. It might be one of the most intense sequences in film history. Nearly dying, he is deemed, by Tom Hardy's character, as too risky to be carried along with them, so Hardy leaves DiCaprio to die.<br/><br/>The film is really long, but riveting. Not once does your mind wander to something else. Scene after scene is like nothing you've seen before.<br/><br/>This film is about revenge, but it's also about moral decisions. It's never preachy, but those who wish to get something out of it will. It's hard to watch, but completely rewarding in the end. And there may have never been such a dark film that is also this beautiful to look at.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy, while audibly incomprehensible at times, plays grimly sadistic to perfection. From the beginning, he walks around like nothing ever bad is going to happen to him. He's cocky, but there's something subtle in his tone that makes you believe that he's unsure of himself subconsciously--even though he thinks no one notices. Perhaps they don't. <br/><br/>It's a no brainer that DiCaprio has given the best performance of the year, even if just for his commitment to making his character real. The film is shot in actual freezing temperatures and throughout the entire thing you really do feel his pain--just from the piercing cold itself. He's in a league of his own with this one. <br/><br/>But if we're going to talk about commitment, we must also discuss Iñárritu's insistence that there will be no green screen used and everything that happens will be happening for real. Last year, Iñárritu's film Birdman won the Oscar for Best Picture. This is a step even above that. Birdman was filmed in a controlled setting. Watching The Revenant, you feel like everyone on set is playing with fire. The fact that they get a breathtaking film out of it is superbly impressive.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 100"

","In ""The Revenant"" Leonardo DiCaprio is real-life fur trapper guide named Hugh Glass. In the 1830s, Hugh and his half-Pawnee son, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) led a group of fur trappers in the forests he knew so well. These men were at a high risk for animal attacks, Indian attacks, and the unpredictable way winter can turn stormy and life threatening. The leader of the fur trappers is John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and he and Hugh do not get along. <br/><br/>In fact, John denigrates Hawk because of the boy's half Caucasian/half Indian ancestry. Hugh keeps the peace between them, but it is short lived. Hugh is alone in the woods watching a couple bear cubs whose mother comes along and attacks him. Hugh kills the female bear with his knife after she nearly kills him. The men make a stretcher of sorts for Hugh, but hauling the man around in it in sub-zero weather is making everyone tense.<br/><br/>John asks Hugh if he should let him die and with the blinking of his eyes, Hugh agrees to this. Just as John is ready to finish off Hugh, Hawk intervenes and John kills the boy. John and his men dig a hole and put Hugh in it after taking the man's gun. Hugh is barely alive and not ready to throw off the mortal coil. He digs himself out and wants to get revenge on the men who killed his son, took his gun, and left him for dead.<br/><br/>The revenant of the story is the wife and mother of Hugh and his son. Huge's wife was killed when the Indian village was attacked. Her ghost aka the revenant guides Hugh along his quest the men who left him for dead. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is wonderful as the taciturn, honorable Hugh Glass while Tom Hardy shines as the villainous John Fitzgerald who leaves Hugh for dead. Hugh's near-death visions are touching but at the same time frightening because he sees a nightmare character played by ""Mama"" character Javier Botet. <br/><br/>The struggle of Hugh Glass is not glossed over for the audience. His determination to live is laid bare for all to see and Leo's expressive face tells all. I do think this is a good movie to watch when it is 90 degrees outside because the cold beauty of winter can make one feel like they are freezing!

Yes it was a beautiful location, yes it was amazing cinematography but that can only take a viewer so far.<br/><br/>Forget the moralistic mumbo-jumbo and the deeper meanings that the writers and directors were trying to get across. One has to actually care about the characters to try and find the deeper meanings. Di Caprio's Glass doesn't give us any reason to root for the guy other than a revenge motive and the entirety of his lines for the film were grunts, groans and mumbles. At least Tom Hardy's Fitzgerald gave us a reason to somewhat dislike the guy, although put into his situation, his actions do make completely logical sense for those with a desire to survive. <br/><br/>The story moves at a pace that makes The English Patient seem quick after the initial scenes. The CGI with the beasties is right there with Sharknado. <br/><br/>With regard to ""mountain man"" films, Jeremiah Johnson remains the king of the hill. The Mountain Men with Brian Keith and Charlton Heston is a fun diversion and Harris's Man in the Wilderness was very good. This one, hmmm.<br/><br/>Let me put it this way...I thought that perhaps Terrence Malick was the man in charge as so much film time was spent focused on things that were not doing anything but existing...trees, leaves, snow, rocks, the moon. The story development regarding the main character is told in choppy flashback and at the end one is left with more questions.<br/><br/>So... disregard the trailers as they would indicate an action-packed, historical man-versus-nature revenge film.

These are some of the millions of unknowns that the director Alejandro G. Iñárritu allows us to experience with his cinematic gem. ""The Revenant"" a visceral but artfully delicate piece that surpasses his previous project (Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) and marks a new era in the survival movies. <br/><br/>Based on the 2002 novel by Michael Punke, chronicles the life of a man of the 19th century that after a couple of misfortunes must survive and seek revenge in a risky and hostile, territory, discovering that the more dangerous is not abroad, the more dangerous is where can reach. <br/><br/>It is a survival story, It's an ancient epic, It's a drama, It's a western, It's a teaching and explanation of the spirituality of a human being, It's all. Mark L. Smith and Iñárritu manage to create perfect DNA between a frozen forest and a frosted heart questioning the human potential to its maximum splendor. <br/><br/>Although a little invisible, the spiritual concept of God is often present in the development of the main characters (forgetting the Indians red skin) around the film, hidden in some scenes but in others this fully explicit (the analogy of Hardy between God and the squirrel). Literally this movie is ""in the hands of the creator"", any being that breath has reflected on their forehead the concept of a God, for Glass his son and his wife, for Fitzgerald a profitable future, for an Indian the loss of his daughter, In general are based on the physical, making stress upon the strong Glass wounds, creating a very temporary container to enter the presence of God. A measure that advances added more and more injuries in the metaphysics of the protagonist, but this only creates more strength in his head. <br/><br/>DiCaprio is the touch of any movie, it has been part of Quentin Tarantino in ""Django Unchained"", it has given it hand to Martin Scorsese in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" but not even ""Django"" or ""Wall Street"" or ""Titanic"" Leonardo has made a physical, mental, psychological and spiritual performance so overwhelming and complicated as did with Alejandro. Walk dragged all the time, eat unimaginable things, murder, fight, pretend, and burn in locations devastated, have few hours of shooting, enduring cold, and experience work more complex (in all senses) of his career. <br/><br/>DiCaprio is a master, even when doing something as simple as a bath naked, rimmed his physical scars and emotional in below-zero temperatures. Will be this the Leonardo year? Hardy has not lost his talent, especially coming from the infernal desert ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" and the double performance of the gangsters in ""Legend"". He is alive, again. Hardy takes part to give a bit of testosterone and to demonstrate the customs of the (mostly male) Indians where kill, eat, shoot, hunt and rape was the only thing that could make a few heads, but that well was the 19th century. <br/><br/>Inarritu assassinated our minds, ears, eyes and hearts with a close- up images uncomfortable and bloody but both tense and exciting Open our auditory canals with a battle with arrows, shooting and adrenalin and close our eye focuses with blood, cold and fight. Number of elements are used in the film, forming the perfect union of the director and the crew a product with 12 nominations in the Academy Awards. <br/><br/>""Birdman"" most striking point was the apparent recording in only one take, now, the point most visually striking was the Emmanuel Lubezki stunning decision in record fully with natural light for once again generating something new in the Hollywood world. <br/><br/>Auditory and visual accompaniments are perfectly incorporated, resonating strings and the ashes of a campfire is a clear example of the excellent work done by Ryuichi Sakamoto , Alva Noto, and others, having some results quite compelling. It is interesting that if we think, usually all the films nominated for a statuette from the Academy have such cohesion. <br/><br/>DiCaprio, Hardy, Inarritu and the team effort is analogically in the shedding of blood in the Glass front. Alejandro is breaking schemes, limits and stereotypes of Hollywood. It is all proud to see that a Latin American triumph in the most top of the podium. It makes me dream, the show me that it is possible. ""The Revenant"" has shattered its competitors and Gonzales stands out more and more, but, Have already done so with ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)""? ""The Revenant"" closes a year deepest with a flourish, being terribly shocking and perfect, visceral, tremendous, real, spiritual, human, natural, exceptional.

If you have not seen this film, I would recommend the cinema screening, as it enables you to experience the landscapes in all their glory.

Moreover, the interaction of the characters is fluent during the entire plot. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is majestic (he truly deserves an Oscar this time).

"samfischer88","10","3","6","4 February 2016"," Much More Than Just Leo
","Great Director? check... Great cinematographer? check... Grade A actors? check... The Revenant has been number 1 on my watch list since I first heard it was getting made. The movie took the best director ( Innaritu) and cinematographer (Lubezki) of the the last few years and matched them with Leo and Tom Hardy in the main roles. I am slightly biased since those two actors have been my favorites for years, but this combination made The Revenant the best movie of the year for me!!<br/><br/>The Revenant is based on a true story, as Hugh Glass (Leo) has to battle a winder of the 1820's. Glass is attacked by a bear, and then has his son killed by John Fitzgerald (Hardy) as he is left for dead. Glass then starts a track for revenge as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>I was first interested in this movie because Leo was set as the star. I was not disappointed in his performance at all as I believe he should win the Oscar this year. He was not the best actor in this movie though. That title should go to Tom Hardy. He gets so into this character that its hard to even tell that its him! I was shocked that he didn't get nominated for a Globe, but I think he should definitely be in the running for the Oscar. He is magnificent and had his best performance of his career. <br/><br/>Leo made me interested in The Revenant, but that is not the reason I loved this movie. The scenery and technical aspects of this movie were outstanding. I was left in complete shock after seeing some of the scenes. How can they possibly shoot a movie so well?? I was left wondering how they put together a few of the scenes while keeping them so realistic. A great example of this is the bear attack seen, which should go down as one of the best shot scenes in cinema history. Put these scenes together with the beautiful scenery and landscape, and it is easy to say that Inarritu made a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Revenant is quite simply the best movie I have seen in the last few years. There is no flaw. The acting, the editing, the visual, etc... All of it was done to perfection. Expect The Revenant to clean house this year at the Oscars, as it should."

This time though I've only read this movie is great but has no plot, that this guy has more lives than a cat, and that revenge is second to the survival story.<br/><br/>*BIG FAT spoilers* I don't think so, this is not a survival story, cause Glass's purpose was never to survive. He only wanted to revenge, and moved by this desire, he survived the unthinkable, which makes sense because only with a huge determination and soul pain, could somebody endure all he went through. So it only makes sense that his pain would motive his revenge desire and his fight for survival. He said it himself, that he was not afraid to die, so he only did it to revenge.<br/><br/>Sure, probably there was not a plot twist or i wasn't the most original story.

"Kino_Corner","5","3","6","30 January 2016"," A beautiful face with zero personality
","When going in to see the latest film ""The Revenant"" from director Alejandro González Iñárritu, one cannot forgo some certain expectations that diverts your attention before the movie actually begins. You are, in the least knowledgeable scenario, aware that it stars Leonardo Dicaprio in the lead role. If you have been keeping up with cinema you know the director's name and his previous Best Picture winner, Birdman; further, if you if you have followed ""The Revenant""'s production, you would hear countless stories of the troubles the crew faced shooting in sub-zero temperatures on natural locations, with all-natural lighting, and perhaps you would hear how Leonardo Dicaprio had to eat a real buffalo liver on camera. <br/><br/>Beyond what you perceive with these expectations, the film delivers nothing of value to the audience. Yes, DiCaprio is a competent, if not a particularly great actor. Yes, Iñárritu is a talented director who knows what he is doing, and yes, DiCaprio eats a real buffalo liver on camera along with the promise of some beautiful natural scenery. And that is precisely what the film delivers. However, what the film fails to do that would ultimately capitalize upon these individual elements, is create a cohesion that ties them and drives the movie forward as the viewer is gripped in Hugh Glass' survival story. And what happens here, when the vision is separated into these three distinct elements is a really pretty, really boring movie.<br/><br/>The plot is one of the film's more significant flaws. Iñárritu had assembled all the resources to create a singular artistic vision that would work the best outside a typical movie's generic plot conventions (for an example of this, see ""Valhalla Rising"" which very effectively combines its bleak and beautiful natural scenery with a rewarding and engaging plot based in abstraction). ""Generic"", however is the word that best describes ""The Revenant""'s dragging plot. It's the most basic revenge story there could possibly be, and this really dampens the impact of Hugh Glass's real survival story. The sub-plot involving the Natives searching for one of their own ends up being an utterly pointless exercise that is totally isolated from the core of the movie beyond a weak convention for the ending. Furthermore, the movie is bogged down repeatedly with unnecessary flashbacks to Hugh Glass's dying wife and the evil white colonizers burning down the village. Towards the meat of the film, which is Hugh Glass's survival in the harsh winter wilderness, all these elements bear close to zero relevance.<br/><br/>The written dialogue is fine for the most part, and provides ample characterization to make the viewer care for some of the characters. DiCaprio has little to work with, but what he has to deliver he delivers decently. Domnhall Gleeson is very good and nuanced as the Captain. Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) however, is one of the film's highlights; although he does have some cheesy typical 'villain' lines, his character is one the viewer could sympathize with. In the frontier of ""The Revenant"", Fitzgerald is a man of realistic pragmatism and for the most part his actions constitute a realistic sequence of decisions that make his ""villain"" role a lot more compelling than some others that flood the market. If it had been some other actor, it would have been a very different performance and most likely, a less memorable one. Tom Hardy continues to prove to be one of Hollywood's greatest chameleons in recent times as he simply melts into the role.<br/><br/>The special effects that were used were very well-made, and did not distract; namely, the bear during one of the film's best and harrowing scenes, was an example of masterful CGI and the entire bear attack sequence was probably the best part of the movie, accentuated by Iñárritu's extended shot. It's brutal and messy, and very convincing. Beyond these instances of merit, the film is dragged down by an abundance of excessive gimmicks and cliché. The meta aspect of the filmmaking of the film supersedes the film itself a la ""Boyhood"" (""It took 12 years to make!"" repeats everyone associated with it). So what if DiCaprio had to eat a real buffalo liver? He doesn't have to! He's an actor! The movie defines itself with all these media headline-grabbing gimmicks of how difficult it was to create and sure, one can appreciate the effort that went in and how pretty it looks. But beyond prettiness and Tom Hardy's performance, the movie is bogged down with irrelevant subplots, a generic revenge story, and an in-cohesiveness and lack of focus that makes the whole thing boring. If you really love to observe great technical filmmaking and enjoy films that take advantage of nature, then I would recommend ""The Revenant"". If you're looking for one of the year's best films, or a compelling story of survival, skip it."
"ctowyi","10","3","6","30 January 2016"," Masterclass filmmaking
","Visceral... Onslaught on the senses... Nail-biting... Unforgiving... Brutal... Punishing... Riveting... Chest heavingly breathtaking... Spiritually meditative... Hellishly harrowing... Disconcertingly beautiful. Believe the hype. This is master cinema!<br/><br/>The Revenant feels like it could easily be reduced to the usual revenge thriller platitude, but Alejandro González Iñárritu just loves his big themes - redemption, loyalty, betrayal, survival, loss and revenge. What Iñárritu does so masterfully well here is that he creates a world so real that this is the only world that matters for 2.5 hours. Then he amplifies these themes till they filled the entire canvas. This is no wrong move. Every one is calibrated to hit the right note. <br/><br/>Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is fluid, contrasting against the heaviness of the narrative. It feels like Birdman all over again with all the sublime long takes but IMHO he absolutely ups the ante with his hovering and weaving shots drawing you directly into the action. The opening attack scene reminds me so much of the storming of the beaches of Normandy in Saving Private Ryan. It draws you in, making you one of the frontiersmen under siege. There is such a level of realism to the action because Lubezki uses natural lighting in all his shots except for one scene. While my eyes were riveted on the mayhem and madness, I remember feeling a little sad for Roger Deakins' outstanding work in Sicaro. I have a strong feeling it is not going to be his year again. <br/><br/>Talking about strong feelings, I think Leonardo DiCaprio is almost a shoo-in for Best Actor. If the Academy loves to give the Oscar to long-suffering and tortured soul characters, then DiCaprio deserves at least 3 awards for The Revenant. OMG... The stuff that happens to him... Getting mauled by a bear, left for dead in a grave, having to eat raw nasties to survive... Give him the award already. Not only did DiCaprio bring his A game, so too did Will Poulter, Domhnall Gleeson and Tom Hardy. The latter fully deserves his Best Supporting Actor nomination. His enthralling portrayal brought an internal logic to his character and I could understand so vividly how he ticks. <br/><br/>As much as the film is about so many things, I also feel it is about nature. This isn't an ode detailing the awe of Mother Nature but about the danger and no-holds-barred take-no- prisoner nature of it. Nature is treated with the deepest respect and it is constantly fraught with danger from every angle. Nature is definitely one of the stars of the film. <br/><br/>This is a film that above all else has a certain death rattle rhythm to it and Iñárritu's hold on the proceedings is impeccable. He is the master. To watch misery heaping on misery and pain piling on pain for 2.5 hours do not make for easy viewing but Iñárritu's command is absolute. This is not a movie for all tastes. In fact this is not a movie. It is an event and you are in good hands."

","This is the story of Hugh Glass, or rather this is the story of the Hollywood version of Hugh Glass. Glass never married a Pawnee Indian and he most certainly never had a son which reduces the plot somewhat! The cinematography is superb and the locations cold and unrelenting. Mr De Caprio is required to look glum and cold and occasionally grunt with pain. An Oscar winning performance it is not! One can only assume Academy members were impressed with his ability to survive on such cold locations? The revenge mission in the film is completely at odds with the accepted version of events. Tom Hardy is the outstanding actor and certainly deserves recognition. The scene where his character Fitzgerald on hearing that Glass is returning decides to rob the payroll safe and abscond with the money. Untrue. Fitzgerald had left the fort weeks before the story of Glass become public knowledge. Glass had to head south to find him. When he succeeded in finding Fitzgerald he discovered that Fitzgerald was now employed by the U.S Cavalry and was therefore a government official. Shooting him would have meant the death penalty for Glass. He had hoped to call him out in a gunfight but in the end relented, retrieved his rifle and headed north to carry on trapping. A disappointing film. With the budget they have why not tell the true story and cover the whole of the life of Hugh Glass?"

","It hasn't been far already into 2016 and there's already a fantastic film that captivates your mind, body and even spirit to break or even open further; and that film to be labelled as a 'Top Film' is The Revenant.<br/><br/>I won't go into much of the film's plot but I'll keep it brief; inspired around the famous Hugh Glass (who has been labelled as history's toughest survivor) it tells his deep and yet engaging adventure that see's him fighting not only for himself but his quest for justice when he is left for dead by an emotionless, careless and even cowardly member of his crew.<br/><br/>What makes The Revenant so amazing is that it's directed by both award winning and critically acclaimed filmmaker Alejandro G Inarritu with his style of storytelling, themes and character that make the silver screen shine. There is so much to take away and grip from this so I'll try to give my best of it all without spoiling it for you; firstly the film's themes include 'Survival of the human spirit', 'revenge' 'God and spirituality' and they help to keep the audience not only intrigued to the plot but the way the characters are seen from our eyes. Importantly, with Leo's character (Hugh Glass) we are shown that he's not only a tough human but he's battling his own demons that push him to be as strong yet broken in his path for revenge. Leo has played many great roles in his acting career but I think that this role is his best and truly toughest to play, it's bound to get him award nominations again as like other years but this is indeed something that the Oscars should deeply consider for him to receive. Tom Hardy is fantastic as well; his character is truly a monster that is emotionless, heartless and really driven for the audience to despise.<br/><br/>Cinematography was outstanding throughout and the locations where the film takes place are 100% real and really captures the realism of the story's setting from wet forests, raging rivers, snowy mountains and isolated trails. So much detail and thought has been put into this and the efforts from both the cast and the crew behind the camera make it seem so believably strong. Sound mixing and editing is strong too, with sounds of birds, winds and even breathing that makes it sound so beautiful but it's is composed soundtrack that makes it seem so emotional and yet captivating, from Glass's visions to even seeing him survive the harsh environment make these worthy candidates for Oscars and further awards in technical achievement in film. Again, we see camera shots that seem a 'one shot take' and even in one sequence we switch from one character to another. The violence is brutal, bloody and well executed and it can be confronting for some.<br/><br/>Overall, The Renevant is a breathtaking, captivating, and brutal but beautifully shot film that has so much to grasp but it will take an open mind to get it's themes and character development. This is indeed on my list (and the first entry) of best films for 2016."
"maurice_yacowar","10","3","6","14 January 2016"," abandoned trapper survives bear and winter to avenge murdered son
","Like the classic Western, The Revenant examines the thin line between savagery and civilization, as played out in the white man's ambivalent conquest of the native American. The central clash is between two white survivors, Hugh Glass and John Fitzgerald. <br/><br/>Both men have their proteges, son Hawk and cadet Bridger respectively. Hawk soars but Bridger follows the wrong orders, imperilling his life and soul. <br/><br/>Glass bridges both cultures, having lived among the Pawnee, learned their language and values, having lost a Pawnee wife and now caring for and avenging the death of his son Hawk. <br/><br/>Glass lives with the spirit of his slaughtered wife and in the last shot appears to rejoin her in the spirit world. Indeed the title may connote dreamer and avenger but it literally means a returning spirit. As he says before his last mission, ""I ain't afraid to die anymore. I'd done it already."" Hawk says to the moribund Glass, then Glass says to dead Hawk what he said to his dead wife: ""I'm right here. You hear me?"" The spirits are there to address. This rebuts Fitzgerald's last remark: ""You came all this way just for your revenge, huh? Did you enjoy it, Glass?... 'Cause there ain't nothing' gon' bring your boy back.""<br/><br/>Fitzgerald survived a scalping. When he meets his ultimate end it's not directly at Glass's hand but by nature. The Pawnee consign him to the rushing river. <br/><br/>Fitzgerald is reduced to the material. He's greedy, murderous, dishonourable in every way. He has no moral sense. In his theology God is a squirrel you can shoot and eat. <br/><br/>For Glass and the natives nature is a far larger spirit than an edible squirrel. That's the point of the powerful images of the landscape, Kananaskis (aka the suburbs of Calgary). God is in the land, either as a harsh test or as an enabling spirit. When Glass pulls himself out of the gutted horse he overnighted inside, he pats a respectful salute before moving on. <br/><br/>The central metaphor is what Glass learned from his wife: ""As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight. You breathe. Keep breathing. When there is a storm. And you stand in front of a tree. If you look at its branches, you swear it will fall. But if you watch the trunk, you will see its stability."" Time and again Glass saves himself or is saved by deploying the twigs and trunks around him. When he rides off a cliff a tall tree breaks his fall. In contrast, the French hang his Pawnee friend from a tree, a summary if not an emblem of European civilization. The Pawnee serve the nature the ostensibly ""civilized"" exploit.<br/><br/>Both the white and the native sides are mixed. Civilization is undercut by the army's savagery when it eliminates Glass's adopted tribe. As Glass warns his son, ""They don't hear your voice! They just see the color of your face. You understand? "" Even the counselled silence won't save Hawk. Glass as rumoured did kill an officer: ""I just killed a man who was trying to kill my son.""<br/><br/>Captain Andrew Henry is a man of honour and integrity, proved by his confrontation of Fitzgerald. But his company shows a moral blind spot when its workers end up owing the company for their expenses on a thwarted hunt for pelts. <br/><br/>There is also savagery among the natives, as the Sioux try to wipe out the Pawnee. But the one native's pursuit of his daughter, abducted and raped by the French, and the succour Glass gets from another isolated Pawnee put them on the honourable side.<br/><br/>As usual this historic drama is about the time it is made as well as the time in which it is set. Star DiCaprio makes its pertinence clear when he speaks out against the threat of the oil sands and pipelines to the natural preserve and our continuing neglect of native rights."

","I'm not one to call a movie a ""perfect 10"" but ""The Revenant"" turned out to be my favorite film of 2015, and my favorite film of at least the last two (if not three) years.<br/><br/>Dark, violent, unrelenting, and disturbing, ""The Revenant"" is also staggeringly beautiful, hopeful, exhilarating, and deeply moving.<br/><br/>And these seemingly conflicting emotional notes in fact go hand in hand. Only recently released (it's wide debut was last weekend, as of my writing this), the film is already underrated, and this is one of those rare movies I really expect to grow in stature over the years, not diminish.<br/><br/>Despite mostly positive reviews, many critics are being way too hard on this one--I suppose that's not too surprising. It seems like something this great can't help but find critics looking for things to nitpick (not to mention totally misread and misinterpret) about.<br/><br/>I'm sure you already know the general plot line, so I won't even bother recapping it. But there's so much more to The Revenant than meets the eye (and there's nonstop stunning imagery to meet said eye!) Beyond some of the most dazzling cinematography I've ever seen (Innaritu's previous Oscar-winner, Birdman, turned out to be only a warm-up for this one in that department), beyond a classic revenge story, and beyond the uniformly fine performances (DiCaprio's best to date) is a morally pertinent, narratively ambiguous, and spiritually uplifting vibe unlike any other film I have seen.<br/><br/>Don't like seeing movies on the big screen? Make an exception for this one... Do yourself a favor and make an exception... The movie completely immerses you in it's world (bereft of cartoonish CGI or silly 3D glasses) and you are in the pioneering west for the cost of your ticket... The camera swoops and swirls and puts you in the middle of some truly spectacular action sequences. Every frame looks like a postcard. The most ambitious nature documentaries don't capture the beauty of nature as well as this film does (I suppose Emmanual Lubezki should probably start working as DP for nature documentaries) with it's use of real locations and natural lighting.<br/><br/>The sticking point for critics seems to be that the film lacks subtlety. While it's true that The Revenant is rather blunt and uncompromising in its brutality, it's equally ambitious and ambiguous in it's spirituality... And goes further than the typical survival story in depicting man's perseverance in the face of adversity.<br/><br/>Most survival stories depict people overcoming nature's cruelty... This one depicts man's own moral failings as part of nature's cruelty. It's not just a marauding bear or brutal weather Hugh Glass must overcome, but his own moral failing in desiring revenge. Glass' primary motivator for staying alive is also what could ultimately do him in. The same is true of his adversary Fitzgerald.<br/><br/>It all adds up to a film that is visually astonishing, emotionally wrenching, and hits you on every level. A genuine must-see, and a truly great film, deserving to go down as a classic. It reminded me of Kubrick's best work, and that's no small compliment.<br/><br/>A true epic."

This movie shines in how much Glass had to struggle and fight for every second. I could really feel that wind/chill and I could really feel the serenity of those quiet moments. Like Gravity, this movie is absolutely an experience. The Story was ... well it was alright. The ending was satisfying. There were moments where I was sad but nothing jerked any tears out of me. It kept me at the edge of my seat for most of the duration, so hats off to that.<br/><br/>Its got drama, strife, survival and combat. It was a real trip. So the bottom line is that this movie imo didn't blow me away story-wise but it was one hell of an experience. Hardy and DiCaprio did an amazing job. The other actors played their parts very well too. It really did feel like DiCaprio had to give his all in order to pull it off and he did. I cant imagine anyone giving more.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I think its a must see. Or at the very least, it's an experience that you'll be pretty sorry you missed.

"meeza","10","6","17","31 December 2015"," Reved up with this one!
","Acclaimed & Oscar-winning filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu went from a Birdman seeking redemption to a Frontiersman seeking revenge. His latest stellar work comes in the form of ""The Revenant"". It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the aforementioned 1800's frontiersman named Hugh Glass who seeks vengeance against his fellow frontiermen who left him for dead after a bear attack. I guess they could not bear seeing Glass in such pain or maybe not. Glass is made out of thick glass with his focused resiliency to get those who did him wrong. Let's just say that he has viable justification to be an angry man. Oh, and as far as his marital status: he once had a love and it was no gas, soon turned out it was the heart of Hugh Glass; sorry for that ""Blondie"" moment there. Anyways, Inarritu marveled with his courageous direction of ""The Revenant"". His script of the picture, which he co-wrote with Mark Smith, was a revelation on revenge; but this movie shines more with the physical than the verbose and that is its brilliant makeup. Two-time cinematography Oscar champ Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki presented what is probably one of the most breathtaking photography I have seen in a motion picture with his work in ""The Revenant""; y no estoy chivando! Now to Mr. DiCaprio! It is one of my favorite Leo performances and it is his most impressive physical thespian effort of his illustrious career with his Glassified offering. Tom Hardy was exceptional as Fitzgerald the Frontiersman. Other fine supporting performances derived from Will Poulter as Bridges the Frontiersman, and Domhnall Gleeson as Captain Henry. In the end, ""The Revenant"" is something to see. ***** Excellent"
"sauradipg","7","6","17","22 December 2015"," A colossal disappointment.
","The Revenant is what happens when a strictly bordering-on- mediocre film gets universal acclaim. It wouldn't be correct to call it a mess because there are some scenes to marvel at, especially the wide angle shots of Calgary's forests and sunlight filtering through clumps of forests on a white canvas. The one take thing which gave Birdman an edge is simply a distraction here as the camera seemingly cannot decide where to stay and , instead, meanders pointlessly here and there as the film does. There are a lot of inspired moments from Kurosawa's climax in Throne of Blood, a lot of Tree of Life inspired juvenile philosophy thrown in for good measure and a ready dose of scenes structured around Birdman. But what absolutely kills the film is the amazingly banal sentimentality which is presented in the form of universality. Innaritu presents us with a lot of images. A lot. They are pretty dazzling to be honest, extremely cinematic, but as light as fluff. And as pointless as DiCaprio eating a raw bison liver to get into the skin of his character, or a horse. or whatever."
"mitsuharumisawax","9","6","17","22 December 2015"," The Reverent is so real looking it is almost scary
","Alejandro González Iñárritu is solidifying himself as one of the finest directors of his era. He has directed two aesthetically beauteous chefs-d'oeuvres in just a two-year span. The first was the 215 Oscar winner for best picture, Birdman, and now the The Revenant – another Oscar worthy movie. <br/><br/>The Revenant is straightforward from a story perspective. The story is about a protagonist seeking revenge on an antagonist for his malevolent, self-indulgent and inhumane actions. However, Iñárritu evinces the story you tell does not matter. What matters is how you tell it. The story is brilliantly structured. Every scene amplified the suspense and intensity of the movie, and it was sprinkled with just enough plot twists to keep us guesstimating how it would all unravel. It was difficult to guess how it would end, yet the journey of how the character would will himself to get there and how the climax would play out made the movie keep its vigorousness. Behind the disheartening tone constantly following around the characters, is an inspirational story. A story that demonstrates how much drive and perseverance we as humans have. All we have to do is dig deep to discover it, and if we do it can make us dangerous beyond belief.<br/><br/>The directing, however, is what makes this movie stand out the most. It is so natural and so realistic that it blurs the line between reality and fiction. It is almost as you are in a virtual ride or playing a video game as the protagonist, feeling every inner-emotion the protagonist feels.<br/><br/>The Revenant takes its audience on an aesthetically stunning expedition with meticulously remarkable directing; beauteous cinematography; thought-provoking, ultra-philosophical and metaphorical dialogue; and an exquisite, way-too-realistic method acting-esque performance by Leonardo DiCaprio."

The sheer grit and dertimination by hugo to return to his family barely alive is a tribute to the actual events of this true story.

"blanbrn","9","4","10","9 January 2016"," An epic adventure that's a struggle a fight for survival that's overcome by spirit and faith.
","""The Revenant"" is without a doubt one film that thrills with drama and action and it's filled with blood and it shows that human life can often be pushed to the extremes. It also blends themes of faith, survival and revenge to fine form. Actually the picture is based on the true life story of Hugh Glass an 1820's fur trapper and his quest for survival. And the cinematographer work is well done as the scenes of nature and wilderness is stunning it seems so real as it almost takes a little from the narrative as it seems the images move this long drawn out adventure film.<br/><br/>Anyway Leonardo DiCaprio(in his best performance yet)is Hugh Glass the 19th century hunter who stalks the American west on guard with his rifle. The peace and beauty of the outdoors is shattered quickly in the film as the Glass camp of fur traders are attacked in a blood and gore carnage by Native Americans. This begins a saga a journey mission of search and escape and this all involves Hugh and his son and thru time flashback you find out about the demise of Hugh's wife. And in a fun and compelling and seems like real yet very brutal and blood bath like is the grizzly bear attack fight sequence that leaves Glass to almost die. After this the adventure becomes more about a struggle to survive and a journey that has twist and turns all it really turns into is a revenge hunt that Glass must seek as payback can be hell.<br/><br/>Overall ""The Revenant"" is a harsh and tough emotional film that proves life is a struggle as one must fight for life all while dealing with faith, and the spirit of believe as it's supported by loving nature and loving family just as Glass did. And the performance from Leonardo DiCaprio is his best ever he pushed himself to the limit for this role nearly transforming his look and enduring the cold and snow type scenes that he had to shoot in, yet all in all that helped make ""The Revenant"" an emotional drama that shows tough images yet it dazzles."
"alexcomputerkid","9","4","10","9 January 2016"," A film that should win Oscars once award season is here especially DiCaprio.
","I tend to see him more on People Magazine while working at my local supermarket more so than I would like to but I have still always enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio since the early 90's when he started his career. He is an actor willing to put himself in the big spots and as he has worked with famous directors like Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino or actors/actresses like Johnny Depp or Meryl Streep and Kate Winslet, it shows he is doing something right. His latest film The Revenant follows the same positives along with some similar themes of his previous work.<br/><br/>Based off real events and set in 1823, Hugh Glass (Dicaprio) gets attacked by bear on a fur expedition. What follows is a survival story dealing with the themes of revenge, climate issues and the stylings of a western. A wilderness film trying to showcase life in the 1800's.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is usually the dominant character in every movie that he is in and The Revenant is no different as this is all about DiCaprio. Using very little dialogue at times and coming from famed director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu who uses these VERY impressive close ups and single shots, DiCaprio seems to be always in your face here. From the times his character is in pain to expressing emotions, DiCaprio is top notch and he can do it all. A type of personality that DiCaprio has never played before and being that's it's such an original storyline, it is one he will likely won't play again.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is the main piece but this cast has more. John Fritzgerald (Tom Hardy) is Glass's enemy and a character that brings revenge into the story. Hardy plays the role so well he's almost as good as Dicaprio. Played by actor journeymen Domhnall Gleeson, Captain Andrew Murray is a character who is the next closest leader to Glass. Even in the smaller roles, there are recognizable names like Luckas Hass (so underused though) and upcoming star Will Poulter.<br/><br/>The Revenant is so different from what we see every Friday. The type of style that I wish we saw more of. Something that just make us look forward to more Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu films. A film that should win Oscars once award season is here especially DiCaprio."
"grantss","7","4","10","7 January 2016"," Interesting tale of survival and revenge
","Interesting tale of survival and revenge.<br/><br/>Set in America in the 1820s, a frontiersman, Hugh Glass (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), is attacked and badly mauled by a bear. He is left for dead by his comrades. Meanwhile a group of Indians are after him. Thus starts his fight for survival and revenge...<br/><br/>Loosely based on a true story, this is part drama movie, part action movie. Written and directed by Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu, who usually directs emotional human dramas which veer from interesting and profound (Ammores Perros, Birdman, Babel) to dull and pretentious (21 Grams, Biutiful), this is a bit of a departure for him. The dramatic touches - dream sequences, symbolism - are still there but the action side is new.<br/><br/>And therein lies some of the problems with the movie. The drama, catering for his existing followers, seems, at times, overwrought and padded. Some of the dream sequences and flashbacks weren't entirely necessary.<br/><br/>Then we have the action, there to cater for the short attention spans of Generations Y and Z. Some of it is good, and contributes to the movie, but some of it feels very clumsy and just action for the sake of it.<br/><br/>This all said, the plot is interesting and engaging. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a good performance in the lead role. Tom Hardy is solid as the villain (though I would have preferred if he didn't try to make his voice so unintelligible). <br/><br/>Superb scenery and cinematography.<br/><br/>It does drag towards the end though, as Inarritu adds sub-plots and scenes that don't really add much. He slows the pacing down too. The final scene is inevitable and largely predictable.<br/><br/>Overall: a good movie, but not a great one."
"carlos37andre","8","4","10","4 January 2016"," A great movie
","Great movie. After a movie in my opinion overrated (Birdman), director Alejandro González Iñárritu last delivery in a decent prize work. The Revenant is not 100% plan sequence as the trailer could fail to understand, instead alternating between small parties in this style and in normal courts or with spotlights on the stage, which makes the experience of watching it much more dynamic, satisfying and without saturation. Long Photographic is excellent, with amazing scenery, and all featuring the characters be very good. Leonardo DiCaprio, even without a lot of lines, is once again amazing in the role of protagonist, giving all the emotional charge needed for a character so full of feeling, the largest being the rage. Moreover, it is not only DiCaprio worth mentioning, Tom Hardy is very good in his role as antagonist, and Will Poulter surprises in its performance, even with a character who is not very well worked during his screen time, he can add ( and) charisma and other elements on a solid, lucid performance. The whole concept of the story is engaging, not needing much time to the viewer Imerse completely in the narrative, but the way how it is developed further help in this regard. But nothing is perfect, on the one hand the construction of some characters is very good, the other is bad, Hawk (son of DiCaprio) is a character who just seems to be there to cause trouble in no time becomes very clear if there a motif defined for it, or if it is simply stupid. The film's soundtrack also does not please me, leaving much to be desired, and in some part to annoying. In short: The Revenant is a great film certainly has its faults, but still is a great movie with great performances, outstanding photo and an engaging story, very worth watching."

At least I could see the beautiful trees with snow in the background, but it was the same background always, in every scene, it WAS THE SAME TREES WITH SNOW.

","I must admit that going to see this movie, I was expecting prolonged boring scenes to serve the purpose of brutal loneliness in the wild. However, the opening scenes of mini battles between native tribes and the fur trapping squad, the theatrical method by which the director captures these moments drew me right in. Certainly the director with his cast and crew members spared no effort to depict man's merciless battle over the riches of one land, the rawness and brutality of how far a man would go to survive death even if it was on the expense of another man's life.<br/><br/>Without a doubt the director's decision to shoot this movie in the hostile wilderness made the movie what it is and helped the actors rise to the state of mind of the real life characters who lived that same rawness and hostility. <br/><br/>What intensifies this piece of great work are the two gravely talented actors, Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy, playing Hugh Glass and John Fitzegerald. These two continue to excel and prove that they are indeed the best in their generation. Leo with his amazing utilization of his body and face to portray the character's agony, despair and finally determination was behind yet another Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy,on the other hand, as John Fitzegerald shows off his humongous acting skills with the use of his eyes and voice, as the rest of his face is covered in this big beard, to create this unyielding, rugged and sometimes seemingly unstable character, that also won him the appraise of the academy with a nomination for best actor in a supporting role. <br/><br/>The movie would not have been the same without those two men.<br/><br/>The Revenant has been nominated for 12 Academy awards including best picture, best lead actor and best actor in a supporting role and I am rooting for this movie in all these categories."
"khang_tran","10","3","7","1 February 2016"," Alejandro G. Inarritu achieves an amazing feat in filmmaking with this stunning survival story
","Just as the protagonist in his latest film, Alejandro G. Inarritu had to struggle and will himself in finishing this ambitious project. The production experienced numerous setbacks with locations, switching of producers, cast and crew members suffering from hypothermia and an overblown budget. This had me worrying that the project was just impossible to make. Inarritu pushed through and the eventual end result is the complete vision of a genius creative mind displaying some of the best filmmaking I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>The Revenant is an intense and visceral viewing experience based on the true story of Hugh Glass's survival story in the frontier of 1823. The screenplay of Inarritu is pretty straight forward: a group of fur trappers, including Glass, are finishing up their deployment when Hugh gets attacked and mauled by a grizzly bear, leaving him near dead. His fellow trappers see no use in trying to keep him alive and eventually leave him to die. Remarkably, Glass survives and vows to take revenge on the trappers that left him for dead. In the Revenant, you follow Hugh Glass on his incredible survival journey through the dangers of hostile natives and the forces of nature itself. The reason this movie works so well is because you truly care about its protagonist, played brilliantly by Leonardo DiCaprio. He further displays his incredible range as an actor in playing a role with minimal dialogue, with parts in the native American language as well. This physically demanding role forced DiCaprio to show the internal rage and struggle of Glass mainly through his facial expressions and body movements, and he does so exquisitely. All of the acting performances were impeccable including Tom Hardy, who plays a fellow fur trapper John Fitzgerald and matches Leo's intensity in every scene. Domhnall Gleeson, who plays captain Henry, impressively holds his own alongside these two acting heavy weights in mediating some of their interactions. Another addition to his remarkable resume of 2015. I was surprised by Will Poulter's casting in the film, as his young career consisted mainly of comedic roles. However, he gave a solid performance as the young and earnest trapper Bridger. Credit Inarritu for getting great performances out of all his actors and achieving good chemistry between them.<br/><br/>Another great achievement of the film is the unbelievable cinematography by Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki. Here, the man is on top of his game, showing that he is the best cinematographer working today. Throughout the movie, he only works with natural light created by sunlight and fire, and uses them beautifully. The movie looks stunning and features gorgeous landscapes, long takes to heighten intensity and meticulous camera-work. Noticeably in the opening battle scene, which is one long intense take where the camera point-of-view switches between different character perspectives. Some of his trademark low angle close-ups were even used during these scenes where water, spit and blood would find their way onto the camera lens. In addition, the composition of some nature images were reminiscent of his work in Terrence Malik's ""The Tree of Life"" and fitted nicely during the spiritual parts of the movie. <br/><br/>The score by famous Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto is rather understated but used effectively to convey pain and despair. The sounds of the cold wind, snowfall, streaming rivers and mud are already sufficient to make us feel like we are suffering alongside the characters. <br/><br/>All aspects of this film were done perfectly, whether it was the sound, visuals, the costumes, acting or editing. This all results in a unique film viewing experience I've never had before, transporting me to the ice cold frontier. This all was topped by the awe- inspiring bear attack scene, which is already turning iconic in the film industry.<br/><br/>All in all, the Revenant is a great achievement in filmmaking, thanks to the passion and sacrifice of all the people involved. As Leo stated: ""Suffering is temporary, film is forever."""

","The enormous hype for this movie sent me into the cinema with huge expectations. However no more than 5 minutes into the movie I was bored. The next 2 and a half hours were spent wishing I had gone to watch paint dry instead. For some reason good film making has now been confused with good cinematography. There is no doubt that this film is beautiful but the excessive reliance on the landscape as an extra character adds an unnecessary hour to the movie. Many scenes were completely pointless and didn't add anything. Watching Leo set up a camp and crawling through the snow for 2 hours is really not that interesting. Iñárritu seemed to throw everything he knew about telling a story out the window and instead relied on using the cast and crew's suffering in the mountains to sell a movie rather than making a good story. All in all this film is clearly successful because of the names attached and not for being a good movie."

This is indeed the main selling point of a pretty dull but captivating film. Not much happens, it's man, and I use that word lightly, man (note there are only 3 woman in the film) vs the elements.<br/><br/>The dream sequences are equally as beautiful as the landscape, it's very, very, Terrence Malick. (Those of you who are unaware of his films check out The Tree The Life & To The Wonder). With the sun reflecting through the trees and the haunting prophetic dialogue. These are the best parts of the film, which in essence is a rather predictable epic.<br/><br/>The performances are good, but not Oscar worthy. However, the cockerney English actor is appalling. How on earth did he get that part? <br/><br/>Its not a film for the feminists. My female friend hated it on every level. The two or three woman in the film have a few lines between them. One is used in a rape scene and the other is a ghost.<br/><br/>I must say I actually preferred Valhalla Rising which was much darker and had more of an unpredictable story line.<br/><br/>Be warned, this film is very, very long. And quite boring at times. I'm also sure Dicaprio would have died from hypothermia at some stage. It's also amazing how quickly his clothes dry out!<br/><br/>Worth any Oscars? Cinematography yes.

","Trapper and guide, Hugh Glass, while guiding the survivors of a party decimated in an Indian attack, is mauled by a bear and left for dead while his son is killed. Glass struggles to survive in an incredibly hostile environment, so that he can return to exact retribution on Fitzgerald, who killed his son.<br/><br/>I have mixed feelings about this visceral but beautiful movie. Directed by Alejando Inarritu, it shows, if anything, even more directorial flamboyance than his Oscar-winning Birdland, and is undoubtedly less likely to divide opinion quite as markedly. The opening sequence of the Indian attack is staggeringly well filmed, in lengthy unbroken shots where the camera makes movements which seem impossible. The movie is a feast for the eyes - the scenery is spectacular, the action is brilliantly choreographed and photographed, the special effects are astonishing (you can't see where they finish and reality ends) – and, all the time, the camera is endlessly prowling around and through the action. Every second on screen shows what a challenging shoot this was.<br/><br/>But there are flaws. At over two and a half hours, it is at least half an hour too long – Glass' wilderness wandering could usefully have been trimmed down. And demanding shoot or not, DiCaprio's almost dialogue-less performance is more grimacing than acting. Tom Hardy sounds authentic but largely incomprehensible as Fitzgerald. Inarritu is far too fond of shots of the sky up through pine trees – the first one was gorgeous, the 21st smacked of ""Get on with it."" The payback on the kidnapped Indian girl is muddled from a story point of view. Frankly, I didn't believe Glass would have survived: not just the bear attack, but the repeated soakings for extended periods in freezing water. And the film is very dark and desaturated, a trend which I have lost patience with.<br/><br/>It is definitely worth seeing, but I don't think I'm that keen on seeing it again soon."

","While my review of the Hateful Eight gave it some latitude since the violence was, at least, directly tied to the plot, The Revenent is a movie whose violence is over the top. We cannot fault Leonardo DiCaprio for his excellent acting, not the special effects that allowed much of this movie to be filmed.<br/><br/>But, how long ago do you think it was that this movie would have been X-Rated? We have become inured to violence and that is a bad thing for all of us but especially the younger generation. Seeing extremely violent movies is NOT the same as the imaginary characters of comic books 50 years ago.

"ironhorse_iv","9","3","7","8 January 2016"," This movie shows that as long as you can still grab a breath, you fight. The Revenant is a visceral experience. Visually stunning & heart-pounding.
","Inspired by true events and Michael Punke's novel of the same name, The Revenant captures one man's epic adventure of survival and the astonishing power of the human spirit. In an expedition of the uncharted American wilderness, renowned explorer Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is brutally attacked by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team. In a quest to survive and guided by revenge for his betrayers, Glass must endures life-threating injuries, sickness, the harsh environment, hostile natives, and others to make it, back to home. Can Glass navigate the cold & vicious winter in a relentless pursuit to live and find redemption, or will this story of the rural survivalist, end tragic? Watch the movie to find out, if you really want to! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the visuals in this film, has reaches a new level of remarkability. It's a fully immersive, dimensional look, with jaw-dropping long takes and strikingly physical realism. Filmed in the remote wilderness of Canada and Argentina, the cinematography for this film, is one of the main reason, why I really wanted to see this movie. Beautifully shot by Emmanuel Lubezki and director Alejandro González Iñárritu, the film is famous for using only natural light to highlight these amazing set-pieces. Some of these tracking shots, were so complicated, due to cold weather conditions, the remoteness of the locations and director Alejandro González Iñárritu's strict aesthetic plan, that the film was infamous for its trouble-some long production. Even season actors like Leonardo DiCapiro and Tom Hardy, have stated out that this is one of their hardest movies to shot. And yet all of the film's visually arresting set-pieces would have been in vain had the viewer failed to connect with the characters. Lucky for them, I found the main and supporting characters to be very appealing. I was very invested in the human element of this tale of survival and retribution. Both Leonardo and Tom Hardy were astonishing in their roles; however, Tom Hardy's performance as John Fitzgerald is definitely the better of the two leads. I like the fact, that he's ruthless, greedy, tough and somewhat scare. Still, I think the movie made Fitzgerald, seem like a one-dimensional villain with him, killing his kid, than what was more like, what was exactly from fur trappers, back then. Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the movie, was the same. He seem a little too super human, good-hearted and embellished to be taken as a real Hugh Glass. Scenes like him, surviving a huge cliff drop and multiply waterfalls was a little too unrealistic for my taste. In my opinion, I think the movie would have a more realistic tone, if they kept, Hugh Glass's account, closer to the real-life event. The film took too many liberties. Unlike the movie, Hugh Glass didn't single-handed put down a bear; he had help from fur-trader buddies. Plus, that event happen in summer, not winter. Another thing, unlike the movie, which has Hugh Glass swim, in ice-cold temperance water, most of the way, down the river. In real-life, he make a crude raft and floated downstream. In my opinion, it doesn't make sense that he swam, because of hypothermia. Then, there was the ending, which I will not spoil, that I have mixed feelings about. It was action-packed, but somewhat disappointing as well. All, I have to say about it, is the 'Revenge in God's hand' arch wasn't well-developed. Still, it was better than what happen in the real-life account. Still, despite, the loose adapted of Hugh Glass's account; DiCaprio's version does have more of the punishing feel; because of that, it's more entertaining. Seeing Leo put himself truly through the ringer for his art is worth-watching on its own. So he deserves some credit. After all, it's pretty hard to do, all those survival stunts, eat raw meat, speak two Natives language, and risk hypothermia. Also, Leo's Glass' loneliness, desperation, bond with his mixed race son, and painful memories all make him a sympathetic and moving character, an all the more extraordinary, accomplishment given how little dialogue DiCaprio has. Yet this movie is not a film for all people. Some of the ""Terrence Malick"" style, symbolism was a bit off, and confusing. It does comes off, as somewhat self-indulgent and pretentious at times. Still, the movie is somewhat passable for its 156 minute run-time. While, the runtime is long, it's not as slow, as certain critics, make it out to be. Overall: The utter ferocity of the action and performances, added with the breath-taking visuals makes, this survival epic, a must-watch from me. Check it out."

","From this Mexican director comes another masterpiece after 'Birdman' ! I particularly got in love with magnificent cinematography of this movie, which I haven't seen on any movie before. Unique long shot without cutting, close to horizon angles, super wide shots are some of the techniques that makes it different from other cinematic experiences. It sort of takes you along in the movie. The sceneries were chosen perfectly to imply the right feeling in the viewers for each episode of the movie. And at last, Dicaprio's acting is one of his best. At the end, it perfectly delivers the messages, whatever you do to others, you get the same in return!"

","If like myself you have been desensitized over the years by watching countless movies with blood, gore and violence and can now watch the beach scene during Saving Private Ryan as though it was an episode of Sesame Street, then prepare yourself to feel your pulse quicken once more and that urge to raise your hand to cover your eyes from the horror.......the horror. Those moments that are hard to watch but even harder not to, are here, this time in the form of a very upset 300kg grizzly bear and Leonardo DiCaprio's face. The realism of this scene is incredible...I'm still trying to work out how they filmed it......maybe it really happened and they've patched Leonardo back up somehow. The Revenant, based on the TRUE yet unbelievable story of frontiersman Hugh Glass,(1780 – 1833) is a survival revenge flick. The camera work is some of the best I've seen om film, it flows effortlessly like a ghost on the breeze, taking you up and close and sometimes closer than you would like to be. These shots are often juxtaposed with some truly beautiful and hypnotic images the wilderness. A great cast of actors including Tom Hardy, who doesn't look like Tom Hardy again and has to be one of the best British actors of recent times. I knew he was in this movie and I still didn't recognize him at first. He plays the hillbilly you'll love to hate and is excellent throughout this epic odyssey. Leonardo DiCaprio does some of his best work in this movie and also eats some truly disgusting food ( even Rambo wouldn't touch ) in order to portray the realism of his character. As he crawls over 200 miles towards his salvation spurred on by his revenge, you will feel every grunt and groan that his half dead corpse is capable of producing. Surely he deserves an Oscar, if not only for best actor but for best stomach. The Revenant is as uplifting as it is traumatic and like his previous movie Birdman, director Alejandro González Iñárritu has a gift for making it personal. A gift for transporting you from your arm chair into another world, which in my opinion is what we want a movie to do. Like Hugh Glass you will go through an ordeal in this film, one that I highly recommend you survive for 159 minutes."
"PandoraProductions4","8","10","37","21 December 2015"," visceral experience from beginning to end
","The Revenant is definitely one of the best shot films of the year. Some of the camera moves are just extraordinary. The story is simple, but that's fine because it's the overall experience that's unique, not the premise. It's basically a revenge western meets a survival story. Set in frosty Montana, Hugh Glass must overcome all odds to avenge the death of his son. All the acting is great- but it's the mood that really stands out. From icy mountains, to great plains, the oppressive and gloomy atmosphere will not be for everyone. It's a hard film to sit through. There are scenes of great violence and very very slow-paced scenes. Plus the runtime is over two and half hours. So it might not be for everyone- but it's still an excellent film."
"constellationofcygnus","7","4","11","3 January 2016"," Mostly a success
","The Revenant - <br/><br/>Hot on the heels of the success of his Oscar winning Birdman, Alejandro González Iñárritu turns his hand to the Western with a tale of double cross and revenge. DiCaprio plays fur trapper Glass, who is gravely wounded during an attack by a bear (in a fantastic and utterly convincing sequence) and ultimately abandoned and left for dead by some of his companions. How his lust for vengeance keeps him alive is the crux of the rest of the story. First of all the film looks fantastic, with a real Kubrick/Barry Lyndon feel to some of the visuals. From the snow on distant mountains to the mist winding through the forest its a fantastic looking piece. The score, by Japanese legend Ryuichi Sakamoto with Alva Noto and Bryce Dessner is also great, sparse and haunting. It mirrors the landscape perfectly. The acting by leads Leo DiCaprio, an almost unrecognisable Tom Hardy and Will Poulter is universally great, with DiCaprio in particular giving a completely committed performance as the wronged frontiersman Hugh Glass. If I had to criticise I would say that not everything works, some of the dream/fantasy sequences seem a bit naive and contrived, and it could also have benefited from being maybe 20 minutes shorter. But although the story is pretty slight and one-note I didn't find myself checking the time at all. I actually preferred it to Birdman. Overall its now my second favourite weird and violent snow draped western, losing the top slot to the vastly underrated Ravenous 7/10"

Photography was stunning, the camera work is amazing and one camera shoots scenes these days are rare. Acting starting from Leo was phenomenal, not going to start bragging but the dude did an amazing job he was spectacular. This must be the movie that he talks the least than in other movies but still good job done by him on the other aspects. Tom is just confirming that he is a top class actor, if Leo doesn't win anything for this then Tom totally deserves it for supporting role. <br/><br/>A nice addition was that comet that I have to mention.<br/><br/>Also the end credit which was mixed with Leo's breath was a nice additional little thing as we know masterpieces are achieved on details. <br/><br/>Overall great movie with amazing editing, directing, camera and screenplay.

Trappers attacked by indians and survivors run
DeCaprio gets mauled by a bear and the man left to tend to him predicatably betrays him and kills man's son.
DeCaprio grunts agonisingly across the snowy landscape for 90 minutes
Kills man.<br/><br/>The movie was drab from start to finish. All the flashback attempts at injecting depth were cliched and lacking in any depth whatsoever. I literally didn't care from start to finish if DeCaprio's character lived or died.
We were supposed to care about the plight of the indians, but any chance of that was ruined by the fact that other indians were also vicious psychos.
The only two remotely sympathetic chaaracters were the two youngsters, and arguably the one who survived.<br/><br/>I think people confuse fantastic camerawork and incredible landscape for a good movie, but almost everything about this movie was ridiculous, and nothing more so, than the fact that in a sub-zero snow terrain, every single character seems to spend hours wading through icy swamps, stream and rivers wearing leather and furs, without so much as a shiver.<br/><br/>Crappy, crappy piece of rubbish.

","This film often got rave reviews in 2015 and in 2016 on IMDb. But those accolades are not deserved IMO. While many claimed the action was so realistic, huge plot flaws undermine the supposed gritty realism. And the shaky cam usage is irritating and overused by the director. Granted the bear attack was well done and the cinematography often beautiful, but the narrative has a number of weaknesses that bothered me. For example, although the hunting party went to the trouble of constructing a gurney made of logs, nobody fashioned a SPLINT for Leonardo's character's broken right lower leg! Later in the film the protagonist is seen running full tilt and even jumping on to a horse--- a total impossibility. In another scene, DiCaprio's character comes to the edge of a huge cliff spying a river and the next cut has him at the bottom of said cliff in that river. Another ridiculous unrealistic scene. Furthermore, the character, Glass, is submerged in the frigid water of a waterfall and has no problems with the frostbite and hypothermia that would have most certainly ensued! There is also a scene stolen from ""Star Wars"" where Glass eviscerates his dead horse and climbs naked inside of the carcass to seek shelter from a blizzard. And the next day he puts his clothes back on although said clothes were left outside in the blizzard--- of course the clothes are perfect?! Another major problem is the constantly changing scenery. Sometimes there are massive mountains and other scenes have a temperate forest. There are no points of reference to make the settings coherent. Everything is for style and visual effect with no logic. And Leo does a lot of grunting but one never gets a sense of empathy for him except a little bit when Glass sees his murdered son's body. All in all, another overrated exercise in style with an illogical script and disjointed narrative by a self important director"

The actors are clearly riding real horses when the horses are moving faster than a walk later in the film.

","This is a remarkable and extraordinary film. It raises the filmmaking art to a different level. The direction, cinematography, editing, and sound are exceptional. From the astonishing opening sequence and throughout Inarritu's direction is fluid, surprising and alternately grand and intimate. Much has been made of the cinematography using only natural light, and rightly so. It is stunningly beautiful, and the harsh majesty of the wintertime Pacific Nothwest has never been captured like this. The sound editing was completely immersive and had the sharp clarity and snap of frozen timber. I didn't care that much for Birdman, although it too had some complex and mystifying sequences. But what Innaritu has done here is an whole other experience. Frankly, he and his crew deserve any and all accolades coming their way, even that bonfire of the vanities the Academy Awards. Yeah, he won the Oscar last year. Tough. Technically and artistically this film is peerless.<br/><br/>A simple story of survival and revenge told in straightforward terms with incredible attention to detail and authenticity, it is brutal and direct, just like life in the early 19th Century was brutal and direct. Leonardo Dicaprio does a fine job, ably supported by an unrecognizable Tom Hardy, that brilliant chameleon who here has a different voice and a rural accent that feels exactly 1800's Americana. Hardy goes so deep into character only Daniel Day Lewis could find him.<br/><br/>This movie won't be for everyone. It is harsh and graphic and it is exactly what it purports to be: the story of a man mauled by a grizzly and left for dead who survives and makes his way back hundreds of miles to safety and to exact his revenge; and, how he does that and who and what he meets on the way. Not a lot of story, transformed by the magic of Innaritu's camera moving from majestic long shots to closeups so intimately close they breathe on you. It is grueling, agonizing and harrowing, and it takes its time. Fine by me.<br/><br/>Interestingly, this story has been filmed before as Man in the Wilderness (1971), starring Richard Harris and John Huston. That was a good film. This one is sublime."

But the story is very far-fetched, with the protagonist surviving: a grizzly bear mauling; smothering by another mountain man; multiple gunfights and Indian attacks; a ride through the rapids of the Missouri River cloaked in heavy hides; and a fall off of a 300-foot cliff! The Native American element is derivative and done much better in movies such as the far superior Black Robe. Character development is weak. The costumes and settings really look authentic but the story is implausible. For example, after the plunge into a raging river, in winter, our hero is washed ashore at a calm eddy, draped in soaking wet hides. The next scene shows him sleeping next to a fire, all of his hide-clothing now dried out. We're supposed to believe that he retained all of his fire starting equipment through the dunk in the rapids and somehow got a fire going, next to a river with everything soaking wet. That's when I decided this was not a great movie. More nonsense, including the fall off the cliff, was yet to come. Good watch for the action scenes but not in the same league as Black Robe."

Although I have to say that he had about a dozen movies deserving it better than this!<br/><br/>A man witnesses the murder of his son and ever after fights his way through all obstacles to take revenge on the murderer. So far, so fair. Anyone being a parent would relate to that one. But anyone who has lost a dear one will also know: Hate, pain and desperation can be eased by nothing... ... except maybe forgiveness. Only like half an hour into the movie I knew: He mustn't get his revenge. If this movie is worth only a penny he mustn't get his revenge. The rest is quite a bit to watch. Lots of very beautiful landscape shoots. A hell of a lot of blood and guts and disgust. Leo is suffering and suffering and suffering, he fights and fights and still keeps on fighting. In the end he arrives at the Fort, he finds his enemy, he dares him and at this point of the story you start asking yourself what's this all about. What is the point? What does it want to tell us? The murderer says a quite reasonable thing in the end. He says: This is your revenge, enjoy it, but it will not bring your son back. That's it. It will not bring him back. There are too guys with nothing left to loose and they lay in the snow fighting each other, trying to cut off as many limbs as possible but - why? Where's the sense? They could stand for the insanity of mankind itself. Could be. Next moment the Revenant remembers something: Revenge is not upon man it is only upon god. This would have been a good punch line. Let go of it, it doesn't bring you any relief. However revenge is not upon god in that movie, at least not if god isn't an old Indian chief who was in search of his kidnapped daughter all along. The Revenant lets go off his enemy and witnesses how he gets killed by the Indian tribe. He himself gets spared because he accidentally saved the life of the Indian princess earlier. The end is a bit ... flat. Uninspired. Plain. Would have been waiting for more deepness. Leo had a bunch of real deep roles in other movies making of him the actor he is and for being the actor he is he got the Oscar. It's alright with me."

","Well, glass has a crazy fight with a bear and the bear almost kills him(he's beating and biting glass for like 15 minutes) and then they fight again and they roll down a hill hugging each other and the heavy bear ends up lying on glass! Glass is beaten to death and bleeding like hell , when after some time, his crew find him and try to heal him with nothing ! (I mean they are in the middle of a jungle and the story happens around 1820 ). They carry him for an hour ,no real food , no nothing. They leave him alone in that jungle he has apparently lost tons of blood and most of his bones are smashed. But surprisingly (stupidly!) he succeeds to crawl towards his son's body have a little chat with him like they are in central park and nothing is wrong. He crawls some more, after hours he finds food he meets an Indian. The Indian cures glass better than any doctor in 21st century, with some ashes only. He's fine again so he goes for another adventure and falls off a canyon ! He survives again , the crew find him again he goes for another adventure , he kills the man who killed his son , but this time glass finally dies just because he got a few knife stabs."

","Any Baldwin brother could have acted his part.<br/><br/>DiCaprio's problem is that every time he opens his mouth it screams- ""Young Boy"". He hasn't the physical or more importantly- vocal requirements that would display him as a ""Man"", and that's where films like this just don't work with him. He fits well into movies like ""Catch me if you can"", but he is NO John Wayne or Clint Eastwood... or even Alec Baldwin! and that's not good.<br/><br/>For me? Standing up (or laying down) and making impressive looks on your face isn't acting, really. Not the kind that should bring you Oscar. Unless all the others last year were pretty lame.<br/><br/>His role was pretty shallow and didn't offer much for him to show off acting talents.<br/><br/>The Film? was put together quite well. Very well. I am very picky about reality though, simply walking through a stream and soaking your feet in those conditions would have been a death sentence. There were several other things that made me smirk, but there have been other movies that take liberties with reality.<br/><br/>John Fitzgerald acted better than DiCaprio. Either the other movies actors were even more shallow, or he was given this award for some other reason.<br/><br/>The movie was good, would I buy it and add it to my collection? No.<br/><br/>PS- Open note to Chris Rock... I am a white guy... does this review make me racist?.... you idiot."

","This movie is visually stunning. The landscapes, sunset,sunrise, clouds etc., were simply magnificent. The entire credit for this film goes to Emmanuel Lubezki for his top notch work in cinematography.But the drawback of this film is it's duration.The entire film can be wound up to one hour but it's duration is 158 minutes! After 30 minutes you feel bored and the script becomes predictable.Performances by Dicaprio and Tom Hardy were outstanding. This film may not deserve an Oscar but the artists do deserve them. May be this film fulfill the dream of DeCaprio. Watch out for best landscapes and the performances if you can bear them.Else wait to watch it in Blu-Ray. Note: This is my personal opinion. No offense."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","4","22 February 2016"," The Wonderful Visuals Bring the Film to Life
","The Revenant (2015) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Visually striking drama/action film about guide Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) who crosses a grizzly bear and is seriously wounded. Before long the man (Tom Hardy) left back to protect him leaves him to do as well as taking away someone very close to Glass, which leads to a tale of revenge.<br/><br/>Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has quickly become one of the greatest directors in regards to visuals and it pretty much happened over his last two movies including this. As with last year's BIRDMAN, this film here takes the director's visual style to a whole new level and it helps create a rather unique and original looking film that takes on a subject that has been told before but it works.<br/><br/>I say this type of story has been done before and it has countless times. With that said, more than likely the majority of people watching this film hasn't seen the story before because we really haven't seen this type of Western in several decades. I think it's fair to call this a Western but it's rather hard to imagine the Indian massacre, the bear battle or the intense ending not making this a Western in its own way.<br/><br/>The strongest thing about this film are the visuals but we've also got a couple excellent performances from DiCaprio and Hardy. Both men are wonderful in their roles and this is especially true for Hardy who is just so cold blooded and evil that you can't help but want to see him in a lot of pain. The actor does a marvelous job building up this character without too many words but when he does say something it rings right through you. As for DiCaprio, I'm not going to lie but he's one of my favorite actors and he has been since I first saw him in THIS BOY'S LIFE back when it was released. I don't think this is one of his greatest performances but he is still wonderful here and especially since he has to do the majority of the acting with his eyes.<br/><br/>The film's settings are another major plus as you really do feel and believe what you're seeing on the screen. The director does an excellent job at making you feel everything that the lead character feels and this includes the now already legendary bear attack. The film's brutal violence is another major plus because it just makes everything seem a lot more realistic. THE REVENANT is certainly one of the most beautiful looking movies you'll see from 2015 and it has two great actors delivering excellent performances."
"tinovalkki","6","2","4","21 February 2016"," Boring and lame but will get its Oscars
","Spit, dirt and painful faces. That was a first sentiment of mine about this movie. It surely is gritty picture of settler, but after tenth time when Leonardi Di Caprio rescues himself from certain death everything starts to feel too unbelievable. I am certain that many of you disagree, but for me this movie is boring and predictable. There is a lot of beautiful scenery, maybe even too much to handle. You could easily cut this movie under two hours length instead of over two and half an hour length without any suffering for the storytelling. Maybe this is what they call an artistic of a movie what it needs to take notice in Oscars. Probably it will get more than ten nominees, but is it really worth it? I am quite definite that Leonardo will pick an Oscar of best leading actor, because there are enough of spit, pus and painful faces and if that is all it needs. At the beginning of a movie is very realistic Indian attack scene, almost a racist. Attack of a bear is also very well done and it gives a strong start for a movie. Unfortunately magic vanish quite quickly. Somehow you just start to wait the end scene. Everything that happens in between star and the end starts to feel just vain. The Revenant is well produced drama, but at the same time it is boring and predictable. It is very patriotic and I'm sure the old members of actors guild will love it so much that many Oscars are pretty undisputed. To me it was just too lame and boring."

","This movie surpassed my all expectations, I felt all kinds of emotions with this movie, desperation, anger, hope, intrigue, solitude and many more, and let me tell you, those are emotions very hard to get from me just by watching a movie. That is thanks to the magnificent acting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, both of them are two of the greatest actors of their generation.<br/><br/>This movie is relative long but I connected so much with the main character that the time distorted and it felt longer because you can feel the character's pain and this is one of the few movies that even being long you feel is so short, you just enjoy every second, you taste it like enjoying your favorite meal.<br/><br/>In simple words, watch it and you wont regret even one minute."
"descendintodespairband","10","2","4","16 February 2016"," A hope for cinematography
","By far much more than a simple story of survival, here it is: the proof that cinematography is not dead. An amazing blend of stunning visuals, exceptional soundtrack, an unparalleled story and incredible acting. Almost every single shot of this masterpiece is filled with symbolism and emotions like I've rarely seen in a movie. It is really heartwarming to see an artistic creation of this magnitude get the production it deserves. It has instantly become one of my favorite movies ever made and I can see the director, Alejandro González Iñárritu, sitting alongside timeless geniuses such as Stanley Kubrick, Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky. The Revenant feels so natural and with one long shot after another brings a considerable amount of emotional stress on the viewer. It also has something that I thought was long dead in cinematography: quiet time. Atmospheric moments with no dialogue whatsoever paint an emotional canvas that is sure to move even the most stone-hearted viewer. Iñárritu's masterpiece is a movie for the mature and intelligent cinephile and I have only words of praise for it. Fantastic."
"dawoodmirza-85627","6","2","4","13 February 2016"," A solo survival against all odds
","The name ""Leonardo Dicaprio"" has always attracted me towards movies and most of the time it has paid dividends. The Revenant was the same case however it did perform like my favourite soccer team scoring a goal in the opening 10 mins and then losing the game 1-2. Everything in the movie was a class itself except for the long long scenes which resulted in the very long airtime. <br/><br/>As far as the cinematography is concerned, simply outstanding and the direction is superb. No recent movie that I saw shot such amazing scenes of nature which made me in love with natural beauty of snowy mountains. <br/><br/>The acting by the whole cast is fantastic and hats off for Leo the way he worked up his character. I would have liked to see some more role of a girl in this story as her absence dried up the whole movie and all most of the girls rated this movie as a guy flick. <br/><br/>On the whole, a good movie which could hAve done a lot more. In general a bit slow but for all those who likes American History and War movies, or students learning direction and acting, this is recommended."
"DanielRobertRoss","10","2","4","12 February 2016"," We are all savages
","I'm a sucker for films set in the 1800s, it's always been my favorite period in history, so this film (Along with Hateful Eight) was a must see. I haven't seen Alejandro González Iñárritu's previous film Birdman, but considering the glowing reviews and Oscars, it must have been good and I will see it when I get around to it. Simply put, this is the second best movie of 2015 (After Mad Max: Fury Road). The cinematography is breathtaking, showing off the unforgiving yet beautiful scenery and the bear mauling scene is the most brutal bear attack in cinema history. DiCaprio gives another great performance, possibly his strongest yet, in a role that is almost dialogue-free for the first hour. Props to Tom Hardy (Dark Knight Rises, Mad Max) for once again disappearing into a role, this time as murderous fur trapper Fitzgerald, he really is the new Daniel Day Lewis, there is no actor, just a brilliant character. I saw the film twice, and loved it even more the second time. Highly recommended."
"Rebriwien","5","2","4","12 February 2016"," One-man show
","The Revenant is set in a world full of interesting characters and huge events. As so often happens, the film-makers picked out one white man and put him in the spotlight, fading everything around him into a blur. Don't expect the movie to discuss the rights of Native American and/or women - they're passed over just like panoramas of snowy scenery.<br/><br/>While Leonardo DiCaprio does some hardcore acting huffing, wheezing, coughing up blood and crawling around, the script is such a one-man, one-act show we don't really learn much about Hugh Glass, just that he's a widow with a son and several life- threatening injuries. It's debatable if his will to survive and get revenge can even be called bravery.<br/><br/>All that said, the movie is actually quite enjoyable to watch. (As long as you're not bothered by blood and guts.) It's a long one, but the pacing is fine. The visuals depend on good old-fashioned camera work rather than hours of CGI, and when they do use CGI (yes, the famous bear), it's so life-like you won't even spot it."
"davidsmith907","6","2","4","9 February 2016"," Yet another over hyped let down
","Leo DiCaprio is being suggested for an Oscar for this film.<br/><br/>No idea why.<br/><br/>This film starts well...the attack on the camp by native American's is brutal and realistic then there's the Leo versus the bear scene which is great. Most interesting factor in the movie is the relationship between Leo and his son but that was cut short when bad guy of the movie Tom Hardy kills his son to force the plot pretty early in the film. Then Leo spends 75% (maybe more) crawling around injured with his throat damaged which means nearly zero dialogue from his character. So we're left with Tom Hardy to carry the film and story verbally. Which is never a good idea since in most movies he's in majority of people can't understand a word he says half the time.<br/><br/>There's little action in the second half, mainly just a forced Leo versus hardy finale which is nothing special.<br/><br/>This movie is insanely over-hyped and will go on the pile of films that won't be watched twice.<br/><br/>Leo DiCaprio if you do get an Oscar be sure to realize it wasn't for this film but something you did earlier in your career."
"sunilsach-14175","6","2","4","8 February 2016"," The Revenant
","A shaw, who are all the black and white film converts,the cinematography has merit, that is if you live in a colorless world but I personally enjoy movies that have some color. By watching the film you will learn some survival techniques but really, is this what you want? There is walking and more walking with some gore (the highlights) in a bleak environment. Kudos to DiCaprio to have survived the filming in these conditions, but it wasn't deserving of a Golden Globe and certainly will not be deserving of an Oscar, although he will probably win it. The dialogue is non-existent, but grimaces of the painful experience seem to be what the film underlines."

","Visiting the Pacific Northwest has kinda been on my bucket list, and this film just saved me using miles on my American Airlines' AAdvantange card, but that's the good news... Sadly, this film borrows too much from the equations of Saving Private Ryan, extraordinary opening battle scene, but really, Gladiator with snow, where the wife and son flashbacks were way too similar and predictable. I barely heard the dialogue, whether it was poor recording of the audio during the shoot or the theater's sound system. (I resorted to reading the characters' lips.) Inasmuch as I wanted to believe the story, a bear attack of such magnitude, open wounds, loss of blood, albeit modern day medical care, and recovering with such ability, killed its credibility. Les Stroud and Bear Grylls would cringe regarding hypothermia's effects while swimming in subzero waters, wearing soaked garments, without succumbing, nearly had me walk out of the theater. Overall, the film should win an Oscar for cinematography, as well as a camera operator who handled a Steadicam quite well. If anything, the film makes me long for The Wolf of Wall Street II."
"gercs","9","2","4","6 February 2016"," visually impressive director's film
","From the opening of the movie, you already have a good idea that the work is masterful. From the shots of the flowing water in the middle of the forest to the shots of the mountains and the sky, the technical achievement is impressive, most notably the camera work and the visuals. It started great, and then augmented by Leonardo's performance, it retained its strength towards the end. Although it's not much on the writing department, with some forgettable conversations, its driving force is the visuals, and perhaps it can be even told well as a silent film, although we might miss the aptly written film music. The point here is that this is one of the best directed films of the year and in many years. One notable scene is the raid of the American natives against a band of White hunters. Albeit small in scale, it felt grand and challenging to shoot, given the unique angles and action sequences. It was rather a gory scene, which Alejandro Inarritu masterfully mixed with artistic values.<br/><br/>There were a lot of other scenes with bloodshed and gore, and in terms of effective use of visual effects, it is the battle with the huge bear that stood out among the rest. If we talk about the most violent among them, one cannot rule out the combat in the last part of the movie. Although it is not really as violent as most of Tarantino's movies, one cannot help to notice the director's fascination of the artistic value of blood in the snow. <br/><br/>Apart from the direction, there were two other strong driving forces in the movie: DiCaprio's performance and the cinematography. The role was definitely challenging, but then it was a bull's eye. The other characters were not developed well, but you will not be bothered by it because the plot is simple. Miss some of their conversations and you won't miss a lot. It was after all a director's film about survival and revenge, impressively made."

But for the most part there just wasn't any character depth.. The only intriguing character for me was a native Indian that helps DiCaprio & then with quick skills builds a shelter to protect DiCapriofrom a blizzard, tthat guy I was fascinated with to see more only for him to be bumped off.

","What the hell? Are you kidding me? This is just a miserable survivor movie. The misty atmosphere is cool but it is not enough to make a movie. LDC is really wasted here. Anyone can play his role, there is no particular acting when compared to LDC's any other movie. He is just crawling on the ground and murmuring. Wow what a performance! I am really astonished! <br/><br/>In terms of technical details there are a lot of goofs. The fight with the bear is overly exaggerated. No one can survive such an attack in those conditions. In one scene he is dragging his left leg and in another scene the right one. There are many similar issues regarding his survival. Through the end of the movie, Fitzgerald easily loots the captain's safe which is ridiculous. And finally in the ending, Glass sacrifices everything to kill Fitzgerald but what a coincidence that there are readily available cutthroats just 10 meters downstream and he wants the leave this pleasure to them. Haha it really did make me laugh! Ohh was I supposed to cry, sorry guys but I laughed my a** off!!"
"mickcasey-13181","Null","2","4","31 January 2016"," The perils of Pauline with bears
","With a token appeal to our interest in the main character this film invites us to share with him a series of catastrophes which would have killed not only lesser men but any man who lives in any kind of believable world. Mauled by a bear, choked by the 'villain', nearly drowned in a rushing torrent, left to crawl across miles of frozen wasteland, plunged over a precipice, our hero survives it all. He eats raw fish caught with a method defying all logic, he gnaws on and is sickened by raw buffalo, ignoring the opportunity to teach the art of barbecue to a random native on the fire burning invitingly behind them, he grimaces, he growls, her bleeds - he survives despite the odds, despite the elements, despite the siren call of credibility. There is nothing wrong with the performances. Di Caprio emotes his suffering by recreating a hangover in scene after scene, Tom Hardy does his impressive best with a cliché from any number of westerns, Will Poulter does well with his ingénue role. The photography is exquisite. Overall, however, I kept expecting Mazi stormtroopers, the Alien or Freddie Krueger to pop out of a frozen bush and add to our hero's trials, such was the almost comic overloading of the dice cast against poor Leo. The Indian attack and the bear attack are well done - after that repair to the bear - sorry, the bar."
"captainmike-michael","10","2","4","30 January 2016"," A Masterpiece about Vengeance and Redemption
","Unlikely the complexity in his previous masterpiece Birdman, Iñárritu has approached a straightforward story without much dialogues but enriched with metaphors about vengeance and redemption. It is an unresistant hypnotic drama that combines revenge, survival, violence and desperation intensely that would certainly chill audiences both physically and mentally. Each and every single detail of the film is taken care perfectly, death and evilness of the characters are well captured with beauty and horror thanks to the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, the setting of the stranded nature background and the powerful orchestral scores add on the sombre effects which all contribute to the impressive technical aspects of the cinematic experience. Leonardo DiCaprio amazes again with his brutal and anchoring performance struggling to survive while the commitment between him and Tom Hardy into their respective roles have successfully turned the director's artistic visions into an immersive life of death journey. Although it seems to be a strange film with striking images of blood soaking ground, animals and humans, it is an inspiring wild expedition about humanity and inhumanity that is elegant in its own simplicity."

","From the unbelievable acting to the groundbreaking cinematography there was not a single moment where I was not completely immersed in this story. As soon as the opening credits began I was transported to that cold wilderness and it was not until the final credits rolled that I emerged from this film feeling as if I now understood what it may have been like to love, live and struggle in a time when living meant surviving.This film did an incredible job conveying the deep love a father feels for his son. A fantastic thrilling experience that will leave you feeling emotional. Dicaprio's portrayal of a character whose overwhelming love for his son serves as the driving force throughout this picture, was not only incredibly real and captivating but also powerfully emotional. This movie is filled with a talented cast. The young and veteran actors alike are like windows to another time, transporting you to the difficult and gray existence of people at that time. The breathtaking scenery of this perfectly filmed movie was like taking a deep breath in a place you had never been. Living in the Pacific Northwest all my life I felt the area of wilderness being represented was so truthfully pictured. Every masterfully crafted frame of this film will leave you speechless.

I very much enjoyed his opponents acting too. This film contains just the right amount of violence to make it believable.

","With so many poor stories and plot lines often undertaken in mainstream film, when a director and actors get a chance to partake in a potentially great story like The Revenant, you have to come through. The potential for greatness is right in your hands. <br/><br/>So without being too wordy or descriptive this movie is a Failed Opportunity at Greatness and is completely over-rated. No reason awards should be going out in this film except for cinematography and to Tom Hardy (who was great!).<br/><br/>PROs: -The film did do a fairly good job of capturing the brutal frontier life, the hardship of survival in the west during the early 1800's, and gosh just how stinkin hard life must have been back then. -The imagery and cinematography was GREAT. The scenes were visually epic. The bear scene was so raw. The film was just plain raw and real feeling. -At no point did you feel good or happy during the movie (except snowflake eating scene). And that's a success, in that they were certainly going for that feel.<br/><br/>CONs: -Considering everything above, this movie bombed. Creating the above PROs on a $135,000,000 budget is easy. Making it more than that is the challenge. Not much was added on by directing and acting. -2 1/2 hour movie that had ZERO character development (except for Tom Hardy's character Fitzgerald). He was great not by script but by personal performance. Everyone else was hollow and uninspiring. -The story did not grip you in anyway. At no point did I find myself caring for Glass(DiCaprio), or anyone else outside of maybe Will Poulter's character Bridger. -There was little clarity as to where, why, and for who everyone was living for. No sense of purpose. -Leo's performance was so OVERRATED. He did not portray ruggedness, mournfulness, frustration, anger, revenge, in anyway. Not through facial expression, sound, or action. I can't believe he's getting so much credit for this role!?!? Why, because it was hard to film!? What a joke. -The revenge chase should have lasted longer. It was a week ending. -The soundtrack was just OK. With minimal dialogue, and a primarily visual film, you need to hit a homerun with the soundtrack. Very disappointing. <br/><br/>And that's quite it. Just a straight up disappointing film. Might be worth watching just for the visuals and bear scene. Outside of that, I'm glad to never see it again. <br/><br/>It was a combination of ""The Way Back"" and ""The Road"". Just not as good as either film."
"JamesHitchcock","8","2","4","27 January 2016"," One Who Comes Back
","Late 2015 has given us two fine epics of survival, ""The Revenant"" and ""In the Heart of the Sea"", both dealing with men who somehow manage to survive against the odds after a disaster which leaves them isolated in a hostile environment. The word ""revenant"" literally means ""one who comes back"", and is often used to refer to a ghost which ""comes back"" to haunt the living. ""The Revenant"", however, is not a tale of the supernatural. It is a Western based upon the true story of Hugh Glass, an early 19th century frontiersman. In 1823 Glass was part of a fur trapping party when he was attacked and severely injured by a grizzly bear. Glass's companions left him to die in what was then unexplored wilderness, but he somehow survived and came seeking revenge on those who had abandoned him. In particular he wanted vengeance against one John Fitzgerald who had not only tried to persuade the others to kill Glass outright but had also murdered Glass's son Hawk, who had been trying to protect his father. In this sense Glass is a living ""revenant"", one who comes back to haunt his enemies during his lifetime. <br/><br/>The date at which the film is set is an unusual one; most Westerns are set during the period 1865-1890, the quarter-century immediately following the Civil War, and it is unusual to find one set as early as the 1820s. The story, however, is not particularly original; revenge has long been a standard theme of Westerns. Indeed, Glass's story has already been told in an earlier film, ""Man in the Wilderness"", made in 1971 and starring Richard Harris.<br/><br/>I have never seen ""Man in the Wilderness"" so cannot say how it compares to ""The Revenant"". Alejandro G. Iñárritu's film, however, is very different from most revenge Westerns, not in its storyline but in its style of storytelling. The traditional revenge western is fast-paced, moving quickly to the climactic final shoot-out between hero and villain. (Another 1971 film, ""Hannie Caulder"", is a good example, except that there the person seeking revenge is a woman rather than a man). ""The Revenant"" is different. It is a large-scale epic of the West, slower and more deliberate in its pacing. It starts not with the bear attack, as many directors would have done, but with a battle between the trappers and a band of Native Americans. For most of the film the emphasis is not on vengeance but on Glass's struggle to survive not only the bear but also cold, hunger, hostile Indians and an equally hostile group of rival French (presumably French Canadian) trappers.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio has not only given a number of fine performances in recent years, he has done so while playing roles generally very different from one another. The rugged backwoodsman Glass has little in common with urbane millionaires like Jay Gatsby or Howard Hughes in ""The Aviator"", or with J. Edgar Hoover or the youthful con-man Frank Abagnale in ""Catch Me If You Can"". This is perhaps DiCaprio's most physical (as opposed to verbal) performance; for most of the film Glass has nobody to talk to, and even when he has he is not the most talkative of individuals. His thoughts and emotions are mostly conveyed through expressions, gestures, movements and a general sense of mood. It was also a physically demanding role; DiCaprio had to undergo in person many of the hardships which Glass endures, such as jumping into icy rivers or sleeping in a buffalo carcass. His ""Best Actor"" Oscar nomination is well deserved. Unfortunately, not all the acting is as good. In particular Tom Hardy as the main villain Fitzgerald failed to speak clearly and was often difficult to understand. He should have stuck to writing ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles"". Iñárritu's original choice for the role was Sean Penn, who may well have been better.<br/><br/>A notable feature is cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's photography. This is one of those films where every shot looks like a painting; I was particularly reminded of the work of great American masters such as Albert Bierstadt, Thomas Cole and Frederic Church. Most of the film was shot in Canada, although because shooting overran into May the final scenes actually had to be shot in the Andes of southern Argentina, one of the few parts of the world where snow was to be found. This is not simply photography of beautiful scenery for its own sake; indeed as most of the action takes place in late autumn and winter the look of the film is for the most part not conventionally beautiful. It is, however, generally awe-inspiring; Lubezki and Iñárritu seem to have wanted to create a sense of majestic grandeur in order to emphasise man's insignificance in the face of nature and of nature's indifference towards man, a sense which makes Glass's achievement in surviving all the more impressive. I hope that the Academy will remember this film at the Oscar ceremony. 8/10"
"vancavalleri","7","2","4","27 January 2016"," Beautiful movie, lengthy, definitely not Leo's strongest performance
","I have to say ""The Revenant"" was a breathtaking movie. The scenery is beautiful, the direction is on point, the actors are doing a very good job. <br/><br/>However, I was personally expecting more from the movie, especially as it had been acclaimed by the critics before its release. First of all, it felt like the picture was unusefully long to tell the story Inarritu wanted to tell (2h40). This resulted in a lot of lengthy and quite uneventful bits. Secondly, while Leonardo DiCaprio does an outstanding job (he is one of the best actors of his generation), I did not think he was really given the room to perform to his usual standard at all. Hugh Glass is an interesting character but I had the feeling the character fell flat during the movie: his back-story is interesting but wasn't exactly well developed in my opinion (the flashbacks weren't always very clear). Glass has very few interactions with other characters and it felt like the chemistry didn't work even between Glass and Hawk or Glass and his wife. The only real connection he seemed to have was with Fitzgerald but I can only assume it is because Tom Hardy was doing a remarkable job. Thridly, this wasn't Leonardo's best performance in my book. He is an outstanding actor, but it felt Tom Hardy stole the show with his impression of Fitzgerald. In comparison, the character of Glass was overall less charismatic and too smooth and good to be believable. <br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, but I was expecting that little ""something special"" that would make it one of the best pictures I had ever seen and it didn't come."

","All in all this isn't a bad movie however considering All those hype around this movie, it was very disappointing. I'll start with good parts: Acting department did its job very well. Both, leo and tom hardy performed outstandingly well. I've read some reviews in which criticizing the movie for too much violence and too much blood scenes. In my opinion this scenes are acceptable since the deeper layer of the movie is about human nature and harsh nature itself. Now the bad parts of the movie starts with the main story or the one that is on the surface and is very obvious: a cliché story of a revenge, battle between the absolute bad and absolute good. a man who left to die rises from tomb and gets his revenge. The thing that surprises me is the fact that even the deeper layers of the movie which is about human nature, nature itself and cruelty against first nations is also very cliché and doesn't have anything new to present. The movie is too long and slow. I guess more than 80% of the movie is an empty shot of nature or Leonardo starring at some unknown spot. Now in Dead Man we see that Jim Jarjmosch ( I chose this movie on purpose because it has a lot in common with this movie) focuses on a solid story with accents of irony. However in this movie Alejandro G. Iñárritu choses poetry in motion pictures with accents of a story. I love poetry on motion picture In the mood for love, apocalypse now, or many of Akira kursawa's movies can fit in this category but if you fill 80% of your poem with the same words it will make your audience get bored or fall asleep. At the end of the day, I'm not there to listen to the poem, I'm there to see what does your poem means."

","The performances were excellent (Di Caprio does deserves the Oscar this time), the pictures and filming were awesome and everything in general about this movie was ""correct"". But the plot just wasn't for me. In the second this movie started, I wanted it to end; and since I was watching it online, I watched it at 20-minutes intervals. Boring is not the right word, and I feel like this movie wasn't exactly slow. I think my problem with The Revenant is that I didn't care. I didn't care about what was going on or what was going to happen, because I simply didn't feel attached neither to the story or to the characters. I like action movies, but not when the only thing that happens is basically our main character struggling in the edge of the death for TWO HOURS. I just needed more plot, something interesting going on, and not just Di Caprio making pain faces and surviving in un-human, impossible and almost ridiculous ways. I couldn't relax or actually get into the story during the hole movie. Â¿Awesome performances? Yes! Good pictures and scenarios? Of course! It deserves the Oscar's nominations? I guess so. It was ""correct"", and I actually don't regret even for a second watching this movie, it's obvious all the hard work that is behind The Revenent and the watching is worth it just for that. <br/><br/>But yeah... like I said before: not my kind of movie."

","I've gone camping. I've seen bears. I watched Backcountry and I'm sorry, but this film does not meet expectations. I don't believe the entire story is true. Realistically speaking, the injuries sustained by Leo D's character throughout the movie (let alone the bear attack), would have been fatal, especially in the 1830's! Leonardo DiCaprio is a decent actor, however he was not the right one for this character. It seemed the whole cast was off a bit; but then again, the character development was seriously lacking. I watched this movie without judgement, with an open mind. Unfortunately, it didn't pan up and I was genuinely disappointed."
"FXH-71","7","2","4","25 January 2016"," Meticulously crafted, physically draining
","First things first: The Revenant looks absolutely gorgeous, no doubt about that! The fact that it is shot entirely on location with natural lighting paid off in spades, as you'd be hard-pressed to find a film as visually striking as this one, that also feels so gritty and brutal at the same time. The action scenes are riveting and masterfully directed, with the camera seamlessly flowing from one shot to the next, often leaving you amazed and wondering how they pulled it off. That being said, there are a few times where CGI had to be used and even though it did not look in any way bad, the fact that the rest of the film looks so incredibly real, made those moments stick out a little more than they otherwise would.<br/><br/>However, for all its amazing achievements in cinematography and direction, it is far from perfect. I felt that it would have greatly benefited from a shorter running time, as its excessive use of landscape shots often brought an already slow paced film to a crawl. The story isn't anything special; a pretty straightforward tale of survival and revenge with some spiritual self-discovery thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately, character development was minimal and I wasn't as emotionally invested as I thought I should have been. <br/><br/>DiCaprio's performance was compelling as usual even though some of the more extreme situations his character manages to survive stretched my suspension of disbelief a few times. Tom Hardy also gave a noteworthy performance and the interactions between the two throughout the film felt appropriately tense.<br/><br/>Overall, while it falls short of greatness and requires some patience, it's still worth seeing at least once for the cinematography alone."
"manders_steve","7","2","4","23 January 2016"," Larger than life explorers and injuns tale wherein cast and crew really earned their money
","Leonardo DiCaprio is Hugh Glass, the leader of a fur trapping expedition in the 1820s. Glass's tale of survival after a mauling by a grizzly bear and being abandoned by the two remaining members of his party was told in Michael Punke's 2002 novel 'The Revenant: A novel of revenge'. By the way, a revenant is one who returns, as if from the dead â€“ in case, like me, you didn't know the meaning of the word. <br/><br/>The action takes place on the upper Missouri River in present day Montana, North and South Dakota, with the original event bear attack recorded as taking place in May. The snow, water, blizzards, snow melt rivers, not to mention at least two Indian tribes and competitor expeditions make it an incredibly challenging environment, and underlines the unlikeliness of Glass's survival and 320 km journey to Fort Kiowa. These conditions are most convincingly demonstrated, and it must have been just awful for the cast and crew. Truly Mr DiCaprio earned his fee!<br/><br/>The settings are wonderful and the rivers, waterfalls, immense conifer forests lovingly shot looking straight up through the mist, rain and snow make you want to visit the areas â€“ but at the height of summer.<br/><br/>Initially the film is slow and I found it difficult to work out who was who in the murky near dawn and dusk light. It is very violent, with long detailed scenes that pull no punches, which makes for a gritty experience that underpins the drama. In my opinion, it is too long overall and the opportunities lie in the first half. As the film progresses, the stunts become more and more amazing, making it increasingly difficult to remain convinced of the veracity of the story. But after a while, one realises that this doesn't matter and it turns into a wild bucky ride to the certainty of resolution of the moral dilemmas developed along the way."
"Bangell153","6","2","4","21 January 2016"," Beauty and brilliance, tedium and toil
","The Revenant is in many ways absolutely masterful; to criticise such a stunning piece of film-making almost feels inappropriate. But the film highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of its talented director, and lacks a few key ingredients which could have made this a masterpiece in cinematic history.<br/><br/>I doubt I need to comment on the fantastic visuals: the locations are breath-taking, and the landscape shots repeatedly made me sit back and marvel throughout the film. The actions scenes are some of the best-directed I've ever seen - the Native American attack which opens the film has the camera following events down low, on horseback, underwater; it picks up a moment of action and moves onto the next. The effect is to have the viewer feel involved in the scene, as if it were unfolding right before your eyes, and it really drives home the sense of chaos and confusion felt by the characters. The final fight of the film (no spoilers) is one of the best of its kind ever recorded. I'm tired of seeing perfectly choreographed, dirt-free finales. What you get in The Revenant is so tense and visceral that everyone around me in the cinema - many of whom were bored and restless with the film by this point - were suddenly transfixed, gripping the arms of their chairs. The scene combines the tension of the knife-fight towards the end of Saving Private Ryan with uncompromising, unflinching brutality that looks more like a bar fight than a movie duel.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent; over the last few years he's grown from one of my most disliked to one of my favourite actors. However, I enjoyed Tom Hardy's performance even more. Partly this is because his role in the film allows him to do much more than mostly express physical pain; but what I love about Hardy is that he always makes his characters believable as well as mesmerising to watch. Time and again he steals the show and becomes the actor you can't wait for the camera to pan back to in his recent films; another top-notch performance here. Credit also to Domhnall Gleeson, who impressed me here as he did in Ex Machina and The Force Awakens - a new star, for sure.<br/><br/>For the points I've made so far, the film is worth seeing. It's an astounding cinematic experience, especially in an age when over-use of CGI predominates. Unfortunately, the film has its shortcomings too. To say it felt 'bloated' would be unfair, considering the meticulous attention to detail; but undeniably, this movie makes its length felt. The key problem is the lack of an emotional core; the main character's physical suffering and feats of endurance can only sustain our interest for so long without any character development. An attempt to flesh out the character is made with the clumsy inclusion of flashbacks and hallucinations - these segments were tedious, though thankfully short. Ultimately, we never really get to know our protagonist. Now, this need not be too much of a problem - one of my favourite films, Apocalypto, also indulges in minimal character development for its survival story. Apocalypto did two things differently, however: firstly, the pace never slackened; the main character is constantly chased and the action is non-stop. The Revenant stops and starts and pans up to a tree canopy a few too many times. Secondly, Apocalypto had a 'ticking clock' element, lacking here. Apocalypto, then, was full of tension; The Revenant really misses a narrative drive and ended up feeling too long. It's similar to Werner Herzog's Aguirre: lots of stunning landscape shots, lots of great cinematography, lots of admirable on-location work by the actors and crew - but it's patience-testing. The ponderous nature of The Revenant made it disappointing for me that Inarritu misses a couple of great opportunities to ratchet up the tension: the opening attack could have had a tense prelude before the action kicks off, and there's a scene where the main character is discovered by Native Americans and has to flee, which doesn't take its time and create some fear.<br/><br/>It's difficult to create a strong narrative core to a film that's essentially about the survival feats of one man, granted. But the stop-start pace doesn't work well with the lack of character depth or development, and leaves the audience questioning why they're watching the gruesome spectacles on-screen; as we sit through another long scene and reflect - there's certainly enough time to stop 'experiencing' the film and start reflecting as a movie-goer - we wonder what all the spectacle is in service of. And the answer is, well, a very shallow story. Not that I think Inarritu aimed for a particularly deep story - but his visual masterpiece struggles to fully hold the viewer's attention. There is one opportunity for moral complication which is declined (very non-specific to avoid spoilers): one of the men who leaves the protagonist for dead doesn't simply leave him because thinks he's going to die anyway and is worried about his own survival - he also does *something else* which gives the main character reason to hate him and want revenge. The *something else* is a non-historical detail and could have been omitted - wouldn't it be more interesting if, rather than a straightforward revenge plot, we have to question our protagonist's right to seek revenge? If we the audience had to question whether we would leave the man to die - if the protagonist himself had to question this? <br/><br/>If you're an impatient person, don't watch this film. To most people, however, I'd recommend a watch. Go book yourself a good seat at a cinema with a big screen and marvel at the visuals, the acting, and the action.<br/><br/>There's certainly enough that's great about this film to make me excited to see what Inarritu does next."

","When we were young, we used to play a word game which we called ""Fortunately/Unfortunately"". It was quite a straightforward game to play, with one player setting the scene by saying something like ""Doris went to the park one day"". The next player would respond by saying ""Unfortunately, as she was walking to the park, a giant girl-eating lizard jumped out from behind a telephone box"". The first player then needed to respond by saying something like ""Fortunately, it had just eaten another girl and so it was all full up"".<br/><br/>Watching The Revenant reminded me hugely of this game. Leonardo Di Caprio is your classic white man, Glass, who is down with the native Americans, nursing a lost wife and looking to protect his ""half-breed"" son (as he's charmingly referred to by Tom Hardy's compelling, although somewhat garbled, villain Fitzgerald). To say Glass gets knocked back every time he tries to step forward is underplaying the extent of the trials and tribulations he faces.<br/><br/>He's beaten, battered, shot at and stabbed, dunked in ice cold water, dragged through snow, and yet he still keeps on coming. Strangely though, I felt that the director manages to keep things just about credible and the unfortunate events never dawdled or overstayed their welcome, and despite its length, this movie keeps your interest throughout. The camera-work really is astounding, a dizzying whirl that plonks the viewer right at the epicentre of the action. The landscapes and light are really to die for, it's a gorgeous visceral experience throughout and really is a feast for sore eyes.<br/><br/>Hardy's characterisation of Fitzgerald was, for me, the standout performance, even if some of his dialogue is so broad as to be more or less incoherent. However, the brooding sense of malice and unrestrained anger he transmits with a raised eyebrow or a steely-eyed look is astounding. Di Caprio by comparison says very little, for the very good reason that his throats been slashed, leading to a mild moment of humour when he desperately tries to drink some clean water. Which very quickly then transmutes into yet another gory scene that makes you squirm. And that happens frequently throughout.<br/><br/>The plotting and narrative are probably the weakest elements of the production, however, and some of the events felt slightly too pat and contrived to truly hit the roof. The dream sequences in particular didn't add a great deal to the overall package although I can see why they were included. Especially if you go away and read about the actual Hugo Glass, you wonder why IÃ±Ã¡rritu and co needed to invent some of the story in the way that they did when the real-life story sounded quite compelling in the first place. However, those are petty complaints really and I have to say, this is well worth spending two and half hours of your time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I had a bad back on the day that I went to see it. Fortunately, I completely forgot about it whilst watching this movie, it was that good."

","Leonardo DiCaprio WILL do whatever it takes to win an Oscar. He'll get mauled by a grizzly bear, get buried alive, limp and crawl his way out of being buried, gut and sleep inside a horse a la Empire Strikes Back, and even do hand to hand combat with Mad Max himself. Guys, give the man his Oscar, or else he'll probably crucify himself with hot steel bars and barbed wires, before getting stabbed in the side with a harpoon by the Antichrist in the bowels of hell (or Indiana in June) to the irritating sounds of Pentatonix!<br/><br/>Not to any disservice to The Revenant itself, as it is a really damn good movie, and I really want to give special mention to the makeup department. Every gash, cut, scrape, splatter of blood, and wounds seeping with puss look terrifyingly realistic. You see the freshest of cuts slowly heal up and look as if they're getting infected. Combine this with how great DiCaprio's acting is in this, and you get a scarier feel of tension then in any horror film of recent memory. You see him slowly transform into a survivalist savage who's in constant pain. You never see Leonardo DiCaprio, but rather Hugh Glass, the character he plays.<br/><br/>Another mention goes to the director, Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu, for how well he shows us such breathtaking and beautiful views of the frozen points of Canada to visually tell a story. Many points that lack dialogue are well done, especially when combined with DiCaprio's physical acting ability and the musical composition. It's a real match made in heaven<br/><br/>The Story, however, is the weakest part of the film. ""The Revenant"" is loosely based off the Michael Punke novel of the same name. I never read it, but I'm sure there were many deviations from it, as this is solely a survival film that has some generic revenge plot against a racist villain jumbled in, almost like a delicious bacon and chicken sandwich with melted Hagen Daz on top. It just feels forced and out of place, and it really dumbs down Tom Hardy's character to just another Clayton from Tarzan, only now he has a son that's that annoying ginger from ""We're The Millers"" and ""The Maze Runner""<br/><br/>It doesn't really matter, since the visuals, acting, and composition save the film from being a mess. It's an easy recommendation for those who love a good survival film, and to everyone else should at least give it a look. It's a really good one."

Tom Hardy played the arch enemy of LD's character-which TH also did very well. I have not seen a bad guy like that on screen for some time-maybe never. The historical aspect of the movie was handled well-you really got a sense they were back in the 1820's. The film was apparently based on a book but I have never come across the book they are talking about. I really cannot say anything negative about this movie because I think that so far it is the most accurate film dealing with the subject of pioneer America. Go see it-you won't be disappointed. I think it will do well in terms of long term sales if it isn't knocking them dead at the box office right now-it will probably sell a lot of DVD's over time and become a 'new classic movie.'

","A haunting, complex, uncompromising piece of film of which its biggest success is how much it opens for a conversation about filmaking and the power of movies. It is really challenging in craft and provides for a very, very singular experience, despite some overbearing and slightly pretentious touches. <br/><br/>There is one thing that really struck me in thinking about the film: it could be really easy to hate on it for its flaws, because there are flaws and they are the reason this film isn't getting the universal acclaim people were expecting. The flaws it has are actually quite relevant: the screenplay isn't really anything special, there is so much acting thrown to your face in an way too overwhelming way. It is one of those films that really pushes the ""look at us we're acting"" thing and almost everybody is part of it. There also lots of breathing space that isn't really necessary and overall the whole thing really is thrown into your face in an overwhelming way that sometimes totally forgets subtlety and brings down also the film thematically. But the point is, all of these flaws are there and they would normally really knock a movie down, yet there is so much triumph here in the craft of filmaking, so much ambition, so much sheer cinema, it is really hard to get mad at anything of this. Basically the positives outweigh the negatives. <br/><br/>As much as I said that there's the ""look at us we're actors"" thing, of whom Inarritu is also to blame for, there is even more genuine fantastic work from them. Could DiCaprio have done with being a little more subtle in points? of course, but you simply can't discount a performance of this caliber based on that. He has problems in disappearing from the screen a an actor, but overall what he does here is some kind of remarkable. With his recent movies he is almost creating a new school of acting that isn't quite anything we've seen before, good or bad I don't know. Domnall Glesson and Will Poulter also have their chance to shine. Still, nobody manages to take over the Brando of our generation: Tom Hardy can do no wrong, he upstages all of the actors and steals every moment he is in, he is just a powerhouse.<br/><br/>A thought that really, really hit me after this film and that I cannot stop thinking about is how much I would now love to see Inarritu direct an action film. Just writing that makes me even more excited about it. He just has a thing were under his direction the technical aspect of a film is beyond debatable. It is just flawless. The sound, music, Lubezki's photography, everything, it just leaves your jaw dropped. He does take a little too much breathing time as I said before, but it is easily forgettable when you see what he can do when sh*t hits the fan. I repeat it, I just want to see him direct two hours of action now, that's how visceral this film is, it is astonishing. He reminds you what is the power of cinema and actually goes further in that in creating new ways to use the screen. There is a horse chase in this film where I couldn't believe what was happening with the camera and the shock value it has floored me.<br/><br/>As I said, if you really want to hate this film there is nothing stopping you, but as a fan of cinema and filmaking and as an obsessed lover of the craft behind everything involving film, ""The Revenant"" was really an achievement."
"willismattjohn","8","2","4","16 January 2016"," An excellent cinematic experience but not without its flaws.
","You cannot deny this film's beautiful cinematography and excellent direction. You also can't deny there are a few excellent performances with Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio standing out. However, for me it doesn't quite deliver as much as I expected it too. This could be due to me having high expectations for this movie, as there has been a lot of hype surrounding it, not to mention the 12 Oscar nominations. Although, I found the overall experience enjoyable I couldn't help but think that it could have been better. The film never seemed to deliver what it promised after the brutal and enthralling Native American attack at the start of the film. Some of the following hour and a half is at times a little boring. This scene was a highlight along with the bear attack, the murder of Glass' son and the finale. This is not to say that the rest of the film is all boring and unnecessary but some of it I feel is. I get it, we're watching this mans brutal struggle to survive in this vast wilderness against all the odds. We're watching him suffer from injuries and fight to survive at every turn, all in the name of revenge. But there is a period where we see Leonardo do little more than grunt and grimace which I understand is what the character would be doing, it just grows a little tiresome after a while. If it weren't for the picturesque setting and beautiful shots captured there are times when you could nod off. For me, despite a tremendous performance from Leonardo (you really do believe he's going through hell mentally and physically) I'm unsure it's Oscar worthy. So many of his previous roles certainly have been, but for him to pick it up for this I think is unlikely. I can't think of many actors who've won the best actor in a leading role award whilst having about 20 lines over 2.5 hours. Tom Hardy on the other hand is one I could see picking up an award and deservingly so as he puts in a sensationally convincing performance from start to finish. To conclude this film is worth a watch and at times extremely gripping whilst at other times it seems to drift of course and lose you throughout its long running time. If it weren't for some excellent individual performances, beautiful cinematography and outstanding direction I would have given this film a much lower score, as the story and character development are a little off par. Can't help but think it had the potential to be a masterpiece. 8/10 stars"

","I'm still torn on The Revenant. On one hand the production is an amazing accomplishment in a way few movie have been before. It's mixture of Tarkovsky-like visuals and rarely photographed backdrops are easy to admire as well. On the other hand I was left feeling the characters and story weren't created with the same majesty. The core story could have easily been transplanted into a B western from the 1950's. Maybe that was the intention but if so I don't understand why. This had the skeleton of a transcendental work-of-art but the body laid over that skeleton was nothing but stale hokum. I will probably return to watch it again in 5 or so years and see if my opinion has changed for better or worse. As it stands, I'm torn on it's quality."

","The Academy Award winning Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu took Michael Punke's novel, and really turned it into something of his own. AGI captured countless breathtaking shots, utilizing a lot of long-wide takes, and some hand held shots. The premise is a little played out, but he did a BRILLIANT job putting a creative and unique twist to nature, and human nature. With AGI incorporating this tremendous act of risk at all times, it really helped to keep the audience engaged, and to not pay too much attention to the longer runtime. The opening scene made for such a crazy first act. With such a hard hitting opening, you have to keep that same energy throughout each act, but AGI slowed down the pace a little bit come the second act, incorporating some emotional notes, while being a little repetitive with his direction. The third act capitalized on the speed change prior, and became a very entertaining, high octane final act.<br/><br/>With Leonardo DiCaprio & Tom Hardy leading the charge, you know you're automatically in for a treat. After all of Leo's Academy Award performances, HE FINALLY RECEIVED HIS FIRST OSCAR, being so well deserved. His emotions felt so genuine, that you can truly feel his pain, and really connect with his character. Tom Hardy also put on such a fantastic performance, also being nominated for an Oscar. His character had a very clear notion, and was a very big part of the way things unfold. The acting overall was very good, without anyone overshadowing one another. The tattered & dirty costume design by Jacqueline West was so articulate and well designed. The makeup & hairstyles was just the cherry on top to complete that rugid look.<br/><br/>The Academy Award Winning Emmanuel Lubezki took over the photography, and my god, was it beautiful. He utilized the beautiful natural lighting, while also incorporating a lot of dark colors to embrace the gritty & cruel tone. Not only was the cinematography gorgeous, but the visual & practical effects absolutely stole the show.... and most of the budget. The visual effects added this level of grit to the film, making everything feel so real, from the action to the climate. AGI and the effects team did an amazing job making you feel like you were in the movie. I was cold when there was a bitter cold scene, I felt the pain with all the injuries; AGI really knows how to connect to the audience.<br/><br/>Overall, the 3 awards & 12 nominations speak for themselves. This is an absolute must-see, especially for the DiCaprio & Hardy fans out there.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"ethanbresnett","9","0","0","11 April 2020"," A punishing tale of survival at any cost
","The story of The Revenant is a simple but powerful one. A truly devastating tale following the desperate struggle of a man to survive against all odds in a desolate and punishing environment. A tale of revenge, love, and loss which packs so many emotional punches. It's a testament to the quality of the story and direction that this film absolutely flew by. It really didn't feel like two and a half hours and was paced very well. That was never a given with this story either. The middle third could have dragged, but avoided that pitfall completely.<br/><br/>A large part of that is due to DiCaprio, who was exceptional. The emotion that he brought to this performance was astounding, and the pain that he felt (both emotionally and physically) was so real. What was most extraordinary from this performance is that it was very physical and visceral. He managed to convey an abundance of emotion and feeling from a relatively bare script, using his body and face to their full capacity. His Oscar was most definitely deserved for this performance. Alongside DiCaprio the support cast were all good, if not too present throughout the film.<br/><br/>The cinematography of The Revenant was beautiful, with many scenes feeling like pictures. The setting really made this film incredible, establishing the bleak and punishing environment of the Dakotas expertly. The danger that Glass was facing because of this environment was made all the more real by the cinematography and direction - it wasn't simply to make the film look pretty, but to drive the story onward, which it did to great effect.<br/><br/>From the survival techniques through to the fight scenes this film felt incredibly gritty and realistic. The stunt choreographers, the cinematography, direction, and performances all contributed to this realism, producing a spectacular piece of cinema that can't be missed."

The film constantly explores the strength of man (both spiritual and physical), as well as the connection between man and nature, and the depiction of man as just another species in the animal kingdom (especially notable in a climatic sequence towards the end of the film).
The film perfectly balances technical agility and transcendental tone in a way that is both brutal and poetic."

","I've heard nothing but good things about The Revenant, especially regarding the cinematography. However, upon watching it, I was shocked by some of the terrible wide-angle lens choices. This lead a number of the scenes having distortion which completely pulled me out of the scenes. This is a shame, because other than that the camera work was solid. I usually wouldn't nitpick about something so small but, unfortunately, other than the visual aspect of the film, it didn't have much else going on.<br/><br/>Leo did a wonderful job, as did the rest of the cast, but it wasn't enough to hold my interest through the two and a half hour run-time. This isn't because I don't like slowly paced films about people, I do, I just found the story a little simple for such a long run-time. I have no problem with a two and a half hour character driven film, but it needs some complexity to justify it. Apologies to the filmmakers, but I don't find a man crawling and stumbling around the woods for over an hour to be especially gripping storytelling. The only reason I can think of for this film being as needlessly long as it was, was to show off the stunning landscapes in which it was filmed.<br/><br/>Had the movie been shorter, it would have been much better. There were some scenes, one in particular with a bear, that dragged on so absurdly long that it could pass for a parody of itself.<br/><br/>The Revenant is neither a spectacular film nor a horrible film, it's fine. Just fine. Nothing more, nothing less. If you're looking for an interesting character driven drama, check out something like Nightcrawler instead."

After recovering from his wounds with some assistance the frontiersman, utilizing his legendary tracking and survival skills, hunts down his partner on his way back to civilization to seek vengeance for his partner's betrayal.

","Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu's ""The Revenant"" is without a doubt one of the most beautifully filmed movies I've ever seen and is also one of the most violent, it isn't a perfect but it has enough qualities in it that make it as good as it is. Leonardo DiCaprio won a long awaited best actor Oscar three years ago for his excellent performance as Hugh Glass a frontiersman and fur trapper on an expedition in the extremely cold wilderness in the early 1820's and his group of other trappers includes John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), as well as Captain Andrew Henry (Dohmnall Gleeson) among others. After we get to know the characters a little bit we see Glass in the woods by himself hunting for animals and finds a bear that ends up mauling him to the point where he's so badly beaten up that he nearly dies and is left for dead by his own fellow trappers. After Glass wakes up and discovers this he sets out for revenge against those who betrayed him. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the finest performance I've ever seen from him in a movie for a role which he went all out in preparation for and totally deserved that Oscar for, Tom Hardy is also very good here and got a well deserved best supporting actor nomination as a result. The acting is strong, the direction is very good, and the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is nothing short of breathtaking. The only thing I would say about this movie that I had a problem with was that at points in the film it seemed a little drawn out with DiCaprio's mission to seek revenge on those who left him for dead but it is also understandable because it's his movie. The movie was actually filmed in the harsh weather conditions that are actually seen throughout its over two and a half hour runtime. Iñárritu is without a doubt one of the best directors of the last twenty years and part of the great Hollywood trio of Mexican filmmakers along with Alfonso Cuaron and Guillermo del Toro, and so far out of the three films I've seen that Iñárritu directed not one was bad. This is one of 2015's very best films."

What the picture lacks is a complex story. The story we are presented just doesn't hold up to scrutiny, somehow managing to be unexplored and overstretched and managing to squeeze logical inconsistencies together with amazingly realistic scenes.<br/><br/>Take the relationship between Glass and his son; you're telling me there wasn't time to explore this in 160+minutes of screen time? Except for in the hokey dream sequence scenes of the movie that have to be the weakest part and an obvious crutch.

","An engrossing drama ! To start with, the merciless face of the Nature, the panoramas etc. inspire an awe. The way the camera moves from each character's view is subtly impressive. The characters are played impeccably by the actors - Hardy as the selfish and ruthless 'Fitzgerald', the dutiful 'Captain Henry' by Gleeson and the die-hard 'Glass' by Caprio. The background score is above average.
While it's a thrilling work,
one cannot ignore it's numerous faults. First of all, the gross historical inaccuracies and unjust liberties taken, followed by limited display of survival skills(evisceration survival scene appreciated!). Then comes the monotonous illusions(hallucinations) that Glass suffers. It would have been better to create a pure, factually solid survival film rather than a revenge drama intertwined with survival - a serious viewer would often get exasperated e.g: While I was wondering how a near-dead Glass manages to navigate and heal his wounds, I was disturbed by either his hallucinations or some seemingly practical escape from his opponents. How captain Henry makes to fort Kiowa is another mystery. How all the tribes speak the same language, what horses eat in that barren land and many such questions could have been covered in its 2h 36min. run but the scriptwriter and the director didn't seem to have a precise focus.
While it's an absorbing film, watch it with a pinch of salt ..."

","I previously gave this film 10/10, however after some thought I have reduced it to 9/10. The film is an amazing film, but in light of reading the true story, I realise that the film does contain a lot of wasted potential.
In the true story of Hugh Glass, there was no pawnee son, no burial, and no one died. Glass only pursued Fitzgerald through anger of his desertion. Had the film remained faithful to the original story, it would have felt far less hollywood-esque, and would have been a courageous attempt at a different kind of revenge story.
The cinematography, the sets, and the costumes remain beyond phenomenal, but there was something they missed in the plot."

","The Revenant - an American biographical movie in western background in a wintry climate, which is also played as a character, happening in 1820's. Hugh Glass played by Leonardo DiCaprio is about a man who survived from a grizzly bear attack and survived to take revenge on his son's death. One of the recent films The Revenant is with a higher artistic level and strong effort of visual storytelling methods with least dialogues in the cold background with cold hearted characters. Mind blowing cinematography mention's the name of Emmanuel Lubezki's in wide through a zero lighting technique in the digital era.
At first, it's a peak for Alejandro González Iñárritu's directorial venture after giving a movie like Birdman. Here, this as a masterpiece of Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, which let him to bag him an Oscar. This film has Leo, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson & Will Poulter as main characters to portray the novel with the same name. It starts with a hunter's point of view to hunt down preys and soon himself become a prey. Alejandro González Iñárritu and Mark Smith had done an applauded script to portray the life of Hugh Glass to expel the pain and sorrow of the lost of his only son who got saved once before by himself from a life threatening event. While talking about Leonardo's dedication he deserves more than awards as recognition for this movie.
As a director Alejandro's did justifiable work, in a scene like buried spot escape need some more explanation and information. Tom Hardy is always never given up on his roles; again this is a milestone for his performance as Fitsgerald. In climax as a convict he did a convincing performance and personally as a fan of Hardy, he and the entire team deserves a strong consideration and recognition for presenting such a movie with a high artistic level."

","Simply put, this was too long for a movie that you already know the ending of. <br/><br/>I like historical dramas. Modern advances in film-making have made them incredibly realistic and eminently more watchable than the older generation that were clearly Hollywood soundstage projects. This movie did not disappoint in that regard. It was gritty and believable (sort of--Hugh's legend received a couple embellishments) with beautiful cinematography and top-notch acting.<br/><br/>It was also not a surprise. I first learned of Hugh Glass in junior high. When The Revenant came out, it instantly went to the top of my must-see list. Because Hugh's story is of one man's struggle for survival in the wilderness, I knew it had to have a lot of scenes with only one actor. And it did. But those scenes could have been tightened up a lot. Two and a half hours is a long time for a movie in which very few things actually happened and the things that do happen you mostly expect. I did watch it to the end, but more out of loyalty to Hugh than commitment to the actual story. And-here comes the spoiler-he lives. Huh."

The most beautiful cinematography. I have never seen a movie with a better setting tbh.
Amazing cast and amazing acting. There is nothing to mark on that. Just a-m-a-z-i-n-g.<br/><br/>There is just two little things to note. First of all 
The storyline is actually good but it can seem a bit simple because the whole movie (and it's 2h 36min long) is about Glass getting his revenge on Fitzgerald for killing his son and leaving him behind to die. Now don't get me wrong. There are a lot movies with the same kind of concept but what's different about The Revenant is that A) Glass is trying to get his revenge while almost dying a zillion times and still making it out alive and because he get's injured in the process he is crawling to get to Fitzgerald and his revenge. Literally. He is crawling. B) the movie is hecka long.<br/><br/>But other than that the movie is marvellous and the fight scenes are flawless.<br/><br/>I also really enjoyed the ending which is a rare experience. <br/><br/>9.5 stars because of the two little complaints."

I know people wanted better character development and not such long stretches of quiet but the way it was filmed brings you back to that date and time, makes you know what it must have really been like trying to make a living hunting and trapping amongst tribes of Indians whom we were impinging on their way of life and ruining what was always their land, their animals and especially their ways.
The bear attack was phenomenal and so real I nearly screamed out loud and I've never done that at any movie, ever.
The attempts to save each other, when to run, when to not attempt to save others, all these things caused you to put yourself in their shoes and that's what I love in a story. Not how it's contrived or how it stands up to other contrived stories.

What is gained by the viewer being immersed in a time, place, and setting is lost to mumbling Southern drawl and stagy acting.
If there was a criticism of DiCaprio's performance it was he often overcommitted and his expressions were ungainly. The late Oliver Reed once recalled Peter Cushing's advice to him on how an actor should convey pain: Don't pull your face - suppression of pain is more dramatic.

","If ""The Revenant"" doesn't contribute in some way to revitalising the Western genre, it is likely nothing ever will. The film is a remarkable experience; an example of what happens when each and all of the various aspects of film-making - original soundtrack; cinematography; second unit direction; imagery, etc. - fuse together as effectively as perhaps they are able to in order to deliver something quite extraordinary. <br/><br/>""The Revenant"" unfolds in a place inherently dreary, yet somehow beautiful at the same time; takes place in a setting absolutely deadly, yet possesses a strange tranquillity to it. Mostly every scene or sequence is bookended by a magnificent composition of a mountain or a skyline of trees which you sense might succeed as an award winning photograph all by itself. It takes place in a world drenched in war; hurt; pain; loss and cynical opportunism (you can practically feel the grief dripping off the screen as to watch it), and while it is entirely its own film, somehow manages to draw on the best from other works of its sort (which range from ""Into the Wild"" and ""Apocalypto"" to Terrence Malick) in order to supplement the experience it's delivering to you. <br/><br/>Primarily, Alejandro Iñárritu's film is about the bourgeoning conflict between two men which then erupts into a tale of revenge as one goes after the other in the wake of a murder. One of these men is Hugh Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is guiding a troupe of (mostly) American fur-trappers to a fort through the barren winter wilderness of where the United States appears to meet Canada. <br/><br/>Glass, mistrusted by some of the crew as to having previously lived with the indigenous peoples of this terrain, and having previously apparently shot an allied soldier, is already grieving the death of his wife and the destruction of his village some years ago at the hands of the French Colonialists. His infant son, however, survived and now travels with him.<br/><br/>The simplicity of Glass' exercise is complicated by an ambush they suffer by a group of Native American Indians: an event which forces the trappers downstream and deeper into the hostile wilderness from which they entrust Glass can guide them. Not interested in seventy year old stereotypes, Iñárritu bothers to cut back to the Indians who reveal themselves to be searching for the kidnapped daughter of the enraged chief and are therefore allowed an extra dimension. We actually want them to find her.<br/><br/>""The Revenant"" then completely changes gears when, inexplicably, it has its protagonist attacked by a grizzly bear to the extent that it very nearly kills him. What set out as a, and certainly would have been decades ago, somewhat standard adventure story of a lost group of people evading Indians and bandits (Mexicans; the French, etc.) through untamed North America ends up as something very different. <br/><br/>Space here is limited as to the extent I want to get across just how impressed with ""The Revenant"" I really was. What struck me the most was the way the film subverted the traditional action-movie character arc in BEGINNING with its lead in the worst possible state (bloodied and beaten) before only later becoming ready for the climactic 'showdown' when they are able-bodied. <br/><br/>It is in the aftermath of the bear attack that two volunteers remain behind to care for him, as the rest of the trappers press on to the fort. One of these is Tom Hardy's John Fitzgerald - a mumbling, grizzled Texan with money problems who has his own reasons for hating Indians. Iñárritu uses a combination of techniques to disguise the eventual conflict between the two men as mere small talk amidst a platoon of men just wanting to get back to base with their scalps intact. <br/><br/>When the first 'shot' of the film rings out, it is from Glass' rifle and the film cuts quite deliberately to Hardy's character reacting to it in the far distance - their binary natures are then established when it is revealed Fitzgerald only wants to save the 'pelt' skins they have accumulated on the expedition, while Glass tries to rescue as many fellow trappers as possible following the Indian raid. <br/><br/>Later, we witness verbal conflict on-board the escape-barge and then over Glass' son's ethnicity - were it not for the captain, who has authority over both of them and has already asserted it over Fitzgerald on the barge via an exchange in profile over whether to disembark, we sense they would resort to blows. The culmination of these exchanges spill over into the second act of the film and form Glass' ultimate goal, when Fitzgerald's hatred of Indians has combined with his superiority complex to lead him to do what he does. Watching Glass' recovery; escapade and catharsis is truly something to behold. <br/><br/>Perhaps the film's most impressive characteristic is its sheer nihilism: this is not a film wherein anybody really wins (except for, maybe, the Indians) Nobody's actions brings back their deceased loved ones; the world remains an incredibly savage, existential place full of death, pain, grief and natural selection - tomorrow, as today, a pack of wild dogs will savagely bring down a buffalo in order to eat him - time continues ticking, inevitably, towards whatever the future holds for us. Everyone (those few who survive) is largely worse off for what they experience in the film. Whatever you take from the film the most, there can be little denying that ""The Revenant's"" is a powerful accomplishment."

","There is a thing that happens every year when DiCaprio's movie that is good enough to get into Oscar contention releases.
His fans are eagerly anticipating it to be more in the line of the departed(aka macho movie which celebrates masculinity) and not a j.edgar. Then the movie comes out which more or less gives them what they expect. Which is a well made movie that doesnt challenge the audience nor does it People often forget how accurate studios are with the release date they give a movie. They dont waste prime oscar release slots for oscar misfires..they allocate those slots for movies they think they can get behind and market/campaign to successful results atleast getting nominations.
So you know if a studio like fox or paramount is heavily marketing a movie then at the very least it will get bunch of oscar nominations aka the movie is worthy enough for bunch of nominations.
Then all the people inside hollywood or on the peripherals of hollywood who ever benefited from Dicaprio will root for him. In entertainment industry people are loyal to favors and not to actual talent. Its like living on a ship. You are loyal to whomever helps your stay on the ship and not the best person on the ship.Biggest currency in hollywood is doing favors.
What I often thought that proved to be wrong this year is the size of the people that owe him favor is much larger than imagined. They are in every walk of showbiz campaigners,studio exes,producers,actresses,actors,directors,anchors,music artists who are his buddies at parties etc. Who do you think margot robbie will vote for when dicaprio is one of the nominees ? he practically launched her career ..all these mask what the movie really is.
Which is , its a movie competently made by a director who wanted to take on a challenging subject and then an actor who helped get the checks to make the movie and everything about this movie is honest except the lead actor. Lead actor covers up his incompetence perfectly by trying so hard with over acting, by spending so much money to make the movie as authentically as possible and alas at then end a significant portion of audience who dont know anything about acting think of him as the greatest actor ever."

","A note to light-hearted movie goers: The Revenant is not for you.<br/><br/>Life pits it's will on Hugh Glass, the real-life tracker & fur trapper played excellently by Leonardo DiCaprio. And director Alejandro G. Iñárritu damn near tortures his cast & audience in telling the story of Glass' revenge against the people, headed by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who done him wrong. Set in the untamed West of 1823, this is one brutal epic piece of film making. The visionary result is so relentlessly raw some of the actors referred to the filming as a living hell and watching the movie, you can feel their pain.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't take long to get started and you can barely even get your bearings of what's going on before Glass and his expedition are attacked by Arikara Indians and as mayhem ensues, Glass strives to protect his half-Pawnee son, Hawk. But that is all tame in comparison for what is about to come. I am, of course, talking about the infamous fight scene where a mother grizzly (protecting her cubs) lays into Glass like a demon possessed. Make no mistake - this scene is as brutal as it comes and while you know that it's all ""film trickery"", it still doesn't stop you from believing it's real when you're actually watching it unfold.<br/><br/>The whole movie, though, and not just that scene, is a visceral punch in the gut. You could gripe about the excess carnage and lack of philosophical substance, but surviving nature is Iñárritu's subject here, and he delivers with brilliance. And then there's DiCaprio. Hidden behind a grotty beard, his words are mostly reduced to grunts, but he nonetheless provides a portrait of a man in full. It's a virtuoso performance, thrilling in its brute force and is well deserving of his Oscar nomination & win<br/><br/>The Revenant is one of those movies that justifies it's hype, award nominations and wins. Definitely a must see film."
"myhalf","9","0","0","1 February 2018"," A Visual Wonder
","This was a review I wrote back in early 2016 for a class project, so this was before Leo won his Oscar.<br/><br/>The Revenant is the movie many say is finally going to get Leonardo DiCaprio his long deserved Best Actor Oscar. Inspired by true events and directed by Academy Award winner Alejandro González Iñárritu (Birdman), this Action/Drama film has received Oscar nominations for acting, cinematography, editing and many more categories. But does it live up to all of the critical attention it's getting?
 The movie starts out with a panning shot of Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) and his son Hawk (Forest Goodluck) in a flashback in which his deceased Indian wife is encouraging him to keep fighting onward. The film then cuts to a continuous shot of Glass and some of his regiment hunting for food for their camp in unsettled territory. While they are gone, a hostile clan of Indians attacks their camp, killing around 30 of Glass's men. The survivors retreat to the river and escape on their boat, only to abandon it in an attempt to mislead the pursuing warriors. Things take a turn for the worse when Glass gets mauled by a bear and is near death. John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) echoes the sentiments of many who believe they should leave Glass behind to increase their odds of survival. But when money is offered by one of the regiment commanders to stay with Glass until he is able to move, Fitzgerald volunteers along with Bridges (Will Poulter) and Hawk. Eventually Fitzgerald gets tired of baby sitting and tries to kill Glass, but ends up killing Hawk instead. He lies to Bridges about Indians approaching and they both leave Glass for dead. Abandoned, Glass (with the help of the voice of his dead wife) picks himself up, conquers the elements and gets back to his camp. The remainder of this epic film recounts his perilous tale of survival. 
 Leonardo DiCaprio (Titanic, Inception) delivers one of the best performances of his career, playing Hugh Glass, a man whose wife was killed by soldiers during a raid. In a good eighty percent of the film Glass is mute due to a bear attack in which his vocal cords were damaged. Unable to speak, he communicates an incredible array of emotion through his facial expressions and actions. There's one scene when he is strapped to a plank of wood, still recovering from his wounds and Fitzgerald wants to kill him, but Hawk saves him. Fitzgerald then stabs Hawk and Glass is upset to the point of foaming at the mouth out of anger at Fitzgerald for killing his only son. In another scene Glass is cautiously approaching an Indian from his wife's tribe. When the Indian points his weapon at him, he immediately falls and successfully explains that he is injured and needs help using body language. DiCaprio has come a long way from the pretty boy he played in Titanic, and while this isn't my personal favorite Leonardo DiCaprio movie, his ability to convey complex emotions and communicate without dialogue definitely makes this performance Oscar worthy. I hope he finally gets it. 
 Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises, Mad Max: Fury Road) plays the antagonist in this movie, and is an extremely unlikable, selfish jerk throughout the film. He is constantly finding ways to take advantage of others for personal gain. He shows this best in one scene where he and Bridges are traveling back to the camp to get their reward for staying behind. Bridges asks Fitzgerald, at gunpoint, if he lied to him about leaving Glass because of incoming Indians and Fitzgerald says yes. Bridges isn't the bravest or the smartest of men, and is unaware that his gun isn't loaded. Fitzgerald, however, knows the gun is not loaded and wrestles it from Bridges. He points it at Bridges, telling him to stay quiet about the lie. In classic villain fashion, he says ""the Lord giveth and taketh"" and pulls the trigger. Bridges of course is OK, but has received the message loud and clear. At the end of the film Fitzgerald in his final act of cowardliness, tries to kill Glass to cover up his lies and treasonous acts. It was a hard fought battle but in the end, Fitzgerald bites the bullet, or in this case, the arrow. An excellent performance overall by this multi-talented actor who should be a contender for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.
 Alejandro González Iñárritu hired Emmanuel Lubeski for the cinematography, and it is some of the best I've ever seen. He makes some interesting choices like multiple continuous, one take shots. The best example is when DiCaprio gets attacked by the bear. The way they shot it in one take is absolutely outstanding. Just when you think they are going to cut away to another angle, they stay with the same shot throughout the entire scene, which makes it even more tense than it already is. Another technique Lubeski used a lot was close ups on the characters' faces. Probably the most intense part of the film, aside from the bear attack, is the final fight between Glass and Fitzgerald, which is mostly done in one take. The way they zoom in on the battle made me super tense from the expressions on their faces as they were dueling to the death. He also shows incredible scenery in many shots. We soak up mountains, sky, horizon, and forests thanks to Lubeski's glorious camera work. I would not be surprised if he won the Oscar for Best Cinematography; this guy know how to make scenes visually memorable. 
 The soundtrack was created by Alva Noto and Ryûichi Sakamoto, two names I have not seen before. They do a good job setting the scene by the use and lack of use of background music. In the beginning of the film when the Indians are invading Glass's camp, the music drowns out the battle sounds, setting up the somber mood of the lives being lost as Glass and his men retreat to their boat on the shore. Probably my favorite instance of where they don't have any music is the scene where the bear mauls Glass. The absence of the music make the scene extremely tense since were are forced to listen to the agonizing screams of Glass and the grunts of the bear without anything to soften or detract from those sounds. The music finally comes back in at the very end of the scene when Glass and the bear fall down the hill and the bear lands on him and both lay motionless. I will definitely keep my ears open next time I go see a film with these two as the film composers.
 Of course, movies are not perfect, and there are a few nitpicks that I have with the film. The first one is in the scene where Glass is still recovering from his bear attack and some hostile Indians find him near a stream. He gets away by swimming. He can hardly walk without collapsing, so how can he swim as fast as he did away from the Indians? The current helped a bit but there were sections of the river that were calm and the Indians were shooting him with arrows. One or two should of hit him. Another issue comes up after Glass rescues an Indian girl from a rapist and flees from the group the rapist is from. He then falls off a cliff into a tall tree while his horse falls all the way down and dies on impact. In the next shot Glass looks fine except for having a bit of difficulty walking. This makes little sense since he was critically injured earlier in the film and is still not one hundred percent back to full health. And finally, immediately after the fall, a snowstorm hits, and Glass cuts out the organs of his dead horse, goes inside for warmth (much like Luke in Star Wars Episode V) and survives the night inside the horse buck naked. I would think that would lead to a faster death by frostbite, but I'm no expert. It just left me confused and a little skeptical. These must have been the embellishments to the ""inspired by actual events"". There were some instances where an off-camera character's voice sounded a bit odd, like 2 of the same person was speaking at the same time, but that only happened a few times. Even the best of films can have a few small flaws. 
 Overall, The Revenant is one of the best movies of 2015, which says a lot coming from a year that produced films like Star Wars, Mad Max and Inside Out. The acting is great, the chemistry between the actors is believable, the cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen, and the music makes the scenes memorable. It definitely deserves a least a few awards, one for the cinematography and one for Leonardo DiCaprio for pulling off an excellent performance of a character that had to be very difficult to portray. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of DiCaprio, great camera work and intense survival films."

","'The Revenant' (noun: ""a person who has returned, supposedly from the dead"") is a film about a man left for dead, Glass (DiCaprio), and his lust for revenge keeping him alive in the wilderness. Set in the 1820s, in what was then the Wild West of Montana (but filmed mostly in Alberta, Canada), Captain Henry (Gleeson) and his men, including Glass, his son Hawk (Goodluck), Fitzgerald (Hardy) and Bridger (Poulter) are collecting pelts (I assume deer?) when attacked by Native Americans, setting them on a desperate journey back to 'civilisation'.<br/><br/>Obviously, plenty goes wrong, including Glass being attacked by a Grizzly Bear, which even though it's CGI, is an amazing/horrifying thing to watch! He survives, but is left for dead and thus begins his improbable survival tale for vengeance. There was a few things I didn't like that much, including the score (too piercing at times), the length (over two & a half hours, and it meanders for about 40min in the middle) and some of the repetitiveness (always seem to be sitting around a fire!) and unnecessary flash-backs/visions.<br/><br/>However, the cinematography is absolutely superb - hopefully more films are made in Canada after this! - and Leo is solid, with his shaggy hair and crazed stare on display. Hardy is great and completely unrecognisable as Mad Max, while Poulter provides the film's conscience. For mine, it's a better film than 'Birdman', but although it strives for it, it's still not an exceptional film. The ending leaves you, like Glass, exhausted and questioning everything."

","The movie is stunning there's no denying that. All this shooting directly in the wild paid off, it was worth the effort.

You're made to believe at first that it's a period movie, historically accurate. And I know some people will still believe it going out from this... But it's wildly fictional. First, Indian attacks wouldn't decimate a well armed expedition like this. We're made to believe that back in the day EVERYONE was a savage. Indians killed for fun, the French raped and lied, and the Americans took Indians into slavery or something, and were basically constantly at war. All of this is false. First, the French were known to be mostly peaceful traders, never really at war with the Indians, forming alliances against the English. Second, in the real story, no one died. Glass just went back to Fitz, asked him his gun back, and Fitz didn't kill anyone (Glass never had a son). It's all fiction, and all false. You don't go in icy water so often without stopping first to dry off your clothes by a fire. You don't fall from a cliff into a tree without any injury. You don't recover from a broken leg in a few weeks, or from infection with dry grass and smoke. Texas didn't have any ""ranger"" at the time. The Indians weren't wiped and devoid of every property (yet). I know it's just a movie blablabla but I fear that many people will take this as historical accuracy, thinking white men were constantly at war with Indians, raping and murdering them at any chance in return. This was not the case at all..."

","I reluctantly watched The Revenant thinking this would be a boring pioneer drama. Upon watching it in a theater, I have concluded that The Revenant is in fact a pioneer thriller and I that absolutely loved it. Shot in the Canadian wilderness but set in 19th century Missouri, fur trapper Hugh Glass tracks the man who killed his son and is out for blood. To makes matters worse, this tragedy occurred after Glass was brutally mauled by a grizzly bear. The pinnacle scene in The Revenant is assuredly the infamous bear attack. Advancements in CGI and Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of the grueling pain of being shredded to death made that scene terrifyingly impressive. The use of the non-diegetic thumping of paws on the ground and the grizzly's haunting breath made this scene a squeeze and hide your eyes type of intense scene. You could truly understand the helplessness of Glass by only hearing what he could hear. One other scene to note is the beginning battle between the Native Americans and fur traders. Since it was a continuous shot, it is amazing how director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu used passing characters across the camera to shift the focus of the scene to another. A whole 2 minutes and 35 seconds of continuous footage is a feat to remember, especially when knowing that this is a wild battle scene where characters must shout, run, and ""die"" on cue. This movie exceeded my expectations and I certainly plan on watching more of Inarritu's work in the future."

","People have a lot of mixed feelings about this movie and so do i. On one hand it is beautifully made and has absolutely amazing scenery and use of sound, but on the other hand it feels very drawn out and boring at times.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie you will never want to watch twice, the plot is easily remember-able and there is not anything interesting or deep about it, just a guy left for dead surviving the seemingly impossible and seeking revenge right after. You can call this movie visual poetry, since it is really outstanding when it comes to calm, extremely beautiful scenes of nature, also i think Leonardo Di Caprio really deserved his Oscar for this, after waiting for so many years he finally clinged his hands on it with this beautiful performance. Leo was absolutely amazing, even though the plot was bad and the film tried to attract more with its amazing scenery and poetic calming vibe than action or interesting conversations.<br/><br/>I was amazed about Tom Hardy receiving an Oscar nomination for his role here, he did an absolutely awful job trying to fake a Texan accent, he was almost inaudible and simply annoying, it was extremely hard to understand what he is saying and it made the conversations even less engaging, as if they already were not in this movie.<br/><br/>In my opinion people are giving this film too much negative reviews only because it is quite long and might seem boring for some people, i can agree it is not the most exciting or fun movie to watch, but people have to understand not every movie should be the same action packed thriller people enjoy. I can guarantee there are a bunch of people who absolutely loved it for its outstanding shots of the mountains and nature in general. Not to say it is the greatest film ever, but it certainly does not deserve the 1 out of 10 star ratings, that is just simple hate for something you do not like, some aspects of the film are amazing and that is something i can not take away from it, even though it the plot was kind of shallow."
"sddavis63","6","0","0","27 October 2017"," DiCaprio Holds Together An Over-Rated But Watchable Movie
","I was surprised to discover that ""The Revenant"" was based on a true story - then disappointed to learn that it was only very loosely based on a true story - a lot of important details in the movie (like Glass's Pawnee wife and son) are simply not true, and the real story of Hugh Glass wasn't really a revenge story. What was true was the bear attack. I was familiar with the silly story about Leonardo DiCaprio (or really Glass, his character) being ""raped"" by the bear. That was utterly ridiculous. The movie made clear that this was a female bear with cubs nearby. Why anyone would start such a story is beyond me. It was a bear attack - a pretty vicious one that was very well portrayed. And, as I said, it's really the primary connection to the real story of Hugh Glass.<br/><br/>Set in 1823, the movie starts strongly, with a depiction of an Indian attack on a group of American fur traders. That's very well choreographed. In fact, overall - including the depiction of the bear attack and the choreography of the Indian attack - the strongest part of the movie is probably the work of director Alejandro Inarritu. His work was excellent. All throughout the movie you see great camera work, excellent photography and spectacular scenery. All that is so good - and, in fact, it's almost too much. It seems to take over the movie at times. That's probably because the story as a whole didn't exactly enthrall me. The movie is set up as a revenge story, with Glass hunting down Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) - who had killed his half Pawnee son. As I said, that's fake, and really the movie doesn't emphasize the revenge element. This is really a survival story - and there are times when you wonder how Glass survived. How did he survive the wounds from the bear attack? How did he survive the raging river and waterfall? Why didn't he freeze to death once he got out of the river, soaking wet in the middle of winter with snow on the ground? How did he survive the plunge over the cliff? He's almost superhuman - the survival scenes are too unbelievable to make Glass a character you can really empathize with. There are also more than a few cringe worthy moments. There is that gruesome bear attack. There's Glass cauterizing his own wounds. There's Glass gutting the horse so he can crawl in to stay warm. Yeah. I was wincing a few times. But those are scattered throughout the story, and for long periods there's not much to fall back on but the scenery and photography. It's beautiful, yes, but some of it could probably have been taken out for the sake of making a tighter and more focused movie.<br/><br/>Having said that, the story did grow on me as it went along and came closer to the climactic confrontation between Glass and Fitzgerald. I admit my attention wandered a few times, but I was never tempted to just step away from this. DiCaprio offered a basically one man show for extended periods, and was all right doing that. I've probably seen actors pull it off better than he did (Tom Hanks in Cast Away, James Franco in 127 Hours, maybe even Robert Redford in All Is Lost all come to mind) but DiCaprio was pretty good in holding it all together. And I did like the ending. The final scenes in which Glass finally confronts Fitzgerald were very well done. It wasn't true, but it was well done. Interestingly, I also found a pretty consistent spiritual theme running through the movie - which I wasn't actually expecting.<br/><br/>I think this is a bit over-rated, but it was worth watching.

","THE REVENANT: Done in Alberta. I believe the Indian guide was a Shaman sent to help heal Glass enough to avenge his son's death. He was a cat that used up nine lives A point glossed over was his forgiveness of the boy who had to endure being with the nemesis. That showed a character of wisdom. We got to see how the young frightened lad was lied to and had to follow the bad guy, but there was a scene where the boy gave food to the female Indian hiding in her village after a massacre.<br/><br/>The symbol of the bear attack, so vicious, connects with another of his realities of defending his own son.<br/><br/>The movie also followed tradition in that Natives live their wisdom and stories and ancestor spirituality, as an important part of their ways.<br/><br/>Glass had nine lives, super human for sure. First there was early Indian village massacre where his boy was 9 or so, where he lost his Indian wife. Then massacre of his men in opening scene of movie, then escaped and bear attack. Then desertion by his men, confusion of teams, almost killed by nemesis, witnessed murder of son and betrayal, thrown into pit with dirt, crawled to son. Then hardships to survive winter - escaped Indians going down rapids. Met Shaman in deep winter with 3 open fires and a buffalo carcass. <br/><br/>Friendship and Shaman built a shelter for Glass to heal. Glass woke up and discovered Shaman murdered (didn't really think this had to be a plot). Glass stole horse, saved Indian daughter that the tribe is looking for and attacking white tribes for that reason. Glass fell over cliff with horsecut horse, oh my god. Found his way back to the village of his men. <br/><br/>Epic battle, he let the enemy down the river 'in God's hands' to the Indians.

This guy could survive a meteor hit - which he in a way resembles, traveling huge distances in a perfect curve, unstoppable by ground objects.<br/><br/>This film is not even as beautifully shot as some people make it out to be. Instead of being the saving quality of the film the pictures are uneconomic, unconcentrated, boringly bleak and always almost held at elbow's, even at kneecap's height, which made me feel like a toad.<br/><br/>The only truly memorable thing, in my opinion, is the acting of Tom Hardy.

This scene conveys his feeling that he would nit like to admit his son died to me deeply from his frustrated expression. From this scene, the man's hatred feeling becomes bigger, so it is very important turning point in this movie.

","While The Revenant masks it's purpose with the realism of the great wilderness, the movie goer ""take away"" is not as assuming. ""Castaway"" is another survival movie framing the human spirit in itself, not staked to the ground in preconceptions. Quite simply, revenge is a strong motivator, as are the ghosts of our past that take us down our personal wells of failure. The experience of the film is the star, as is Tom Hardy's ""Fitzgerald"" a survivor furrier in soldiers outfit, but separated from honor and morality. His survival leaves him with clear decisions, while honor clouds the others. Leo DiCaprios' Hugh Glass is the understated hero, with a history of no-aggression, but the gumption to survive the unthinkable twice to then go on the mission best served cold, or in the directors case, freezing! It's a true dilemma and understandable on another level that, thankfully, you or I will never have to experience. Much like ""saving Private Ryan"", we start with a gruesome battle of the times before settling in on the great expanse of the powers that be. Where is honor in fighting someone else war on their terms. How does dignity prevail in war? War is a fight without dignity but war movies are in need of a morality that justifies our entertainment. That's one hell of a dilemma for the audience that I've yet to come to grips with, which is why the script calls for Leo to lose the rifle prior to the final battle. That's when the director lost me...."

","Left for dead by his companions after being mauled by a bear, an 1820s fur trapper traverses tough terrain to avenge the murder of his son in this epic scale drama starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy. Lasting several minutes, the bear attack is very graphic and between the brooding score (co-written by the masterful Ryuichi Sakamoto) and Emmanuel Lubezki's mobile cinematography, 'The Revenant' is often appropriately moody and atmospheric. There is, however, little escaping how relatively simple the plot it is, and as DiCaprio predictably comes across mounting obstacles while trying to locate Hardy, the movie soon turns repetitive. The fact that it takes him the better part of two hours to locate Hardy lessens the tension; his quest is dragged out for so long that his bloodlust fades into the background. More scenes establishing the bond between DiCaprio and his son may have helped, but the film might have also simply been more potent at half the length (twice the intensity). Certainly the contrast between the lush yet hostile landscapes and the hatred at hand renders the film interesting and with thoughtfully accentuated audio effects and the aforementioned virtues, this is a hard film not to recommend. It does take an incredible amount of patience to get through, however, and awesome as the ending may well be, the journey to get there often feels overly protracted."
"jrarichards","6","0","0","13 March 2017"," What for?
","Yet another (3-) Academy Award-winning effort not really seeming to deserve all the praise, and certainly not worth all the fuss.<br/><br/>There are repeated examples of arrogance and disdain for the audience on display here from the inexplicably-Oscar-winning Director Alejandro Inarritu, as well as co-writer Mark L. Smith, and that begins with the decision to adopt straight the title Michael Punke chose for his 2002 novel. No, a ""revenant"" is not somebody seeking revenge, but is a kind of an unkillable zombie figure, returned but no longer really alive, which presumably fits rather well with the behaviour of our (real-life-historical-figure) hero Hugh Class (1783-1833), as played by an Oscar-winning Leonardo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>If there is a message to this film it is that life in the 1820s wilderness of North America was incredibly rough and tough...<br/><br/>There, I've said it, and it took me one sentence. In the film, the makers devote the best part of two and a half hours to hammering this well-known message home to us, in the process allowing Leo to rasp, groan, moan, gasp, whine and creak at least a thousand times. Other cast members have it far from easy also, but most matter little here compared with the star.<br/><br/>Intriguingly, though, when Glass first enters a river in spate formed by melting snow and ice he for once does not gasp at all...<br/><br/>I write ""wilderness of North America"", because it is several hours before we finally hear that our story takes place somewhere near the Yellowstone River, and that narrows things down to North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana. It finishes at Fort Kiowa which is in turn in South Dakota.<br/><br/>I only know it is the 1820s because I read it online, while the makers do not bother to tell us this, nor do they bother with much scene-setting, for example to explain why somebody not obviously in uniform is referred to as ""Captain"" and appears to be in a position to give military-style orders. There are French-speakers and Brits out there, but we're not sure how or why. All are fur-trappers, and in fact Wikipedia tells us readily enough that Glass was part of General Ashley's Rocky Mountain Fur Company expedition of 1823, which was indeed attacked by Arikara/Ree people native to North Dakota by that time close to extinction. The sad truth is that this genuine story seems far more interesting than the film, which does indeed push Glass's real-life survival so far that it regularly looks implausible, even though it did actually happen.<br/><br/>Art refusing to imitate life, as it were...<br/><br/>The makers' determination to press home the ""incredibly tough"" conditions referred to above is so strong that they refuse to let the sun shine for about 95% of the film, with all being white or dull grey, or in the twilight/dark or in blizzards. This is not possible in real life (and all the more so when snow at times seems to be melting), but since there are various dark and deceitful deeds afoot from the human cast (to say nothing of dangerous animals), we must watch a dowdy film that is heavy on the eye, despite being set in places that - for all their dangers and discomforts - are rightly known for their incredible beauty. Emmanuel Lubezki got a cinematography Oscar for his work here, and there ARE some fine shots of rivers flowing as and where they want to, but I can get those on a nature film (in which, as a bonus, the sun is allowed to shine from time to time).<br/><br/>On the (futher) minus side, ""The Revenant"" features a number of moments of - rather incomprehensible and not properly pursued - Native American spiritual elements. Then there are bison herds on the move with wolves waiting to pick off the weak and various more-or-less intriguing mountain-men ""survival tips""; but a great many of these (indeed far more) could be enjoyed (in the truest sense of that word) in, for example, ""Dances with Wolves"" a film with very serious themes (from 1863) and plenty of awfully negative behaviour on display, but one which did not fear depicting beauty ... and sunshine, and did have its story to tell. The same could really be said of ""True Grit"" - one heck of a story probably set in the 1840s, and even ""The Searchers"" (again hugely strong on plot and acting) - which depicted events from 1868.<br/><br/>Perhaps (Presumably?) those behind ""The Revenant"" would regard the above films as examples of hopelessly old-fashioned and clichéd beginning-middle-end storytelling, unlike their own piece, which pretty much jumps into existence out of the void with its large-scale Indian attack, and then proceeds with a ""survival and revenge"" plot against a background that has scarcely been set up at all, and with characters that we must perforce ""catch up with"" having never been introduced...<br/><br/>While I would certainly not dismiss my time spent with ""The Revenant"" as wasted, and cannot therefore suggest to anyone that they not give it a try, I do go away from it with a sense of being far, far less enlightened or elevated (let alone entertained) than I ought to have been, especially in the case of a film that the Academy clearly adored!"

Towards the end of the film, Glass returns triumphantly to the camp.<br/><br/>Then the unthinkable script failure occurs.. what were the writers thinking?

How can you ruin a film this epic so easily? the moment I saw those 2 riding out of the camp I almost turned it off as the rest of the story was then 100% predictable.

The fact that the main ""love"" story is a father's love for his son, resonates with me as a parent, so I get it. Some say that this does not have much dialogue but it actually does have quite a bit. Some is in English, some Pawnee with subtitles, and a tiny bit is French with subtitles. Where there is not talking, it is not needed. The acting was FANTASTIC as well. I went in thinking it may be a bit artsy and long but did not expect what happened...I was very engaged the whole time.

","So Leo finally won an Oscar. Most of his performance in this was a lot of grunting, screaming, groaning, more grunting. He kind of chews on a live fish a bit, that must've been the winning scene now that's commitment for a role. Tom Hardy is his usual annoying self, am I alone in not liking him much. Must be from that movie he did Charlie Bronson where he had his wang flopping around for half the movie, totally not needed at all. Revenant. Good movie I liked it, well shot, good locales, lots of violence always a plus. Shot with all natural light which is really interesting. Hmmm not very realistic. Ever heard of frostbite and hypothermia, getting wet in snow is very very bad especially out in the open, and with some bad wounds. Watching it half way through I realized Leo's character actually murders 2 frenchmen and steals a horse. It's a hanging time, he's a murderous criminal horse thief so I lost all sympathy for the character and wanted him to get what he deserved alas did not happen. Leo channels Rambo and Han Solo by jumping off a cliff into a tree and using a horse as a tauntaun, chuckle."

","The Revenant was a film I was very curious about, I love Leonardo DiCaprio and AGI has proved himself to be one of the most ambitious directors working today and after seeing it I really liked this movie I didn't quite love it but I have to admire its ambitiousness. What they were able to accomplish with this film technically is Incredible, while there aren't a whole lot of action sequences in this movie when there is, it is absolutely stunning this film contains some of the most realistic violence I've ever seen with its incredible long, uncut takes and realistic make up and excellent performances from the extras all come together to put the viewer right in their and make them feel the danger of the situation. In the lead up to this movie its was highly anticipated that DiCaprio was finally going to win his Oscar for this film and he did, he was great in this movie, not only did he commit himself physically to this part he was also perfect at conveying the pain and suffering that his character was feeling. However to my surprise I actually thought Tom Hardy was better in this film, Hardy completely digs himself into this roles to create such a despicable character but one that is understandably so, you get his experiences in life and understand his hateful attitude and ruthlessness and it's easily one of Hardys greatest performances. The Revenant contains some of the greatest cinematography I've ever seen this film looks incredible, the snowy landscapes look incredible you feel the cold and the misery of these environments and it's all due to the extremes The the filmmakers went to, in order to make this film look as realistic as it does. However this films greatest shortcoming is its repetitiveness and melodrama. The sequences where DiCaprios character blacks out and has hallucinations and flashbacks just feel odd and unnecessary, they don't really add anything to the hatred of the character. This film does have A tendency to rely on a formula that becomes blatant really quickly, Glass crawls around for a little while, feels a lot of pain, finds himself in a bad situation, fixes that situation conveniently, we get a wide shot pointing up towards the sky. This pretty much happens for the entirety of the second act and actually started to bore me at times. <br/><br/>The Revenant is a very good film its incredibly ambitious, everything technically is incredible, the performances are fantastic, it's extremely atmospheric, it does have some issues with its story but I honestly think that any film fan should watch this movie at some point. <br/><br/>80%/A-"

","This film is about a fur trapping party gone wrong after being attacked by Native Americans and their guide being mauled by a bear, double crossed by a comrade and left for dead. The acting in this film is top level by design. Even Tom Hardy gives a great performance. I usually can not stand Tom Hardy, thanks to some of his previous works like Mad Max Fury Road and TDKR, but he is exceptional in here. Leo does a remarkable job but that is nothing new. The basic story and limited dialogue work well and matched the encompassing project. However the over-stylized environment killed the cinematography. The director had no discipline when playing around with camera filters and throwing in background CGI when editing landscape shots. It simply cheapens the film. My second complaint is terrible and inconsistent make-up. I'll have to blame the director again because he wasn't able to see that all of the actors, especially in the first half on the film look too damn clean. Just putting dust in someone's hair and smearing oil on their face isn't going to do it when it comes to a Hollywood level production. The little stuff matters. Final score 7/10, this film was saved by the actors in-spite of the director's laziness and/or blundering."

I assume it was meant to add drama but ultimately, I am not sure what it achieved other than disturbing people for the sake of it. The story line was not original and the dreams Glass has did not change anything and fell short of adding an additional dimension to the plot/character.

The result is a film that leaves one feeling empty and sad about the Western push of our nation's history.<br/><br/>Set in 1823, the film tells the story of a group of American trappers who come under attack by a small band of the Arikara tribe. After suffering heavy casualties, the survivors escape, led by their guide, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio). In turn, Glass is betrayed when, after being critically wounded by a bear, the men who have sworn to protect him, kill his son and leave him exposed to the elements.<br/><br/>At this point, the film turns into a survival and revenge story. There is little dialogue during this lengthy stretch of the film with the emphasis placed on the magnificent landscape and panoramic vistas. The strength of the film is in the cinematography.<br/><br/>Arguably, DiCaprio's performance succeeded through assistance with the make-up and hairstyle specialists. He speaks very little dialogue, and the character's sotto voce speaking was a set of whispers, due his throat wound in the encounter with the bear. DiCaprio's Academic Award should be divided among the designers, who, in effect, created his character.<br/><br/>A stunning film visually, ""The Revanant"" never fulfills its potential as a historical drama or even an insightful character study.

","Spoilers Galore, consider yourself warned! When I saw Birdman, also written and directed by Inarritu, I thought it was great. It was a stylish and interesting movie experience. However, I was left feeling something was missing, which prevented it from entering ""favorite"" status, but I couldn't put my finger on what it was. After seeing the Revenant, I realized what Inarritu lacks. His direction, while skillful, is cold. Emotion, which in Birdman isn't needed to carry the script, is missing here and it hurts the story.<br/><br/>First, the movie could have been edited down by a half to a full hour. The scenery is beautiful but does every shot need to linger so long? The story is about revenge and survival. However, I found the whole script to be dull and lacking. The conversations are bland and if not for Inarritu's skill as a director, the movie would be unwatchable, unbearable even.<br/><br/>Hugh Glass, DiCaprio, is the main character and the guide to a fur trapping expedition. His Native American wife was murdered years before and he was left alone to care for their son. His son, now a teenager, is on the fur expedition with him. The expedition is lead by Captain Henry, Gleeson, and the villain John, Hardy, is also a member of the party. John opposes almost all of Glass's decisions at every turn.<br/><br/>When we meet the expedition, they are quickly descended upon by a group of Native Americans. The scene is brutal but well directed The struggle to survive is well captured but the scene goes on a bit long. We later learn the Native Americans are looking for the Chief's daughter, Powaqa, who has been kidnapped. My issue is the Native Americans just start shooting with no questions asked at all ""English"" men because the French, who actually have the girl, told them that's who took her. They aren't even worried that she might be accidentally killed in the fray. I get it, Inarritu wants this world to be as merciless as possible but sometimes it went beyond reason. <br/><br/>Some of the members of the expedition manage to survive the attack. Glass comes up with a new path to avoid another attack and return to their fort. But, Glass is viciously attacked by a bear in one of the most skillfully directed scenes possibly ever. Glass 's condition is dire but he clings to life. As they continue on their difficult return course, it becomes apparent they won't be able to carry the injured Glass up the mountain. At first, the leader, Captain Henry, debates putting Glass out of his misery. In an unforgiving land, Capt. Henry is more sentimental and takes a more noble path and offers money to those willing to stay with Glass until he passes. John, Bridger - a nice young man - and Glass's son, Hawk, stay.<br/><br/>John has always felt that they should euthanize Glass. So, when the two young men are gone, he offers Glass a mercy death. Glass eventually agrees. Hawk comes upon John while he is doing the deed and freaks out. In the scuffle, John kills Hawk as Glass lays helpless watching. You already dislike John but there really isn't enough character development for you to feel completely devastated by Hawk's death.... and that's a major problem in a revenge story. Plus, it took an hour to get to this point - an hour to establish the setup and it still lacked the necessary emotional punch. By the time any chance of revenge comes, you feel just as worn out as Glass and it doesn't really matter any more - which in some ways was the point of the movie even if it failed to fully realize that..<br/><br/>Moving on. John makes it back to the fort with Bridger who is ignorant to everything. And, for the next hour or more, we watch Glass miraculously survive through some impossible situations like falling off a cliff. Glass meets another man whose family has also been killed but he decided to leave revenge in God's hands. Finally, Glass is found by the those at the Fort. At this point, you're not sure who has been more tortured, Glass or you, the viewer.<br/><br/>When they return, John has taken all of the money from the safe, we don't know how he managed this, and ran off. Here comes some unbelievable aspects, Glass and Henry decide to go after John alone. Two men, that's it? This is to setup 2 aspects of the forced ending: 1) Glass can pretend to be dead on the horse for a cool scene. 2) Glass can let go of his revenge. Except, after a lengthy savage duel, Glass has his chance to fulfill his revenge but his companion's words echo in his head to leave it to God. So, he does by letting him drift down the river... which would be a good ending if that left John with Glass's fate – injured and lost in the wilderness with nothing but it's not. Glass had previously saved Powaqa and those same Native Americans are coincidentally 60 feet down river. John floats to them and they kill him. Is that really leaving it to God's hands? Or letting someone else do the dirty deed as you watch? How about more simply, Captain Henry gathers a group of men to catch John, he has to abandon his belongings including the money to run away. As they risk more perils, Glass sees the futility and talks Capt. Henry into standing down, to leave it to God.<br/><br/>Other notes, Hardy is a good actor but here he sounded like he had a huge wad of cotton stuck in his mouth . Inarritu deserved the best directing Oscar despite how bad the movie was. Lastly, there a bunch of dream sequences that involved Glass's wife that I felt added little to the story. DiCaprio's Oscar is well deserved."

","""The Revenant"" is a movie that did so much correctly. Thanks to the superb work of director Alejandro Inarritu and the cast and crew, the movie is full of flawless cinematography, sound editing, acting, directing, and visuals. The characters are not interchangeable and all of their motivations make sense. By all accounts, this should be a great movie. There is, however, something weighing it down.<br/><br/>After being mauled by a bear, frontier man Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is left under the care of three others while the rest of his team makes it back to their fort. One member of the team, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) kills Glass' son, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), and leaves Glass for dead, fleeing back to the fort. Hellbent on revenge, Glass travels across the dangerous wilderness back towards the fort to find Fitzgerald.<br/><br/>Glass' motivation for wanting revenge makes sense: Fitzgerald killed his son and left him for dead, though Glass seems to not care as much about the being left for dead part. The problem is that the entire situation just makes you ambivalent to Glass' struggle. Fitzgerald only killed Hawk after he was making noise and Fitzgerald couldn't get him to quiet down. He was also in the middle of dangerous territory and bringing the wounded Glass along was most likely suicide. He is clearly a bad person, but based on the circumstances, his clear life picture, and the time period that the movie takes place in, it can be viewed as less evil and more of survival instinct. <br/><br/>As you can make these defenses to Fitzgerald, when Glass goes after him, your only reason to actually care is because Glass is the protagonist. I personally found myself not caring if Glass got his revenge or not. Since the lust for revenge is what pilots the movie, it ends up feeling long and boring because you can't connect with any of the characters.<br/><br/>""The Revenant"" has a lot of flawless qualities to it. Getting you to care about the story is not one of them."
"bluelandshark","10","3","8","17 January 2016"," The Revenant: A Master Class in Film
","After having seen The Revenant, I can truly say it is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. Every element of this movie is handled expertly, with people who have a genuine love for their craft. Alejandro González Iñárritu has once again outdone himself, as he did with his excellent Birdman from last year. Of the movies that came out in 2015, only The Revenant and Mad Max: Fury Road truly blew my mind. <br/><br/>The Revenant has some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever laid eyes on. While most movies feature quick-cut editing and shaky cam in their action scenes, The Revenant blew my mind with single-take action scenes with fantastic choreography. Honestly, there are some huge action scenes in this movie with almost no cuts at all. It was truly breathtaking to see a film where the filmmakers just let you watch it, without having to squint and lean forward in your chair just to understand what is happening on screen. In The Revenant, you just stare in awe and soak in the things happening on screen.<br/><br/>Now, let's talk about the acting. Leonardo Dicaprio has proved time and time again that he is one of the greatest actors working today. This may have been his best performance yet. It's a much different performance from The Departed, The Wolf Of Wall Street, and many others. Dicaprio's performance in The Revenant is almost entirely physical. From the incredible stunt work to the insane method acting used to get into character, this was the point where I didn't see Leonardo Dicaprio, the pretty boy. I saw Hugh Glass in this movie. When an actor does such a good job that you no longer see the character they are portraying as that actor, that actor should be commended. In fact, all of the acting in this movie is superb. Tom Hardy gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from him, selling every word out of his mouth. Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson are also very compelling, the former giving the best performance of his career. <br/><br/>When I left the theatre, I was shaking. The atmosphere in The Revenant is so present and strong that I was shivering in my seat, and for the next half hour after the movie ended. Now, this movie doesn't have much to say about society or anything like that. It isn't some profound metaphor. It's a film about both the beauty and horror of nature. Every scene in the film feels gritty and real. The Revenant is the first movie I have gone to in a very long time that I can call an experience."

","Some of the best cinema of the year, but it goes on for too long and starts crumbling by the end. It's a simple revenge flick mixed with a survivalist tale. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as a frontiersman with a half Indian son who has been hired to guide a group of trappers. After suffering an attack by Indians, DiCaprio is mauled by a bear. Unable to travel further, two men, Tom Hardy and Will Poulter, along with DiCaprio's son, stay behind to care for him until he dies, as they assume he will. Hardy doesn't really feel like it, though, so at the first opportunity he murders the son, tells Poulter (who didn't witness the murder) that the Indians are nearby, and buries DiCaprio in a shallow grave, still alive. DiCaprio eventually digs his way out and goes after Hardy to get his sweet, sweet revenge. The film is at its best when its in its you-are-there, in-the-actors'-faces phase, making you feel like part of the action. Its at its worst when it goes into flashbacks and DiCaprio's highly symbolic dreams. The final act is pretty silly, too. Domhnall Gleeson, who has really earned a vacation at this point, also co-stars."

","The Revenant is one of the most anticipated movies for me of 2015. From the first to the last trailer that was released i got more and more excited to see Leonardo back on the big screen. A lot of my excitement came from the fact that this movie looked ambitious and unique and i think Hollywood needs to take more risks like this film as. <br/><br/>I'm just going to start by saying this is one of the most intense, riveting, and breathtaking movies I have ever seen. I can't think of a movie that made me sit at the edge of my seat as much as this one. From the beginning you are submersed into this brutal world that doesn't let you sit back and relax. This movie is man vs nature at its finest. Yes, it is a revenge tale, and yes people do die, but the environment that these people live in never gives them a break and no time to let their guard down. It's cold, it's harsh, and it's dangerous. The costumes and makeup are incredible. I was constantly cringing, while i looked at Leonardos characters wounds. They sure made all the characters in this film rough looking, and as they should for this time period. <br/><br/>Some of the most incredible things about this film, is by far the cinematography and the sound design/mixing. Visually this movie is a masterpiece. I say this because i've never seen a movie with this style of filming. It's unique and refreshing to watch, especially because their is not a lot of innovation when it comes to unique style in cinematography. The sweeping, continuous shots that go on and on are a Emmanuel Lubezkis trademark and they work beautifully. The absence of music for a lot of the movie and the sound of the falling snow, or the wind rustling the trees, or water flowing down the river is absolutely beautiful. For some of the scenes, even if you close your eyes and listen, you get the sense of where this film takes place. <br/><br/>This movie is one the greats, yes the bear looked a little weird, and it was a little long, but when you sit back a think about what these film makers have accomplished, it is truly amazing. They pulled me into this world didn't let me out until the final credits starting rolling. I got up, took a deep breath and said ""wow."" It's refreshing to watch a movie that takes risks and when it pays off it turns out to a movie to remember. I'll be looking out for this movie at the Oscars.<br/><br/>Pros: -Beautiful cinematography -Amazing sound design -Simple yet compelling story -Man vs Nature -Strong Cast -Setting <br/><br/>Cons: -Could tell the bear was CGI -A little long<br/><br/>Rating: 9.3 out of 10"
"jadepietro","8","3","8","9 January 2016"," Shattered Glass
","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is recommended. <br/><br/>In brief: Some action scenes do impress, but the filmgoing experience becomes more arduous than needed. <br/><br/>GRADE: B<br/><br/>Vengeance is a sweet and powerful impulse that keeps our protagonist alive in Alejandro G. Iñárritu's sprawling Western saga, The Revenant. Based on a true account of frontiersman Hugh Glass (a superb Leonardo DiCaprio), the film shows his violent journey homeward. Faced with natural obstacles, man-made treachery, Native American hostilities, and a horrifying bear attack, our pioneer fights for his life every moment on his trek through the wilderness. Left for dead by members in his hunting party, his grueling endurance test becomes one for the moviegoer as well as we face hardship after hardship in bloody realistic fashion.<br/><br/>￼The onslaught may not make for comfortable viewing, but the artistry and virtuoso filmmaking on display is exhilarating to behold, even if the screenplay by the director and Mark L. Smith is one long series of strung together perils with not much in the way of strong character development (other than Glass himself), memorable dialog, or detailed plotting. The story itself is a typical survival tale, rote and predictable, with more than a touch of Terrance Mallick's inspiration and spiritualism thrown in with some cloying (but lovely) ethereal dreamscapes and hallucinations marring the action. Also, the film takes some liberties with the historical facts, especially in the fictional climax of the film.<br/><br/>But the artistry by the director, actors, and behind-the-scenes crew is remarkable in their achievements and dedication. Iñárritu is a visionary director, setting up the many action sequences and positioning his actors to get the maximum effect from his unique point of view. (The actual making of this film must have been demanding with his on-location filming in the mountainous regions of Canada.) Shot under frigid conditions, the film has an authenticity that makes the movie all the more riveting with images that truly astound and leave one gaping at its brutality and beauty. The film is a visceral experience but it never touches the mind or heart. It is technically astute and emotionally aloof. (One false note, literally: The dissonant music by Ryuichi Sakamoto, Alva Noto, and Bryce Dessner, which has a mysterious and haunting quality, tends to telegraph the ominous approaching danger the minute any chord is sounded.)<br/><br/>Still, one cannot gush enough about the glorious panoramic wintry vistas and fluid camera-work of the gifted Emmanuel Lubezki. His wide angle shots and striking close-ups are exceptional as is the brilliant editing by Steven Mirrione. The movie-going audience is placed directly in the line of fire as arrows fly, bullets whiz by, and blood flows. Whenever the action starts, we are swept away into its powerful spell.<br/><br/>￼Mr. DiCaprio gives a consummate performance as Glass. The role is subtly portrayed, mostly silent and intrinsic in its character, as this man battles his way suffering one misfortune after another. The misery shows in the actor's facial expressions and stance most effectively. This physically demanding role should send many awards his way as compensation. Providing strong support are Tom Hardy as his rival, Fitzgerald, and Domhnall Gleeson as his dutiful friend. <br/><br/>￼While not for those who have a low tolerance of pain and violence, The Revenant is must-see viewing for any serious film-goer for its technical expertise and the fully committed performance by Mr. Dicaprio. The awe and wander is there, just not the necessary wonder. <br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

"tjgoalie13","9","3","8","8 January 2016"," A Non-Traditional Western
","The Revenant isn't like most westerns that have very straightforward moral dilemmas and are fun tones, it is dark, and it is complicated. The Revenant is a movie with a lot of backstories that makes, it even more impressive than it already is, and it is impressive. The Revenant is brilliantly acted, features beautiful cinematography all the while showing deep narrative heft. The film is poised to receive major awards attention, and rightfully so.<br/><br/>The first piece of back story surrounding this film is fairly well known, and that is that Leonardo DiCaprio is still fighting for his first Oscar. After seeing this film, it seems safe to say that his performance is Oscar worthy. DiCaprio carries the movie as long stretches of the film feature DiCaprio alone, acting in an isolated surrounding, which is even harder to do. DiCaprio often balances soft-hearted empathy and stone-cold revenge within small stretches, and every emotion is well accentuated. While the focus is on DiCaprio, because he's the cornerstone of the film, Tom Hardy and Domhall Gleeson are also brilliant in this film as well.<br/><br/>Another piece of back story that may not be as well known is that Director Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu and Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki decided to shoot the entire film with nothing but natural light. To go a little deeper, considering exposure and reciprocity this gave the filmmakers only a few hours to shoot per day in order to get a good exposure. Even more impressive is that the film is stunningly gorgeous, and by that I mean that the film looks professionally lit, despite the use of no lighting. This is Lubezki's third consecutive cinematography masterpiece, and he'll probably end up winning his third consecutive Oscar for cinematography.<br/><br/>The other impressive aspect of the film is the story. Most westerns tell straightforward stories, with simple characters (good guy vs. bad guy), that's not bad it's just easier to follow. The Revenant mixes traditional western conventions such as the use sweeping panoramic vistas, and the typical setting, but has far more complicated and deeper characters. All of the characters in this film are relatable because their motivations are easy to follow, just not always pleasant. The end result of the realistic character development is that the story is far more realistic and thus thought provoking.<br/><br/>In conclusion, The Revenant is brilliantly acted, and may be the film to finally get Leonardo DiCaprio his much awaited Oscar win. The film is beautifully shot and will, more than likely, win the Best Cinematography Oscar. The story is uncompromising, and graphic when it needs to be. For those who love artistic films, this is right up your alley, and for those who love westerns, you'll probably enjoy it too."
"britneystellini-35468","8","3","8","8 January 2016"," An experience of human bravery and cowardice to see before our eyes.
","The Revenant is not a common movie which you can watch for amusement. It has a deeper idea, a very reflective intention, than being a movie itself.<br/><br/>Honestly, with the amazing visuals which bring this movie to life, made me question myself our very existence. This is so, due to the indirect importance of human-beings in harmony but also in chaos ( this is a paradox) with the astonishing wilderness. <br/><br/>Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy vanish into the flesh and blood of Hugh Glass and John Fitgerald respectively, two rivals which develop their hatred throughout the movie. <br/><br/>No need to say this because you may already have seen this in the trailer; stupendous sound effects, make-up and picture.<br/><br/>The main plot points are survival and vengeance due to human ignorance and selfishness which lead to betrayal and take the downward spiral to death. It is more of a survival-themed movie because most of the running time you see Hugh Glass cling for his life. Vengeance is only emphasized here and there , and it is conquered at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Life; death, beauty; sorrow, self-indulgence; selflessness ... This movie, in a deep way is full of contradictory terms which make you think. The Revenant movie is like a metaphor - two unlike terms compared with each other - we see this every second in the movie : nature ; which is beautiful and is full of life but it is cruel/harsh and it can cause death."

","Inarritu, award-winning director for ""Birdman"" has returned this year to direct another masterpiece. The Revenant could easily return to win awards for best motion picture of the year, best achievement in directing, and best achievement in cinematography. Hardy performed exceptionally well as the villainous Fitzgerald but Dicaprio stole the screen as the protagonist Hugh Glass. Dicaprio deserves to win this year for best performance by an actor in a leading role. <br/><br/>The Revenant, inspired by true events, is about fur trapper Hugh glass and his passion to live when all is lost. After being brutally attacked, betrayed, and left for dead, Glass has two motives: survival and revenge. <br/><br/>The Revenant is gripping throughout the whole two and a half hour runtime and will leave you breathless by the time you leave the theater.

"aceofspades96","7","3","8","5 January 2016"," Eye Candy, but Still Meh...
","Right off of the bat, I'd like to say that the film has some of the absolute BEST cinematography I've ever seen. I don't know how the producers managed to get so many long-shots in there. There are literally shots that will last 5 minutes without cutting in between. This is especially true at the beginning. If anything, this film should definitely receive tons of praise for its cinematography alone. Hand-in-hand with the cinematography are the visual effects. Next to the Martian, this film has some of the best visual effects that I've seen this year. This is especially true with the bear mauling scene. The bear literally looks real, and the manage to generate drool coming from its mouth and landing on Leo's forehead, however, the bear was never there in the first place. The effects looked gorgeous, and I really enjoyed seeing them on the big screen. <br/><br/>However, despite the great visual effects, and the stellar cinematography, the film just wasn't up to my expectations. When I saw that this film had 4 golden globe awards including best acting, I truly expected to see a breath taking performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, but I was greatly disappointed. Sure he did great job of acting like he was in pain, and acting like he couldn't talk, however, this is nothing that we haven't seen before. Even in low- budget films, we see acting of a similar caliber where people are suffering for their roles. There simply just wasn't enough lines for Leo to peak our interests or to really steal the show. Leo spends most of his time on screen grunting, screaming, and breathing super heavily. I'm sure that any other trained Hollywood actor could pull this off too; his performance was very bland.<br/><br/>The other actors seemed very one-dimensional. There were some great actors in this cast: Tom Hardy, Leo DiCaprio, Domhnall Gleeson, however, I feel like the director spent most of his time on capturing the environment rather than the actors of the film. Throughout the film, I feel like the acting was done in one take. From the beginning with the dispute between Glass and Fitzgerald, to the scene with Fitzgerald and Glass' son. The performances given just seemed so rushed, and I know for a fact the actors can do better. <br/><br/>The director for whatever odd reason liked to put slow-motion in areas that didn't need slow-motion. This is really shown in transitions back into the wild. The running time is 156 minutes, and could have been trimmed down to 140 minutes by getting rid of all of the unnecessary slow-motion. Minute after minute, we see nothing but trees. Trees and the moon. This really doesn't do anything for the audience but remind us that we are in the cold weather. Which was kind of implied anyways.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was visually appealing, but the acting was not great. The talent in this movie was very much skimped for the excellent cinematography and effects. The film was fun to watch, but nothing ground-breaking, and unfortunately for his fans, I don't see Leo getting his Oscar from this film."
"lediscipledessocrates","7","3","8","4 January 2016"," Punitive Retribution
","The Revenant is a story of survival and retribution . If we take out these thematic elements from the movie it still is a visual stunner . The cinematography is spectacular , given the nature and conditions of the climate in which the movie is shot. In fact weather is one of the main protagonists in the this thriller . <br/><br/>Another very important aspect of the movie is the raw depiction of violence. It is in line with the raw depiction of the natural elements. The bear-mauling scene is one of the most detailed animal assault scenes shot in movie history ( If we leave out the homo sapiens species).<br/><br/>Where the movie falters a little is in fully exploring characterisation . This becomes obvious because the director himself tries to add depth to the characters but then somehow fails follow through and ends up giving fairly transparent black and white characters. This stands in stark contrast to the general plot which is rich with ethical grey shades and a fairly complex situational setting.<br/><br/>However , as an action movie the film is superb and unabashedly dishes out hard hitting sequences of combat, gun fights, fist fights, accidents and human suffering , so much so that one starts cringing every time Leonardo comes on screen. <br/><br/>Despite the excellent action , the movie was a little too indirect and needlessly philosophical with an unclear chain of flashbacks haunting Leonardo throughout the movie. What was the purpose of those flashbacks apart from the obvious reliving memories , I seriously don't know. But these pseudo-philosophical digressions derailed the movie partly and it lost pace and precision. Westerns , to be thoroughly entertaining need to have at least nominal theatricality . Otherwise what's the point of watching a Western !!! Watch it once for sure , and then decide if you would like watching it once more. I may, if it is telecast in the future on TV , but not entirely . I will be skipping forward some scenes ."

","I must say it's refreshing to watch Alejandro González Iñarritu's style in an otherwise uncomplicated plot. The Revenant's story is simple, yet scenery, acting and overall pace of the movie is amazing. You feel lost and panicked when the group is under attack, distressed when attacked by the bear (AMAZING scene by the way) and hopeless but you can relate with Glass' motivation for vengeance. This movie immerses you in the story and keeps your attention. It's a great tale of survival and instinct, it achieves a very high level of realism with each take. It features long take scenes which are being mastered by Mexico's golden directors like Iñarritu and Cuarón, which always seem so fluent but must be so incredibly difficult to achieve. Kudos!"

The movie is directed by 'Birdman' director Alejandro Inarritu who is known for magnificent direction. Leonardo was masterpiece as always and has not let down in this too. The story centers on Hugh Glass, a frontiersman who was left alone after bear attack and killed his son. Leo takes revenge to new style with its own survival style. This can be expected from Leo to be perfect in every condition and can do anything to draw into character. Leo's performance was outstanding and this time I hope Oscar gets to Leo.

"altersaege","7","6","22","23 December 2015"," Don't mess with Di Caprio!
","I have read guys talking high of how incredible Hardy is in this film. How many nuances in his acting, and bla bla bla bla bla. One guy dared to say that Hardy was generally speaking a much better actor than Di Caprio, and that this was the worst performance in Di Caprio's history. That's delusional!!! They both are very good actors and I find it pointless to make a diatribe about who is better. They have eventually different acting styles: Di Caprio is more refined, Hardy is more instinctive. But in THIS film, Di Caprio rules, without any possible doubt. He goes deeper and is much more intense, while Hardy is a bit over the top, playing the rude guy with western accent and rigid movements. And I do not know what film hat watched that other reviewer, but I do not see many nuances in Hardy's acting and face here. While Di Caprio delivers a wide spectrum of many different emotions which can be very easily read in every little movement of is face, while performing the whole time at max power and top intensity.<br/><br/>Now the film itself, it's an imposing film. I do not believe it is a ""masterpiece"". But it is a good movie and kept me interested from beginning to end. Anyway the synopsis is kind of misleading. It made me believe that the WHOLE movie was about Di Caprio persecuting ""those"" who left him for dead, but there is no ""those"" and you see it immediately (so, no spoiler), there is just Hardy. And the real persecution is a very short part of the movie, it is quite predictable, and not so intense as I expected.<br/><br/>EDIT: Di Caprio 1, Hardy 0. Sometimes the Oscars speak the truth. I told you!"
"sushant0406","6","4","13","23 December 2015"," Alejandoro González Iñárritu's The Revenant is a breathtaking visual spectacle.
","Story<br/><br/>The Revenant is a simple revenge drama. It is inspired by the book, of the same name, written by Michael Punk, which was inspired by the life of Hugh Glass, a fur trapper who is motivated not by revenge, as depicted in this movie, but, simply by a desire to get his furs back.<br/><br/>But, revenge makes for a more engaging movie, or so the team that created this movie must have thought. <br/><br/>Acting<br/><br/>Let's first address the most important reason why this movie has been on the watchlist of the majority of the people, including me, an admirer of Leonardo DiCaprio. This is supposed to be the film that finally gets him the elusive and his first Academy Award. Like most of his movies, Leo does deliver an intense performance. Looking at it as an ""individual performance"" it is clearly visible that he has given it his all and put in a lot of effort, like he always does. His performance is mainly physical, as he mouths only a few dialogues, most of which are in a tribal language. Eats raw bison liver and sleeps inside an animal carcass. Such acts, require determination, not acting skills. If any other actor was to play this role, then even he would have done so. Taking all this into account, I feel that this performance is behind many of his previous and more Oscar-deserving roles. The main reason behind this is that, when you compare it to those previous ones, it becomes abundantly clear, that this performance is like a collage of some of his previous ones. From an acting point of view, he has never experimented a lot and his always restricted himself to a particular kind of serious roles, which he has undoubtedly excelled at. But , he has hardly ever done anything innovative. Unfortunately, he does the same, in this movie too and this year with other brilliant performances in the mix, Leo's performance, doesn't seem like a front-runner, who deserves to win, now.<br/><br/>The star for me was, Tom Hardy, as Glass'comrade, John Fitzgerald, who leaves him for dead, kills his half-Indian son, and robs him of his furs. He is the most gifted actor of his generation and he puts his acting skills on display, yet again.He perfects his western accent. He beautifully expresses his character's varying feelings, from the bottled frustration of staying back to look after a nearly-dead Glass; to the shock and pain of realizing when he accidentally kills Glass' son; to the feeling of paranoia of being caught for his deeds; Hardy carries himself with authority and dominates which ever scene he is in. It is unfortunate, that he is not getting as much praise as Leo, when he truly deserves more.<br/><br/>Cinematography & Background Score<br/><br/>A third consecutive Oscar nomination for cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki— who films in such exotic areas as Chile's Tierra del Fuego and also parts of Alberta, British Columbia and Montana, seems imminent. He also deserves to win it.It is one of the 2 reasons, that raises the level of the movie and makes it a must watch on the big screen. Those beautiful mountains and gleaming rivers in the sunlight, on the big screen, will be an experience worth remembering. <br/><br/>The background score had a raw and tribal feel to it. The most invigorating score, since The Last of the Mohicans, that is sure to pump up the adrenaline during the battle scenes and give us chills during the more tragic and sensitive scenes.<br/><br/>Direction<br/><br/>Alejandoro González Iñárritu is the Picasso of modern cinema. He is a creative genius. Each and every single frame was like a beautifully and patiently drawn painting. If, Birdman (2014) was him using the camera in such a subtle way that the entire movie appeared to be like one large painting; The Revenant too is extremely realistic, although, compared to Birdman, it is much more violent and raw, which was to be expected, because of the several scenes that involved battle and bloodshed. It requires a special kind of genius to portray even such scenes, that would normally be gory, as precisely made brush strokes on a canvas. His direction complemented the cinematography, perfectly. It turned The Revenant from a 156- minute long slow period revenge drama into a visual spectacle to be experienced and remembered for the rest of our lives. <br/><br/>If this movie deserves an Oscar, it is only for the Best Director. <br/><br/>Mr. Iñárritu is the rarest of the rare breed of talented individuals. He is man of great vision and aesthetics, as can be seen not only by The Revenant and Birdman, but, also by the movies that he directed prior to these. His talent is to be cherished. We can expect even greater things from him in the future.<br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>The Revenant is Alejandoro González Iñárritu's most brutally realistic movie till date. The way that he has captured the actor's performances and the beautiful landscapes, will propel The Revenant to break to great heights in the history of Hollywood. It is his direction, that puts the performances by the lead pair and every other technical element in the film, on a higher pedestal for everyone to see and admire.<br/><br/>Kudos to him and the entire team, for shooting in such trying conditions and presenting us with an experience of a lifetime."

His ability and follow- up to Birdman does not disappoint. The amazing shots of every scene, every breath of Glass, every fight, struggle, survival on set makes him one of the greatest of all time. Definitely after this I'm going to watch more of his work. <br/><br/>DiCaprio DiCaprio DiCaprio... where to begin? He has definitely proved once and for all who runs this. The pain that he reflects, the scene with the bear the screaming, the scars and hope to make it another day, horse scene where he sleeps on his carcass to the fight scenes and eating real bison liver he really committed to this performance. He wasn't playing Glass - HE WAS GLASS. There is not enough words from the training and prepare of mastering guns, western lifestyle, the look to the accent and rawness of his character he topped Wolf of Wall Street and that was some of his best work congrats man hats off to you.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy's performance wasn't unnoticed. He showed us one more ti how well he can manage to play a supporting character and that he's good at it unfortunately Leo's performance I think it shadowed him but there's a great possibility he'll grab an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>Will Poulter's performance as a scary trying to be honest but coward was just another point to making the film complete. <br/><br/>I waited for this film almost 2 years to come out and see it ever since it was announced.

Leonardo, who doesn't speak much threw out the movie, depicts Hugh Glass's pain and suffering with the skill of a true thespian grand master.

I understand there have been performances that have won for not really saying a word, however, there presence was more abundant than Leo's. **Spoiler**After he is attacked, he is almost non existent.

Aside from the bear attack and the ending of the film nothing else happens except a betrayal, left for dead, then OMG he's alive :-O, and a scene of Native Americans trying to kill him, but it was literally one scene of that. The cinematography, I will say, was really good. Maybe its trailer suggested that there was to be more going on. But honestly there wasn't. <br/><br/>It really doesn't deserve Best Picture. Personally Mad Max or the Martian were better movies."
"bankofmarquis","8","3","9","13 January 2016"," Strongly directed with a bravura lead acting performance
","Just give Leonardo DiCaprio the Oscar now. That is how good he is in this film. The surprise for me was how good everything else was.<br/><br/>I went to see THE REVENANT under the impression that it was a brutal, tough movie with a tour-de-force performance by Leo as a Mountain Man who seeks revenge after being left for dead following a Grizzly Bear attack...and I would be right...it had all that (the Grizzly Bear attack is pretty, well, grisly). But it has so much more going for it.<br/><br/>If you recall, Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu won the Oscar last year for BIRDMAN, a picture that was a ""stunt"", in that he shot it to appear that it took place in one long take - a stunt that ultimately fell short for me. The good news here is that he tries the stunt, in smaller doses, in this film and succeeds mostly. The opening scene is a Native American attack on a group of Fur Trappers and is shot as one long take that gives the feeling of chaos and uncertainty that this sort of surprise attack would give. He also uses the long take technique in the Bear attack, to show the isolation and the feeling of ""no way out"" and, finally, he used it very well in the climactic fight scene to show the visceral nature of the Mountain Men who's main instinct is to just survive.<br/><br/>There is sparse dialogue in this film and it that works well. These ""Mountain Men"" are used to being alone in the wilderness, so this sparseness of speech is apropro. The actors, then, need to use expressions, gestures and posture to convey what is going on inside their heads - and they do so. None more than DiCaprio who (literally) has to claw his way out of the wilderness to survive and gives the type of Award winning performance through action and expression that is necessary for this film to succeed without going ""over the top"".<br/><br/>Tom Hardy, yet again, is a formidable antagonist. Domhall Gleeson continues to build on his resume with an impressive performance as the Captain who just might be in over his head. The 4th main protagonist in this film is a young Jim Bridger, played with strong naivete by Will Poulter, who gets better every time I see him.<br/><br/>Is this a great film? I don't think so. I think it is a very good film. Innarritu has long stretches of ""pretty pictures"" that look STUNNING on the screen but doesn't add much to the story, so the 2 hour, 36 minute running time seems a bit bloated and there is a sub- plot about an aging Native American searching for his daughter that I saw how it would dovetail into main narrative a mile away.<br/><br/>But these are quibbles in a very strong movie with strong direction and an exceptional leading turn.<br/><br/>8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"
"crusader-96051","9","3","9","11 January 2016"," It was so good I'll just complain about essentially nothing.
","The Revenant was without a doubt a completely fleshed out ride from start to finish. It was one seemingly hopeless trial after another for Glass and the viewer had to helplessly sit and watch, hoping and praying that nothing else would go wrong(though something always did). In my opinion the camera work set a very specific and fitting tone, giving the feeling of being more of an onlooker who was right there with the characters, rather than the choppy editing styles that seem to be becoming more popular these days. The viewer was treated to continuous shots that didn't feel too long or drawn out, and did exactly what they were supposed to do. By the end of the film you absolutely abhorred Fitzgerald which is a massive credit to the performance of Tom Hardy, felt real sympathy for Bridges and just wanted Glass to get out alive! There was so much good in this movie, I think it may be more interesting to point out some of the few things that I have minor issues with. Firstly, in the (absolutely fantastic) sequence with the bear. This scene was magnificent, the bear looked wonderful and DiCaprio really did look like he was being mauled by a wild animal. The only thing that bothered me was that after the bear believed it had killed Glass, it stood on his head. There is no reason for the bear to take any of its full body weight off of Glass's head. I'm not an expert but I imagine that 270Kg (googled average grizzly weight) is more than enough to crush anyone's skull. Secondly, and finally, there is a scene where Glass is facing the camera and his breath fogs up the lens before he passes out. While this led to a nice transition into another shot, it did not really follow any kid of previous or upcoming interactions with the 4th wall. Again, this is literally all I can ""complain"" about. Perhaps some movie goers may find the pacing a bit hard to deal with if they aren't able to be engrossed by the story like a lot of people seemingly were. Honestly If I had to pick out the one thing that surprised me the most in the entire movie though, through all the insane things that transpired throughout Glass's journey, it was something very small towards the end. When Glass swings his hatchet at Fitzgerald and just barely clips some of his fingers off in the final fight, it made me reel more than any of the other violence throughout the film. I believe this is because it seemed so believable and comparatively mundane against the other instances of combat. Overall The Revenant was a beautiful, bumpy ride. personally I don't need to see it again, and that's not a bad thing. I feel like I have gone through this ordeal with Glass and do not intend to be put through it again. It was filled with gorgeous scenery, amazing performances from the entire cast (great work by Will Poulter, hope he keeps it up), and a captivating story, I would absolutely recommend this film to anyone who can take it."

Although,it is easy to believe you can kill a bear w/ one bullet,& several knife wounds(I read somewhere that Alaskan Kodiak bears can reach 8' tall standing);I never imagined a film would show a person almost getting killed from the dead carcass he killed landing on top of him,after collapsing & falling down a ravine(?).Despite all the long beard, I instantly recognized him as Leo diCaprio,but could not figure out who the villain was underneath all that makeup hair & the southern, pre -civil war speech vernacular(it was that same guy who plays those British gangsters,Tom Hardy!).THere were so many pithy, aphorisms he said(will have to return & see film a 2nd time to write them all down), I thought that Inarritu had hired Ralph Peters as a dialogue coach!(CAIN AT GETTYSBURG@2012); I also thought this is a very good film,in the model of many Hollywood westerns about ""Lewis & Clark Expedition"" type adventures about explorers tracking the western Frontier & confronting bloodthirsty indians,etc.,in showing the types of wardrobe that John Richardson & Glass wore,the typical long bore weapons, the type of diet,(it looked like diCaprio caught a live fish & bit into it?,i dunno,it sure looked like it!); Also, this is described as a revenge movie,so I impute that to mean,diCaprio is trying to find the ones(Hardy) that done him wrong. All in all,I rate this a 10 out of 10,the Bear should get an honorary Oscar for all the shaking he did of diCaprio's body, I thought he was going to eat him alive,but then the bear seemed to just walk on top of him to lick his face....?<br/><br/>More civil war aphorisms(an aphorism is a concise way of describing a depressing truth?)>> '.that sounds like pissing in the whiskey jug'=(a used car salesman, or a tin horn politician speaking out of the side of his mouth,or similar 2-faced obtuse person)>>' a blessed person who hides behind a curse.....=not quite sure what this aphorism in the book meant)>> I would think that 10 minutes being devoured by a bear would easily substitute for 3 horrific days in the summer of 1863 (battle of Gettysburg); I cannot believe I live in the same country as where the battle of Gettysburg was fought,it makes me feel very insignificant,like diCaprio walking through the frozen tundra of this wonderful movie...>>"

Looking at the end result of that stunt the director completely lost me as viewer. All the gravity the heavy story had; became an absurdity, which is an incredible shame. That single scene should have been edited out, which would have saved the story, because everything what happened afterwards became an irritating show-off of special effects (like The Hobbit trilogy) and no longer the gritty film what it was.<br/><br/>The special effects are indeed amazing and you are very often left wondering how they have pulled that off; especially the bear scene.

It is too bad he got too cocky here, because Gravity and Birdman were both beautiful masterpieces. The Revenant in its current form is definitely not a masterpiece unfortunately.

If you are seeking a movie true to facts, but may not be as visually stimulating then watch ""Man In The Wilderness"". It's pretty much that simple.

"nofavoritZ","9","2","5","13 March 2016"," Intense, beautiful, gripping
","The Revenant has a gripping story, gorgeous cinematography, fascinating depictions of time and place, and a spiritual dimension I appreciated and associate with the director. What I liked most: <br/><br/>* the story arc -- lots of involving and suspenseful scenes within a larger story that is part survival drama part revenge tale. <br/><br/>* the ""grit and grim"" -- did you ever see a movie about someone in a harsh time and place, and find yourself working to overlook an actor's coiffed hair or capped teeth? Or a cottage room, for example, that just seems a bit too picturesque? This ain't a problem here. The harshness of this world, which includes lots of grizzled men surviving in the freezing wilderness, is unrelenting. <br/><br/>* the spiritual dimension -- nature is ""red in tooth and claw"" but Inarritu gives time to its majesty too. That is to say, the God in this movie is pretty fearsome but is also there in the wind and trees and mountain vistas. (Note the film's main bad guy at one point quotes his father describing God as a squirrel he shot and ate. Maybe the ultimate sin is not recognizing the beauty and awesomeness of the world as it was given to us?) The humans in the movie do all sorts of terrible things to each other and to animals, but the fur trapper Glass (Decaprio) also embodies extraordinary human strength in the face of adversity. His strength comes from his loved ones -- namely the whisperings in the wind of his wife, her spirit and her philosophies, as well as his love for his son. There is a beautiful scene in which Glass dreams of his beloved son, hugs him within the ruins of a missionary church, some of its frescoes still intact. In keeping with the balance of beauty/goodness and ugliness/violence/death, the frescoes depict Spanish colonial soldiers torturing indigenous peoples.<br/><br/>* the ""equal time"": I'm old and grew up watching traditional cowboy and Indian movies. So I appreciate this film's care in creating complex characters and motivations on all sides, even the ""Rees"" (Arikara tribe)] when they attack Glass and his fellow trappers at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>Those were my favorite elements but there is lots more to appreciate, especially the fine acting. If you can handle very intense movies, by all means see this one. And if you haven't, I also recommend Biutiful by Inarritu."

"dgranger","6","2","5","21 February 2016"," Emotional, good performances, and effective but over long, self indulgent, and frankly, a bit boring.
","The title of this review sums it up almost perfectly. The film does have major strengths but also has major weaknesses. While intense at certain points, it gets as vague as hell in others which kills the narrative drive and tension of the film. Also, another problem with this is my age as in the I have lived long enough to have seen and remember films of similar stories and themes. With ""The Revenant"", I had felt like I was watching a variation of a theme that I had seen before. That is bad for a film because it jerks the viewer out of his enjoyment of the film. Every film should make you feel that you are seeing something new and unique even if it isn't. With me, I had thought I was watching a variation of ""The Naked Prey (1965). While the Naked Prey film was set in Africa, the historical event that it is based on, Colter's Run, happened in North America, in Yellowstone park, just like The Revenant. And both Colter and Glass were guides and experienced mountain men. The stories were too similar. And it didn't help that I had just finished reading a novel that had mentioned Colter's Run shortly before seeing this movie. Bad timing on that. As far as acting goes, I was not particularly empressed by Dicaprio's performance and felt it was the weakest of the major players of the film. I thought Will Poulter's was the best and stole the show. Gleason and former child star, Lukas Haas, gave strong performances. Hardy was good, but frankly, there was points where I couldn't understand what the hell he was saying because the accent he had used was so thick and he had mumbled some of his lines. But in the end, the strength of the story and the directing did pull me in and I did feel emotion at what was happening on screen which a good film should do. So therefore, I say this film has both good points and weaknesses. I will say that if you are looking for a fast action packed film, this not the film for you since this film takes it's time (aka, ""slow""), and builds towards it's ending that doesn't really pay out."

The brutal story has the same spirit of another snowy Western that depicts the fight for surviving, Sydney Pollack and Robert Redford's ""Jeremiah Johnson"", but with some very realistic scenes that probably could not be made in the 70's. The spectator feels suffocated.

","The direction of this movie is stunning. The movie starts with an attack that is the most exciting since Last of the Mohicans. One is really placed in the thick of things with the expert cinematography and direction. The bear attack is unbearably terrifying. <br/><br/>Story: There is more to the story than just making it home after being mauled and left for dead. It has a significant Native American aspect. Politically correct in handling the Native American portrayals for a 21st century movie, the villains, murderers of women and children and rapists are mostly the French soldiers and trappers and the main bad guy is named Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). The only thing I didn't like about the story is why only 2 of them went out to look for Fitzgerald. Also the fight scene at the end was just overkill. Made it end in a formula Western way when it should have been above than that.<br/><br/>Acting: Acting is generally good. Leonardo is convincing in his pain hunger and suffering in the snow and freezing water. Give him an Oscar just for the physical hardship alone. The mainly British supporting cast is good too. Will Poulter is good as the kind of dimwit. The main problem with the casting is that some of them look alike. Better to have had some with different colored hair and no beard for some. The Captain and Fitzgerald look a bit alike. Tom Hardy as the villain mumbles. Couldn't understand most of what he said. Unnecessary to have such a thick accent when the others were speaking more or less normally. <br/><br/>A gut wrenching and exciting film."
"ralph_2ndedition","10","2","5","30 January 2016"," DiCaprio's tour de force
","Revenant *rev–uh-nuh nt*<br/><br/>noun<br/><br/>a person who returns. a person who returns as a spirit after death; ghost.<br/><br/>There is a lot that can be said for the unfairness in Leonardo DiCaprio never receiving an Oscar, despite his tremendous performances in quite a number of movies. I have a sneaking suspicion that some people still think of him as the pretty-boy from Titanic and The Beach, and that is really a shame. Because DiCaprio is one of the hardest working actors today (he averages just over one film per year, ever since his breakthrough in What's Eating Gilbert Grape in 1993, and has as of today 36 projects listed as ""in development"" on IMDb 36!). And not only that – he is one of the best actors out there, the man seem able to play almost anything, and after seeing him in The Revenant, I have come to the conclusion that Leonardo DiCaprio will from now on be able to make me buy a movie ticket based on his involvement alone.<br/><br/>The Revenant tells the (inspired by true events) story of Hugh Glass, an explorer leading a small team of surviving fur trappers through the vicious winter wilderness that is 1820's America, after they have been attacked – and most of them killed – by native Americans. On a scout tour in the forest, Glass finds himself standing between two grizzly bear cubs and their mother, and he is brutally attacked<br/><br/>I will say no more, even though there is a LOT more that could be said, you will have to (and I encourage you to) see for yourself!<br/><br/>Let's get a few things out straight away. This IS DiCaprios film, he plays Glass and it is his story we get to follow. The pain, misery, fear, frustration and anger are all very palpable for me as the viewer. I can see it in DiCaprios face and I can hear it in his voice – what little he has left of it, after the bear tore out his throat. He embodies all the emotions to such a degree that I actually felt the freezing cold water and the snow, sitting there in the theater – dressed in my thick sweater. The camera is right there, in his face His dirty, banged up, tired and determined face. This is a film about survival, about determination and about not succumbing to any sort of fate. It is also about revenge – but that is very much a secondary point. -This is DiCaprios tour de force, and there should be no hesitation about that.<br/><br/>That being said, I would not be surprised if Tom Hardys performance as John Fitzgerald is mentioned in as equal high regard. Hardy has always been a fascinating actor, who seem able to play everything from the leading man in romantic comedies (This Means War, 2012) to super villains in superhero-movies (The Dark Knight Rises, 2012). But what he does best though is play lunatics The kind of trouble stirring lunatics that stand on the wall, screaming, banging their chest and rally everybody to get the revolution going! But if you look in their face, you can see that all they really want is chaos, violence and disorder. Tom Hardy is fantastic in this film, relishing in playing a character that you instinctively hate, already from the start! -It's in the eyes<br/><br/>The Revenant moves seamlessly between intimate (and sometimes painful) closeups, to sweeping landscape shots, showcasing not so much the beauty as the isolation and the relentlessness of nature, interspersed with Glass' dream like hallucinations of his wife and child. The movie is shot using real light (as in no stage lights) and it has a very gritty and real feel to it – a style not unknown to director Alejandro González Iñárritu, who's breakthrough was the fantastic Amores Perros (2000). Making my way through the movie, after the fact, I find it hard to imagine anyone else, other than Alejandro, directing it – and certainly no one else other than DiCaprio starring in it<br/><br/>-Make no mistake about it, this movie is a MUST SEE!<br/><br/>One last thing, because the scene where Glass is attacked by the grizzly bear absolutely needs to be mentioned! I have seen a ridiculous amount of movies where characters are attacked by large animals/creatures. Everything from acid spitting aliens, dinosaurs and toxic waste enhanced spiders to lions, tigers and bears – oh my. But the bear attack in The Revenant is the most horrific, panic filled and – for lack of a better word – REAL I have ever seen! I cannot remember blinking, or even breathing at all during that scene! When you go see this movie (and you REALLY should), it will grab you from the get go, and you will have forgotten all about the bear attack – until it happens, and then you will wish you could forget it.but you never will!"

A few films have faltered, such as ""J. Edgar"" and Ridley Scott's ""Body of Lies,"" but eight of his last 13 movies have topped $100 million at the Stateside box office. Leonardo can do it all when it comes to acting. He has once again out done his self with this new movie. He is rightfully due many awards this season.

"xcisics","9","2","5","25 January 2016"," A modern definition of the Epic genre
","The initial scene of The Revenant sets the tone of the following film perfectly. The almost unbelievable natural beauty of the Canadian landscape is harshly juxtaposed against the cruel artificiality of the historical rifles which slowly move into the shot. Iñárritu perhaps intended to represent the brutal tainting of Native American time during the Frontier period. DiCaprio corroborated this concept whilst accepting his Golden Globe win - briefly discussing the world's indigenous peoples and calling on people to protect the environment from man-made interests.<br/><br/>One major disappointment was the title of the movie being perhaps the biggest spoiler of all. Anyone with a dictionary or an extensive vocabulary can, after about 20 minutes into the movie, make a likely correct prediction about the ending of the movie. <br/><br/>In terms of the cast, Tom Hardy further demonstrates his immense versatility when it comes to characters - his portrayal of Fitzgerald differs massively from his performance in 2011 Cold War Drama Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Despite this, one minor downfall I personally noticed was that it was, for myself, at some points very difficult to understand some of Hardy's voice. However, the muttering accent of Hardy's character arguably assists in the development of Hardy's character, Fitzgerald. Leo DiCaprio gave an stellar performance, his impressive prowess as an actor was proved by his ability to demonstrate emotion despite his lack of dialogue (due to his character being solitary for the majority of the storyline). This is perhaps best demonstrated in an early scene, in which Tom Hardy's character is murdering Hawk (DiCaprio's character's son) in front of a bed ridden DiCaprio. DiCaprio represents immense emotion despite the fact that he is essentially paralysed as a result of the bear attack. <br/><br/>Overall, The Revenant is a stunning film, with visuals and a storyline clearly furnishing it's categorisation in the Epic genre. The movie furnishes a crucial visual representation of an environmental issue of ever-increasing importance, perhaps safeguarding The Revenant's position as a modern Frontier-film classic."

","I am not sure why they portray it as a revenge saga.Revenge is definitely a part, a big part of it.But to call it a story of revenge only is like calling a sea just a pool of brackish water.There are so many interwoven philosophies, that when the revenge does take place, you are already taken away to a mystic world, world where vengeance means little, embarking on a journey which teaches you how to survive the worst, life has offered you and yet come up with a spirit to endure more, to invite more and to sustain till the last breath of life becomes everything.Since my teenage, I have always rooted for Leo to win an Oscar every time he gets a nomination since 'What's eating Gilbert Grape'.And every time, as Leo returned empty handed, my heart went down as if it was the last time.But he came back with a bang every time.And continued winning 4 more nominations.And continued returning bare handed.But this time, while I watched the masterpiece saga' The Revenant', something deep inside started saying' Yes, it's the time'.In every frame, in every moment, it makes you feel, this was just made for him to win an Oscar.Because what Leo delivered here, is something you can not look beyond in any acting dictionary to better.What a visual treat Alejandro González Iñárritu has given you in this epic tale of survival!Every frame becomes etched in your mind as if you are living in the world construed by him.When I had watched this movie, it was yet to win 12 Academy nominations.But I was certain that it was a sure entry for the cinematography.The mountains, the river, the water, the blood, the snow, the ridges- everything so vividly portrayed.Tom Hardy did an exceptional job as the villain.It must have been an extreme difficult job for an actor of his stature to portray second fiddle.But there lies his finesse.The background score is fabulous, too.Overall a movie you hardly affor to miss.Fantastic -'The Revenant'."

"Icedooitle","8","2","5","17 January 2016"," Dakota Legend
","Watching ""Birdman"" for the third time, I viewed it just to appreciate the cinematography. On first viewing I only wanted to immerse myself in what was promised to be a groundbreaking and highly enjoyable trip to the theater; it was, in no small measure. When you spend the entirety of the film looking for a ""cut,"" you aren't absorbing, you are monitoring. Knowing that Inarritu was using the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubeszki again for ""The Revenant,"" it was a chore not to measure cut lengths, camera movement, and blocking. This was not a distraction, just an affirmation that I would need to see this film again, and again simply for appreciation.<br/><br/>The broad-strokes of this film's plot are centered in truth. Hugh Glass was a figure of legend in South Dakota where I was raised. His story wasn't introduced along with John Henry or Wild Bill Hickok; his was reserved for older students, so that gruesome details and exaggerations could be employed without censorship. I heard of ""The Toughest Man in History."" The basic story is widely known, Hugh Glass was a frontiersman in the early 19th century who fell victim to a vicious grizzly bear mauling. With cold weather setting in, the members of his hunting party were not keen on hefting a near-corpse 200 miles to their fort-base. Consensus was that he would not recover and he was left with 2 volunteers to see him through to a dignified passing. These volunteers waited in vain for his last stubborn breath, and left him half-buried in the wilderness. The facts of his survival and journey after the matter have been molded by time into something formulaic and unabashedly compelling. If this film takes liberties with the truth, how far off can they be?<br/><br/>This story doesn't build to a finale so much as sustain a continued agony that is bearable to the viewer through character perseverance and beautiful filmmaker craft. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't demand pity for his situation, he doesn't relent in his drive long enough to evoke sympathetic emotions. From the first mechanically shot battle sequence, we are spectators to this man, and we don't want to leave him. The world that Glass resides in is beyond hostile, and there is very little reason why we should want him to survive so badly, but that feeling is sustained throughout. Revenge becomes a murky motivation until it needs a boost. Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald gives us plenty of reason to see Glass through to the end and exact it.<br/><br/>Fitzgerald is the soulless volunteer who callously leaves Hugh for dead and sees the world as carrying a debt that is owed to him. The pacing of Glass's survival juxtaposed to Fitzgerald's damnable existence back at base, fuel the audiences involvement in exquisite balance. Anytime you wonder ""What is Glass even fighting for anymore?"" Hardy steals a scene that demands retribution. Aside from Fitzgerald and the terrain, the local Native American Pawnee tribe are a continued threat, always fast on Glass's heals. As overwhelming as this may seem, there is never a moment where it doesn't feel authentic.<br/><br/>Due to the sustained tension throughout this movie, the climax doesn't pack the punch we are accustomed to. There is an unnecessary use of Dues Ex Machina in the final moments that doesn't hurt the plot, but makes it feel needlessly formulaic. Long-takes blended in with seamless choreography of action make this a prime candidate for Best Picture and Cinematography. Leo's performance is second to none this year. And it should be noted that if Inarritu pulls off an Oscar for directing, it will be the third consecutive Mexican won award, his second in a row. This is a great year for film, and whatever the cast and crew of The Revenant walk away with in February, I begrudge them nothing."

","I just got out of this movie. It was an experience, so I can give it that. But also it is pretty much a grittier version of the frontier cliché, sights, battles, cowboys and indians, rapes.<br/><br/>The more I read and really find out about the frontier the less I think we know about it, and our movies don't really help us here.<br/><br/>I am surprised that people rate this movie so highly. I think it has to be Leonardo Di Caprio because for some reason people seem to like him as a box office star. I like Di Caprio precisely because I don't really care about him or think he is that great, so that is what I want to see in an actor ... someone who is not that Hollywoodish.<br/><br/>Leo and the cast did a great job. The think I had a problem with was that I could only hear about 10% of the dialog, which improved the movie because you follow what is going on more with your gut than with your mind.<br/><br/>The white men were rotten, the Indians were rotten and noble. The land is the real beauty of this movie, our planet is just spectacular and we ought to pay a lot more attention to it than to just throw it in to make our crappy movies look better.<br/><br/>The problem was that as I said, the characters were one-dimensional, they moved through the movie like the fake disembodied movie characters they were. The special effects were fantastic. I cannot imagine how they did some of the animal scenes. I am pretty sure the bear was CGI, but it looked and acted real, and should probably be the only thing that gets an Oscar in the movie, but Star War will win for that.<br/><br/>Loved the movie, there was just not that much to it, and it had no real lasting impact or point. Bottom line it is a loss and revenge picture which puts it in the class with all the action movies that get made in a year, except that it is a beautiful Western."

","The Revenant is a really good achievement in cinema that I enjoyed. Don't think the 6 is meant to be as a diss, I just reserve the higher numbers for rewatchable films. It is a straight-forward story of revenge in which Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is after John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). I feel like the way this movie was pitched was what all can we do to Leo to finally get him an Oscar. I mean his character goes through so many setbacks on his quest for revenge which is very entertaining to watch if at sometimes pushing the unbelievable mark. WARNING - This is a very, very brutal film with lots of blood, intense and violent images. I cannot use the word intense enough to describe the film.<br/><br/>THE MAJOR PLAYERS (5 Best):<br/><br/>Director - Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Best 3 Credits - 21 Grams, Babel, and Birdman)<br/><br/>Cinematographer - Emmanuel Lubeski (Best 3 Credits - Gravity, Children of Men, and Sleepy Hollow)<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio - The Departed, Django Unchained, and Inception<br/><br/>Tom Hardy - Bronson, The Dark Knight Rises, and Legend<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson - Ex Machina, About Time, and True Grit<br/><br/>HONORABLE MENTION - After his horrible acting in Maze Runner, Will Poulter totally redeemed himself. His dramatic acting in this movie gives me hope. I new he had good comedic timing in We're the Millers. I totally believed his inner turmoil in this movie.<br/><br/>MVP - Sorry Leo but Tom Hardy deserves an Oscar for his performance. So brutal and unforgiving. He must be a real A-Hole in real life cause he was perfect at playing a horrible character with no redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>THE VERDICT - I would recommend seeing the film in Theaters but I don't think I will see the film again.<br/><br/>If you liked the film The Grey, you will like this movie."
"adrongardner","6","2","5","8 January 2016"," ""it's real but it's not interesting""
","You will hear a lot about how difficult the filmmaking process (though it was not shot on film, but digital) was in The Revenant. You will hear a lot about the length the actors, director and crew went to make things real. But to quote Jack Nicholson quote Stanley Kubrick:<br/><br/>""Jack, it's real but it's not interesting.""<br/><br/>There's a lot of good work from every member of the cast and crew of the show here. I commend them all on their fine work. But I did not identify with anybody except Arthur Redcloud's Hikuc, and even then, his appearance is all too brief. This movie would be easier to review if there was more wrong with it, but I cannot offer some academic or faux intellectual retort. My personal criticism is just that, personal. And my personal opinion was I simply did not feel invested in any of the characters in the movie or what they went through. <br/><br/>Instead of a journey, surviving to the predictable end feels like a slog. And when it was all over. I really didn't feel anything for anybody. Maybe it's just me. I'll accept that.<br/><br/>Iñnaritu is a master of despair, but he isn't a dramatist and Revenant hasn't advanced his craft.<br/><br/>If you are interested in films about the trials of survival or snowy mindscapes, try ""Touching the Void."" The tonally similar, and far more contrived, ""The Gray"" is another one I would rather watch. I just found myself far more invested in watching Liam Neeson face off with a wolf than Leo sleep in a horse carcass."
"clanciai","7","4","14","28 December 2015"," 2½ hours of self torture - for what?
","There is nothing wrong with the film. The acting is perfectly natural all the way, so natural, that you can't understand what almost anyone is saying for their mumbling in their shaggy beards, especially the main crook (Tom Hardy), who isn't credible in his unmotivated evil, and of course everything goes constantly wrong. They do everything they shouldn't, go wandering alone in a dark forest when there are bears around and you can even hear their cubs - these bear hunters couldn't be unaware that there must be a worried bear mother near by when she smells a human hunter close to her cubs. Of course, the bear attack triggers the drama, without which there would be none; but the greatest folly is in the end, when the two good men go a-hunting for a desperate murderer in the wilderness and they split up. How could they be so dumb? Sorry, it's a weak story with no psychology mainly made up for its effects, and of course, these are marvellous, the main prize going to the fantastic photography of the wilderness in the awesome landscape scenes, and here you could actually speak of poetry, but that's about all. They say it was all shot without any artificial light, which of course adds to the intriguing atmosphere of the nocturnal scenes, and the whole enterprise of shooting such a film under sinister conditions in the wilderness deserves much credit. At best some of the wilderness scenes succeed in creating some ""Call of the Wild""-ecstasy, especially the most spectacular of them all with the buffaloes. But the story is such, that you feel rather inclined to take sides with the Indians and the bears than with these villains causing nothing but mischief in the wilderness and even failing with that, while the original Richard Harris-John Huston film from 1971, which I haven't seen yet, could be expected to be better.<br/><br/>You could blame the flaws of the story, which appears to be founded on fact way up in the Dakota wilderness in the 1820s among Sioux and Pawnees, on the necessity of the truthfulness of naturalism, people could actually be this beastly, and if they are beastly they are usually dumb as well, so let's make allowances for that - realism in absurdum, which though only makes you take the stronger sides with the Indians and the bears. One final question mark - even an Indian would in the end feel motivated to do something for the trapper that after all saved the life of his daughter, which she couldn't be unaware of, when she exits with her father with no more than a look."

","The definition is ""revenant"": 1) a person who returns, 2) a person who returns as a spirit after death; ghost, I was excited about this film months before its release, even more when it received award nominations and wins, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director Alejandro González Iñárritu (Amores Perros, Babel, Biutiful, Birdman). Based on a true story, set in 1823, in the unsettled wilderness of the Louisiana Purchase, quasi-military hunting party of trappers and hunters, commanded by Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), are hunting for pelts. The hunting party are ambushed by hostile Native American Arikara Indians, only half of the party escape on one of their rafts, they salvage as much as they can while still under fire from the attacking Arikara, Henry knows they will still be pursued. The party are further slowed down when experienced hunter Hugh Glass (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Leonardo DiCaprio) becomes separated from the others, he stumbles on a mother grizzly bear and her cubs, the enraged grizzly savagely attacks him, Glass eventually kills the bear, but he is left severely injured and nearly dead himself. The hunting party can only provide rudimentary medical care, they take wounded Glass with them, but he is on a makeshift stretcher, slowing them down, finally one of the party, John Fitzgerald (Oscar nominated Tom Hardy), suggests killing Glass. Initially Henry tries to kill Glass himself, but is unable to do so, instead he offers payment for several men to stay behind with Glass, only Glass' son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) and young Jim Bridger (Son of Rambow's Will Poulter) volunteer, Henry ups the reward when Fitzgerald mentions the likelihood of the boys and Glass being killed, Fitzgerald volunteers also. Fitzgerald promises Henry to stay with Glass until he dies and give him a proper burial, but once separated from the hunting party Fitzgerald tries to kill Glass, who cannot speak while wounded, by smothering him, Hawk stumbles on this, and Fitzgerald kills him while Glass watches in agony, Bridger returns and Fitzgerald claims he does not know where Hawk is, and makes up seeing Indians, though Bridger is hesitant he agrees with Fitzgerald to leave Glass behind, leaving behind a canteen with a carved spiral on it. Glass, put in a shallow grave covered in earth, finds strength, though struggling to recover, to crawl away, walking through the woods and surviving feeding on roots, the same Arikara who attacked earlier are tracking him, the chief is looking for his kidnapped daughter, Glass narrowly avoids a confrontation at the river by floating down the rapids. Meanwhile Henry and the surviving hunting party have reached their nearly dilapidated barracks outpost, Fitzgerald and Bridger make their way to the outpost, Bridger realises Fitzgerald was lying to leave Glass behind, Fitzgerald intimidates him into keeping silent, and when they reach the outpost Fitzgerald tells Henry that Glass died and Hawk disappeared, Henry gives him his reward, Bridger refuses his payment. Glass encounters Hikuc (Arthur RedCloud), a friendly Native American, who like him seeks revenge, the Pawnee builds Glass a shelter during a blizzard, and the next morning Glass finds his friend hanged, he was murdered by French pelt hunters camped nearby, he rescues an Indian girl being raped, this is in fact the kidnapped daughter of the chief, he takes the Pawnee's horse that the French hunters stole, he accidentally leaves behind the canteen with the spiral carving. Glass encounters the Arikara, but escapes falling off a cliff, killing the horse and wounding himself further, Glass keeps himself warm during the night in the hollowed horse corpse, while back at the outpost a lone hunter is found carrying the canteen, a search party is organised, Fitzgerald realises Glass must still be alive, so he empties the outpost safe and flees. Henry's group eventually find Glass and bring him back to the outpost, furious Henry fails in finding Fitzgerald in a search, Glass assures Henry that Bridger was lied to, and is released from imprisonment for treason, Henry intends to bring back Fitzgerald dead or alive, Glass insists on coming with him. Henry and Glass split up to approach Fitzgerald from separate angles, but Fitzgerald ambushes and kills Henry, Glass finds him deceased, but sets up a trap to trick Fitzgerald, he gets shot in the shoulder, Glass chases him to the river bank where they fight. Glass stops himself killing Fitzgerald, remembering words from the Pawnee, so he instead pushes heavily wounded Fitzgerald downstream, into the hands of the approaching Arikara, the chief, with his daughter returned, kills Fitzgerald and spares Glass, in the end Glass has completed his revenge, but his flashing visions of his dead wife and son will remain. Also starring Paul Anderson as Anderson, Kristoffer Joner as Murphy, Joshua Burge as Stubby Bill, Lukas Haas as Jones, Brendan Fletcher as Fryman and Duane Howard as Elk Dog. DiCaprio as the shaggy frontiersman gives a superb award winning performance as the real man struggling through savagery and harsh conditions, Hardy is also fantastic as the menacing villain who leaves him for dead, the supporting stars are good too. This true story set in the wilderness of 1820s America, about revenge, redemption and survival is astonishing, watching the man alone fighting to stay alive, and punish those who betrayed him, with fantastic cinematography, natural lighting and intense emotion, it is a brilliant must see historical revenge adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Production Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, Best Sound and Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Original Music for Ryuichi Sakamoto and Carsten Nicolai and Best Makeup and Hair, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score. Outstanding!"

","The Revenant was one of those movies that got released in December and then got a wider release in January. I walked into this movie last night expecting nothing more than a good Leonardo Dicaprio film, but it was a masterpiece. The last time i had this much fun at the movies was probably back in 2012 when i saw The Dark Knight Rises. The overall movie plot was Glass'(Leonardo) fight against mother nature, with the desire to get his revenge after the murder of his son. The breathtaking locations and forests throughout the movie and the beautiful cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki all added up to make The Revenant a visual poetry. The film had many fight scenes which were BRUTAL, especially one that involved Glass and a Grizzly. Every actor in the movie pulled a good performance and Tom Hardy was great as usual. Leonardo Dicaprio at the age of 41 delivered yet another Oscar worthy performance, making The Revenant without a doubt one of the best movies of 2015."
"mccavaco","8","3","10","3 January 2016"," What a monstrous movie!
","I could not ask for a better way of beginning 2016 that is for sure. So, my review will begin by quoting an expression of my own, which was said when the screenplay turned black and the lights tuned off: ""What a monstrous movie!"" Monstrous in every sense, since the story, the action, the scenarios, the actors' interpretation, until the directing. <br/><br/>The story about The Revenant is quite simple to tell, once all the juices rely on the scenarios and even more on the Actors' performance. It is about an American, named Hugh Glass, that was on an expedition throughout Native American territory searching for fur when he was attacked by a bear. This animal almost killed him, so the group where Glass was inserted considered him only a burden and left him behind to face his own fate. What happens next is something amazing that show us what the human being is capable of surviving whether the energy that propel you is love or revenge. <br/><br/>The scenario that serves The Revenant is absolutely astonishing and creates in the spectator the desire of being there. The snow, the rivers, the falls, even the storms are incredibly beautiful. All their beauty is well capture in the screen and only raised the magnificence of the movie. On top of that, all the scenes with the animals are also incredible. Even if you know that they might be virtual, because some scenes tend to be brutal and violent.<br/><br/>But what transforms The Revenant in something of another level are the actors. By seeing the cast we understand that this could be a good movie, however, sometimes good casts generated poor movies, so I usually do not deposit all my hopes on that. Of course that when you have in the same movie Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, only good things could happen. And let me tell you that in this movie only incredible things happened! The performance of Leonardo DiCaprio (Hugh Glass) was absolutely incredible. I have already heard that 2015 could be the year for DiCaprio, and I have to beef up that idea because he has a role that is out of this world. The evolution in the screen is incredible since he passes from a relatively calm guy with a dark past to a vengeful man with fire in his eyes. And the spectator will share with him all the anger and desire for blood. But in the end we learned a lesson, and in my opinion that is all what matters when you see a movie: what you take home. There are particular scenes that enhance the spectacular performance of DiCaprio but in the end I have to say that all the picture is set to finally Leonardo DiCaprio become an Oscar winner. And what could I say about Tom Hardy? Oh my god! If Hugh Glass become only alive because of an incredible Leonardo DiCaprio, John Fitzgerald only make sense with Tom Hardy. If you will love Glass, you will hate Fitzgerald. And all the love and hate are only possible because not just DiCaprio is astonishing, Tom Hardy blew up in this movie and features one of the best performances that I have already seen from him. At the beginning Fitzgerald is only a mere pawn but as the action developed, you understand is role on the movie that culminates with an astonishing class with Glass. <br/><br/>Therefore, I truly recommend The Revenant and I have scored it with an 8/10. You will not regret the 180 minutes of the movie, because it has the ability of capturing your attention the entire time. It is an awesome movie, incredibly directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu. Is beauty relies in every aspect, every detail, so do not detour your attention from the big or small screen."
"NIPHomePage","7","3","10","1 January 2016"," Visually and Aurally Stunning - Those Carry This Film
","A visually and aurally stunning film that captured and held my attention from beginning to end - for those two reasons primarily. This is a familiar story - albeit in a rather unique setting of unrelenting cold and unforgiving wilderness - that has been told a multitude of times before: a man's loving family is killed needlessly, man then overcomes challenges to seek revenge and redemption. Therein, to me, lies this film's greatest weakness and the main reason I did not rate it higher - for all intents and purposes, we've seen the story before and pretty much know instinctively how it will turn out. The story really doesn't throw us much in the way of curves or unexpected turns. As noted, the film's greatest strength lies in the production and sound design and the stunning cinematography, both of which could be Oscar worthy. While I am not a Leonardo DiCaprio fan, in my view he did an admirable job getting across the pain and desperation of the main character. I don't think I would go so far as to say that his performance is Oscar worthy; in my view an actor must rise above putting in a ""solid and admirable performance"" to get to the lofty heights of an Oscar. For me, the other weakness in the film - and some may not have found this the problem that I did - is Tom Hardy's performance. While his characterization was outstanding and properly menacing and nuanced, his accent was so thick at times that, despite a good sound system, I was often unable to understand what he was saying. This was unfortunately a major distraction for me as a viewer. Nevertheless, I would highly recommend viewing this film at least once primarily for the stunning visuals and sound design that makes you feel that you are right there in nature with the characters on the screen."
"Tiffany-pow","7","3","10","29 December 2015"," Nostalgic visual effects with thrilling moments
","Several things made this movie amazing, the demonstration of human resilience, the stunning visuals and the outstanding cast. Despite the minimal use of Leonardo's verbal acting, his ability to display the character's sheer emotions in every aspect was both invigorating and powerful. With every new challenge came the display of pure will power; understanding survival in the truest sense in a way which really transcended with me and I'm sure with many other viewers of the film. Another aspect of the movie I loved was the beauty within the film - the vibrancy of the locations really added that extra ""punch.""<br/><br/>Although it had its captivating scenes whereas I would certainly place one in particular for ""scene of the year"" contention, the movie developed slowly with less human interactions than expected. I would relate it to other adventure movies like 'Wild' or '127 Hours'... as the movie did not wrap around vengeance and fighting like I anticipated."

The film that's made Leo a star should have taught him that it's just impossible for a human to stay in the ice cold water for longer than a couple of minutes: because of the body temperature decrease, one's blood vessels contract so much, the heart is no longer able to push through the life juice. And that's just one thing... But nah, says Iñárritu. I'm gonna have DiCaprio body-raft down the freezing cold mountain river, drop down a waterfall, float some more and finally crawl ashore wearing a bear skin, which by that time should have weighed about a hundred pounds. And we know, what happens to a man enveloped in 100 lbs. of stuff in water. Those of us who have seen a single medieval knight movie know for sure: man sinks like a stone. Oh, well, says Iñárritu. That's what YOU think – and then shatters Leo's right leg. Shatters to a point when it hangs by the skin and tendon. At first Leo does take it hard – barely moves. A day (!) later he crawls, using a crutch and a tiny stick for a splint. Another couple of days pass and he is moving like a drunken hockey player, though able to avoid all kinds of unwanted encounters, gathering and hunting... Finally, perhaps, after no more than two weeks of healing, he is running, mounting a horse on a fly, spurs it frantically, in short, displays the kind of vigor rarely associated even with a perfectly healthy individual, let alone someone who's spent days under a snag in a forest But the film in itself is great. The kind of achievement which could (and should, given the amount of pure garbage on offer) cap the whole cinematographic year. What is sad though, is that my problem with 'the ballads of the strength of the human spirit' has not for the countless time been rectified. I still can't figure out how to feel about the blatant untruths the film makers utilize in order to make their characters' heroism truthful."
"choorydanny","10","4","16","22 December 2015"," A Western Odyssey or (How Leo Learned To Stop Worrying And Love His Oscar)
","Odyssey in literature equals to the calvary of homecoming. Odyssey means fulfillment either by knowledge, sacrifice or mercy. There are great examples of fulfillment by knowledge in 2001: A Space Odyssey as well as we can find heroic sacrifice and redemption by vengeance in Gladiator, however in Homer's Odyssey the latter fulfillment is achieved by justice and mercy.<br/><br/>Alejandro González Iñárritu's The Revenant takes a great courage from the real life Odysseus' trials and tribulations based on the novel of the same name. Needless to say, Iñárritu reaches higher than the novel by envisioning a cinematically unique and unsettlingly fulfilling experience alongside with the exceptional imagination of cinematographer Emmanuel 'Chivo' Lubezki and a huge amount of excellent performances from a most talented cast.<br/><br/>From the characters, there are three prominently mentionable. Domhnall Gleeson is brilliantly temperate in order for the two main characters to deepen their opposition with each other. Tom Hardy serves as the picture's main antagonist with whom Leonardo DiCaprio's Hugh Glass is forced to confront followed by a tragic decision in the part of Hardy who kills Glass' half-blood Indian son while his father is watching the act impotently lying wounded by a previous attack of a bear. This great inner and outer duel of the two is slowly but constantly reaching its peak as Hardy's Fitzgerald learns to deal with his deed, while Leo's Glass learns a much greater deal.<br/><br/>Hugh Glass does not only seek revenge. He seeks justice. Frontier justice. Glass learns to survive in the wild as was he viciously left for dead and devastated. He is forced to flee from the past and the wild in order to fulfill his destiny in killing Fitzgerald. Such an unprecedented Odyssey we can experience as Glass learns mercy on his journey as well as sacrifice and justice! Leonardo DiCaprio solidly delivers his greatest and most memorable performance in his career. He captures and evolves on every aspect of his character which is absolutely Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>The scenery is marvelous. The costume design is most convincing. The makeup artists did an amazing job. The editing and mixing are no less award-worthy than the beautiful visuals and the masterful vision of Chivo. The long takes are breathtakingly intense from start to finish, from the opening Indian attack sequence that leaves us uncertain who to root for, through to a naturalist and unbelievably convincing depiction of the bear attack, to the brutally mesmerizing and well- executed final confrontation between Fitzgerald and Glass. These two actors both deserve their praise for their most committed performances as they make us believe that on the screen it is not Hardy and Leo fighting, but two hopeless, barbaric, opposing elements who learn to rise and fall in the wild. <br/><br/>All those thought-provoking visual and external oppositions claim for re-watching owing to the film's splendid screenplay in which the conflicts (American-Indian; Fitzgerald-Glass; conflict of elements) are so layered that from the first viewing one may not be able to fully process what they might have just experienced."

","I have just watched the movie. I have marinated the movie in my laptop for a long time because the movie hadn't come to my theater so I had to wait for the Blu-Ray rip. Even after that I was afraid that I will end up not liking it. At long last I have watched the movie. It was amazing. Just amazing.<br/><br/>I will start with the direction. Amazing. Excellent. Alejandro has shown how to use a basic plot and muscle it up with emotions, because it is a very emotion-driven plot. Most of the plot-lines in our real life are not that dynamic but they are important to us because our emotions are attached with it. Alejandro showed that.<br/><br/>The cinematography. Amaze-balls. What should I say about it? It is indescribable. The flow of the movie is very smooth. The CGI is used very efficiently i.e. only where required. I have heard that there was no artificial lighting, so under that conditions putting up such a beautiful looking movie is no easy job.<br/><br/>NOW, the acting. Domnhall Gleeson plays the weak and timid captain. I always thought of him as a timid guy until I saw Star Wars:The Force Awakens. He shows he is capable of everything. Tom Hardy. Tom Hardy. The guy shows so little but every emotion and dialogues are transcended through his eyes. Finally, Leonardo DiCaprio. WHOOOOF! The guy is his own competition. He just makes a movie and then tops that and keeps topping that. There is no stopping Leo. 90% of the movie, Leo is on screen and he shows what he is capable of. After the 1st half he rarely talks because he was mauled by a frigging bear. It's all expressions after that. I could go on and on. As there is a saying that better late than never so ya, he was awarded the Oscar at the right moment, for the right movie and for unparalleled acting. I very much doubt that anybody can match up to this level of acting. Leo, hats off!"

"SingeDeFeu","6","2","6","29 February 2016"," The 'really?' bits in The Revenant
","BEWARE – CONTAINS SPOILERS! <br/><br/>Oh my, what a horrifyingly heroic journey Hugh Glass and I have endured. There was power in that there movie, something universal, mighty and indestructible about the human spirit. Intense, involving and beautiful though it was, I was wondering why Hugh had not gone to meet the great trapper in the sky about 20 minutes in. Sometimes it was all so implausible I had an attack of the involuntary giggles. I can suspend my rational mind for the sake of art, and get swept along by the story, but there was just sooo much that would make a Boy Scout with a camping trip or two under his belt want to scratch his head until it was raw. <br/><br/>For starters – all this standing for lengthy periods up to the knees in freezing winter water and keeping on one's wet cold soggy trousers and boots afterwards. If the Fitzgerald had not murdered Hugh's son, such antics would have. I mean how could he even feel his appendages? Good Pawnee genes or not, frostbite, hypothermia or maybe gangrene would surely have done for him. At the other end of the excitement spectrum was the grizzly attack. Even if a helicopter had swooped in and carried Hugh off to the trauma unit, he could hardly have survived it. <br/><br/>Oh Hugh, all that whole body immersion in a freezing, ferociously tumbling river, even if it didn't drown you would have caused your body to seize up with life-threatening shock in seconds. The blood would have rushed from your periphery to your core organs, leaving your brain blank and befuddled. Perhaps that's why your speech stayed unintelligible ad nauseam and you made funny decisions like wearing that fur poncho effort with the fur facing outwards, mountain man style, rather than inwards to warm your perishing core. <br/><br/>The brain hypoxia could explain why you just kept walking and walking with no idea where you were going, just spiritual guidance from his missus (always clad in unseasonably light Laura Ashley hippy attire). OK, she's a spirit, I know. But hats off to you for your uncanny Boy Scout sense of direction. Dib dib. <br/><br/>Oh yeah, and that horse jump over the precipice. Yikes! Incidentally, did all those chasing riders manage to pull up? Really? Hmm. Jeez, Hugh might have had his fall broken by that super-tall pine but for all we know, he could have floated down on a snowflake. His oxygen deprived and now semi-concussed brain is getting madder. And madness makes you strong. So he decides to make like a horse, slice its belly and heave out the massive innards. For a minute, I thought he might dine on them as it's been a while since the raw buffalo liver, but he cosies down for the night in the bloody body cavity stark bollock naked. No jim jams. No hotty. He'd have woken at dawn in this horse shaped freezer with an annoying draught piercing that belly crack straight onto his perishables. <br/><br/>So out he climbs after a good old smelly kip and pulls on his nice dry clothes. How come after a night in the blizzard? I can only put that down to the missus hanging them on some heavenly radiator overnight.<br/><br/>Oh and there are other things. How exactly did the captain manage to make his mount walk forwards, err.. while dead? Why did only two of them pursue Tom Hardy when there was a fort full of men to help? We will never know. One thing's for sure, his lips had their own story to tell, and proved a diverting subplot. Spittle, blubber, bloody spittle, and more spittle. Then scaly, chapped to pieces, and super scaly like a dead fish. Phew! No wonder Powaqa gave him that look of muted disgust as she rode past at the end. It all explains why no one kissed him hello at the fort gates. <br/><br/>I'm sure at the end, his wife was giving him that 'Darling, that's really enough now isn't it?' look. 'Time to come in for a cuppa and Eastenders '. Go to her Hugh and put your feet up."

","It never ceases to amaze me how very different people's views are regarding the same subject. Some of the reviews here regard this film as boring and a waste of nearly 3 hours. For me, I just looked on in awe from the first minute to last. Yes it is long with slow parts between the excitement, yet this for me adds to the overall structure of the film. The despair and anguish displayed during these periods were almost palpable, oozing from the screen, due to the superb job of cinematography employed.<br/><br/>This review will not touch on the plot as it has been more than played out in these reviews. For me, although the plot was obvious by the title, what set it into orbit was the marriage of brilliant acting set within the harsh wilderness in which it was filmed.<br/><br/>In my opinion this film will go down as a modern day classic. For generations to come it will be looked back on with admiration for the superb acting and sheer enormity of its production with great special effects. They will also look back and believe it was a worthy first Oscar for an actor named Leonardo DiCaprio."

","The revenant is by far one of the most beautiful films ever. Is poetic, grand, epic, mesmerizing, is a film that is in a completely new level. Inarritu did it again.<br/><br/>One of the reasons i love inarritu films so much, is because they all are super original, have such a unique style and are always groundbreaking.. And the revenant is another showcase of this. The story while being about revenge, is unlike everything i've ever seen. Is so fresh, so unique, its like you are experiencing a poem coming to life. Is really well paced, and its highly climatic. You just want to see what happens next and how will it end keeping you at the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>Is a highly immersive experience, where you feel you are right there with the characters. Part of the reason for this, is because the film is insanely realistic. it's like a documentary. You feel everything the characters feel just by watching. Its like they just traveled back in time and recorded everything. The attention to detail is astonishing. It can be very brutal, but its part of the why the film is so great. The most impressive scene, by far, is the bear scene, where you will refuse to admit that bear isn't real.<br/><br/>The cast is just beyond perfect, and for actors clearly stand out: Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter, Tom hardy and Leonardo Dicaprio. But of course, Dicaprio and Hardy are the ones that steal the show. And in the end, the tour-de-force comes from Dicaprio. The fact that he did everything you see, for real, like the true character did, just says it all. His character doesn't have much dialogue, and this is his most physical performance yet, it's not my favorite, but its his most impressive one. With just a look, a move, an expression, he says everything. And the long due Oscar cant go to anyone but him.<br/><br/>The film is just so beautiful is insane. There's a lot of breathtaking nature vistas, so beautifully shot that nature feels like a main character in the film, and it is. The cinematography is mesmerizing, the fact that the film was shot with natural light just makes this one of the most breathtaking visual experiences ever, and again, the Oscar cant go to anyone else but lubezky. The same goes for everyone else in the crew. The production values in this film are through the roof, so real that is like they don't exist. The make up is amazing. The score is brilliant, because it makes such an eerie atmosphere that is a huge part in the films identity. The camera moves are incredible, and the visual effects, well, what visual effects? i can't distinguish whats real or what's VFX. <br/><br/>A case of both style and substance, this breathtaking journey of man vs nature, vs man, is really immersive, emotional, thrilling, awe inspiring, i could just go on and on. Its a film that you either love or not, but you will always appreciate it for the unbelievable achievements of its production and the incredible performances."
"pzazz_hij","9","2","6","15 January 2016"," DiCaprio shines but he owes much to some masterful craftsmen
","Before I address the question on everyones mind regarding the Oscar that DiCaprio craves I have to talk about the on form director, Alejandro G. Iñárritu, and his latest masterpiece. Last year he swept up completely with 3 personal nominations and 3 wins for Birdman and rightfully so. This year he is up for another 2 and if he was to win them both he would be only the 2nd person to win back to back Best Picture awards (The first was David O. Selznick in 1939 & '40) and the 3rd to win Best Director back to back (John Ford 1940 & '41 and Joseph L. Mankiewicz 1949 & '50). He would however be the very first to do both... But could it happen!? <br/><br/>Well, firstly I have to say that any film that is able to put you in amongst the action as fluidly and emotionally as is exampled in the opening scene here is fully worthy of a best picture, the best film that I have seen do it was Children of Men in 2006; rather unsurprisingly a film by a friend of Iñárritu Mr Alfonso Cuaron and also the same man in charge of the cameras Emmanuel Lubezki (The second man to win best Cinematography back to back (He could win a 3rd) along side John Toll). Of course, doing it once in the film really isn't good enough but the fact that it is done more or less constantly throughout the film is exceptional in itself. The opening scene I mentioned is a surprise attack by the Indians on our protagonist and his party, which travels like its one take and has you jolting at every bullet and arrow that hits home. A fully deserved nomination for the above mentioned Cinematographer. But the stand out point for me in this scene was how brilliantly the sound accompanied the visuals and thats not the Score, its the sound effects that feel as though they are happening around you. Brilliant! The minimalistic score is used nicely to overpower the end of the scene and carry us into the next one. All of these elements are under the supervision of the director who I will now say has to make all of this seem seamless and he truly does so. With that in mind the Oscar could indeed be his (But i haven't seen all the other nominees yet). <br/><br/>As soon as this scene was over I knew that I was in for a mesmerising experience similar to what I had with Birdman. Not that they are similar. In fact these films are in many ways mirror opposites. Where Birdman was fast, expressive and imaginative, this is patient, quiet and real. The scene that this film will be remembered for is the Grizzly Bear attack and it really is a shocking and very realistic watch as it happens, seemingly, in 1 take and goes on for at least 5 minutes. The fact that you are sat there at this point almost able to feel the pain he is in is something that must be seen to be believed. The story that follows is just about the mother of all revenge stories, as a true western should be, but also a survival film unlike any seen before it. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy, once again playing the villain can proudly take his Oscar nomination to further springboard his already high flying career; Will he win? Maybe! He's had a fantastic year though, starring in 2 films in the best picture category playing the hero in one and the villain in the other shows his brilliance. <br/><br/>Now... Leonardo DiCaprio... Will he win the Oscar this time? I honestly feel, just my opinion, that the argument suggesting that he should have won one by now is unreasonable because he had been up against some very formidable opposition over the years all of which were worthy winners that he simply wasn't able to outshine. The only one I feel he should have won for was Blood Diamond but was beaten by Forest Whitaker in a career defining performance. The same with Jamie Foxx as Ray. His other performances, albeit very good, weren't ground breaking or really in any films that merit the kind of Oscar best picture winners with weighty subject matter. But also he is the grounded actor in the room which allows for actors around him to experiment and test the water because they know Leo is there as the anchor. The other thing is that if he had have won previously would he have changed the kind of films that he makes? its not an unreasonable thought. <br/><br/>However, this time he has a very physical performance that is given a silence and demands a visceral understanding but also he and all the actors are almost always right in the cameras face... I mean that very literally. There are a few times when Leo's heavy breathing causes condensation on the lens and it never spoils the effect. In fact it makes you realise that the camera was literally a few inches away from him whilst he's trying to perform and given that most of us find that terrifying, for him to achieve this level of performance with that kind of distraction deserves every kind of credit that can be bestowed. His main competition this year is Michael Fassbender for Steve Jobs, 2 very different performances and 2 contrasting acting styles but in my honest opinion DiCaprio will not walk away from the Oscars disappointed this year. Its his to win. <br/><br/>As for the film... Its a masterpiece. Excellent and unforgettable."
"olliecevans","9","2","6","15 January 2016"," Any aspiring cinematographers... take note.
","Very rarely do I feel compelled to write a review, however in this instance I feel I should. <br/><br/>Recently many films have been hyped up, raising the bar for my expectations, only for them to limbo right beneath. The Revenant was truly an exception, taking the bar to new heights. <br/><br/>From the outset the visuals are stunning - the spectacular scenery is married with a deep consideration for movement and cuts. Not so many cuts as to overwhelm the viewer, but enough to capture the enormity of the wilderness whilst also showcasing the cocktail of emotions portrayed by the characters. This is all achieved without missing a moment of the action. <br/><br/>Any line-up with Di Caprio and Hardy is destined to please, but it was the additional support of upcoming actor Will Poulter which added new dimension to the movie. Whilst Di Caprio and Hardy sit on two opposite ends of the 'morally sound' spectrum (by 1800's standards), it is Poulter's character battling with his conscience between the action that keeps the pace of the movie going.<br/><br/>I shall leave my review there - all I can say is, the scenes you've likely heard about WILL exceed your expectations, as will those you haven't. Go see the movie - enjoy."

All of the hoopla about natural light and crew abandonment seem quite credible. This achievement would not be for the timid, whether they are crew or cine enthusiasts. It is extremely realistic in it's brutality. And in that crush of reality of western yore you are also treated to some beautiful majestic and sometimes almost unbelievable captures of the landscape of the Northwestern American continent. There is ode to to past cinema styles and inferences, most notably the dream sequences. But the persistent theme is survival and justice. Not included in the trailer is how specific this film is about the plight of the indigenous people of Northwestern America. And they play a fascinating role in the story. By now, you know the Golden Globe awards this film has received and rightly so. Awesome is a word so over used in our vocabulary today so I will submit to awe inspiring. Truly an unforgettable classic."
"SforSmile","9","2","6","13 January 2016"," Captivating and Consequent, A Masterpiece!
","This movie has such a strong pulling effect that the moment it starts you feel like physically dragged into the woods accompanying the hero on his long, agonizing way to find the man who hideously killed his son. <br/><br/>The eye of the beholder or more precisely, the camera is smoothly flowing around the characters and often comes so close to them that the lens gets fogged by their breath, it's almost ""pornographic"" in terms of how close the director wants to show us everything so that you feel the urge to look away, the blood, the sweat, it's literally palpable, the pain the hero must have sustained while being lacerated by a huge bear you're able to feel on your own skin, it's simply awe-inspiring. Sometimes it appears as if there are no cuts like it's happening in real time, extraordinary!<br/><br/>Inarritu once again proved that he is a visionary cinematographer and a true artist on par with Terrence Malick just (luckily) more grounded in linear story telling, the style never overlaps the substance like it was the case with Malick's ""Tree of Life"" where you could get lost in imagery. Sure the story itself is rather simple, it's about survival and revenge, more or less typical blockbuster themes,""The Revenant"" could easily have turned into a second ""Rambo"" or Liam Neeson fighting wolves in the wilderness, yet it became an ambitious and authentic epos with a kind of documentary and simultaneously artistic approach and a pulsating score.<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether all this panting and screaming by DiCaprio is more challenging and therefore worthier of an Oscar than let's say his brilliant performance of a complex character like Howard Hughes in ""Aviator"" for example which means that he should already have gotten one as he is a fabulous actor, Tom Hardy as his treacherous antagonist played a slightly more diverse character and was slightly more interesting so that he definitely should get the Oscar for the Best Supporting Role.<br/><br/>""The Revenant"" playing in a snow covered wilderness will make you shiver with cold for exactly the right reasons as it is a masterpiece."
"mauswiesel","9","2","6","11 January 2016"," Man vs. Nature
","Only one year after his major Oscar win with ""Birdman"", Alejandro G. Inarritu delivers another awesome cinematic experience with his survival western drama ""The Revenant"". Most of the publicity surrounding this film is about whether or not this will finally gain Leo his first Oscar. But there's so much more to this film. And Leo is not even the star of this movie - even though he's terrific in it, I'll come to that - but the real star is sitting behind the camera. It's cinematographer Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki.<br/><br/>I'd like to say that the art of cinematography has reached perfection with ""The Revenant"", at least it has reached its peak up to now. Chivo's images approach Nature as something elemental, terrifying, yet painfully beautiful. It does not comment on these images, it does not judge, it is rather something that is felt than intellectually explored. Of course we have the long uncut shots that Chivo is already famous for, but the dogmatic restriction to solemn use of natural lighting comes off as even more incredible here. The movie has been chided for its brutality, but it never uses that unnecessarily. It is rather a realistic approach to the hard life in the Northwestern parts of North America in the early 1800s.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a stellar performance as Hugh Glass, the protagonist who is trying to survive on his own in the wilderness although being severely wounded. It is rather a physical performance that he shows without any subtleness, but as an acting tour de force it is overall extremely respectable. Tom Hardy excels as his counterpart John Fitzgerald, a cold-hearted pragmatist who has his own methods for survival. To me, he definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for that performance.<br/><br/>The only issue I have with this movie is with some of the directorial choices made by Inarritu. In my opinion, it would have been the perfect film if it had been linear from beginning to end - just a straight, gritty western that is always in the moment and in the wilderness. Instead, Inarritu continuously breaks the scheme by integrating flashbacks and dream sequences, which come off as quite impressionistic. Those impressionistic elements bothered me, as they slowed down the pace of this (overall too long) movie and distracted from the movie's greatest strength: the Man vs. nature elements. But after all, this is an incredibly beautiful work with superb acting and the best camera work I've ever seen."
"heisenberg12","5","2","6","10 January 2016"," Must See Movie Event, But...
","I give the Revenant 8 out of 10 stars on here. That's good, but not great. It is definitely a must see film of the year as this may finally be DiCaprio's first Oscar victory, and because it is quite an experience. While it is definitely a ""good"" film, it falls short of greatness due to a rather boring opening ninety minutes (except for a few short scenes) and a sort of lack of explanations for certain behaviors of its' characters. This is not a criticism because what it does present us does suffice, but simultaneously I felt like I would have liked to have gotten to know the other characters a little bit more, particularly the son and the chief of the village who goes to hunt for Fitzgerald at the end. Also, the beginning opening is rather confusing as it is hard to tell who is who and what is what, and why this is happening, despite a nice action opening.<br/><br/>All that being said, I was not disappointed and would definitely recommend this movie. It is sort of a like a Castaway meets The Grey meets Dances With Wolves? Either way, it definitely deserves some award recognition. It won't be for everybody mostly due to the boredom that stems from so much time with nothing happening and the length, but if you can stick with it, it is definitely a good film. In all honesty, I found myself rooting for Leo most of the film toward the end: ""Come on DiCaprio, don't mess this up. Nail all your lines and facial expressions. Get this Oscar. Come on, don't mess up! You can do it. Get your Oscar"".."

There's plenty of time to catch your breath and take in the beauty that surrounds the darkness. However, every time things look up for the story and our characters, the ground crumbles at their feet causing everything to come crashing back down.<br/><br/>The film follows Hugh Glass, a frontiersman on a fur trading expedition in the early 1800s. After an incredible opening battle sequence, the story takes off when Glass is brutally attacked by a grizzly bear while out on the hunt. One of the most realistically violent and jaw dropping scenes in recent memory, this attack sets in motion a series of events that cause great pain and anguish for the character, striking relentlessly at his spirit and will to survive. In arguably his best performance to date, Leonardo DiCaprio was the perfect actor to portray the character in all of his pain, loss and misery. His performance was so gritty and realistic that it was hard to watch at times giving the illusion that these things were really happening to a real human being. Combine that with the brilliant cinematography of Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki and you get an unforgettable experience rarely achieved in cinema.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, you experience Glass' hardships hand in hand, feeling his pain. None of this made easier by Tom Hardy's John Fitzgerald. Hardy plays the villain to perfection as Fitzgerald jumps on a chance to collect a payday by looking after the injured Glass. None too excited about sitting around in the freezing cold watching a man slowly die, he takes matters into his own hands to speed up the process. Using the phantom threat of hostile Native Americans to scare his partner Bridger (Will Poulter) into fleeing, the two of them leave Glass for dead and rejoin their group. This leaves Glass to overcome his dire situation on his own and face the unforgiving forces of nature that surround him. DiCaprio's performance and Iñárritu's vision are at the helm for the duration of the film and are also what will stay with you long after the experience is over.<br/><br/>9/10"
"graymattermovies","9","2","6","10 January 2016"," GMM: The Revenant Movie Review, A Truly Heart Pounding Experience
","An experience that finds you shivering throughout the whole film, The Revenant will turn any theater into the cold harsh wilderness of 1823. This is a film that puts viewers on the edge of their seats through most of its two and a half hours. Taking place in a land where danger lurks around any corner, and sleeping with one eye open is key for survival, The Revenant is an adventure only fit for those with a strong heart. Left for dead, the fearless frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) must go toe to toe with Mother Nature herself as he struggles to survive the deadly winter elements of uncharted American territory.<br/><br/>This was one of the few films of recent years that truly makes you believe you are there watching the story unfold. Next time you want to say you are having the worst day ever, just think about Hugh Glass and what he had to undergo. With very few items on hand, every breath of survival was fueled by nothing but revenge for the man who put him in such a situation. A truly great performance by DiCaprio, viewers can really believe the struggle that he endures throughout his treacherous journey. Achieving the Golden Globe for best actor in a motion picture-drama was well deserved. The primary antagonist (the human one) John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) is due credit for his performance as well. It is clear these two actors deliver on screen when you find yourself rooting for Hugh to prevail, and hating every second Fitzgerald is alive.<br/><br/>Director Alejandro Iñárritu spends a good deal of time shooting the surrounding environment. In most cases, this could cause the film to seem as though it is dragging on, but not here. The Revenant is an incredible viewing experience, showing the wintry remote conditions of Canada and Southern Argentina. Part of this had to do with the film being shot in all natural light. This typically isn't done due to relying on the position of the sun and clouds, but it pays off as this is one of the most beautifully shot movies of 2015.<br/><br/>There is absolutely no shortage of heart pounding moments. The biggest being the encounter with a grizzly bear (the primary non-human protagonist). An incredibly impactful scene, it demonstrates the raw power such a creature can have. This moment will induce your fight or flight response as you are sitting in your soft, safe, theater seat. What Iñárritu does so well in this, and other action sequences, is shoot them in one continuous shot. Most other films will cut back and forth between characters or movements, The Revenant does not. Viewers will find that this puts more focus on the event as a whole, versus just the few who are involved.<br/><br/>The story was based on true events, which makes the movie inspiring, but runs the risk of reducing its impact as many viewers might know how the plot unfolds. However, even if you know how it concludes before entering the cinema, The Revenant is brilliant in showing how Glass struggles to reach that point. Though they partly explain why Glass is in a certain mind state during the film, the dream sequences he has do occur a little too much. Nearly every time Glass closes his eyes, he has obscure visions. So for those aren't particularly fond of this type of genre, it may seem somewhat boring, and these moments could highly contribute to that.<br/><br/>A magnificent feast for the eyes, The Revenant is absolutely one of the best films of 2015. With stellar performances and cinematography, it depicts just how resilient the human spirit can be. As a recommendation, it is best to see this in the theater. So don't just wait for it to come out on digital or DVD, get the most from this movie by seeing it on the big screen. A strong Oscar contender in multiple categories (and winning a few golden globes), The Revenant receives a well deserved 8.5/10. (IMDB only allows whole numbers so between either an 8 or 9, it deserves a 9)."
"guitarguy-60094","8","2","6","10 January 2016"," Oscar Worthy
","First off I'm a big Dicaprio fan and was hoping to see an Oscar-worthy performance out of him heading into this film. I expected the cinematography and directing to be excellent and I wasn't disappointed - I'd say this film is definitely worthy of an Oscar in both of those categories. Was Leo's performance strong enough to earn him his first win? I think so. It takes incredible artistry and talent to bring a character to life with very little dialogue. We the audience experience the character of Hugh Glass mostly through Dicaprio's facial expressions and body language as he navigates and endures the most brutal of realities. Dicaprio displays utter vulnerability and commitment to his craft in this film. <br/><br/>I never really consider going to see a movie twice, however the sheer beauty of this film...we the viewers are literally sucked into this Arctic landscape right from the beginning...makes it an enjoyable experience in and of itself. <br/><br/>One of my critiques though is that the movie does seem to drag in the second half. I'm also a little disappointed in how the revenge narrative played itself out in the movie...a little too straightforward and predictable for my liking. I think this movie showed it's strengths in other ways. Apart from its cinemagraphic brilliance, there were a lot of other side narratives that took place as Dicaprio's character journeyed along. These narratives seemed to have an intentional depth to them that made the movie so much more than just a revenge story and brought that entire place and time to life.<br/><br/>I think the last shot of the movie was also appropriate. The movie had a certain cadence that carried on from beginning to end. Tempo seemed to be important, and it left me feeling somewhat calm upon its conclusion."
"alexo-14601","9","2","6","10 January 2016"," Brutal, Beautiful, and Amazing
","I'd been excited to see The Revenant since I had first heard of it, and when I'd heard that Alejandro G. Inarritu was in the directing chair with the same cinematographer who did the marvelous camera work on my second favorite film of all time, I was understandably pretty excited. And while this wasn't better than that film, it was still a pretty fantastic film over all, and the one that I'll be pining for in all categories at the Golden Globes and the Oscars. Without spoiling the film, the cold, intense and frankly brutal atmosphere is held from start to finish, aided by every aspect of the film. The cinematography is as strong as ever, and the performances are absolutely amazing. As of now, DeCaprio's raw performance as Glass is my favorite over all performance in an Inarritu film. The soundtrack was intense, and the violence is some of the most brutal and challenging that I've ever seen in a theater, being more horrifying and endlessly more meaningful than much of the violence and scares that modern horror can deliver. If I had to make a few small nitpicks, some scenes could be cut out completely and the film wouldn't have been any worse. Some character motivations are a bit sketchy, and occasionally snow or breath will fog the camera up, but I'm not even sure if that last one is a criticism, because it is not very normal to see such raw camera work in such a high budget film. Over all, 9/10... go see this as soon as you can."
"leebols38","9","2","6","10 January 2016"," Picturesque
","The cinematography in this film is truly stunning. Capturing the elements was pivotal in this film and the way it has been portrayed through the lens is breath taking. The Landscape shots are incredible making the movie look and feel real. Very Strong Performances from Di Caprio (Hugh Glass) and Hardy (John Fitzgerald) make the movie a must see. <br/><br/>Two scenes in particular I found to be epic. <br/><br/>The bear attack scene as it was very realistic, everything the bear did seemed instinctive and natural, whether it was the bear sniffing to see if Glass was dead or standing on him to break his bones. This was the first major event in the film which started Glass's struggle to survive.<br/><br/>The final fight scene was perfect in my opinion, nothing was over the top.There was quite a long build up to the fight, which made it all the more sweeter, it was truly a struggle for both men. With a perfect revenge for Glass after what Fitzgerald did to him.<br/><br/>Credit to Domhnall Gleeson (Andrew Henry) for a great performance in another supporting role backing up his recent strong performance in The Force Awakens. His career is reaching new heights as he explores different roles.<br/><br/>Overall I loved the cinematography and the sound effects, there was never any doubt this blockbuster movie would deliver with this all star cast."
"ingmarbeldman-753-927212","8","2","6","10 January 2016"," A brutal story, told in a too decently perfect way.
","I left the cinema with a deep satisfied feeling in my chest. The one you have after an exhausting hike, or heavy swimming exercise. in this case it was a deep satisfaction of my soul. The photography exposes nature in such a deep way that it resonated with every cell in my body.<br/><br/>The story is simple. No need for explanation. The acting is good but not brilliant. The music is close to perfect and its timing and paste is unearthly good. <br/><br/>The film left me with an uneasy feeling - hence the rating, which is not a 10. this movie is too perfect. The photography, the coloring and the light are too perfect for a story that in it itself exposes the roughness of nature and humankind. It does not fit; or you celebrate roughness in your whole production or you don't. But not half. It's like the director is not making a statement in one clear direction. He over-exposes nature, lighting, color and most of all the sound. It gives me the feeling he wants me to be dragged into that unforgiving side of pure nature. He wants me to be 'dirty' myself by boosting up all the parameters. But then....on the other side, he stays so....neat. So clean. The images are so decently, obsessively....beautiful. The sound-pallet is close to perfect... <br/><br/>So, as a viewer, i feel tempted to jump into the rough dirtiness of this story, but when i jump, fear, fight and survive.....and leave the cinema.... I am still clean and neat. <br/><br/>I miss.uncompromisingly dirtiness."
"jam145","6","2","6","9 January 2016"," Great on the technicals
","The production quality of this film is amazing: Locations, conditions, editing, acting. It's a slow film, and conveys emotions. It takes you into another world with crisp details and beautiful camera work.<br/><br/>The flip side is that it leaves you feeling... empty? At least not satisfied. Definitely not happy. This is a hero's journey, but he doesn't reach redemption. He seeks after something, overcoming adversity(!!) at every step, on sheer grit alone. But in the end he reaches his goal, and you don't feel happy for him. It's hard to watch a movie 2.5 hours long with the spanning visuals and locations- you literally become part of the trip- and then not feel good at the end. And the rub is that because it's such a BIG feeling film, the at best neutral finish, or at worst negative finish is multiplied 10-fold. It feels like a downer. It feels pessimistic.<br/><br/>Again, there are plenty of positives to the film and I'd still recommend it, but it's a hard journey to go on just for the sake of seeing it."
"lahiriritwik52","9","2","6","9 January 2016"," It is not an usual Inarritu movie.
","In most of his movies Alejandro G Innaritu has emphasized on human behavior, relationship, conflicts between various characters and he represented his movies in a non linear, hyperlink format. Amores Perros, 21 grams and Babel are the three most prominent examples of his cinematic style. He always has liked to reveal the whole story with flashbacks, flashforwards and plot twists. But 'The Revenant' is an exception of his usual format. Here he created situations in absolute wilderness. It is a story of 'Struggle for existence' and survival with inner current of vengeance, love and human values. He depicted the survival strategies in one of the most hostile and extreme environments with impeccable detailing, that is what makes the film a great creation. Leonardo DiCaprio has done the best performance of his life. a must watch."
"wishhaze","9","2","6","7 January 2016"," A great cinematic experience
","The Revenant could be just one more survival story, but Alejandro Iñárritu directed a movie that can be described as a great cinematic experience. I've really enjoyed its dark but beautiful atmosphere created by director Alejandro Iñárritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (both Oscar-winning). The soundtrack just emphasizes it perfectly. Outside of some brutal scenes, the movie is visually superb and will take you to the beautiful landscapes of the Far West. You should be ready for some extreme scenes of violence, though.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio plays really great, but I'm afraid he won't win Oscar for this one. His character simply doesn't require much acting and resembles (to me at least) Tom Hardy's character in Mad Max (2015). No doubt it was extremely physically challenging role, but it's not an Oscar winning type. I would be glad to be proved wrong!<br/><br/>Beside all of that, The Revenant remains an inspiring story of courage and the unswerving determination to survive. A desire for vengeance possibly shouldn't be the single reason to live, but in watching a movie all my sympathies lie with Hugh Glass. When I learned that movie is based on a real story from the 19th century, I was very impressed.<br/><br/>Before The Revenant, I wasn't a huge fan of Iñárritu's, but now I'll wait for his next movie."
"stevendbeard","7","2","6","6 January 2016"," Realistic Looking Tale of Revenge
","I saw ""The Revenant"", starring Leonardo DiCaprio-Django Unchained, The Quick and the Dead; Tom Hardy-Mad Max:Fury Road, Bane in The Dark Knight Rises; Domhnall Gleeson-Star Wars:The Force Awakens, True Grit_2010 and Will Poulter-The Maze Runner, We're the Millers.<br/><br/>This movie is based on true events about a frontiersman named Hugh Glass. The story was made into an earlier movie back in 1971 and it was called 'Man in the Wilderness', starring Richard Harris. The director of this movie is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who also directed 'Birdman or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance'. Revenant is a French word, meaning to revert to spirit or ghost. The story takes place in the 1820's, with Leo playing Hugh Glass, a guide for a group of fur traders. Tom is one of the traders being led by Leo and Tom does not like Leo and his son, at all. Believe it or not, it seems like there was racism going on back in the old west. Leo has an Indian son from an Indian wife-that has since passed away-that Leo uses as his assistant guide and Tom just don't hanker to them. Domhnall is the leader of the traders that is trying to raise money for his soldiers and some settlers back home and Will is another trader in the team. After a bear attacks Leo and leaves him in pretty bad shape-the attack or actually a maul, looks realistically authentic-Tom leaves Leo and his son behind, to die. Tom actually helps the son on his journey to meet his ancestors in the happy hunting grounds, up in the sky. Leo crawls out of a hastily dug grave and goes after his revenge. Along the journey, Leo runs into other fur traders and Indians, falls off a cliff while riding a horse and climbs inside a dead animal, just to keep warm-kind of like what Luke Skywalker did. You gotta say one thing for him, he didn't know the meaning of the phrase, 'Just give up'. It's rated ""R"" for violence, gory images, language and sexual content- including nudity and a sexual assault-and has a running time of 2 hours & 36 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD."
"garychurch","6","2","6","5 January 2016"," Disappointing
","I was looking forward to this film and the beginning is good and the grizzly bear scene is very impressive but thereafter it falls away somewhat. Leonardo dicaprio seems to survive above all logic - bear attack, nearly dead and frothing from the mouth, bit then can crawl, icy river in a animal skins and then appears to make an almost instant recovery and can then walk again, neatly guts a horse in a blizzard and sleeps in it to keep warm, despite the fact that he's slept out for the previous nights with massive ice crystals in his beard and survived. He then looks quite well but collapses when his employer finds him and then a short time later is fit and fine to pursue the baddie. On another point all the musket shots are amazingly accurate but almost everyone forgets to reload them so there are a lot of surprised clicks and no shot (if you owned and understood a musket wouldn't you reload immediately you'd fired it?). Then there is end where leonardo pursues the baddie and watches him fall in a heap at the bottom of as slope. What shall we do? The logical thing is to reload the musket and take a shot at presumably a dead cert range, given how accurate they have been, but no we fall down the slope in a sloppy manner( maybe the bear bites and tree fall injuries are kicking in at last) and then ensures fight where no weapon is reused. The baddie avoids a tomahawk strike but gets stabbed in the back of the knee but leonardo abandons the seemingly effective and we have the classic strangulation scene before finally the baddie is thrown in the river to the delight of the Indians. I had hoped to enjoy this movie and had previously watched the hateful eight which was fun but a bit overlong (fast forward the first 45mins) but I have to say that quentin Tarantinos film was much better. Okay it's different take but still a western"
"Kirpianuscus","Null","1","2","10 February 2020"," The cinematography
","A survive story. Impressive, în my case, for cinematography and acting. The physical huge effort of Leonardo DiCaprio, the way to give to his character fascinating nuances by Tom Hardy, the flavour of fairy tale because it is not adaptation of a biography but portrait of a super- hero. But, sure, the image is the mist important in this case. Maybe, too important, giving a sort of obvious aesthetism. But , sure, the Oscar of DiCaprio remains the mist powerful memoriu about it. And the influence of Tarkovsky."

"alfitititamus","10","1","2","20 October 2019"," Why is the camera lens such an insistant presence in this film?
","First of all, excellent camera work: impressive immersive long takes, and who knows how they managed to physically move the camera along with the action so cleanly? However, that effort and technical skill was undermined by the amount of lens flare and lens moisture. In river scenes there's water droplets on the camera lens catching the light, in snowing scenes there's specs of snow. At one point, a close up on Leo's breath fogs up the lens. And the lens used is some sort of fish eye lens, making many scenes look unnatural - like you're viewing the events through a camera. Every time this happened it took me out of the film. It made me aware that a camera was being used to capture actors acting. I could imagine a camera man scrabbling around in the snow and the water and the dirt waiting for the scene to end so that he could wipe the lens with his lens cleaning cloth. Maybe the lenses used were particularly good at capturing action, but the downside was the lens flare and walleye vision? Maybe the lens flare was a deliberate choice?
By the middle of the film I was engaged enough in the plot to forget about the camera, but in the last quarter I became aware of the camera/cameraman/film crew/acting again. So I must have enjoyed the middle bit.<br/><br/>Leo's character's surname is Glass and the camera lens is made of glass, and at the end Leo looks into the camera lens. Does that mean something? Is this irony? Are we all made of glass?"

","AMAZING. This is what I consider to be art. This movie might have the best cinematography I've ever seen, and some of the most beautiful shots I've ever laid eyes on. I think I could have taken a screenshot about 500 times during the movie and framed it, no exaggeration. And the directing stood out to me so much in this movie, I kept wondering who made this? there were so many times where a scene had nothing happening in it and yet I was still in awe of the direction and cinematography. and you have the acting, two absolutely outstanding performances by two of my all-time favorite actors.<br/><br/>other than that, this was one of the most intense and real-feeling movies I've ever watched. there were so many scenes where I was on the edge of my seat, or squirming, or clenching my fists. gut-wrenching is a good description. and it wasn't just that it was overly violent, I've seen much worse (ie Hostel). but the fact that I was actually feeling what they were feeling shows how well those scenes were done.<br/><br/>I also thought they did a great job with using almost no music in certain scenes which made it feel much more real. And that's saying a lot since I absolutely love when a great song is used to make an awesome scene more intense. and there were many times when this didn't feel like a movie at all.<br/><br/>another thing that made it feel real was how some of the big events started with no warning or build-up. for example, the bear attacks Glass immediately after we first notice it hiding behind the bushes. in regular movies, we would first notice it, then it would zoom in on his face, then the bear would stand up and roar, and music would start playing, then the bear would attack. the way it was done in this movie just hit you hard and fast.<br/><br/>another example is during the final battle when glass chops off two of Fitzgerald's fingers. it was so quick. I feel like in regular movies he would've chopped them, then they would zoom in on the hand and show his chopped fingers, then show him holding his hand in front of his face, screaming.<br/><br/>I like how they not only showed but made you feel how hard life must've been back then in the lawless land of the west.<br/><br/>downsides, it could have been shorter, and I thought some of the imagery in the dreams didn't really pan out to anything tangible. I thought they would play more of a role in telling the story.<br/><br/>Also, I don't really consider this a downside , but the story really was nothing special overall. but this shows how you can take a regular story and make it amazing with great acting, directing, and cinematography (2 viewings)<br/><br/>
SPOILERS<br/><br/>
the opening scene, the bear scene, and the final battle were three of the most intense and amazing scenes I've watched. and there were many other smaller moments that were jaw-dropping, like when he fell off the cliff on a horse. there were also a few long shots that look like they were done in one take, similar to what he did in Birdman. and the bear scene looks so real that it makes me question all past CGI scenes I've watched and makes me wonder if they actually looked as real as this"

The awards it won are likely deserved (I won't look up nominees now). But the categories it won in sum up fairly well how much effort went into the production, which is, no doubt, outstanding. The props, costumes and settings make it look very realistic.<br/><br/>

","I am surprised how much I didn't like this. <br/><br/>I didn't even like the photography. Too many 360° pans and jumping off cliffs that make the camera a character, or at least felt very out of place in the setting (when they were very reasonable when used in Gravity, for example). <br/><br/>Some great acting, some amazing VFX, but... no story. I mean sure there's a story, but somehow one that was so fantastical, so remote from the actions of the characters that I didn't ever connect the two so didn't feel any emotional attachment to it. <br/><br/>Even the bear scene was the tour-de-force of film-making that everyone says while also making me have absolutely no concern for Glass.<br/><br/>Take the opening attack, and compare it to the attack on the convoy leaving the fort in Last of the Mohicans. The latter gives you a much better sense of the geography of the action, even when they go off to the river and are chased down; this all gives the scene a distinct sense of peril. The characters might not make it. <br/><br/>Not so in The Revenant. Even with the quite common chance of death, as people start dropping from arrows and hatchets, it all feels remote, cold, isolated. And confusing. Warriors coming from off the frame to kill someone doesn't seem frightening, so much as confusing."

","We watched this film on the basis of several rave reviews when it first came out. I fail to see why it rated so well. There is spectacular scenery and dramatic camera work. (Although splatters of artificial blood on the camera lens during one of the many violent scenes seem surprisingly sloppy. Nor did the frequent appearance of lens flair serve any artistic purpose as it sometimes can. This was simply careless cinematography.) The whole movie is relentless machismo, one disturbingly violent scene after another and frequent, gratuitous use of the ""F word"" which was not even in the thesaurus of early nineteenth century profanity. If you're intent on watching this appallingly violent, lengthy, sexist and pointless film, turn the sound down and enjoy the scenery. It is the only positive aspect of a very disappointing movie."

"mitchell-ansell","5","1","2","18 April 2017"," Good visuals on an unnecessary movie
","The movie I'm reviewing is called The Revenant. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio and he won an Oscar for this movie. The movie is basically about a pioneer making his way back from a gruesome accident with a bear and tracking down the man who left him (Tom Hardy) for revenge. I thought the movie was pretty average and I didn't get the massive praise it got from both people and critics. I thought that the shots were very pretty and the cinematography was great. But the story was something that should not have been put to screen. The majority of the film was watching Leonardo DiCaprio crawl through the mud and run away from people. The movie stressed the reality of the scenario,by having DiCaprio recover immediately and take a while to heal, showing the harshness of the time and setting. But then they contradict themselves by having him ride off a cliff and survive pretty much unscathed. <br/><br/>I love dialogue in my movies, and this movie did a poor job of delivering meaningful dialogue to the audience. From the beginning you knew who everyone was and nothing surprised you. The dialogue was all either misunderstood by me because of the garbled accents, or the fact that it was essentially meaningless. When there was dialogue of course, as I said before most of the movie is the title character crawling in the mud and surviving brutal conditions.<br/><br/>Overall I thought the movie was good because of the directing and cinematography, but I never really found myself caring about the story or being more invested than I am in any other revenge plot."

","Same guy who directed Birdman -- so the directing is superb, with great camera angles and shots. Very realistic film. I felt like I was watching an excerpt from this Hugh Glass's life, with nice sweeping orchestral music in the background.<br/><br/>Also a good look at the bad history between the white men and native Indians of the west back in the day in America.<br/><br/>But in terms of the plot -- this is one of those rare films whose plot isn't really the main aspect. Like I said earlier, it's more or less a cinematic version of presenting the legendary Hugh Glass's adventure and/or tale of revenge. Same feel like a documentary film or Animal Planet, just featuring a man."

","The Revenant is mostly known as the film that gave Leonardo Dicaprio his long waited Oscar after a career filled with one awesome performance after the other, but it is great and by itself ,even though as for accuracy falls a bit out, however the rest are spotless.<br/><br/>The film follows Hugh Glass and his team as they venture out to the eighteen hundreds West in order to get furs and during their travel they get in to a lot of trouble and he is badly injured (you know how) a member of his team will play dirty for the group to leave him to die in this cold and inhospitable place. Dispute his condition Hugh tries to survive and eventually revenge his mistreatment. And here is where the actors, cinematographers and the directing and writing of Alejandro González Iñárritu go in and make this film a piece of art , with minimal dialogue, beautiful scenes and close to excellent pace.<br/><br/>And of course I have to mentioned Dicaprio of here give it all and then some for with almost zero dialogue manage to carry ,about half of the film alone and I am sure that he and the rest of the team after the end of the shooting the were in desperate need of a warm bath and even I felt cold just by watching the flick. You know that it a good sign when the audience feels what they see in the scene and here it is no exception.<br/><br/>All in all the film rocks, Leo won his Oscar fair and square and definitely watch it if you haven't already ,it is among the great Oscar films and not a Oscar grab, like Crash(2004) , Sheakespaer in Love(1998)."

","The movie starts with certain flashback scenes of the lead actor and then it changes the pace quite drastically. Leo has always been a strong actor throughout his career and this performance was no different. His performance will make you feel as if you are present in front of him i.e.you are actually in the movie and this is a creditable thing from an actor's perspective. All the co-stars have performed beautifully and never even once you will feel that you are watching a movie. You will feel like you are actually watching real life scenes. This movie is made in the most realistic manner and hats off to the screen play. The only thing that I would want to add is that this movie is not suitable for weak minded people and you got to have a strong heart to watch this movie as certain scenes will create disturbing emotions in you. All in all, the film is an experience which takes you on a realistic yet thrilling ride through the woods and will make you hold your breath on many occasions. So, for the people who can watch violence and have a strong heart, you can always watch this movie as the performances of all the actors, the camera work and screenplay are majestic and impressive."

","I can see why The Revenant got nominated for the Oscars. It's beautifully shot with top class actors. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy both stand out in this adventure movie. It's for sure one of Leonardo DiCaprio's best acting performances. Even though for a movie that long there is not excessive much talking you never get bored. Au contrary there are a lot of silent passages that add to the feeling of loneliness in those winter scenery's. There's a lot of grunting from the diverse almost deadly wounds. It all works perfectly well to tell this story of revenge and vengeance. There are some graphic scenes that could make your stomach turn, but that also makes this movie stand out from the rest. You can almost feel the frostbite just by watching it. Tom Hardy plays a stone-cold heartless son of a bitch and those roles fits him the best. A long movie that never seemed long when you're watching it."

","Leonardo DiCaprio gives his all in this survival movie. He walks, then walks some more, and then does a bit more walking. If an actor putting himself through hell equals awards glory, then DiCaprio deserves his name on the trophy for his performance representing a kind of progressive frontier man. Part of the entertainment of watching The Revenant is knowing its cast and crew went through the same crazy conditions and endurance tests the actor went through in the various middles of various uncharted wilderness.<br/><br/>Director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu transports us to another time and place in this depiction of First Nations people. The movie is based on historic fiction, when a fur-trapping expedition in the Midwest gets attacked by a Native American tribe and history gets written in blood. Excellence in art should always be rewarded and Leo sure is in the right role with the right director at the right time."
"ianlouisiana","6","1","2","20 January 2017"," I can respect it,but not enjoy it.
","After all the hype I expected to be overwhelmed by ""The Revenant"" but sadly I wasn't. Yes the scenery was awesome,nature was red and raw in tooth and claw,it was obviously jolly cold and Mr di Caprio struggled manfully wrapped up in a bearskin and spent the night inside a horse and generally suffered for his art but somehow he didn't inspire much sympathy from me. I suspect the film has a more appreciative audience in the United States and Canada where the term ""frontier"" still has some meaning. Regrettably it made me think of the New Christie Minstrels' song ""Four wheels on my wagon"" in a lot of places. Somehow all that snow and freezing water,all that suffering and brutality and ""nature is pure - only man is evil"" stuff whilst not exactly passing me by did leave me unaffected. Yes it was crisply shot,well - lit and the sound was excellent,but the unrelenting evil on display eventually got to me and made me more or less indifferent to Mr Glass's fate. Perhaps I am too sensitive. Whatever,""The Revenant"" is obviously worthy of the viewers' respect but it did not induce in me the slightest desire to watch it again."
"Samiam3","6","1","2","19 January 2017"," Leo commands an empty landscape, Overrated survival film
","The Revenant is a strong movie for the first half hour or so and then it reduces to a series of 'greatest hits' moments from survivalist films that we have seen before. This movie is about sixty minutes of material padded to two hours plus, and is too emotionally distant to be worth the endurance that it asks of the viewer.<br/><br/>With that in mind, the film has strong points. This is NOT remotely an award winning performance from Leo Dicaprio, but he is indeed commanding. He is one of those actors who can make himself seem bigger through his physical performance, and Leo has never felt this naturally big before. Tom Hardy also brings some a-game and knows how to be threatening through small nuances in his demeanour. <br/><br/>The Revenant is a well shot movie, making great use of camera work and the same wide lens effects that aided Birdman but the problem is that mostly there is nothing to look at but scenery. Leo wanders through the wilderness for a long time, leaving the audience with nothing but a chilly feeling. The Revenant is meant to be a tale of revenge but there is no sense of drive or character motivation which makes it worth investing in. <br/><br/>It's a clunky, and unmemorable film."

","This is a good film. Its not great but it is good and i would recommend it. It isn't a patch on the book though. The film has very little similiarity to be honest. Apart from him being a trapper and getting mauled and seeking revenge thats it. There are far too many liberties taken with the plot details and back story in my opinion. The worst of these is his son. Typical Hollywood thinking we need to have our emotions tampered with. Also, he doesn't kill fitzgerald and the relationship with bridger is better explored. Reading the book gave me a much better sense of the scope of his injuries and his struggle to overcome them. Also the treatment he received was much better explained. The film gives the impression that all he had to stay in bed a bit. The book was much more of a struggle and his crawl to redemption was far more arduous.<br/><br/>All in all its a decent film but a bit of a disappointment. Like the title says, read the book!"

After seeing what Glass goes through in the first third of the film you really feel his struggle and determination.<br/><br/>The story is good, although a fairly simple one and is based on real life events. There is nothing complex here just a good survival/revenge tale which I think is all is needed here.<br/><br/>A lot of reviews I've read say that nothing much happens in this film, but I have to disagree. It is a long film and a good portion is spent watching a man struggle, but it never becomes boring as you feel you are right there with him thanks to the amazing camera work. You also meet new characters along the way and there are a few tense action scenes littered through to break it up.<br/><br/>Since the cinema I have watched it 4 more times and my opinion hasn't changed. It looks amazing, sounds incredible (you need a good home theater to appreciate it) and is very well acted and told.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is awesome as well<br/><br/>The Revenent will stick in my mind as a classic film<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and watch it if you haven't already"

I enjoyed all the various obstacles placed in Leo's way on his journey back home. It became a perverse sort of enjoyment after a while. And the action scenes all have a thrilling quality to them that felt visceral and real and painful. If it took itself a little less seriously and just embraced its greatest qualities it could have been a wild ride akin to Mad Max.<br/><br/>For me, in the end, I think it fails completely with the father/son relationship, the relationship upon which the whole movie relies.

","This movie would score higher if it wasn't for the fact that one of the key characters did not appear to be speaking English throughout the film (ironic given his heritage). Someone please give Tom Hardy a voice coach - he rivals the eternally mumbling Casey Affleck in this otherwise overly long but worthwhile film. The cinematography is excellent throughout and the special effects (with the notable exception of the infamous dead horse scene) are extremely well done. It looks quite seamless when the hero hears a rumbling sound and we see from his perspective a distant avalanche that helps create the sense of place and isolation in the film.

","First things first... That bear attack, how did they shoot it? I mean, was that bear real? Is Leo aware that; ""Hey, I'm just shooting a movie, here, right""... Because, that scene, gives meaning to this films title. It was a graphic, not gory, yet a realistic depiction of a bear attack. Well done Alejandro and Emmanuel.<br/><br/>Next, lets - for a moment, imagine that the bear attack didn't live up to expectations, of erecting a revenant; that gutting of a horse, for him to lay dormant inside it, just to survive, surely would've been worth a look, as a substitute title, The Abdominoplasty, aka, The Tummy Tuck.<br/><br/>The Revenant, was, stunning, however, it's pace was... frequently, slow-moving, and it lost you a little. Also, the mixture of the languages and civilizations was, a bit confusing at times. On top of that, the death of Glass's son, didn't move me, and it felt a bit contrived and orchestrated... Which means, I couldn't fully appreciate Glass's thirst for revenge, and the motivation it gave him, to rise again.<br/><br/>And, was this Leonardo's best performance? For me, not at all. Was it an Oscar performance... Yes. Was it worth the win... I don't know. And Tom, there were points where he'd sound like Bane, and look like his character Eames, from Inception - thanks to his mannerisms, but, I do love that he decided to take on a role that's this different from his previous works.<br/><br/>For me, this film is not quite an 8/10... The most spectacular scene - being the bear attack, happens 28 minutes into the film... Then thereafter, we have 2 more hours, that need to be given reason... In some parts, they succeed, but in others, Alejandro lost me, left me for dead, haha, for a while. Also, the most purposeful scene, didn't captivate me, so... 7.7/10 it is."
"notafanof","8","1","2","17 July 2016"," An endurance test
","I've seen this film three times, and have realized that it seems like it gets longer with subsequent viewings. This is definitely a theater film as the small screen does not do it justice. It's brilliantly realized and atmospheric in the theater, but kind of a snoozer on the couch. The film opens with an exhilarating battle scene as Aboriginals barrel down on a group of fur trappers. This fight scene is fluid and organic and appears to have been shot in a single take. It sets a gritty tone for this film and the rest if it's run time holds nothing back. A Bear mauling about 45 minutes into this film is a standout scene and a true technical marvel to behold. However, there are long stretches of this film where Leo is crawling in the muck and moaning like a whale that really grates on the senses and can test the viewers patience. The main issue I have with this film is that it is an immense exercise of style over substance. Take away the directorial flair, the technical achievements, the massive scope, and what you have is a pretty convention revenge film. The effort is certainly appreciated, and is felt throughout the film. But, to view this film on the couch will take a lot of effort from the viewer not to get up and do something that is less strenuous. Watching someone with serious injuries gasp and crawl in the muck for an hour is surely not what some folks will view as entertaining. If you missed the chance to see this film in the theater note that it is a long film that feels a half hour longer on the small screen. A merely good film at home, but a great film in the theater. You will feel the main character's struggles more in a dark theater that enhances the film's fantastic sound design and crisp cinematography. The opening fight scene, the fantastic directing, the bear mauling, the acting (especially from a grizzled Tom Hardy), and the ending are definitely worth giving this film a look if you can stomach some of the more wince worthy parts and the exhausting run-time. I was not a fan of Alejandro's Birdman , but I can say that he at least deserves one of the three Oscars he has won. A truly brilliant director with a great eye for visuals. 8 out of ten for the breathtaking experience it gave me in the theater. Be warned, this film does not have much lasting appeal,as three viewing and 450 minutes of precious time is enough spent on relatively surface dwelling film that could be well scratched with just one sitting."

But they were more focused on making a beautiful film and highlight the Leonardo DiCaprio, again don't get me wrong Leonardo DiCaprio was without a doubt the worthy winner of the Oscar.<br/><br/>I liked the movie as a cinematic piece of art but not as a Good Movie, because not always the good movies gain the deserved awards but they get the title of ""Good movies""."

","Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his team are on a fur trading expedition when Glass finds himself badly injured after being mauled by a bear - this is after a subsequent attack by a bunch of Indians. As a result of his injuries Glass is barely alive and is left in the care of two members of his hunting team John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and Bridger (Will Poulter). However, Fitzgerald has no intention of looking after Glass and leaves him for dead (after killing Glass' son in front of him). This prompts Glass to track down Fitzgerald and seek retribution against him.<br/><br/>The Revenant is another in a long line of 'big films' that has been hyped as being a brilliant film (its current IMDb rating of 8.1 seems to follow this trend). Whilst it's far from awful, I think it's both inaccurate and misleading to represent it as being a flawless piece of work.<br/><br/>In order not to appear to be too negative I'll begin with a few positives; firstly this is a very handsome looking film; the bleak, cold cinematography makes the film look and feel realistic. Some of the special effects are also very good - the bear attack on DiCaprio was one of the highlights of the film and again was so realistic that for a moment you may actually believe that he's fighting against a real bear. The brutality of the picture and its sheer rawness means that it's a film that you rarely want to take your eyes away from and much of DiCaprio's story arc sees him having to survive against the elements with little more than his instincts and knowledge and again it made his journey interesting if nothing else. The performances in this film are also excellent; DiCaprio is an actor who has steadily improved over time and this is easily one of his best performances and likewise Tom Hardy is also excellent and to his credit his American accent isn't bad either.<br/><br/>So yes there's a lot to praise this film for, but there are clearly some problems here that need addressing; firstly we come to the pacing and although the first 15 minutes are pretty exciting and well-staged Inarritu seems to take his foot off the gas after the opening battle sequence and fills the first hour up with the huntsman squabbling and dragging DiCaprio around in the snow - OK there is a bit more to it than that, but not much more if I'm being honest. The second problem lies with the running time; at its core this is a revenge thriller and I personally feel that if they're tightly plotted revenge thrillers can be wrapped up in 90 minutes or so - quite why a 150 minute run time has been assigned to a film with a plot as basic as this is a mystery to me? This results in The Revenant being chocked full of lengthy scenes which add very little to the film and ultimately make the film a bit boring at times.<br/><br/>One thing Inarritu does seem to get right is the tone of the film; it does have some brutal violence and it does contain some stomach churning scenes, but these things are included at the appropriate moments and many of these scenes do serve a purpose (in other words these scenes are included when the narrative dictates rather than simply to shock or induce nausea).<br/><br/>Ultimately The Revenant is worth your time because when it's good its very good, but at 150 minutes it's too long and I personally feel that if it had been more tightly plotted and had the narrative been a bit stronger than it would have been an excellent film rather than merely being a good film."
"takmike-08995","5","1","2","5 June 2016"," Not for Oscar
","The world wanted Leonardo Di Caprio take an Oscar. I can't say he didn't deserve one, but he's played far better and more difficult roles such as at Shutter Island or Wolf of Wall Street. However, the academy gave him one, in my opinion, not because he totally deserved it but in order to calm and appease us all. Now, about the movie. The whole story threw him obstacles and hardships that made me feel sorry for him and not congratulate him for his acting skill, which has shown us in the past that is very big. Nice plans and photographs, but unfortunately that's the only thing that I can find to say some good words. The whole story was predictable and closed very fast. The screenplay took to long showing us Di Caprio shouting and falling and eating whatever he found than it should and concluded very abruptly. Never the less, Tom Hardy played extremely well and that boosts up the average. As for Iñárritu I didn't like what he said at the Oscar awards and made the whole thing worst for him. To sum up:<br/><br/>Di Caprio = Can do a lot better, Tom Hardy = Very good again, Photography = Very good, Screenplay = Predictable with many copies<br/><br/>5/10"
"rasmusthompson","Null","1","2","27 May 2016"," Awful Comedy
","I was excited for this film. DiCaprio's last film, The Wolf of Wall Street, was absolutely hilarious and this severely disappointed. The only time I laughed was when they poked their tongues out to catch the snow because it reminded me of childhood nostalgia saying ""Na, na, na, na, na,"" when someone was chasing you. They had all the best jokes in the trailer, the bear scene wasn't even funny, Baloo was so much better in the Jungle Book. DiCaprio was so dull not even bringing any laughs to the hilarious situation especially when his son dies Monty Python style. Furious 7 was a better comedy then this pile of trash and Furious 7 wasn't even that funny apart from Vin Diesel's Shrek face. Tom Hardy's voice was very funny but there was no good lines of dialogue to be found. There was too much blood and the bear attack scene was too realistic. I could do with some light comedy movie I don't understand what tone you were aiming for. Are you slapstick or dark humour, cos I couldn't tell. Don't Hail Caesar me. Get your tone's together. 5/10 because of that childhood nostalgia factor if not for that probably a 3. Don't even bother with the Revenant. By Ride Along 2 on Bluray twice because that is masterful film-making."

","Don't even half to watch the full movie to know how terrible it is. Looking at the trailer it seems almost unrecognizable from the book (which i happened to read in two days). The main idea of the story was him being a ruthless fighter but it changed the whole prospective and added in characters of all sorts that weren't needed. First of all he does not even have a son and his girlfriend (not wife) died while at sea who was not at all aboriginal. This was supposed to be based on a real mans story and they totally disregarded that and changed his history. They most likely used this to add a love interest or some sort of positive ethnicity image (since a lot of the natives were portrayed as bad) it was unnecessary and just sad. It took away the whole idea of proving himself to the people that left him to die. Not surviving only to get revenge for his son and wife. It erased the whole meaning and i suggest giving a book a try. Its a whole lot better then this s**t."

","The Revenant is a difficult film to watch and buy the time the movie ended I was wondering how any man could survive in the mountains of US for a single day in the 1800s, forget weeks and months.<br/><br/>Thats the power of film making and story telling Iñárritu has and it hit me multiple times while watching this film. Right from the 1st scene when Glass's contingent of men are attacked by the Indians to he being attacked by the grizzly bear to him surviving and finally extracting revenge, its unbelievable and I was awe struck.<br/><br/>The story is simple..a tale of survival and revenge. The difference is Iñárritu and his two men...Di Caprio and Hardy.<br/><br/>Hardy is virtually unrecognisable. After watching him in Madmax Fury Road earlier, he plays an opposite character of a brooding pessimist man who becomes the accidental villain. His make up that includes a half bald hair is superb and he puts on the perfect accent that I forget he is British. I was wondering how he missed receiving the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. <br/><br/>And Mr. Di Caprio. I hate to say this but it seems that Revenant is a tailor made role for an Oscar which he won with ease. Its an outstanding performance and you feel his pain and his struggle to survive. Like Hardy, he is unrecognisable under the huge beard and sinks his teeth into the role. <br/><br/>Di Caprio has done better performances according to me in films like Wolf of Wall Street and Inception. But an Oscar is an Oscar.<br/><br/>Another stand out in the film is the Cinematography. Forget the blood and pain and focus on the scenes, it seems like the scene is painted. Some of the shots are like from some American tourism brochure.

"billysellio","10","1","2","5 May 2016"," One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen
","I was overall thrilled by this movie. I loved the premise and for the most part, the way they structured it. I thought the performances were all earnest and believable. I never really found anyone to be inadvertently calling attention to their performances nor under-performing. Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson especially stood out to me despite Hardy's usual over-mumbles in the beginning. Here it's more appropriate than anything he's done before, so I won't discount him for that.<br/><br/>The cinematography was, as you'd expect, stunning. I loved almost every shot. Every time I would see an opportunity to do something cool with the camera, I'd be delighted to see them do exactly that, or more often than not, surprise me with something much cooler than I could have thought of. I felt that they weren't quite able to make some of the longer sequences as seamless as in Birdman, but I was never especially bothered by it - just thought it noteworthy.<br/><br/>Beyond the technical wizardry behind the awesome cinematography, I loved how purposeful everything was in juxtaposing the unrelenting consistency of nature against the seemingly important struggles of a few men. While clearly the Alexa 65 and Lubezki's committal to natural light yielded some wonderful colors within his extremely precise frames, I think as usual he excelled most with movement - both of the camera and the subjects within the shot. Everything has purpose and heightens the emotions of the moment. The opening sequence was my favorite part in terms of how it was shot. It may have been a tad flashy, but it worked for me.<br/><br/>The action was dope.<br/><br/>The CGI bear was dope.<br/><br/>The pacing was effective for me. The first act just thrusts you into their world and all of its chaos, whereas the middle of the film is quite drawn out and moves slowly, despite its incessant tension. The third act felt a little inconsistent, perhaps just as a result of the exhausting preceding events...but only just so.<br/><br/>On to my problems with The Revenant. I thought the editing was at a few moments just a little too pushy; specifically, the long holds on nearby nature at the end of many sequences. I think some of them overstayed their welcome by a second or two, and maybe they could have pulled out one. That's a nitpick, though, and I might change my mind upon second viewing.<br/><br/>Hugh Glass. Like many others have stated, his character is a bit underdeveloped, as is his relationship with his son. I was actually surprised at how late in the movie his son was killed - a pleasant surprise, at that, as I really did feel for their relationship despite their minimal dialogue. I do wish the trailer had omitted that plot point, as it would have been interesting to see as a surprise instead of dreading it for the first hour. This is also a rather minor qualm.<br/><br/>The expression of Glass's hunger for revenge just didn't seem quite there for me throughout his struggles to survive. This makes sense, as it works with his focus on surviving since that is what matters in the moment. However, I just didn't quite feel that he was motivated by revenge to survive. Sure, he wrote ""Fitzgerald killed my son"" a few times when he thought he might die, but I never saw that emotion in his performance, the camera-work, or much else.<br/><br/>Like many others, my biggest problem with this film is its attempts to reach for something surreal and metaphorical in a very direct, hamfisted manner. I'm referring, of course, to the dream sequences of Glass's wife and son, and the melodramatic manner in which they're delivered.<br/><br/>This entire sequence is redundant and out of place in a film that already says so much through more subtle imagery. Everything that is conveyed through these dreams could have illustrated through editing and camera-work - and it largely is, making this even more disappointing. These sequences don't bring anything good to the film, and they are even used to wrap up the conclusion, when in reality the focus of his struggle was regarding his son and himself. His wife didn't need to be excluded entirely, but she should not have been this strange motif boasting references to films like The Holy Mountain.<br/><br/>Most of this film's elements seemed to ride the border of trying too hard to create a masterpiece, yet they push just far enough to wow audiences in the right way. Unfortunately, the random absurdity included here disrupts that by wow-ing audiences in the wrong way.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd probably give this a 9.4/10. It's one of my favorites of the year and I had a blast watching it. I understand its mixed reviews, but I'm not bothered much by it's few flaws. For me, it lived up to the hype."""

Glass was left for dead numerous times, but despite his shriveling odds he was able to overcome death and survive. <br/><br/>John Fitzgerald, played by Tom Hardy, could not have been controlled any more by greed and betrayal. He should have never turned his back on Glass as he did. Because of that, Fitzgerald had trapped himself without realizing it.<br/><br/>This is truly one of DiCaprio's best performances.

For starters the way the whole movie looked was breathtaking and it's Oscar wins proved that. The way each scene looks gives you the feel of a cold snowy mountain. A very underrated aspect about this movie is it's visual effects, although they aren't used too often, they are amazing. Some scenes I knew used visual effects, but I still couldn't wrap my mind around how they did it. Now, the film isn't perfect as it can be a little slow at some points, but overall the pacing is used very well since there is a lot of action and a lot of gore (if you're into that). The main problem and really only problem I had with the movie was some character back story was confusing and it didn't really focus on back story.

","It's an interesting story for a movie. They spent a lot of money to make it, and had Leonardo DiCaprico and a truly great actor in Tom Hardy in key roles. But sadly, the movie is ruined by a hateful political agenda.<br/><br/>The movie portrays the French as evil rapists. The Native Americans are portrayed as unhappy victims of evil white men. <br/><br/>There is a scene of redcoats killing killing Hugh Glass' Pawnee wife, but it is doubtful that Glass ever had a Native American wife, and the redcoats were not in South Dakota at that time in the 19th century. History was altered here to defame the British. <br/><br/>The Pawnee were never enemies of the British, French nor Americans during the 19th century, although they were often attacked by the Lakota. The French did not raid villages and slaughter all the Native Americans. History has been changed here with racist intent to defame the French. <br/><br/>In the historical record, Glass was mauled by the bear in early summer, not winter. And some of the locations chosen were ridiculous. For example the forest around Squamish, BC, Canada is nothing like South Dakota, where there are no mountains, just a few hills. I see Pacific Rainforest vegetation in the first half-hour: Western Hemlocks, Western Red Cedars, Douglas Firs and Sword Ferns. The movie could have easily been shot in some part of Canada that looks more like dry, grassy South Dakota."
"ericrnolan","10","1","2","10 April 2016"," ""The Revenant"" (2015) changed the way that I see movies.
","""The Revenant"" (2015) changed the way that I see movies. This utterly immersive, jaw-droppingly gorgeous period thriller is easily one of the best films I've ever seen, and I plan to see it again, soon. I'd rate it a perfect 10.<br/><br/>It's a visual masterpiece. Its cinematography renders its mountains, valleys and plains both dreamlike and lucid, and its action is unflinchingly visceral. Shot mostly in Alberta, Canada (standing in for 1823 Montana and South Dakota), the film's visuals are more stunning than anything I've ever seen. You truly do feel that ""you are there."" But ""there"" is an absolutely brutal 19th century middle American winter wilderness. It's fatally dangerous, both with its unforgiving elements and with the human violence that seems to erupt casually and constantly over its land and resources — not to mention bloody retribution among groups and individuals. This isn't a movie for the faint of heart. I won't spoil the subject of its gut-wrenching action sequences for fear of spoilers — most of these sequences arrive as frightening surprises, thanks to Alejandro G. Inarritu's expert direction. It is this juxtaposition of beauty and brutality that define the movie.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, an American trapper who begins as one of the seemingly few characters that do not quickly resort to unnecessary violence, prejudice or revenge. He later does seek vengeance for his son's death against fellow trapper John Fitzgerald, played by Tom Hardy. (Glass was a real frontiersman who was the subject of Michael Punke's 2002 biography, ""The Revenant."" But a cursory Google search suggests to me that this is not actually ""a true story;"" I think of it as loosely based historical fiction.) Like DiCaprio and Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter also excel in their supporting roles. (Gleeson seems to specialize in playing reluctant innocents; I remember him from his skilled performance as the gentle young computer genius in last year's outstanding science fiction thriller, ""Ex Machina."")<br/><br/>But the main star of ""The Revenant"" is the setting itself, beautifully shot by Emmanuel Lebezki and masterfully employed by Inarritu as a kind of character unto itself in the story. It's lovely. I've never seen a movie like this. And while I'm no film connoisseur, or even a genuine critic, I've seen a lot of good ones.<br/><br/>The direction most reminds me of Francis Ford Coppola's work in 1979's ""Apocalypse Now."" I was also reminded of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" (1980) — that was a film that also depicted threatening snowscapes as dreamlike and eerily beautiful. There was one shot near the end, following DiCaprio's vengeful hero on his path through immense firs on either side — it reminded me a lot of Jack Nicholson's murderous Jack Torrance on his path through the hellish hedge labyrinth.<br/><br/>There is also a central action set piece involving an attack on one group of characters on another — it actually reminded me of Oliver Stone's work in ""Platoon"" (1986). Like Stone's finale, the battle is staged so that the viewers have no sense of which direction the attack is coming from, paralleling the experience of the confused defenders. There are countless long tracking shots throughout this film, with fewer cuts — and amazing circular surrounding shots of the action. I've read that Inarritu actually had to transport cranes to his mountaintop shooting locations in order to execute those.<br/><br/>If you had to find a flaw with ""The Revenant,"" I suppose you could complain that its story and characters are thin. We know little more about DiCaprio's Glass beyond that he is competent, patient and slow to fight — then merciless and unrelenting in seeking justice. Poulter's Jim Bridger is loyal, but not as strong as the hero. Hardy's Fitzgerald is a greedy, opportunistic bully whose murder of an innocent drives the plot. That's  little more than the plot and characters of a lot of throwaway westerns, isn't it? (I've indeed seen this movie categorized as a western in reviews. That's technically correct, I guess, but it feels too unique to pigeonhole that way.)<br/><br/>You could easily read the movie for moral ambiguity. There are the obvious issues connected with revenge, of course, underscored by a final shot in which one character appears to break the fourth wall. I found myself wondering about Glass' compatriots. Yes, it is Fitzgerald who acts villainously, but all of Glass' fellow trappers also consign him to death by abandoning him after his injuries. I do understand that they feel they can't survive themselves if they try to carry him back to their staging area at Fort Kiowa. But  is what they do ""right?"" What would you or I do?<br/><br/>I think I am coming too close here to revealing too much about the film. The best way to experience ""The Revenant"" is to walk into it knowing little about it. I strongly recommend you do so."
"BirdmanT7","Null","1","2","11 April 2016"," very overrated and confused movie?
","I only went to see this film because of the director ""Iñárritu"" and it was very disappointing. It started out with a good premise, it felt like an art film at times, it reminded me a lot of ""Terrence Malick"" films, one in particular ""The New World"". However, this quest to revenge is where I think the film failed. There was a lot of great scenes with the main character Glass having visions and memories of his wife; that could have been to reflect on finding some kind of forgiveness. The other Indian ""Elk Dog"" who was also looking for his own revenge of his daughter could have been explored further to parallel to Glass's revenge of Fitzgerald; where they could have met and maybe the exchange of their meeting would have had an impact on Glass to reflect.<br/><br/>I know no book is ever translated to the screen exactly the same, I just thought this film had the potential to add more depth together with the visuals to the arc of the story. Glass was helped by the Indian who also suffered a lost, then Glass rescued another Indian girl who was getting raped and those two characters alone could have had more of exchange with Glass. The film relied way too much on visuals that character. Glass's journey is an odyssey in itself, like Homer's odyssey, but in this odyssey ""The Revenant"" is an empty one at that, where the film didn't present you characters that parallel, cross and effect's Glass's character for him to maybe reflect his quest to revenge. That's where the movie felt short. So yes people rave about the visuals and Di Caprio's performance, which again I had problems with because I don't think he is a good actor either; just way way too over rated, he is like a parody as an actor. I would have picked maybe either Jeremy Renner, Christian Bale or even Tom Hardy for the role of Glass, I just see more range from those actors than DiCaprio; he is like a boy pretending to be a man. <br/><br/>The film continued on this relentless and unrealistic path where Glass survived the impossible, first to survive a bear attack is one thing but to live through the wilderness winter ice cold weather with the injuries he had, no food, then to swim down the river, then jump off a cliff with a horse and survive that again?. I had already lost interest midway into the movie, where its all about Glass survival's to avenge his son's death. There was no arc in the story for this character to maybe pause to question his revenge, it would have had more of impact if Glass had found forgiveness for Fitzgerald through his journey, maybe through all the visions of his wife, maybe by his interactions with the Indian who helped him whom had also lost his wife or Elk Dog. Maybe a better ending would have been once Glass found Fitzgerald he had realized his revenge was futile?. Maybe if Fitzgerald had ran into the Indians later and got killed by them instead, it would have been karma catching up to him, not being half stabbed to death by hands of Glass.<br/><br/>Even Glass himself said right at the end: ""Revenge is in God's hands, not mine"", which debunked and contradicted all his actions. Where did Glass found God in the entire film that he suddenly had a epiphany when he sees the Indians and let them kill Fitzgerald.?. It didn't matter if ElK Dog gave the final blow to end Fitzgerald life; he would have died bleeding as he was floating down the river.<br/><br/>So many people praise this film for all its acting, photography, direction, etc, but those are all a disguise and a camouflage to cover up flat story. What is it you get walking away after watching this film?..what's the message here?. That revenge is the answer and it will bring you peace?."

","To be honest, I was not very interested in the film when I started watching it, and the trailer did not look all that engaging either. Though I do still think the first half of the film is a little boring, it was actually quite interesting. It depicts a different era, with a way of living that I am not much aware of, and so was quite an eye-opener. <br/><br/>I just have to mention first of all, that the cinematography is absolutely phenomenal. Emmanuel Lubezki certainly knows how to position the camera, and along with Iñárritu's directing, manages to produce an exceptionally beautiful film. The shots of nature are so breathtaking that I feel like the film could have just been a documentary about the attractiveness of Canada (and Argentina). Indeed, during the first half of the film, it seemed like the appeal of the nature scenes far outweighed that of the narrative. <br/><br/>The story is based on the true story of Hugh Glass, though of course through a Hollywood-ised version. (I spent a good amount of time reading through the trivia page on IMDb.) From what I gather, there is a lot more anger and confrontations with other groups in this film that was not experienced by the real Hugh Glass. Though I have been saying that the narrative was not engaging, it did get better as the film progressed. Do note that the film is primarily focused on the aesthetics and not the narrative. <br/><br/>Speaking of aesthetics, I've already mentioned the amazing cinematography, but the visual effects are absolutely stunning as well. There is ton load of gruesome scenes and depictions of violence in this film, and they are all done with so much detail it's amazing. It is almost too hard to believe that what happens on screen didn't happen in real life. The bear attack -though seemed a little long, was absolutely chilling to watch. There is another scene involving another animal further on in the movie, and that too is unbelievably realistic. Adding to that, the make-up crew did a fantastic job at creating the wounds and scars. Seriously, everything that contributed to the visuals of this film supported each other into creating this visual masterpiece. <br/><br/>Last of all, I am sure all of you know by now that Leonardo DiCaprio finally won an Oscar for this film, and rightly so. Though it did not seem like much of a performance at first, I understand now why he won it for portraying this character. The sheer intensity of raw emotion that he manages to convey, transcends the screen and brings so much feeling into his role. I really applaud his dedication to acting (apparently he ate a raw bison liver even though he's vegetarian- check the trivia page). Additionally, Tom Hardy gives a great supporting performance. I did not even recognize him for some time, and was extremely shocked to realize that he was in the film. His accent sounds so natural, and leaves no trace of his British origins. Gleeson is believable as the Captain, and I was surprised to see him in this as well, since he is mostly in romantic films. It was pleasant to see some of these major movie stars in roles not normally their style. <br/><br/>Overall, a visual masterpiece with amazing acting. The narrative was intriguing at best, and did feel convenient at times. Plus, the beginning was confusing, and I would have liked more of a background into Glass' life prior to the exhibition."

","As I anticipated this film had me filled with worry I didn't believe it could live up to the greatness of Birdman, Alejandro G. Iñárritu's previous film. Could the hype of this movie crush it since it's production problems were so publicized? Thankfully The Revenant is one of the best movies of 2015. I was floored by how amazing everything in the film was. It's the one of the most immaculate films to ever be released.<br/><br/>The Revenant stars Leonardo DiCaprio who plays frontiersman Hugh Glass who is left for dead by the crazy Tom Hardy after being mauled by a bear. He goes on a trek to find Hardy and get his revenge. It's no shocker that The Revenant is one of the most beautifully shot films my eyes have witnessed. Everything felt vibrant and pristine from the Woodlands to the Snow that covered the entire frame. Emmanuel Lubezki always brings his A game when it comes to creating beautiful images, even when it's for trash like The Cat in the Hat. This is by far the best work from him I've seen and the man has done Gravity and Birdman! He keeps stepping up and makes every frame a painting.<br/><br/>The story is a gritty revenge tale that holds no punches. I haven't been this tense in a theater since Mad Max Fury Road. It made me perspire at some of the scenes, especially the bear mauling scene. That scene could have been ruined for the fact that the bear was CGI but given that the rest of the film was practical gives the bear realism to it. Iñárritu's direction is flawless in this movie. You feel Leo's struggle and you have his blood lust as he tracks him down. He's the 2nd best actor of 2015 (Sam Jackson is still the best in his amazing role as Marquis Warren in The Hateful Eight, another brutal movie set in the snow.)<br/><br/>While it has all these amazing things there are some minor problems with the movie. There'd be times where a character's mouth wasn't synced up to their lips. You could say that's a nitpick and it kind of is. The rest of the film is a technical marvel that impressed me a lot. I wouldn't be extremely mad if this movie won Best Picture at the Oscars. (I am actually kind of mad because Carol wasn't nominated!)<br/><br/>The Revenant is the most tense film I've seen in 2016. This film won't be for everyone but it's shot so beautifully and told so tensely that I can't recommend it enough. While Leo's performance isn't his best it's definitely a performance of anguish and perseverance."
"duncanbourne","8","1","2","1 April 2016"," One long bad day
","In some ways this feels like Mike Leigh does a western. It is unremittingly grim. DiCaprio is definitely not having a good day, good week or even possibly a good month. It goes bad from day one with an attack in the opening scenes and doesn't get much better for him. Especially after the famed bear attack! However this hard-to-kill man takes us on an epic journey through some wonderful mountain scenery and the story, plainly told, develops to a suitable climax. DiCaprio deserves an Oscar for shear bloody endurance in the face of some incredibly harsh conditions alone! It did not look like a very comfortable acting job and he bore it with great fortitude. It had a great frontier feel and I felt for the hard lives of those who lived through those times. If I have one quibble it felt over long and a bit more editing would have produced a tighter film. But that said it must take its place in the hall of classic westerns."

"MaxHaydon1994","8","1","2","29 March 2016"," Scenes of Serene Scenery
","I will forever remember this film as the film that brought the biggest injustice in cinematic history to its justifiable conclusion. Of course I'm referring to Leonardo Di Caprio's recent win at the Oscars. The film itself I found to be more of an artsy film then one with a particularly thrilling story line so anyone who is more interested in a twisty turny action packed plot then watching a period drama perhaps this film isn't for you. This film makes the most of Blu Ray however with beautiful scenes of serene scenery if you'll excuse the tongue twisting alliteration. If what you're looking for from a film is a feast for the eyes then look no further, however I have spoken to a few people who lost interest 40 minutes or less into the film and that's probably down to the lingering pace. I believe it's a hit and miss film, for me it was a hit, but I can see why it missed some people, I know that not everyone has the tolerance for sitting through a long film that doesn't excite them. To sum up, The revenant is a visually stimulating film with some great performances and is only let down by the films lengthy periods of dialogue in which I felt the story wasn't moving forward quick enough. The film does however have a strong message about man's relationship with the earth and there's something quite beautiful about that being visually translated into film."

","The Revenant is a treat to watch visually, for me the film fell flat when it came to the very slow pacing. The film throws a lot at you in a very short amount of time and nothing else important happens until the very end, I think the 2 and a half hour run time is far too long. Another problem I had with the film was the characters. I didn't find myself invested in any of them. Besides Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy's characters everyone else felt wooden. My favorite part of the movie was the visuals, all of the naturally lit scenes are beautiful and the CGI bear is so good it looks real. Overall I respect the work that went into the film but this is not one I will be revisiting."
"DavidLindahl","8","1","2","23 March 2016"," Man vs wild and beauty vs cruelness
","The director Alejandro González Iñárritu is back with The Revenant. After the success of Birdman, he returns with the real life story about the frontiersman Hugh Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Glass is left for dead in the wild and is forced to fight for his survival and at the same time he swears revenge on those who left him for dead. The Revenant is a renowned film, partly due to the difficulties during the making of it, but also because many feels it is finally time for DiCaprio to get his well deserved Oscar.<br/><br/>The Revenant is incredibly beautiful, shot with only natural light. The film crew practiced the takes during the day, and shot them later when the light was perfect with only a few hours to spare. Iñárritu's demanding style and the different weather conditions, caused according to the rumors, many to leave the film. Perhaps understandable but nevertheless the result is stunning. Iñárritu's long takes and tracking camera movements are consistent. He rather shows us the action with brutal realism, than enforce it with fast cutting. Brutal realism really is the right word for The Revenant. Our eyes are not spared of anything, even if a hand gets cut in half or a person shot through the stomach. It really feels as though we are right in the middle of the film, rather than an audience watching from a platform.<br/><br/>The Revenant is to me a man vs wild film. Other films, such as Deliverence, Aguirre, the Wrath of God and Into the Wild comes to mind. Terrence Malick's nature influences are visible. At the same time as the film is incredibly beautiful, it is also extremely brutal. In one scene we watch enchanting landscape and northern lights, but in the next we also see how cruel nature can be. Next to DiCaprio, Tom Hardy plays an Oscar nominated supporting role as the bad John Fitzgerald. The Revenant is really worth your time and truly something out of the ordinary. Prepare yourselves for a dramatic movie about how man and natures, cruel and beautiful paths cross. I grade it an 8."
"T-Dawg210","9","1","2","23 March 2016"," A well-made beautiful movie
","Finally Leonardo Dicaprio wins an award for Best Actor in Oscars and the Golden Globe Award for best actor. After watching this movie, I realized that this movie had great cinematography. Alejandro González Iñárritu definitely made the visuals of this movie very pleasing for the audience's eyes! Alejandro definitely is a unique director and just like what Dicaprio said, this movie was really one of a kind. <br/><br/>This historical/survival/revenge drama was taken place in the Canadian wilderness and according to Alejandro, it was extremely difficult to shoot this film because the cast and crew had been filming it for 6 months. You might wonder why it took so long to finish filming for this movie, but that's because the director decided to use all natural light. No wonder the visuals were beautiful! In addition, I really liked how the director decided to portray the transitions. In most of the scenes, the transitions would just show the mountains, trees, river, etc. and showed nature's pristine beauty. Also just like Birdman, there was this one particular scene I vividly remember and it was when Dicaprio was trying to hide from the Native Amecans and the camera applied the 180 Degree Rule, and the camera spun around 180 degrees. <br/><br/>Instead of going on describing how awesome the visuals are, I also want to talk about the acting. The acting was no doubt really good. Leonardo Dicaprio did well, but Tom Hardy, Will Poulter, and Dohmnall Gleeson's acting was incredible too. You know that the movie is good when everyone's acting is phenomenal.<br/><br/>Moreover, Dicaprio doesn't have that much line, but you can feel his emotions through his breathing. As you can tell, this movie is more of a kinesthetic type sort of movie. You can literally feel how Dicaprio felt every time he was gasping for air. It was filled with anger, agony, and sadness. It was painful to watch because the acting felt so realistic. Even at one point, the camera lens were filled with Dicaprio's mouth mist, which I thought was really cool.<br/><br/>The movie was gory, but it felt different compared to Saw and other thriller-gory movies. One of the most memorable scene was the bear scene. Dicaprio gets brutally attacked by a bear and gets nearly killed. They show all the scratch and bite marks and it looks so painful. In addition, there was this scene when Dicaprio drinks water and the water leaks out of his throat. Finally, the most mind- blowing scene was when he opens up the horse's stomach and takes out the premature horse babies and goes inside the horse in order to not freeze to death. (Literally OMG) <br/><br/>During the movie, Dicaprio would sometimes see a vision of his dead wife and son and at the end, it was really sad because after Dicaprio accomplishes his revenge by letting Tom Hardy die, now he has nothing to hold on to because he has accomplished his mission. So in the final scene, the wife looks at Dicaprio and turns away... :(<br/><br/>Anyways I think the director and actors did well and even though the plot is simple, this is more of a feel-type movie. <br/><br/>94.5/100 (A)"
"l_rawjalaurence","6","1","2","8 March 2016"," Lazily Plotted Visual Extravaganza
","Alejandro G. Iñárritu's film has Oscar nominations written all over it. The film begins with a bloody conflict between a group of fur trappers and a marauding bunch of native Indians; Emmanuel Lubezki's dazzling photography not only captures its bloodiness but sets it against the washed-out colors of a barren landscape, making us painfully aware of how the elements remain indifferent to human activity. The standards of cinematography are excellent throughout: Lubezki is particularly fond of the lengthy panning shot in which the human characters are depicted as mere specks on landscapes that almost seem to swallow them up.<br/><br/>And then there is the stellar central performance of Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass. He does not have many lines, but director Iñárritu concentrates on his sufferings as he quite literally rises from the dead on at least two occasions while trying his best to cope with the exigencies of a harsh winter. There are some memorable moments - for example, when Glass takes the guts out of a dead horse and crawls inside its corpse, thereby creating a cocoon to protect himself against the snow. In another sequence he manages to evade a posse of native Indians by concealing himself against a river bank, and then swimming out towards the rapids. Although buffeted by an apparently inexorable tide, he manages to cling on to some driftwood and thereby ensure his survival. We have to admire the actor's courage as he (or his stunt doubles) subject themselves to a series of almost unendurable tests of physical and mental courage. It is hardly surprising that DiCaprio won the Best Actor Oscar at the 2016 ceremonies.<br/><br/>But lush photography and stellar performances do not necessarily make a great movie. THE REVENANT is 156 minutes long; the plot unfolds at a leisurely (some might say almost a snail's) pace, with plenty of attention given to the central conflict between Glass and his arch-rival Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). The first half of the movie offers a convincing depiction of the trappers' existence, and how they struggle to survive while trying to make a buck. Unfortunately the second half turns into a rather hackneyed revenge thriller set on an unforgiving landscape. One can't help but remember that classics such as George Stevens's SHANE (1953) told the same story in a much more economical (and dramatically effective) way.<br/><br/>In the end we are left with the feeling that, while THE REVENANT has a historically convincing story to tell, director Iñárritu somehow missed the opportunity to do so."

Having said all that, the bear attack was good, even if it was played by a cartoon bear......I always have had a soft spot for Yogi, and I'm glad he's still getting some work, even if it's just supporting parts. A bit of a come-down from fronting your own series, but at least he's still getting a gig. I found The Revenant to be just a series of events strung together, a bit like the plots in formulaic TV series, one thing happens followed by another, you get to the end and think...so what... Good stories have twists and turns, with sub-plots that weave themselves around each other, go off at tangents and finally meet at the end for the money shot. Well, none of that happens here. This film was a missed opportunity."

","Oscar winner for best actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), best director (Alejandro G. Iñárritu, and best cinematography (Emmanual Lubezki), THE REVENANT is an epic production and in truth Nature is the leading character. The film is a visual spectacle, the themes of survival and for love between a father and son are moving, but this is a long song and requires endurance on the part of the viewer for sitting through 156 minutes of repetitious gore and raw natural elements. The film is based in part on a novel by Michael Punke, and the screenplay is by Mark L Smith and Alejandro G. Iñárritu.<br/><br/>The film may be excessively long but the story can be quickly summarized: While exploring the uncharted wilderness in 1823, legendary frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) sustains injuries from a brutal bear attack. When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home to his beloved family (his son Hawk - Forrest Goodluck – dies on the same trip). Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry terrain to track down John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), the former confidant who betrayed and abandoned him.<br/><br/>The hunting troops are well portrayed by Tom Hardy (very difficult to understand his mumbling accent), Domhnall Gleeson. Will Pouster (a very talented young actor), Forrest Goodluck et al. But the overwhelming power of the film is the depiction of man in Nature and the concept of survival against all odds. For that aspect alone the film is well worth seeing."
"cammymadden","6","1","2","28 February 2016"," Entertaining but Nothing Special
","*Doesn't contain any huge spoilers: just one scene*<br/><br/>After literally just getting back from seeing The Revenant, I decided to share my opinion of it prior to the Oscars before it becomes even more hyped up. <br/><br/>While Leonardo DiCaprio does deliver an incredible performance, making the audience feel his pain and helplessness in certain situations, I found myself often comparing his facial expressions and noises to the scene in The Wolf of Wall Street where his character consumes some surprisingly powerful quaaludes ultimately dropping him directly into the ""cerebral palsy phase"". I found it somewhat difficult to contain my laughter after making this comparison during the film. Putting that aside, his portrayal of a character determined to have his revenge was impressive.<br/><br/>That being said, even within the opening scenes of the film I found myself focusing more on Tom Hardy's performance. Whether it was his character or his acting that caught my attention, I couldn't tell you. Following the ""evil"" character in the film added a sense of dramatic flare that we don't always see. Watching as he deals with each and every consequence as it unfolds, watching how little effect this has on his conscience. Short of putting any real spoilers in here, Tom Hardy in my opinion played an essential role in the success of this film. <br/><br/>Overall, I would certainly recommend this film to people because it is a great watch but I also won't be rushing to purchase the DVD upon its release. The story tends to drag in points and many aspects of the story that would have been interesting to see are left unexplored. Perhaps this was to add a degree of mystery to the film but I think it would have helped flesh out the story a little more."

The story with Tarkovsky is just a brilliant -but fake- marketing idea to give a touch of art and ""poetry"" to this moderate big budget Di Caprio film and so to achieve better sells outside America, where things seem to be difficult at the box office. The only common between Inarritu and Tarkovsky is that they both finally give you the same empty taste under the well done but completely artificial universe they create.

","THE REVENANT is directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Domhall Gleeson.<br/><br/>Set in the 1820s we follow the members of a fur trading group who operate under incredibly dangerous conditions. Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) is simply plying his trade with the help of his son, and is clearly an individual who is scarred by the events of his past, something we are alluded to throughout the film.<br/><br/>One of his expedition partners John Fitzgerald (Hardy) is a passionate man, one who simply wants to be paid his way, no matter what the cost. They are both lead by Captain Andrew Henry (Gleeson) who tries his best to keep order and stability in the group as they attempt to return home.<br/><br/>Each actor in this film gives a stellar performance, particularly DiCaprio and Hardy who play two very different but incredibly intense characters which you are unable to take your eyes off. Hardy is menacing, brooding and unforgiving, whilst DiCaprio is passionate and intense in equal measure. If both of these actors don't win an Oscar for their efforts they will no doubt feel hard done by, especially DiCaprio, who gives one of the best performances of his career.<br/><br/>Will Poulter also gives an engaging performance as the character of Bridger and Domhall Gleeson, an actor I admire greatly, does well here too. There is also a strong showing from the unknown entity Forrest Goodluck, who plays Hawk, the son of DiCaprio's character. A muted but incredibly polished performance will surely lead to great things for this young actor.<br/><br/>Iñárritu directs each of these actors incredibly well and professionally pulls us into this dog eat dog world where no one can be trusted. The cinematography is gorgeous, offering us sweeping, intense shots of the desolate and unforgiving landscape we find our characters within. The decision to film using only natural light was an incredibly admirable choice and one which pays off massively, lending the film an intense realism that is hard to pull away from.<br/><br/>My criticisms of this film are few, however I do have some gripes. Mainly with the pacing of the film which at times can be incredibly slow and measured, allowing the tension to build up, which may put off some viewers who are hoping for an action packed DiCaprio romp. The opening is a cataclysm of spectacle, but this slows down very quickly and we move along at a canter until the dramatic moments of the final act. The score on the other hand was a very muted but hauntingly beautiful work which punctuated and complimented every single scene it featured, making up for the somewhat snail pace and long, drawn out shots of the landscape which while beautiful, offered little to the flow of the story except as filler between story beats.<br/><br/>The most intense and incredible moment of this film is without doubt the infamous bear scene, which involves DiCaprio coming face to face with the brutal beast in what is a harrowing five minutes for the viewer, one which is both intensely realistic and fiercely brilliant. Without spoiling anything it is one of the most enthralling scenes you'll see this year and the execution of it is fantastic. DiCaprio really showing his incredible acting range in this film, particularly here.<br/><br/>The Revenant while slow, is an excellent piece of film making with a stand out performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, which should win him the Oscar he has been striving for all these years come and gone.<br/><br/>For more reviews go to www.filmathon.co.uk"
"ron_20078","8","1","2","18 February 2016"," Will The Revenant get Leonardo DiCaprio the Oscar?
","Plot: A fur trading expedition goes wrong and wildered after an attack by the Native Americans. The onus is on tracker Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) to get the team safely back. The pursuit becomes more complicated when Glass is viciously attacked by a 500lb grizzly bear. When his team is unable to carry him further, they leave him behind after paying mercenary John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) to stay back until Glass breathes his last. The untrustworthy Fitzgerald betrays Glass by the worst means possible. Thus begins the ruthless quest for survival and revenge.<br/><br/>For starters, The Revenant is a visual spectacle from scene one. Ace Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who has two back-to-back Oscars to his name for his impeccable work in Gravity and Birdman, hits the bull's eye yet again. Each frame is a work of art in itself, a feast for the eyes. Based in the nineteenth century, the film is shot in the most exquisite of locations in Argentina and Alberta and look almost heavenly. Alejandro G. Inarritu, the Mexican import who dished up the intense drama 'Birdman' last year helms a project much more complicated and ambitious. And he checks all boxes, well almost.<br/><br/>The film, which looks like an extended episode of Bear Grylls' 'Man Vs Wild', seems a tad too disbelieving at times.From Cast Away to 127 Hours, we've all seen survival films where the odds are heavily against the leading man. But Inarritu's protagonist, who by the way is 'loosely' inspired by a true character and true story, goes through stuff that even the manliest of Bollywood heroes wouldn't be able to endure.From getting ripped off and shattered by a merciless wild bear (in a spine chilling sequence- a highlight of the movie), to defying the Arikara warriors on multiple occasions, to falling off cliffs, to getting washed away in menacing streams, Glass has to be the toughest man to have ever walked on planet earth to survive it all.That probably is the only flaw in the otherwise flawless project. Innaritu's camera work is thrilling and mesmerising (Kudos to the brand new 6.5k ARRI 65 camera which makes its debut). His cast couldn't have been better. Will Poulter does a fine job. Tom Hardy, whose look reminds you of Game of Throne's 'The Hound', puts up a solid performance. At times, you cannot help get a reminiscence of Bane due to the similar voice pitch. All said, at the end of the day, The Revenant is a film made for Leonardo DiCaprio. Oxford dictionary might have to come out with fresh adjectives to describe his no-holds-barred performance, it is that good.<br/><br/>He fights a grizzly wild beast. He eats raw bison body parts. He sleeps in animal carcasses (The latter two for real to attain authenticity). He does it all. And with mind boggling finesse. Amidst freezing cold temperatures and fighting constant hypothermia. His struggle shows on the screen (in a good way of course). He speaks lesser dialogues than he ever has and that too in a husky voice, but expresses more than ever.<br/><br/>Leo's scintillating performance takes the survival turned revenge drama to an all new level of immensity. Without him, the film could have been just another visually appeasing film. Leonardo turns it into something else. You live with him throughout the length of the film, almost holding your own body at times to check if it hurts. As Hugh Glass defies all odds in surviving the wrath of nature, DiCaprio defiles all odds an actor could ever face. If this doesn't get him the coveted golden statuette, nothing will. There a famous joke that someday there will be a biopic made on how Leonardo DiCaprio never won an Oscar and the actor playing him will win an Oscar for it. After this role, that joke is ought to die a welcome death.<br/><br/>The Revenant might not be Leonardo DiCaprio's best film, but Hugh Glass is surely his best performance. It has all the ingredients the Academy looks for in an Oscar winner for Best Actor, something which critics have claimed he lacked all this while. (Yes even after Titantic, Catch Me If You Can, Aviator, Blood Diamond, Departed and more recently The Wolf of Wall Street). This year seems to be his year finally. Yes we've said it a half a dozen times before only to be proved otherwise, but this by far is the most realistic bet. After all the years of struggle and disappointment, the moment when it finally happens would be quite historic to say the least. Over to the 28th of February."

It also provides you an opportunity to immerse to their reality: the freezing, skin peeling and pain, but most importantly is the way it connects you to the intense emotional loss the main character is going through. Leonardo did a good job in this movie depending on his body language mainly after loosing his voice due to the bear attack incident.

They were beautifully shot. Truly gripping. Must see!

","One has to respect Leonardo DiCaprio, whose career could have gone the way of Ryan Reynolds or Mathew McConaughey--since repented-- cashing in on his boyish looks with hollow romantic-comedies for half-wits. Instead, he chooses to work with Spielberg, Mann, Mendes, Nolan, Tarantino, and, of course, Scorsese--narrowing in on challenging, often unlikable characters.<br/><br/>In an astounding turn-around from last year's ""Birdman,"" Alejandro Inarritu takes a by-the-numbers folk song about one man's thirst for revenge and strips it naked of all barroom romanticism. With ""The Revenant,"" he holds up his thumb to unrelenting nature, sees the beauty within and begins the shaping process.<br/><br/>The film's first victory was the decision to shoot on-location, with natural light. While the concept might seem somewhat pretentious at first--considering the luxuries computers afford--it pays off, creating one of the more immersive film experiences in recent memory--and no 3D, what do you know? No matter how advanced computer generation becomes, you can't beat the real thing--that works with movies, Coca-Cola and nearly everything else.<br/><br/>I'm normally not a huge proponent for realism in films--I already know it's fake, so just have fun with it--but ""The Revenant"" is the rare case where I can't imagine the film any other way. Perhaps, it's because much of it isn't fake. Or perhaps, it's because the story is so naturally thin, and the realism puts a magnifying glass to the cinematic fine print--delicate human moments--that would otherwise go unnoticed. Yes, I think that's it.<br/><br/>The action sequences--and they are that--are leagues above anything seen in any superhero film, placing the audience amongst the gun- smoke, zipping arrows and the horses who move like heavy machinery. No better is this accomplishment signified than the already notorious ""bear scene,"" in which Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) is eviscerated by a grizzly. The scene is unrelenting in its brutality, the bear acting as the physical manifestation of cruel Nature, and Glass as helpless Man, always on the defensive. And unlike most blockbuster films, the action has purpose and repercussions; it doesn't feel like a child playing nonsensically with his toys--not that I don't occasionally enjoy such a thing. <br/><br/>One would be remiss to fail to mention DiCaprio's performance as Glass--if ever there was a man less suited to his name. He's the kind of actor who never goes for the admirable base hit, but spits in both hands and points to the rafters each and every time; here is no different. He's as raw and inexorable as the film itself. Same goes for Tom Hardy, the villain of the piece, a man so detestable, the Indian who scalped him changed his mind half-way through. The character had be worried for a bit, as he comes off a tad mustache- twirling, but he rounds out in the end.<br/><br/>""The Revenant,"" is a film that unfolds rather than unveils; that reveals rather than relates; a film of driving, raw emotion."
"scottshak_111","9","1","2","17 February 2016"," The Revenant is a gruesome gore blended with the right dose of beauty.
","Grisly and grizzly is written all over it. The biopic that carefully walks on the edges of jaws of death that Glass managed to return from, couldn't have possibly ended up being more complete and perfect.<br/><br/>""My heart bleeds. But revenge is in the creator's hands."" <br/><br/>Aforesaid escapes Hikuc's mouth, a Pawnee who happens to the protagonist amidst complete chaos. He walks in and out of his life like a savior whose only intent seemed to resuscitate his dead and pass on the above rad message.<br/><br/>Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a genius behind the lens. Right from the very beginning you can't help but notice how he walks you amongst the characters. With clean close up shots taken right next to individuals he lets you stay with them, feel the angst, the immediate pain and empathize. His famous long uncut shots are persistent here as well as they complete big takes without breaking the flow. His genius can be seen in parts where the camera swifts gorgeously between pumped-up killing characters on the battle ground and stays on the ones living till their death knell resounds. He even captures breath-gasps on screen by giving a proper follow up to its characters for emphasis.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is downright exceptional. To say he ate real bison liver and slept in animal carcass would be to say the least. He wears the skin of Hugh Glass like a pro. There is a constant tension he carries throughout the movie where his brows barely relax and rarely speak of relief. The bear mauling bit is one jaw dropping memorable scene that will forever haunt us in our dreams. To fight right to the moment of being incapacitated was something he aced to perfection. The aftermath of the attack where he loses his vocals, speaks with a wheezing sound, hisses and coughs whilst talking, drinking and eating, are all marvelously mastered.<br/><br/>The Revenant reeks of heart-melting pathos. One of the saddest bits in the flick is when Glass crawls his way to his son's cadaver. He stops twice whilst doing so taken aback by the sight of the blood and the corpse as he puts his head on his chest, and says:<br/><br/>""I am not leaving you, son. I am right here."" <br/><br/>If you wish to see pain personified, behold Leo's eyes! Period. To watch him gnaw on that Bison liver whilst knowing it was the real one, couldn't help you feel sorry for him. To see him get under the quilts of horse flesh naked to beat the cold and all odds, was how you would have wanted the Glass story to be like.<br/><br/>Watching The Revenant is like watching the enthralling head of Emmanuel Lubezki. Tranquil frames visit one by one amidst the crawling story, engaging you with its magnificence. Shots of winter ridden trees, capped mountains, frozen leaves, dewed branches, bubbles of water sluggishly moving 'neath the river, cloudy moon shots are all badass results of Lubezki grandeur.<br/><br/>The Revenant is an intriguing affair with nature. You behold the might of nature in the biting cold, the hailing storm, big slaps of relentless water that take the protagonist down (water-shot was brilliantly taken as well) and animal savagery in the punishing snow and feel them tingling your bones. It celebrates gore fights where fingers get chopped off, ears plucked off, heads lanced with arrows. Downright brutality! In all that barbarity, there is beauty lurking in its originality. The way things happened has been given precedence. That's what makes it special and unique. It is a cold blooded biopic, played outrageously well by its ingenious actors.<br/><br/>Fitzgerald played by Tom Hardy can't be ignored either. He isn't all evil, but with one knee in perversion, he could have been anyone put in a dire situation. But he was the one insinuating trouble from the very beginning, trying to justify his act by pointing ""you blinked"" and attempting to put justice to his killing act. Tom Hardy plays John extremely well with his brilliant accent, and thoughtful eyes that he carries whilst giving explanations.<br/><br/>Bridger is a character that could have been any one. So Poulter plays him with perfection. A little kind to begin with, yet overpowered by power. Not exactly wimpy either but a stone trampled down by Fitzgerald, left without a choice.<br/><br/>The music of the flick is apt. Complements the sadistic theme the flick runs on. It is uplifting in a way, always suggestive of the imminent revenge lurking in the corner. Screenplay is confined, but is no doubt great.<br/><br/>There are brilliant well-thought of parts strewn all across the movie. Hugh's dreams are quite poetic. They are well supported by whispers and a majestic backdrop that impart meaning. The music there too supplements it. Little things like, a bird escaping from the heart of Glass' wife signifies her soul leaving the body. One time when Glass is hungry as hell, he sees a herd of deer crossing the river. He imagines he has a rifle, points the stick at them and signals shooting them. Such games of despair! As the movie concludes, we see the wife of Glass conjuring him, ultimately leaving him alone yet again. It was a perfect way to end it. A typical Inarritu finish that leaves you with questions! The aforementioned is suggestive of how eager Glass was to visit his wife, but he is bereft of death once again. Sheer amazeballs!"

","Let me start by saying that I have never heard wheezing in pain that was so convincing that I believed it Oscar worthy. However, Leo is an absolute genius in this picture. As my friend quipped, ""I couldn't even make my leg look that dead; how does he do it?"" I can't even describe for you how great DiCaprio's performance is in this film. I honestly have never been on the Leo bandwagon. I think he's a great actor who has turned in many Oscar worthy performances, however, I do not worship the ground upon which he walks. This is not a Leo groupie lauding unnecessary and bloated praises. This performance is genuinely one of the best I've seen. <br/><br/>This film generally has a small plot, which includes a lot of violence. Frankly, I have never been accepting of these terms, but this movie makes up for it else where. The cinematography of this is flawless. The cut to shots are beyond genius, the camera work is brilliant, the colors are rich, the costumes are great, the makeup is greater, and the technicalities are perfection. Every t is crossed and every i dotted. The film won't wow you with an incredible plot but it dives deep into what it has and let's the visuals speak for themselves. It is an instant masterpiece of filmmaking which turns in great performances from two of today's top actors. I don't know whether it will pull down a Best Picture Award from the Academy, but it doesn't need accolades for longevity. It is genius. Innaritu has proved himself one of the best filmmakers in the industry today. There isn't much more to say about this movie. Go see it and you will see exactly what I mean. It is polarizing so whether you like it or not, I think we can all admit that it a great achievement all around."
"sdrobner-49806","3","1","2","7 February 2016"," no storyline, unrealistic and ennoying
","I would have almost walked out of the movie, if i hadn't gone into the theatre with my friends. Nominated for many Oscars, viral discussions about the movie in the social media and a huge hype everywhere. I had high expextations but the movie couldn't meet them.<br/><br/>There is no story, it is only about revange in the North American wilderness. There is pointless violence, lot's of moaning and groaning, blood and plenty of unrealistic szense and story lines that do not make sense. When Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) is attacked by a bear, he has injuries that no human would have ever survived. In one second he is almost diying, in the other second he is swimming, talking and hunting. These ambivallece of a men whi is almost dead and then absoluetly fine again did not make sense for me. Falling from cliffs without injury, getting stiched together without any affect on the well being was to extreme for me. The biggest mistakes are for me the ending, where two men alone hunt down a criminal. The way that is being done was non sense. A day before Hugh Glass wasn't able to walk, the next day he is ready to hunt someone and win. ALso the day before tons of men search for Hugh Glass, the next day two men alone walk out and follow a criminal. In the very end Hugh Grant leaves the criminal for the native indians. For what reason? for me this is one of the most overrated movies ever. I would not watch it again."
"josbell","8","1","2","15 February 2016"," DiCaprio's more than just a pretty boy
","Leonardo DiCaprio is primarily known for playing dashing men but this film had him going out of his comfort zone. And do you know what? He did a great job. I'm not a DiCaprio fan but I thought he was well cast in this role. He played a harsh, angry man driven by a desire to survive for his son and later a desire to avenge his death. While he wasn't exactly a great father as shown by his rather harsh behavior around the kid, Hugh Glass' son was his main motivation for living and after his death, all he had left was revenge. Furthermore his harshness towards the boy fits the nature of the film which is essentially about survival of the fittest. Evidently Glass' son was not the fittest.<br/><br/>The film is bleak and dark but in no way does that make it bad because the bleak atmosphere was entirely intentional. There was also a rather shocking amount of blood and even a brief rape scene. This is a very masculine movie with very few women and none in a main role. The Indian Chief was often talking about his daughter but throughout the entire movie, she was only on screen for about five minutes which was slightly disappointing. I liked the open ending where it implied that Glass was dying when he saw his late wife in the snow. He claimed he felt like he was already dead by that point so to him, killing Fitzgerald was just tying up a loose end before his spirit could actually leave his body.<br/><br/>I liked the subtle little touches DiCaprio added to his performance. He had quite a few scenes where he wasn't talking so he needed to do more than just show off his good looks. For example after he used a horse as transport and later shelter after it died when they fell off a cliff, he gave its body a gentle touch before he left which I interpreted as him thanking it for keeping him alive. The harsh, wheezing voice he used towards the end of the movie is explained by his throat injury as well as the fact that he had no reason to talk between the time where his Indian friend was killed and he was found by the search party. However I wouldn't say DiCaprio was completely perfect, although he was pretty damn close. When Glass found his son's body, I think tears would have made his performance even stronger and even more deserving of his BAFTA award. To be fair, he was playing the kind of man who most likely saw tears as a sign of weakness but I would have liked to see a tiny bit more vulnerability in this tough and harsh character. However that's literally the only criticism I can give him. DiCaprio was still easily great enough to show that it's not only his looks that make him such a successful actor and I'm pleased that he finally won an award.<br/><br/>DiCaprio carried the movie and prevented me from losing interest despite its long running time. Tom Hardy was also good as Fitzgerald but I was more impressed by DiCaprio because he broke out of his typical pretty boy role and tried something different."
"teemu-uusitalo","8","1","2","14 February 2016"," A beautiful, universal movie
","The Revenant is another snowy western that's come out recently, the other being The Hateful Eight. They are very different kind of movies though: H8 is much about killing and talking, Revenant about not dying and not talking! <br/><br/>Anyways, The Revenant is a good and beautiful movie that tells a story which is interesting in a way. See, this is one of those movies in which some character is a little evil already and only needs a tiny push to fall to ""the dark side"", if you will. Same as in Saruman in LOTR and Sgt. Barnes in Platoon. Tom Hardy does a really good job playing a bad-ass character as usual. That character (Fitzgerald) also loses his honor and becomes a coward...<br/><br/>As I said, a major part of the movie is plainly about Hugh Glass trying to live on to avenge his son. Leonardo DiCaprio acts realistically but I'm not sure if this is the movie he should get the Oscar from. That should've happened already. Not a single character in this movie really does anything I could REALLY remember them from. They do what they're supposed to but there is not much interesting dialogue like in, well Hateful Eight for example. Instead, what we find is an amazing story of survival, betrayal and revenge that is detached from the characters themselves. It's quite universal.<br/><br/>I love the cinematography here and the movie is very enjoyable to watch, really. I long to go camping in clean and fresh forests and mountains, drink straight from a river. Maybe I'll just pack my bags and head for Lapland. Maybe I got a little carried away. Nice views and excellent work there whatsoever. <br/><br/>Finally, if there is something that bothered me during watching The Revenant, it's the sound mixing/editing. I often felt like I was listening to three layers of sounds and music. Even the silent parts often had some sort of weird humming or screeching in the background. It made me feel nervous in the bad way. The actual sounds of the movie + the score were enough. Someone fix that for me?<br/><br/>8/10"

","I don't know if I've ever wished for a movie to end so many times that I enjoyed as much as Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's newest outing The Revenant (2015). Fresh off an Oscar with Birdman (2014), Inarritu continues his trend of a natural unstoppable force constantly pressing throughout his films. A force so strong that it won't even allow us to breathe. It is also worth mentioning the progression from Birdman, a dark comedy mostly centered around the ways which we present ourselves to others, and The Revenant, which replaces all of the dialogue in Birdman with brutal moment after brutal moment.<br/><br/>The films structure calls to mind thoughts of Gravity (Cuaron, 2013) lying mostly on its protagonist dealing with just about every single thing that could go wrong going wrong, initiating with the now infamous bear scene. While Gravity seemed to replace interesting story telling with these humongous set pieces, The Revenant uses these constant natural disasters to help supplement the spiritual journey that Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) endeavors. In an interview with Variety, the film's director spoke heavily about the two tiers that the story revolves around.<br/><br/>Being both beautiful and completely brutal, this film will rip into your mind and leave you with mental and emotional scars all too similar to that of the main character. Inarritu collaborates again with Birdman cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who once again has proved he is an absolute geniuses with the camera. Whether he is a 'mad' genius is up for debate. The themes of the unbreakable human spirit in the film seem to mirror the production perfectly. Shot in entirely natural light, sometimes only shooting for an hour a day to find the perfect light, the film went through tremendous difficulties to perfect Lubezki and Inarritu's vision, and it pays off marvelously .<br/><br/>While the image is completely breathtaking, The Revenant seems to have its weakest aspect lying within the screenplay itself. I by no means am saying that having little dialogue hurts the film in any way, in fact it enhances it, but when there is so little dialogue when it arrives it needs to be cutting and important, and most importantly interesting. Now the dialogue by no means is boring, but it does not reach the same peaks as the technical aspects of this film.<br/><br/>As relentless as this film is, it seems as if this was an earlier cut of the film. By that, I mean that it seemed as though there was still needless moments that only heightened tension for a moment but ended up not contributing to the overall necessity of the movie. I never got bored, but there were certainly moments where I thought to myself 'alright, this needs to pick up the pace!' When every minute feels like three, because the pain is so real, it's hard to sit through any moments that seem redundant.<br/><br/>The Revenant is brutal, gut wrenching, and painful, yet beautiful and endearing. It was probably the most visceral film of the 2015 season."
"alexanderstephencraig","9","1","2","10 February 2016"," As much a film as it is art.
","*This of course contains spoilers. (Also probably better reviews than mine but who cares.)<br/><br/>The Revenant was as intense in some moments as it was beautiful. The cinematography, to the sound, editing, acting, everything, was perfect. I didn't give it a 10/10 because the very end was false but changing the script to satisfy the story was in correct direction in my opinion. <br/><br/>You start off with a single shot scene that carries on for I'm guessing ten minutes or so but without paying attention to the details, you would never realize; it's very similar to the way Alfonso Cuarón does his films. Some of the camera work of the low angle shots and transitions really made it breath to where you actually are a bit frightened during the scene, more so than some crappy horror flick.<br/><br/>There's not much to say about the acting other than what everyone already knows through social media.I personally heard it through internet, word of mouth, and on TV but I wanted to see it because hey, Leo and Tom together in one movie? Duh. <br/><br/>The film was delayed due to weather by a full three months I believe so Tom Hardy missed out on Suicide Squad to do this film so you know it has to be good. Even in an evil role you can't not love the great Tom Hardy. He's one of the most captivating actors of his time. He has a scene talking about his father and God which(watch the movie) He makes into a mockery of God through a joke from his father and then stares in silence where you're forced to look into his eyes. It's a very eerie moment but in a good way. He is of course the actor that acted mostly using his eyes for an entire film. - The Dark Knight Rises.<br/><br/>As for the social media and what not about Leonardo DiCaprio winning his first Oscar kind of speaks for itself. Everyone knows how amazing he is in everything he does an the lengths he goes to. Fun fact: Leonardo is a vegetarian in real life and in the film he ate a raw liver; as you see him eat the liver in the film, he is actually eating it for real. Which for me(know before I saw the film) made me laugh because I'm immature but immediately vomits after the first bite, know that was real just made me crack up. Anyways, Leo is king.<br/><br/>Again, there are better reviews than this one but hey it was fun. All in all, the film was pretty incredible and was absolutely better in theaters. Go see it."

","Having just watched Iñárritu previous and fantastic movie Birdman again, and knowing this film was nominated for 12 Oscars my expectations was very high, despite the fact that the trailer made the movie look boring. I thought it was just a bad trailer. But no; this long long movie is boring from start to finish, and when the movie ends I could not care less who lived or died, so even in the grand finale I did not really care how the movie ended. I'm so disappointed. I really hope it will not get any Oscars, and feel so sad that a great actor like DiCaprio probably receives an Oscar for a part, where most of his lines are grunts, instead of for one of the many great movies he has made prior to this one. But I guess he will win because he deserved to have an Oscar already, and this is how the Oscar often goes when great actors have been overlooked."

","I used to live in Northern Canada so I definitely enjoyed the visuals in the movie but even that pleasure was lessened by inconsistencies. One minute DiCaprio was walking on flat land with no mountains even in the distance and then boom he was in the mountains. Unless two weeks had passed that could not have happened. The story line was incredibly weak, just too many coincidences and inconsistencies. Even to the James Bond style of leaving the hero almost dead but without finishing the job. We have to be able to suspend disbelief to enjoy a movie but it was very difficult to do that with such a weak story line. It was nicely filmed and there was some stunning scenery but that could not compensate for the weak script."
"Jonmurgie","8","1","2","9 February 2016"," Brutal and raw
","There has been a lot of hype about this film with much talk of Leonardo DiCaprio's dedication to his performance, and the brilliant Tom Hardy lined up next to him it certainly sounded like it was going to be an epic and epic it was, in a few different ways.<br/><br/>The moment the film starts you're taken back to the early 1800's in the cold and desolate landscape of Montana and South Dakota with breathtakingly gorgeous scenery and an almost endless vista. You can literally feel the coldness oozing out of the screen. Long lingering shots are plentiful, with a slow and powerful soundtrack combining to make the films overall pace seem somewhat sluggish at times (with a 2hr 36min running time it could have been comfortably shorter). Putting that aside the story does tick along and there are plenty of tense scenes which keep you on edge and focused.<br/><br/>The gore though, wow there is a LOT of gore in this film. Whilst I'm sure it's very realistic it can't be described as anything other than brutal. Some scenes are literally a brutal onslaught and are often difficult to stomach, not what I was expecting. The cast were first class, DiCaprio immersing himself in the role to an incredible level whilst Hardy playing his slightly crazed character in that incredibly satisfying way only Hardy can. The two of them work together perfectly.<br/><br/>Up for many Oscars this film is certainly worth of the nominations, this is one well worth seeing but just be aware of its stark brutality."
"jonathanatkinson17","Null","1","2","31 January 2016"," Iñárritu's surprsing blockbuster.
","One year after the release of Alejandro G. Iñárritu's Oscar winning effort, Birdman, he and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki look to take their seamless, almost cut-free brand of cinema, from the ultra-intramural of their previous effort, and apply it to the diametric opposite; the wide-open, exhilaratingly earthy, extramural scene of a brutal 1820's Dakota. Following the mourning Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) traipse his broken body in pursuit of vengeance across the fledgling American frontier. <br/><br/>Sometimes trippy, sometimes telluric, always proximal to the action of the unfolding events – for better or worse, this is oft poor Leo's bared, mud-clagged incisors. This new piece stays away from the naval gazing, creative existential crisis of Birdman, in favour of a surprisingly straightforward blockbuster romp; if that's what you want from it.<br/><br/>Being an Iñárritu film, there is plenty going on beneath the clart cosmetic. Since its release, a number of those involved in the film have gushed about the West's treatment of indigenous peoples; if bringing this subject to a wider discourse was the film's intention, I must admit, I find myself at a loss to have recognised it. While we are subjected to a very corporeal painting of atrocities against such peoples, the film never seems to go beyond a 'we did this and we should feel bad' level of insight. The focus of the goings-on is much more on the Caucasian players, namely the fur- trapper Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio).<br/><br/>The ill-starred Leo, over the course of the film, falls and, quite literally, hits every branch on the way down. In one of the film's most indulgent moments, it does fall prey to crossing into self-parody as it turns into a DiCaprio suffer-a-thon. A rather inapt laugh was uttered when upon seeing what next disaster was befalling the protagonist, a mental image was conjured of Homer falling for a second time into Springfield gorge. This is done with relatively early on in the film's substantial 156 minute running time, however, and soon gets back on track, never missing a beat until its climax and allowing Leo to show some range beyond exhausted, in pain, getting spittle on the lens and so on.<br/><br/>The manner of DiCaprio's performance leads me to address the bison in the room: The Academy Awards. The timing of the film's release, along with the casting of the 'always the bridesmaid never the bride' Leo is a shame, because the film stands to be notably excellent when viewed in a vacuum, whether it boards the band wagon of Academy attention or not. The idea that an actor must suffer 'x' in order to get the gong they so crave is a shame; perhaps, without that unfortunate, extraneous thorn in his mind, Leo would have given a more nuanced, less grimacing and frothing approach to the character. Tom Hardy as the wild eyed, mumbling, but brilliant John Fitzgerald and Dohmnall Gleeson as the sober and solemn Captain of the beleaguered band, have the room to fully showcase their expertise in their craft and really impress. Will Poulter equally inspires and shows competence far beyond his years as the baby-faced voice of morality amongst growingly desperate men.<br/><br/>A somewhat unforeseen turn in Iñárritu's body of work but one that is no less valid: We are given a spectacle that feels truly like something never done before in the way which it is presented. Amalgams between real, in camera work and CGI are seamless, performances, when viewed on their own merit, are colossal, and if there was ever a film to make you subconsciously want to pick the grime from underneath your fingernails, or take a shocked breath of the imagined frigid air, this is it."
"BillSims28","8","1","2","8 February 2016"," Five-Word Review: Visceral, Harshly Beautiful, Overlong Odyssey
","It's the 1820s in Frontier USA. Left for dead, and having watched his son die in front of him, Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) begins an epic mission of survival. With Tom Hardy (Legend), 2015's sweetheart Domhnall Gleeson (Ex Machina) and Will Poulter (The Maze Runner), The Revenant is directed by Birdman's Oscar-winning Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarittu.<br/><br/>The Revenant is a truly beautiful film. Having heard the horror stories of one of the most gruelling shoots ever, I was eagerly anticipating it. Particularly admirable, though possibly insane, was the director's decision to shoot in all-natural light, lending the film a stark, realistic feel that really includes the viewer in Glass's struggle. By the end, I felt cold and uncomfortable inside the stuffy cinema: a definite achievement. And talking of uncomfortable, this is one of those films you'd class as hard to watch. Evoking winces, groans, and shape intakes of breath aplenty, the extent of DiCaprio's plight is expertly depicted. Gruesome stand-outs include a scene of sleeping inside a dead horse to avoid the cold (the realistic side of Empire's famous Tauntaun scene), an jaw-dropping bear attack, Glass's final confrontation with Hardy's Fitzgerald, and the opening scene, an extraordinary fight scene between vengeful Native Americans and the fur- trappers Glass belongs to. In the latter Iñarritu gets to display his limitless propensity for tracking shots that he used to great effect in Birdman, with the camera following one person until their death, then following their killer similarly, and so on. Ultimately, a truly spectacular feast for the eyes, with credit to both the director and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, on course for a third consecutive Oscar following Gravity and Birdman.<br/><br/>Further praise must go to the acting. Obviously DiCaprio deserves all the plaudits for a properly fantastic physical performance (though in terms of his greatest career performance one feels The Wolf of Wall Street should come more into play) yet at times he feels almost overshadowed by the fabulous Hardy. Following up a solid year of Mad Max: Fury Road and Kray biopic Legend (tragically unnoticed, like Johnny Depp for Black Mass, by major awards), Hardy gives a perfect villainous performance as the nihilistic, irreverent and self- interested Fitzgerald, even if, like Tommy Lee Jones in No Country for Old Men, his accent is thick enough to warrant subtitles. The two central performances, supported by more solid work from Gleeson and the increasingly respectable Poulter, in addition to the wonderful Duane Howard as a Native American searching for his lost daughter, provide the foundations for a properly epic film.<br/><br/>Not that The Revenant is perfect; it's certainly overlong. Yet at the same time it should not have been shorter - in order to achieve the epic feel it had to be too long. There will always be redundant scenes, and watching any man trudge through the wilderness will drag, even with the beauty of the film and the class of acting. However, overall The Revenant is hardly harmed by its flaws, earning its place among the elite of 2015. 86/100 d"
"isak-zettervall","8","1","2","7 February 2016"," Not your typical movie
","--There are no spoilers in this review-- <br/><br/>Im writing this review for one specific reason: I want viewers to know what they're getting into. Im gonna start this off by saying if you haven't already watched the trailer, do yourself a favor and don't watch it. I feel like the trailer is kind of misleading. At least it was for me. The trailer made the movie seem like a very action packed movie. If someone explains this movie to you as an epic revenge tale, don't listen to them. Yes, there are some very good (and beautifully shot) fight/action scenes in here, but it's not what drives the movie. This movie is a very realistic survivor story. Probably the best survivor story i've ever seen. It is full of great performances. Leonardo DiCaprio was great in the movie. He doesn't have very much dialogue, his acting is very physical. But that actually just made his performance even more impressive. Will Poulter was also good in the movie, but for me Tom Hardy was the scene stealer. Evey scene Tom Hardy was in was in my opinion great. And I also think he was the best and most interesting character in the movie. <br/><br/>This movie is also one of the, if not the best shot movie I have ever seen. You may have heard by now that the director shot this movie in entirely in natural light. And it really payed off. Also the shots in this movie goes on for a long time. There aren't very many cuts which was very cool and impressive to see. Like I said: this is probably the best shot and one of the best looking movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>If you're a lover of cinema you've probably already seen this movie, if not why are you still reading this review? Go see it! And if you're just a casual movie viewer you'll probably also like this movie. You just have to know what you're getting into which is: A very realistic survivor story with great acting and great visuals.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

","Reaction from someone who is both nutty about photography and survival techniques: (Or - Things I didn't like and which broke the movie for me) - Use of a fish eye lens in certain places. The distortions in the visuals broke the illusion.<br/><br/><ul><li>Repeatedly letting the lens get dirty or foggy, or wet, or snowy. Broke the illusion.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Lens glare, lens flare and star flares, broke the illusion.</li></ul><br/><br/>Those things were put in I guess to make the movie feel more artsy but it backfired for me.<br/><br/>Also, I know that the main character was a pretty tough guy, but I can't help but notice that many of the survival techniques were portrayed cheaply. At one point when a fire was made, you could see clearly that the fire wasn't sparked by the flint and steel (as hardly anything was coming off it), but smoke and ember came from outside the camera's viewpoint, and created that first flame. If you insist on showing survival in such detail, then at least get it right, or pretend you get it right and cut to where there is already a fire. But don't base what you show on something you've seen on Discovery in 3 episodes of Bear Grylls' survival fairytale and assume you know how to do it. There were a few such instances where survival scenes were shown in great detail. The scenes would have been awesome, if the director would have gone that extra little step to make it full out real-looking, not just mimicry of something on TV and then not actually getting the mechanics of it right. It would not really have been hard to make it good, if the director had really understood what he was doing, or what he was asking for. They would have spent maybe a few more hours on recording the movie in total, but made a big difference in how the survival stuff was portrayed.<br/><br/>Besides, since he would have died of hypothermia 5-7 times in the movie already the scene reminiscent of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", was unnecessary and too much. He could have just as well just curled up under that tree and been fine (since he had been so many times before already).<br/><br/>Lastly, when you have an axe and supposedly know how to use it... (or did he not? He missed the first hit when trying to cut that branch, I never miss like that myself and use an axe maybe twice a year.) ... then how can you be so silly as to not use the reach of it against a knife fighter? That broke it for me further.<br/><br/>All that gave the movie its 5 points for me was the acting of the main actors, actually all actors. The acting was superb and saved what was left for me in the movie, kept me watching. So all applause goes to the actors who did an awesome job, but I'm not impressed of the storytelling by the director, neither the cinematography."
"doalvarez2002","5","1","2","6 February 2016"," Painfully slow and barely credible
","The film is not as hunky-dory as it is cracked up to be. On the one hand the storyline is played out as agonizingly and painfully slow as all the excruciating and unbearable pain that the seemingly indestructible Leonardo DiCaprio has to put up with throughout the entire film. His relentless suffering together with the nudity scenes in those freezing temperatures are simply beyond credibility. At some point I thought DiCaprio had been graciously touched by some immortality Indian spell because nobody could have been able to endure such agony. One gut-wrenching scene they could easily have done without is that of the horse plunging with DiCaprio on top over the ravine. That was totally unreal. In my opinion DiCaprio doesn't rightfully deserve the Oscar for best actor for this film because rather than speaking he seems to do nothing but groan and moan throughout the whole film. On the other hand I also found the music deadly dull as it didn't help me submerge myself in the film if this had been at least more engaging. It's also worth mentioning that Tom Hardy could have pronounced his lines more articulately and clearly. There were parts of his speech that I had difficulty understanding. <br/><br/>The Revenant is one of those films I wouldn't put myself to the torture of watching it again when it comes out on DVD, not even to understand Tom Hardy's lines with the aid of the subtitles. It left me unimpressed and what's more it hugely disappointed the great expectations I had built up for this film."

Sometimes several movie critics is just a bit clueless what it makes a good script. The camera work is outstanding I will give you that. But Masterpiece? You must be kidding. This Movie lack so many key aspect and element that makes a movie a masterpiece. The main element is a good script. <br/><br/>Too much style, but little substance. <br/><br/>The first act already have amazing setup and build each character nicely that makes us rooting for the hero and the rest. but the screenwriter somehow lost the plot at the second act (just like many other with not so good script has suffered), too many filler scene (the same circumstance keep showing. lazy writing) and Leonardo Dicaprio character become the most center character and we hardly see others character development (in which Leonardo Dicaprio's gain because it showcase his acting talent). This movie can scrapped into 1 hours movie and it won't lost the main narrative, that's how bad the writers has waste his 2 hours 30 min to make a movie more meaningful. <br/><br/>I will give the show credit for make the movie watchable just for the real setup that it's really look too real at the beginning of the movie (well, the writers really lost the plot because it's become ridiculous the more you watch it).

","This movie was shot with a very good camera. You can tell by watching the lingering shots of trees. It's got good low light sensitivity as you can tell by certain night time shots.<br/><br/>The revenant has a slick surface. But what's underneath it in the end? It's a story about a man who sets out to enact his revenge on a ""bad guy"". There's a ""bad guy"" in this movie who does bad things and this movie's main character wants revenge which he gets in the end. But what does this story show us? What can we see in it? What can we learn from it?<br/><br/>We can see a lot of nasty, uncomfortable stuff. Like a rapist getting his penis cut off. That shows him, right? If he didn't want that, he shouldn't have raped that woman. Just desserts! It's that kind of mentality that this film has and it's rather stupid.<br/><br/>There are some cliché lines like ""Revenge won't bring your murdered son back"" as well as the most problematic one namely ""Revenge should be dished out by God"". That last one is just irresponsible in this day and age where in the real world people actually go on killing sprees because they think ""God must dish out revenge"". The movie just wants to sound more sophisticated and deep than it actually is by having those lines in its script but it just makes it sound more stupid and empty. The movie has nothing to say.<br/><br/>We can't learn anything from this flick. Other than that they make good cameras nowadays and there's no shortage of daft screenplays. No amount of impressive camera work will save a movie if the script is no good. And this movie's script is terrible."
"kunalkhandwala","7","1","2","3 February 2016"," Cold, harsh and lonely tale of survival
","In the frigid wilderness of the Dakotas, a band of frontiersmen who gather pelts (animal skins) for a living, are suddenly ambushed by a Native American tribe with many being brutally slaughtered while the rest escape on a boat. This opening sequence of Alejandro Iñárritu's adaptation of Michael Punke's 'The Revenant' is among the most thrilling since The Gladiator's opening. This tale of one animal trapper's horrifying experiences in the harshest of environments is as tedious and unforgiving as the surrounding environment and it forms the perfect allurement for juries of various award ceremonies who dig the silent, solitary performers. This might indeed be Leonardo DiCaprio's long awaited Oscar but certainly not the most deserving one. <br/><br/>After narrowly escaping the ruthless onslaught from the natives, the frontiersmen decide to head to their outpost, Fort Kiowa. Unfortunately though, in a brutal encounter with a mother grizzly bear, Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is gravely injured, making the group's journey a laborious task. The Captain offers a reward to those who would take the responsibility to bring Glass to the Fort and so his son Hawk, Bridger (Will Poulter) and the ever confrontational Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) drag Glass over ice and hills until greed, apathy and selfishness within Fitzgerald leave Glass alone in the wilderness with barely the ability to walk. Apart from the bone chilling weather and lack of food, he must now desperately find shelter from the Arikara tribe. The fates of every character are linked. The tribe's chief is in pursuit of his kidnapped daughter Powaqa which leads to them crossing paths with Glass' company. Fitzgerald was once scalped by some natives and his undying hatred for them leads him to mercilessly murder Hawk. Glass, though helpless for much of the movie is driven by rage and the need for retribution which turns into a desperate hunt when his company discovers Fitzgerald's betrayal. <br/><br/>The sun never shines with hope for anyone in the story. From diving into the icy river full of rapids to finding shelter inside a dead horse's carcass, Glass faces nature's harshness as he takes each step in perpetual agony resulting from his injuries. Being mauled by a ferocious bear can never lead to a speedy recovery but in 1823, being abandoned for the dead, it just makes things a bit more challenging. <br/><br/>There is no doubt that Leo's performance showcases a solid commitment that anchors the film firmly. However, with fewer dialogues than any of his movies to-date, his silent performance strongly indicates all but one emotion; anguish. For over 2 hours, we are subjected to a helpless, abandoned and weak Hugh Glass who trudges along gradually, with barely the resolve to help overcome his pain. The depth of his coldness is second to that of his surroundings that are harsh and brutal to any survivor let alone one who was mauled by a grizzly. At times, his survival is aimless and desperate while there are subdued emotions portraying his desire for vengeance. Prolonged sequences of such dullness can be engaging for serious cinema enthusiasts but the rest will have to be satisfied with the stunning white backdrop of Canada and Argentina that are supposed to match Dakota and Montana back in the day. While this must've been an enormous challenge for Leo as an actor in those harsh environments, it certainly isn't his best show. Muttering, yelling and grunting lack the appeal of powerful dialogue delivery that Leo is renowned for. Tom Hardy is impressive as the cunning betrayer and with his thick accent and rough appearance, is even difficult to identify. <br/><br/>Director Iñárritu's vision for The Revenant was very personal even though it drew inspiration from Michael Punke's novel. The opening sequence involving the raid by the natives, the grizzly attack, the sweeping shots of mountain ranges, blizzard conditions and even close ups of the actors emoting make for some powerful narrative. Filming during particular hours in the day just for a grim effect is the hallmark of a passionate filmmaker and Iñárritu deserves the nomination for his efforts. However, his overlong, tedious, cold and savage tale of survival and determined vengeance must rather make way for the survivor on another planet that offered more inspiration and entertainment.<br/><br/><ul><li>7.431 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"
"david-meldrum","8","1","2","30 January 2016"," Awe-inspiring, but not a masterpiece; a hard to love work of a master, with questions to answer.
","I've heard tell of children in the urban West who don't know that milk comes from cows. They've never seen a cow; they just can't see the connection. I don't know if it's an (urban) myth, but it makes a point about the increasingly urbanised nature of our lives. We're cut loose from our roots and rhythms; we have established new ones in the urban contexts, but we're no longer creatures of the earth and dust. <br/><br/>The Revenant is a counterpoint to this, a film more in touch with the nature of ... nature ... you could not expect to see. From Alejandro González Iñárritu, the Oscar winning director of Birdman and staring Leo DiCaprio, it tells the story of an 1820s American frontiersman left for dead by his colleagues as he struggles to recover from a bear mauling. It's a brutal, visceral tale of survival and, though this only really comes to the fore in the film's final act, a quest for revenge. <br/><br/>Many have said it's brutal - and it is. The Revenant's portrayal of the natural world is of one red in tooth and claw; physical, weighty and oppressive. There are very few concessions to CGI - apart from in the bear attack itself, which is understandable, but doesn't detract from the sequence's extraordinary impact. DiCaprio's character - and the actor himself, presumably - really suffer here. Bones crack, joints grind; winds sweep and howl; cold seeps into every crevice; food is gleaned from the land and from dead animals. The cinematography is nothing short of extraordinary; the cold colours gleam with a tangible frozen bite; the takes are long and fluid, following the movie's central character to emphasise that he's stalked as much by the forces of the land as by his own mortality or people who would do him harm. <br/><br/>There's a spirituality here. It's a spirituality of the Native American cultures, one wedded deeply to the earth from which the people draw their life. Tellingly the only reference to Western spirituality is a ruined church being overrun by the elements; the only way DiCaprio's character is going to survive his trial by snowbound fire is abandoning everything he knows - including any semblance of familiar faith - and embrace a mode of being that's at once hostile and essential for survival.<br/><br/>Contemporary Christianity has much to learn here. As our planet becomes increasingly urbanised we lose our connection to the rhythms of the pastoral life from which we have drawn our roots. That's not a bad thing - nor a good thing - in itself. It necessitates a reinvention, though; a rediscovery of theology, spirituality and worship that connects to the way we live and is true to who we are and who we find ourselves to be. Sections of the church are wrestling with this; but some still run, crying about heresy or lost tradition. All the while, people thirst for lack of vision.<br/><br/>Back to the movie. DiCaprio - for me one of the most underrated actors of his generation - is magnificent here. He's as physical here as he was to very different ends in The Wolf Of Wall Street; long stretches of this film pass wordless, his body and face speaking volumes. He can be a remarkable actor, and his lack of major awards recognition demonstrates how conservative awards judges like to be. They do like their talent to suffer for their art, though, and that alone will probably ensure trophies on this occasion. <br/><br/>It's a good, remarkable film. It's not - I suspect - a great one. My sense is that it will not translate so powerfully to the myriad smaller screens on which films are now viewed post cinema release. I may be wrong, but it feels as if the film relies so much for its power on overwhelming you with the beauty and hardness of the environment that the small screen will shrink it in more ways than one. In this era, a great film needs to be great on screens big and small; I suppose we'll all just have to watch it on our phones to answer that one. There are other problems with this film - and the director's work in general. The biggest of these is his treatment of women. Here the women are off-stage, in memory, or a victim of violent rape. They have precious few lines. In the context of a career thus far where his films largely focus on the masculine in different expressions, this gives cause for concern. The director has questions to answer, and they can't simply be answered by saying that what he produces is very good in its own terms. It is; but in the era he's working, he needs to do more with half the human race.<br/><br/>The Revenant is remarkable, thrilling, stimulating - and ultimately hard to love. For all that's impressive and awe-inspiring about it (and I use the word awe in its religious context), it's not going to lodge in the heart; it fed my soul, but if I tried to live on it I'd be in trouble."
"kevinmorice","6","1","2","30 January 2016"," Very pretty, but not very good
","Inarritu has spent a lots of time polishing this turd. Some of the artistic shots are absolutely fabulous. They have obviously had the second unit out in the snow for a great long time shooting scenic trees and snow. <br/><br/>The rest is a half-written 30 minute script, packed out with some nice scenery and some hyper-violent scenes to make sure you don't fall asleep. There is no need for a lot of the extremity of the violence. Human vs Human, Animal vs Human, Human vs Animal, all ridiculously bloody and disgusting for no real reason.<br/><br/>If Leo does finally get an Oscar for this he should hand it straight back because it will have been based purely on pity rather than on the actual performance involved in this film."
"Argemaluco","8","1","2","28 January 2016"," The Revenant
","The Revenant is a very competent fusion of cinematographic technique and artistic vision, whose stylistic attributes transcend a simultaneously dense and empty screenplay. For some reason, the general effect it leaves is lesser to the experience offered by the individual scenes. Its narrative basis exclusively lies on the traditional ideals of the western genre (self-sufficiency, honor, revenge and the unavoidable challenge of natural forces, while they are paid the respect they deserve). And sure, all that is spiced by wide doses of pseudo-philosophy in order to prove that the main character's physical torture has a cosmic meaning we can barely understand (""God is a squirrel""). In summary: much ado about nothing. Having said that... what a good ado. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu and the brilliant cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki repeated the amazing visual ballet of Birdman, with the graceful camera floating without any difficulty over complicated sequences in order to display the most dramatic details of the action and the performances in a simultaneously casual and precise way, sometimes with open shots which illustrate the geography of the locations, and sometimes, with those eloquent extreme close-ups which never feel confined. Unfortunately, what The Revenant couldn't preserve from Birdman are the deliciously intricate screenplay and its rich tapestry of character and emotion, which, after all, ended up being more important than any tracking shot or invisible integration of special effects. On the opposite, The Revenant is a simplistic linear tale with unidimensional characters who suffer a lot... but express little beyond of what is evident. Hugh Glass is the hero with a strong volition and a very clear motivation; Fitzgerald is the devious, treacherous and intolerant villain. And that's it. Two hours and a half of a slow chase, extraordinarily shot but without a bigger dramatic ambition. Sure, besides of the hero and the villain, we also have another faction of persecutors to complicate things a bit and bring us a lesson about the evilness of ""white man""; but leaving that aside, they don't have much relevance, at least until the screenplay needs them as a predictable deus-ex-machina. On the positive side, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy received deserved recognition for their excellent performances, and I would also like to mention Domhnall Gleeson's unfairly ignored work, in which he credibly displays a good range of emotions. This is undoubtedly a ""style over substance"" case, but in spite of that, The Revenant was a very interesting experience, and it definitely deserves to be watched on a big screen in order to appreciate its technical triumphs better."

","I normally like these type of movies ,love survivorman , yet this was an awful movie IMO and way too unrealistic. The fact that Leonardo got nominated for this and Will Smith didn't shows what those old white guys like.They remind me of the NFL back room old white guys just wanting to keep rolling in the money whatever the cost.Last year Selma was ignored and specifically David Oyelowo.<br/><br/>The phoney part of the Revenant ,besides the bear , to me was when he was in the freezing water with huge heavy coats on, didn't sink and didn't freeze and after getting out had no dry clothes or a fire. And how many grunts and groans were in this script for him."
"lesamuraiproductions","7","1","2","28 January 2016"," Everything's good but it doesn't work so much!
","It's hard to evaluate a film where I liked a lot of aspects but still it did not convince me in its entirety. <br/><br/>It's not the first time a thing like that happens with Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.<br/><br/>Trying to perform an ''objective'' analysis I can say:<br/><br/>1) The photography is simply amazing. 2) The direction is always a high level one when it comes to Iñárritu. Here he does not propose a (fake) global sequence-shot like in Birdman but he alternates masterful long-takes with intense close-ups, confirming his great talent 3) The editing is remarkable 4) The acting (which hardly ever interests me) is excellent, especially the antagonist (Tom Hardy) works fine, so when you have a good antagonist and a protagonist as DiCaprio (at his best) the job can't help being good 5) The plot proposes many issues, all meaningful (father-son relationship, racism, violated rights of Native Americans, the struggle for survival, Nature, solidarity between ethnic groups in conflict, revenge), perhaps too many to be condensed into a two and a half hour film.<br/><br/>I think what works the least is that Iñárritu's directing style does not go hand in hand with the narration: they are not symbiotic and you can perceive the dystonia.<br/><br/>To give an example in order to understand you can think of Audioslave: an extraordinary guitarist (Tom Morello) and a terrific singer (Chris Cornell) have never really worked out as a group, never reaching the level of RATM or Soundgarden anyway.<br/><br/>It is therefore a missed masterpiece, but it works just fine at a movie theatre"

","A revengeful survivor story set in a terrific landscape.<br/><br/>It's beautiful to look at from the word go but it's a painful to see the protagonist coping with adversities and becoming a hero. It's a story set in the 19th century so there are horses for commuting and stones for making fire. Yet, the theme is universal and so it can be considered a contemporary story with a couple of centuries old backdrop. <br/><br/>I went to see the film for two reasons, the director Alejandro Inarittu and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio and both seemed to in good form although not in their prime form. Nevertheless, that's enough to make a good film. <br/><br/>Technically, the cinematography is top notch and the production design is terrific. The whole crew has to be complimented for working a whole film in such a drastic and unpredictable weather and landscape. The editing could have been more precise. Too many frames of nature, I felt and I hoped for more characters than nature. Makeup is amazing and I suppose it's makeup and costume design is one of the finest I saw in recent times. What disappointed me was the screenplay. This film seemed a bit stretched out and predictability killed the fun. When you know, the path and also the destiny, there is no fun anymore and this film showed me both after few minutes into it.<br/><br/>Leonardo has invested a lot of his time and his physical transformation and fearless acting tells why he is one of the finest actors ever. I got my money worth, solely by his performance. Though for me his Aviator, Blood Diamond, and The Departed are his best, this performance stands tall too.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a well-written film but 20 minutes short, this would be a great film. As it is, it's fine for me.<br/><br/>A 3/5 for a good film, but once again full marks to Leonardo DiCaprio. Respect."

","While this movie is shot beautifully and visually looks really good at times with some amazing camera-work, almost everything else in it is average.<br/><br/>For those who are not familiar with the story, it's based on a real life events. But, ""based on real life events"" is a bit strong word for it. Movie itself is (loosely) based on a book from few years back that is (very loosely) based on real adventures of Hugh Glass. And that means that in reality, this movie is pure fiction inspired by his multiple adventures slapped into one.<br/><br/>While there were Fitz and Bridger and other people and there was a bear attack at some point in Hugh's life, that's about as much as the movie has any resemblance to the real life events. For more, just google Hugh Glass and compare with the movie.<br/><br/>This was not a critique of the movie for not sticking 100% to real story, but I think it's important to note things like that and mention them. It's a fun trivia to know for sure but you shouldn't weigh movie quality by this. Also, if by some bad luck, you find yourself in similar situation do not look back to this movie for guidance, watch Les Stroud's Survivorman instead.<br/><br/>Now, DiCaprio, Hardy, Poulter and Gleeson,they all give good performances but by design, the don't have much room to do something more with characters. Leo himself had some amazing and way better performances recently than this. So ughing and aghing through mud and snow and having painful face expressions can go only so far. And he does that great, but that's about it, even with a lot of help from great camera-work and direction. Character himself was written like that, he did what he could with it and it's solid. Not Oscar worthy, but solid. Same goes for the others.<br/><br/>I can't say what could make this movie better, it just is what it is and that's okay. Story was already changed to be more engaging than it maybe was in real life. Characters are boosted up, there's revenge boost as well and yet it's still somehow just an okay movie with only thing that's exceptional is it's visual style and the way it was shot. Without that it would be just an average 5/10 movie. So just for the visuals, and some wilderness cruelty, you should probably watch this movie."
"temrok9","8","1","2","24 January 2016"," Into the wild
","This was the most anticipated movie of the year for me, for several reasons.Truth is it starts impressively, for almost half an hour, maybe more, it stands as a unique cinematic experience, an immersion in an almost savage stage, brilliantly directed, where the characters seem more parts of the situation than people who are good or bad. On the way, as the plot unravels, however, you get a feeling of repetition, plus a tendency to leave a message(about the Indians and the white invaders of their land), which comes a little unconvincing(Dancing with the wolves was more convincing in such an attitude).Worst of all, the plot left me indifferent.I didn't care at all about Di Caprio's pursuit, and I even found Fitzerald(maybe because he was Hardy, but not only for this reason) a more interesting character, and a more savage one, but not at all the bad guy the movie finds at the end to be its convenient scapegoat. Not a wise finale for such an ambitious film that might have been the best Nature movie ever.But as the value of a film lies not only in the production virtues, or even in the virtuosic direction, but in its general attitude, the Revenant lacks, in my opinion, the greatness of a Hertzog film(with whose films has a certain affinity).In fact, after Birdman, I expected more from Inaritou.He has evolved as a director(he is very impressive)from the times of 21 grams and Babel, but he still has to avoid the simplicity of the supposed messages he wishes to convey. Unfortunately, the Revenant turned to be, for me, a dramatically uneven movie, and the pace was somehow lost in the way.Yet, there is some greatness in part of it;maybe my ambivalence clears out with a second look."

Iñárritu made a movie, again relying not solely on the actors but on every other ingredient which helps make a movie great. I am not sure why Leo was casted, any other actor would have been as great since there were not much of dialogues. But then again, actors like Leo can help give a movie good opening but the rest of course depends on the movie itself. Anyways, coming to the movie, i did not find anything great in the movie except the scenes which were of course natural. The pace is slow may be too slow, the story is okay but nothing great. Flashbacks failed to elicit any emotions other than again slowing down the movie. Leo will finally win an Oscar for the movie i think but personally i would have imagined him winning an Oscar for a movie like Aviator or The departed which were based on the actors and without the actors those movies become weak.

Unfortunately the cinematography greatly supports my 7 rating, which might tell you what I think of the story. One can easily watch the first 40mins and the last 20mins and not really miss anything. Aside from the disaster, ""The Lone Ranger"", I've never complained about a movie's length... but here it is, ""The Revenant"" is an hour too long - the good thing is there's plenty of opportunity to go to the bathroom and grab popcorn without missing anything. I'm not sure why the movie has all the hype, unless you're into 90mins of a guy limping along finding shelter and something to eat. Best Actor? Really? I love DiCaprio, but this was far from his best role to date. The character didn't have the foundation for an Oscar nod in my opinion, and it would have been relatively easy for MANY actors to turn in a similar performance. I suspect there once was a compelling script here that was greatly tarnished my another writer or director's theme emphasis which resulted in numerous scenes that didn't add to the story, thus causing it to drag - like DiCaprio through the snow.<br/><br/>Sorry. It only deserved one Oscar nod. Having said that, there are phenomenal individual scenes, and the cinematography is worthy of the big screen - so go see it.

","Seems like G. Iñárritu didn't have enough attention with his previous film ""Birdman"", because he came up with an angrier, stronger and more daring masterpiece.<br/><br/>""The Revenant"" is based on the true story of American explorer Hugh Glass, who was left for dead after being attacked by a bear and later seeks for revenge.<br/><br/>First, Leonardo DiCaprio. This is possibly his best role to date, you can see how he has matured as an actor, every minute he's on the screen he shows us human instincts beyond his own limits. Tom Hardy is also a great addition as the main antagonist.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil anything, but the storyline is good as well (even if it's not 100% accurate). The script and characters were superbly developed and the pacing was well-crafted. The bear scene is one of the best sequences I've seen in a long time. Every shot of the film is given by huge technical effort. <br/><br/>Finally, the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is another Oscar- worthy work. Using nothing but natural light, the image of the film is sometimes beautiful and sometimes haunting.<br/><br/>""The Revenant"" is one of the best films of the year, with a well- written script, intense and visceral sequences, and an excellent cinematography. This gives DiCaprio, Iñárritu and Lubezki another shot for the Awards Season."

If I didn't know this story was true I don't know how vested I would be in this, but knowing this story really happened it made the movie incredible. The camera work was brilliant and the CGI was tremendous in a great bear scene that will be talked about going forward. Don't miss this one if you can help it. This is about a man who overcomes adversity over and over again. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because 20 minutes could have been trimmed, but that about it.

"zardoz-13","10","2","7","26 January 2016"," An Unforgettable Epic!!!
","Webster's Dictionary defines the word 'revenant' as ""one that returns after death or a long absence."" This word summarizes accurately the adversity that Oscar-nominated actor Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass confronts in ""Birdman"" director Alejandro González Iñárritu's ""The Revenant,"" an unforgettable frontier yarn set in early 1820's America. Struggling against virtually insuperable odds to stay alive after a mama bear mauls him, Hugh Glass watches in horror when his own comrades abandon him for dead. Glass' mind-boggling battle for survival occurred during an ill-fated trapping expedition in what is now South Dakota. Grizzly not only describes the formidable female bear that attacks Glass, but also the obstacles that Glass must conquer during his desperate fight to get back to civilization and wreak vengeance. Although this gorgeously-lensed movie is based in part on Michael Punke's 2002 novel, the real Hugh Glass was a celebrated contemporary of fellow mountain men Jedediah Smith and Grizzly Adams. Glass led an adventurous life as a smuggler, ship's captain, pirate, frontiersman, trapper, fur trader, hunter, and explorer. Oscar-nominated Mexican director Iñárritu dwells on this chapter of Glass' extraordinary life, and he surrounds DiCaprio with a brawny supporting cast. You've never seen ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" like you see him in ""The Revenant,"" and the closest DiCaprio movie to feature such a dreadful predicament is the historical French costume drama ""The Man in the Iron Mask."" Tom Hardy, who played both Max in ""Mad Max Fury Road"" and Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" makes a despicable villain that you will abhor with a passion. The majestic scenery that serves as a backdrop for this epic journey makes the hero and the villain seem larger-than-life as they negotiate a landscape rife with peril. Iñárritu spent nine months shooting ""The Revenant"" in chronological order at a variety of scenic locations in British Columbia, Montana, San Francisco, and finally Argentina. Oscar-nominated cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and he shot this masterpiece using only natural light to heighten the authenticity.<br/><br/>As ""The Revenant"" unfolds, Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson of ""Ex Machina"") of the Rocky Mountain Trading Company has hired Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio of ""Inception"") to serve as a scout for a fur trapping expedition. Things take a turn for the worse early on as savage Arikara Indians attack their camp. Many of the trappers die in the fracas, and Glass suggests that they return to their Fort Kiowa headquarters by an overland route. John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy of ""Lawless""), a thoroughly obnoxious trapper from Texas, hates the idea, but he goes along reluctantly with it. Meantime, while he is out foraging for food, Glass spots two bawling bear cubs and then sees their aggressive mother. This pugnacious bear launches herself at Glass and turns him every which way but loose. Mind you, Glass manages to squeeze off one shot from his single-shot rifle before the bear tears into him and devastates our hero with her six-inch razor-sharp claws. Eventually, the wounded bear succumbs to Glass' bullet, and our hero finishes the beast off with a huge knife. Captain Henry orders his men build a stretcher for Glass, but the expedition halts when the terrain prevents them from carrying Glass any farther. Moreover, the woebegone Glass appears in such ghastly condition that Henry feels certain he will die. He promises extra pay to anybody who will stick around until Glass dies and give him a Christian burial. Fitzgerald and Jim Bridger (Will Poulter of ""The Maze Runner"") both volunteer to stay with Glass until the inevitable. Naturally, Glass' Pawnee Indian son Hawk (newcomer Forrest Goodluck) refuses to desert his dad. Eventually, Fitzgerald grows impatient with Glass when he doesn't die. Not only does he kill Hawk, but also he tries to bury Glass alive. Fearing for his own life, Bridger accommodates Fitzgerald's disloyalty. Miraculously, Glass survives and embarks upon an incredible journey to reach civilization and pay back Fitzgerald for his treachery. <br/><br/>For the record, ""The Revenant"" is the third movie about Glass's astonishing exploits. The first movie was ""Vanishing Point"" director Richard C. Sarafian's ""Man in the Wilderness"" (1971) with Irish actor Richard Harris as the resilient hunter who lived through a bear attack, but his fellow trappers left him behind to die in isolation. While the character that Harris portrayed in ""Man in the Wilderness"" was called Zachary Bass, the Bass character was based largely on Hugh Glass and his legendary exploits. ""Man in the Wilderness"" ranks as an above-average adventure narrative, but it isn't half as good as Iñárritu's ""The Revenant."" Far more abysmal is the hopelessly inferior ""Apache Blood"" (1975), the second cinematic account of Glass's grizzly encounter. Vern Piehl spread himself too thin as producer, director, and cinematographer on this mediocre reenactment. In Piehl's saddle-sore cavalry versus the Indians saga, a veteran army scout named Sam Glass tangles with a bear and emerges the worse for wear. ""Man in the Wilderness"" simulated the bear attack with an actual bear wrestling with its trainer. In the amateurish ""Apache Blood,"" the bear attacks the scout as he is refilling his canteen. The actor gropes somebody in a bear costume. The mauling in ""The Revenant"" looks far more realistic despite the conspicuous CGI work involved behind the scenes to replicate the savage event. Primarily, ""Man in the Wilderness,"" ""Apache Blood,"" and ""The Revenant"" follow the same plot line. Our indestructible protagonist suffers at the claws of a furious mama bear, and everybody deems him dead for the long haul. Punke's novel as well as all three films follow the plot up to that point. In all four adaptations, Glass's companions betray him. Villainous Percy Herbert betrayed Richard Harris in ""Man in the Wilderness."" Cowardly cavalry troopers left Glass to fend for himself in ""Apache Blood."" Tom Hardy displays no loyalty to DiCaprio in ""The Revenant."" Occasionally, the action slows down because our protagonist wanders alone in desolation. Nevertheless, ""The Revenant"" qualifies as a stunning film that deserves all twelve of its Oscar nominations."

"zdrahusz","9","2","7","14 January 2016"," Freezing in a good way
","When I walked into the theater my first thought was that it was warm. It was full of men and women sitting in chairs not knowing what to expect from this movie. By the time it started I forgot the feeling of warmth and was sucked into this film. <br/><br/>The Revenant (R) starring Leonardo DiCaprio (Glass) and Tom Hardy (Fitzgerald).<br/><br/>It has been awhile since I wanted a film to win all of the awards that it is nominated for, but this is one of them. The directing was spot on, never have I been so wowed and gut wrenched like I was here. Seeing the bear maul Glass was one of the most intense scenes I've seen in a long time. The lighting in this movie was beautiful, see those mountains and rivers in natural light really added to the immersion of this film, by the mid point of this movie I felt like I was as cold as the character Glass. Leonardo DiCaprio was a perfect choice for this film, he really brought all he could give to this role, I really felt the pain he must have felt when (Spoiler) His son died (End Spoiler). I must also give a round of applause to Tom Hardy who played Fitzgerald. He really made the character an asshole, which he was suppose too, he also gave the character a really good accent with a few lines that did sound a little bit like Bane. <br/><br/>Now this film is not for the sake of fun, it is a very dark and gripping movie. There are many intense and brutal death scenes that will make you feel uneasy, but that my friends is a good thing, for a movie to make me feel sick at the sight of violence is good. This film is also very gory and full of blood, some of that gore comes from (Spoilers) when Glass finds the Native who helps him back to health and feeds him bloody buffalo, another scene is the confrontation between Glass and Fitzgerald. (End Spoiler)<br/><br/>Although this film was very entertaining I felt that it went on a tad bit to long and that some of the scenes at the mid point could have been taken out, and I also think Glass could have used more lines but all in all I really recommend this film, it has a gripping story, some great characters and for the first time in awhile a good January movie.<br/><br/>I give The Revenant a 9/10"
"mhamaddarin","10","2","7","9 January 2016"," Brilliant movie
","I walked into the theater expecting a great film; somehow I got more. The film from start to finish was beautiful, every shot could be framed and put in to an art gallery. However, if the film was only a spectacle for the eyes, then it is no more than the newest Transformer film. Thus, obviously, the film was more. Although the plot was simple, a man left for dead who seeks revenge on those who are responsible, there is no moment in the movie where you will be bored. The audience remains hooked and continuously roots for Hugh Glass (the protagonist of the film) even as the odds of his survival become slimmer every second. This is due to the captivating soundtrack, spectacular cinematography, and of course stellar acting performances. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, although one with very little dialogue, is mesmerizing. DiCaprio did not need to say any words, in fact, if he had it could have made his performance silly by overacting. Instead, DiCaprio is able to express his emotions with his physical performance. Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson also gave fantastic performances. Hardy taking a role that was outside his comfort zone, the antagonist, and somehow manages to own it. Another name that needs to be mentioned is Alejandro González Iñárritu, who yet again delivers a film ahead of it's time. If the Oscars go as they should, this should be that film that pisses off all the other films because it is hogging all of the Oscars. <br/><br/>Nine months of filming in remote wild environment, natural light, very good cast and few CGI have produced an exceptionally good film. This is an epic masterpiece and a real achievement of cinematography."

","This movie was awesome it had everything you could want from it. Multiple themes from the plot, great acting from Leo but really tom hardy stole the show, thrill, intense action and battle scenes, and a ton of gore sometimes too much to watch but it was awesome either way. Multiple themes showing on what man is willing to do to survive the I humane things that they may do. It has the base story of revenue after being left for dead. And the multiple ""turf"" despite a between more than one Native American tribe and Europeans and white Americans. These disputes lead to gory intense battles that had some very disturbing and almost scary scenes. The key to the action sequences in this movie was the camera work. The camera angles were unbelievable making you feel as if you were freezing in those terrible conditions fighting brutally Native American tribes coming at you. This movie was very good and I highly recommend you go see it with warning that is disgustingly gory at times beyond your imagination. I believe Leo could get his Oscar for this one."
"JaysonT","7","2","7","3 January 2016"," Beautifully Filmed but REALLY Confusing!
","I just got back from seeing The Revenant. Took my friend Helen to see it- we're both poor so we had to see a matinée and pool our money together. The movie is a total question mark. We both kept saying out loud ""What's going on???"" To audible groans from our fellow audience members. At one point, Helen got up and said ""They're going to kill Leo- might as well leave now."" It was the scene where they put cloth over his eyes after that bear attack. I convinced her to stay.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio plays a 1800s frontiersman in the rural wilderness, who's a fur trader. When their camp is attacked by vicious Indians (Native Americans), they fight and then flee.<br/><br/>Then a bear attacks DiCaprio and in a gruesome 10 minutes we witness lot's of blood and screaming. I had to cover my eyes, and Helen went to the bathroom during this horrid turning of events. <br/><br/>Now it starts getting confusing. Leo's gang finds him, and because he knows where they're going- they agree to carry him around on a stretcher. But Tom Hardy, the evil one of the bunch, doesn't like this. He's a power hungry mongrel. He insists they leave him for dead. But DiCaprio's companion, someone who looks Native American too, pleas they don't do that. But somehow- Leo gets abandoned, and the Native American friend is killed by Hardy. <br/><br/>Leo then discovers the dead body of his friend- and pursues to cross the wilderness on his own. He befriends the Native Americans, saves a woman from being raped, hooks up with ANOTHER Native American who looks like his dead friend - and then has to hide in a dead horse because the bad guys return. Then he finally gets back to camp, and seeks revenge on Hardy. There's a final battle between them, and he finally kills Hardy. <br/><br/>Then he breathes heavily in the snow- see's a ""spirit"" of his dead friend, and the camera blacks out before we know if he dies or not. Just like the director did with his previous film, Birdman.<br/><br/>Helen and I agree that while the movie was visually stunning, it didn't make much sense. There was no character development. Leonardo Dicaprio spends most of the movie mumbling. ""I couldn't understand what he was saying"", Helen added. ""He's supposed to be a fur trader. As a salesman, he wasn't very customer focused. I like to hear what my salesman says to me."" We laughed at this, knowing it was a joke. But seriously- who was DiCaprio's character? There's no backstory. Hardy was also poorly written. Just evil to be evil. <br/><br/>Everyone says Leo is winning an Oscar for this, and he does have some scenes of intensity (his big Bear scene, his reflection in the cabin towards the end)- but it's nuanced and not very showy. Hard to win when you're too subdued. <br/><br/>And the whole Native American war didn't make a lick of sense either. What was the purpose for their battle? What benefit did either team get? They were stuck in the middle of a cold, heartless deadline. Why not make peace and work together?<br/><br/>FINAL GRADE: C for Confusing!"
"subxerogravity","8","5","27","28 December 2015"," An emotional masterpiece of cinema
","It's takes you on that type of exhausting ride that you get watching Black Swan.<br/><br/>The movie is about one man's struggle to survive the wilderness after being fatally wounded. <br/><br/>The film reminds me of The Martian. Though both movies seem very different, they are both about men surviving in ruff Terran in the worse circumstances, and they both rely heavily on their lead actors. I realize through this movie, I'm a bigger fan of watching Matt Damon for hours, but Leonardo DiCaprio does give an amazing performance. Leo made me feel for this man, who could have given up at anytime and we all would have understood, but he keeps going driven by the love of his son and pure vengeance. <br/><br/>The Revenant makes you feel the cold winter. Every bruise and cut on Leo's body, given to him by a fight he has with a bear, one of the best fights in cinema history I might add. Some of the things that he did to survive will make you cringe, but Leo gets down and dirty in order to make us believe, and I did. <br/><br/>The Wilderness is no joke and The Revenant is no holds bar in showing it to you.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy gives a great performance in the film as the antagonist more concern about his money than the welfare of others. Also enjoined Domhnall Gleeson as the honorable captain of the crew Leo and Tom were a part of. It's mostly Leo in this picture, but he did have a good supporting crew. <br/><br/>The cinematography was great, the visual effects were perfect, the Camera puts you right there in the action, and the action was as savage as the wilderness it takes place in. I am impressed highly with this. Be ready to get caught up in the Revenant, cause it won't let you go, till the end."

And is this really a true story? There is a real man living this hell??? But Wikipedia tells so, so I guess there is.<br/><br/>The movie itself is amazing. Alejandro always gives a good movie, I'm sure. I could see how Indian lived back then and how the strangers disturbed their normal life and ""stole"" what should be theirs.

","A frontiersman (Leonardo DiCaprio) on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team.<br/><br/>The story of Hugh Glass has gone through a number of revisions in the last two hundred years. There is first of all the true story, which could never be known -- Glass himself likely embellished or mis-remembered certain details. We then have various biographies, a novel, and an earlier film ""Man in the Wilderness"" (1971). Surprisingly, the latter has never had a home video release. This seems like the optimal time to cash in. But that is neither here nor there.<br/><br/>In this latest version, Glass has a son, which increases the emotional factor. Is it historically accurate? No. But we should not allow the facts to get in the way of a good story.<br/><br/>With the Academy Award nominations out, ""The Revenant"" has become the film to beat in a variety of categories. With twelve nominations, it is certain to win a few. And the big buzz is that this is the year that Leonardo DiCaprio will take home his first statuette.<br/><br/>DiCaprio has been in the acting game for about thirty years and has had countless memorable roles. Some are more serious than others, but he has always done a fine job, even if the films did not call for such professionalism. And as Hugh Glass, this is no doubt the finest performance of his career. Through much of the film, he is left unable to speak and his acting must come out non-verbally, which is considerably more challenging. But winning the award is not supposed to be about an individual actor's best role, but about the best role of the year. Even by those standards, the odds look good. Eddie Redmayne and Bryan Cranston are formidable, and Michael Fassbender is a potential winner (even if he looks nothing like Steve Jobs). But did anyone throw themselves in a role as deep as DiCaprio? Probably not.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy, who plays the antagonist, is up for a supporting actor award. By all means, he deserves it. His devilish Fitzgerald is every bit as good as DiCaprio's Glass, and in some ways even more fun to watch. He is a morally reprehensible monster. But the competition in this category is a bit steeper because of a very unlikely opponent: Sylvester Stallone. Few people would consider Stallone a great actor, but he is getting many accolades for ""Creed"". He also has another factor on his side: the subjectivity of Oscar voting. The voters will often vote less on the individual roles and sometimes on an actor's career, especially later in their life. This could be Stallone's chance at a lifetime achievement Oscar. So, hardy deserves to win, but he is not guaranteed by any means.<br/><br/>There are a handful of nominations in makeup, costume and production which could get a win. One of the strongest aspects of the film, though, is Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography. This is a tough category, because you have the incredible Roger Deakins and a bold 70mm look on ""Hateful Eight"". But Lubezki is right now the man to beat. He has eight nominations to his credit, and has won the last two years (for ""Gravity"" and ""Birdman""). And, frankly, this might be his best work yet. There are some long fight scenes that are reminiscent of Seamus McGarvey's work in ""Atonement"" (2007). Could Lubezki win three years in a row? Could be.<br/><br/>All that praise aside, there is one category that the nomination was quite wrong: Best Visual Effects. The film has a notorious bear-mauling scene. And while the effects are quite good, there is never any doubt that the bear is a computer simulation. A very nice one, but still fake just the same. And that may take the audience out of the movie a bit, as this otherwise excellent look at the wilderness has a very modern image of a bear transposed in it... This award may end up going to ""Star Wars"" regardless, as it tends to be the category for awarding movies otherwise not considered Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>In short: is this DiCaprio's best role? Yes. Also possibly Tom Hardy's best role. And some excellent cinematography. Movie of the year? Perhaps, or perhaps not."

","It hasn't been far already into 2016 and there's already a fantastic film that captivates your mind, body and even spirit to break or even open further; and that film to be labelled as a 'Top Film' is The Revenant.<br/><br/>I won't go into much of the film's plot but I'll keep it brief; inspired around the famous Hugh Glass (who has been labelled as history's toughest survivor) it tells his deep and yet engaging adventure that see's him fighting not only for himself but his quest for justice when he is left for dead by an emotionless, careless and even cowardly member of his crew.<br/><br/>What makes The Revenant so amazing is that it's directed by both award winning and critically acclaimed filmmaker Alejandro G Inarritu with his style of storytelling, themes and character that make the silver screen shine. There is so much to take away and grip from this so I'll try to give my best of it all without spoiling it for you; firstly the film's themes include 'Survival of the human spirit', 'revenge' 'God and spirituality' and they help to keep the audience not only intrigued to the plot but the way the characters are seen from our eyes. Importantly, with Leo's character (Hugh Glass) we are shown that he's not only a tough human but he's battling his own demons that push him to be as strong yet broken in his path for revenge. Leo has played many great roles in his acting career but I think that this role is his best and truly toughest to play, it's bound to get him award nominations again as like other years but this is indeed something that the Oscars should deeply consider for him to receive. Tom Hardy is fantastic as well; his character is truly a monster that is emotionless, heartless and really driven for the audience to despise.<br/><br/>Cinematography was outstanding throughout and the locations where the film takes place are 100% real and really captures the realism of the story's setting from wet forests, raging rivers, snowy mountains and isolated trails. So much detail and thought has been put into this and the efforts from both the cast and the crew behind the camera make it seem so believably strong. Sound mixing and editing is strong too, with sounds of birds, winds and even breathing that makes it sound so beautiful but it's is composed soundtrack that makes it seem so emotional and yet captivating, from Glass's visions to even seeing him survive the harsh environment make these worthy candidates for Oscars and further awards in technical achievement in film. Again, we see camera shots that seem a 'one shot take' and even in one sequence we switch from one character to another. The violence is brutal, bloody and well executed and it can be confronting for some.<br/><br/>Overall, The Renevant is a breathtaking, captivating, and brutal but beautifully shot film that has so much to grasp but it will take an open mind to get it's themes and character development. This is indeed on my list (and the first entry) of best films for 2016.<br/><br/>5\5 - Nick"

A slow sweeping long take featuring beautiful scenery and the calming flow of water soon interrupted by the interference of man.<br/><br/>The opening battle sequence sounds like something that would be described in something like a Star wars film, however this (and it is a) battle sequence is one to take your breath away. A brutal depiction of small scale war, the scene takes place in one shot weaving in and out between bullets, arrows and death. Putting viewers in the middle of the battlefield, creating personal conflict. There aren't really any 'sides' to this scene, all that's present is desperation and utter unnecessary viciousness.<br/><br/>The actors of the film all did stellar jobs on their performances, more so than most in films I've ever seen in my life. I'm not one to recognize great acting or even bad acting, usually I buy the actors playing as their characters, but in this it was beyond that. I believed that Hardy's Fitzgerald was the biggest scumbag on the face of the earth and I felt the betrayal, desperation and will to survive through DiCaprio's protagonist. Man did this movie make me hate Tom Hardy! But most importantly I just have to mention the actor Domhnall Gleeson, this guy is the definition of diversity. Most recently he played a cartoonishly evil Star wars character in The Force Awakens, before that I'd last seen him in Unbroken and earliest I'd seen him in About Time as a charming romantic comedy lead. I look forward to seeing more of this guy and literally don't know what to expect from him either.<br/><br/>Beyond the actors however making it's appearances larger than life was simply the setting. Beautiful shots all throughout the film, used as not only establishing shots but interesting angles and shots for even moments of dialogue and general conversation. The Revenant is a visual marvel. From the unique look of the world we see through the film's directors eyes to the astonishingly impressive long takes that I was in love with. The film took what I loved about Birdman (The film making) and added (What I thought Birdman was lacking) fantastic characters and an interesting story which happened to revolve around revenge and survival.<br/><br/>Another thing about the world this film was set in was that it felt full and real. Other people in the film had their own stories, their own fights and motives that we saw glimpses of even though we ultimately followed solely the protagonist. This made the movie feel larger, like a real piece of history.<br/><br/>And not to mention the sincere intensity that this movie holds throughout its entire run time. (Which is saying something considering it's just short of 3 hours.) The pure violence in this movie was actually quite shocking, and that's saying something coming from somebody who has watched some of the ""Most disturbing films of all time.""<br/><br/>Early on in the film is an in-famous scene featuring a bear, I won't spoil anything beyond this scene but I will say that you can feel this scene. You believe this scene. It holds you and it keeps going for longer than comfortable and it's great. This isn't a movie you ""Enjoy"" It's a movie that you experience and personally, a movie I fell in love with almost instantly.<br/><br/>The unique lighting style and the subtle sounds showing that the movie wasn't afraid to use silence combine to make a realistic and fierce portrayal of a look into a fictionalized past. It's a long one but I feel like the pacing is perfect, I wasn't bored at all and there were times where not much was actually happening but not once did I feel like it was slow and dragging. This is one tough act to follow, and as much as I'm looking forward to movies like Civil War and Deadpool, I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be my favourite movie of the year. <br/><br/>10/10"
"AIANDAS","8","2","8","1 January 2016"," Visceral Poem
","2-words to describe this film: VISCERAL POEM. What with the brutal exteriors the cast and crew had to endure the minimal dialogue that was spoken only when necessary and the nonstop tour de force we witness from the moment we see the bear attack and onwards the pace does not let up on the relentless conflicts. Such as man vs nature; man vs man; man vs God.<br/><br/>Although brilliant this is a grim film against some spectacular national parks in Montana; Alberta, Canada and even Argentina! So don't expect to be uplifted at the end of this film. It plays like an opera in its tragic scope and some of the brutal and heinous crimes we witness and I am not talking about the bear attack only.<br/><br/>Cinematography and camera close ups truly bring us very close to the action with wide angle lens that gets close to a character's face. But like I said it plays out like an opera whose usual scope is tragic as at the end of this film in its wake is littered with dead and/or mutilated bodies whether scalping and or castration. One person who should not see this film is Bill Cosby!<br/><br/>I am not giving it a 10 because it is a very angry film. It does have its moments of redemption like when a Native American cares for Dicaprio (Hugh Glass) and encloses him in a tepee to recover from his bear wounds only later for a French frontier group to brutally hang the native American.<br/><br/>It speaks very negatively about human nature albeit true but nevertheless it is a gut wrenching and draining film. After you see this film go out and have a stiff drink to cathartically clean yourself."
"dschreib67","7","2","8","27 December 2015"," I see some similarities to Jedidiah Smith's story in this film...
","Fur trappers attacked at a river. Survivors escape. Extreme cold winters. Barely surviving. Mr. Glass (Mr Smith) survives a grizzly bear attack. His injuries are life threatening,with half his face, ear, and scalp stitched back as good as can be by the only willing associate. I'm surprised nobody else has noticed these similarities. This is not actually a review. It is just an observation. I get my facts from a documentary entitled, Taming the Wild West: The Legend of Jedediah Smith. It is very compelling story about an extremely brave and talented pioneer in the history of the wild west. I recommend watching the documentary as well as this movie. The documentary is actually more entertaining."

The naturalistic beauty of 17th century America that is visualized in this movie is beyond anything I've ever experienced in film.<br/><br/>Hugh Glasses' story is a legendary one, and they couldn't have honored his legacy any better than this.

"Rawal_Afzal","10","2","9","14 January 2016"," A Leonardo DiCaprio special in the greatest survival film ever!
","Firstly, I must state here that I was so confused about what the title of my post should be because I could think of so many. It is the most painful, hurting and brutal film that I have watched in my life. All of it had such great realness to the film that it was impossible not to feel Hugh Glass' pain and suffering, to the extent that I almost felt like crying at some of the scenes. Leonardo's unbelievably awesome performance has left me speechless. Hats off to such a brilliant actor, wow!<br/><br/>This film has involved my emotions like not many films have, and reading that some of it was in fact inspired from true events has left me struck (and most of my praise, if not all, obviously applies to the book that this film is based upon). The realness of it made me reflect on what life could turn out to be for some souls and what great trials and ordeals life can demand from some people, and how fortunate we are after all in life despite the constant complaining. Walking out of the theatre, neither myself nor my brother-in-law could utter a word for a good 10 minutes. There was this heaviness in the voice.<br/><br/>The start itself was a dazzling one with that shoot-out, it made me feel that we in for a good film, but then came the mauling from that bear. Despite it being a film, I bet it couldn't have ever been more real than this. It sent shivers down my spine, and the second time it attacked him I literally felt his pain and utter humiliation. One of the most terrifying scenes ever!<br/><br/>Then came the scene that was personal to me to the extremes; when they leave Hugh alone to die in the forest. Now, this is not the first time someone was abandoned in a film, but the injuries had so much hindered his physical movement that he was completely dependent on others' help. Despite facing so much in life bravely and with a smile on my face, and it is something that my family members often laugh about, it is an established fact that right from my childhood days my biggest fear has always been being left alone (and this fear developed after an incident in childhood). I can't bear it, never can! For example, if my father is alone at home with me, he has to first alert me even going to the balcony and has to return within a given time frame. So adding that personal touch to it, coupled with the earth shattering scene of his son being murdered before his eyes, and then not even being able to tell due to the temporary loss of speech caused by the injuries, it almost made me cry.<br/><br/>Then we proceed to his survival, which is perhaps an even more touching part of the film. He crawls, he fights, he eats things that we might end up vomiting by the mere thought of it, he sleeps ""In the horse"" (yes, that is literal, not metaphorical in any sense!), and reaches his people, takes his revenge. Every scene of it deserves an essay written on it. Amidst all this, the cinematography deserves a special mention. This film is scenic beauty and contains awesome pictures of mountains, streams, trees, and of course, the relentless snow! It added a perfect mix to the story and wonderful performances.<br/><br/>""As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight. You breathe... keep breathing."" This is brilliant, and in every way inspirational and a lesson for anyone struggling in his life. There's nothing more beautiful than your own life, therefore fight to keep it. It is your very existence, and once gone it won't return. Somehow, these quotes sounded better and more powerful in the language that he spoke and reading these lines translated on the screen felt more catching to the memory.<br/><br/>It is, again, one of the most unique films that I have watched in my life. Since it felt so real, what I watched yesterday was not a film. It was reality, or in better words, the brutal aspects of reality. I have so many things to say about the film... I am eagerly waiting to talk to her tomorrow on Skype and tell her the details of a once in a lifetime cinema experience."
"Geckomaniac3","10","2","9","6 January 2016"," This movie is incredible.... but is the true story behind it better?
","So I've watched many many movies, probably over 150 alone last year (2015). And this movie... made me speechless! The only things my mouth could spit our were ""What the F***?"" and ""Oh my God!"" during some of it's moments! (Caution Interstellar Spoiler: Skip to the next paragraph) I was drawn deeper into this movie than Matthew McConaughey into a black hole! (Yeah right? ""What a bad pun!"")<br/><br/>I knew this film would be full of blood and probably gore but WOW! That was intense! You know these moments when movies cut away from the gory part? Well this movie didn't let out sh***! Game of Thrones seems like Spongebob Squarepants next to this one! The best comparison for the brutality in it I could think about is probably The Raid 2! Feel free to tell me if you got another one (well yeah except movies like Saw)! So if you still want to watch this movie make sure to prepare yourself (if necessary) so you don't end up in the cinema, puking all over your neighbor's front seat! If you like gore (like I do) then you will probably love this film even more! Alejandro González Iñárritu didn't let out any violence, which is good, since this movie describes a survival(!) story and all the insane difficulties Hugh Glass faced!<br/><br/>So it's also important to know that this movie doesn't tell a true story! But it was strongly inspired by one! The Story of Hugh Glass! You will sit in the cinema, on your couch, your chair or wherever, and not believe what this man has gone through! <br/><br/>CAUTION: Now comes the SPOILER PART: The writers took themselves some freedom, which is acceptable. They obviously wanted the movie to send out a different message! So let's find out what the movie got wrong and if it was a good or bad decision to change it! First of Hugh Glass didn't kill the bear himself. The Grizzly was shot down by his comrades who came for his aid. (But we'll let him be the hero) He also did not have a son, at least not a son that was in the troupe escaping from the Arikara! So John Fitzgerald never killed his son! He and Jim Bridger were the only ones who accepted to take care for Glass until his death (only two men)! And Fitzgerald convinced Bridger to leave Glass after about a week! But that was all they did... they left him to die alone! There was also no missing Arikara daughter to be saved! But Glass did crawl miles and miles for days! The wolves that brought down the bison and were later on burned by the Indian who helped Glass, were real! But he chased them away himself by screaming and brandishing his walking stick. There was no Indian who saved his life. Also Hugh got back to the camp by himself in search for vengeance! But arriving he found out, that Fitzgerald had quit and joined the Army as a scout, which made him a federal employee, and untouchable. For Glass to kill him now would be to invite his own execution. So Fitzgerald got away with it! But Glass found Bridger, who was overfilled with guilt and shame. Then seeing again how young the boy was, and the fact that he had been heavily influenced by Fitzgerald, Glass spared his life! In an Arikara attack about 10 years later, Hugh Glass was eventually killed and scalped by his enemies. <br/><br/>So why not make a movie out of that story? Why these changes? The truth is Glass never got his revenge on Fitzgerald. Having that in the movie is the only thing I think about that bothers me sometimes! But then I think about that awesome chase and fighting scene and I get it! I mean its and ""happy end""... well kind of! They wanted Leo to get his revenge (and enlarging his reasons for it) even though in reality he never got it! It's probably a matter of opinion whether you like or dislike the writers decision! But independently of the plot, the acting: 10/10 (If he doesn't get his Oscar this year I don 't know what to think anymore), the camera: 10/10 (There are incredibly long takes you don't even realize)! For the most people all the important categories will score a 9 or 10/10 except the plot which everyone has to figure out for themselves! So I decided to give the movie 9,5/10 which rounds for me in Leos favor 10/10! I hope you liked this review, English isn't my first language so I hope it was still easy enough to follow my thoughts! Thanks for reading this review. Hamun!"
"ssunny-social","8","2","9","23 December 2015"," Harrowing, Yet Deeply Rewarding
","This Alejandro González Iñárritu directed masterpiece was under immense pressure after the director's victory in the Oscars for direction and best film last year. Him uniting with one of the industry's best actors, Leonardo Di Caprio, invited even more buzz. Well, the film more than delivers. The story in all its familiarity is about survival, the protagonist has to deal, post being left to die by his mates after getting attacked by a grizzly bear. It though tries to include elements of love and pain of loss, but keeps its focus towards having minimal layers.<br/><br/>The film is another epitome in cinematography. In certain parts, the camera work and execution is so out of the world, I missed few dialogs purely enchanted by Emmanuel Lubezki's work. This man is in the middle of the most towering run ever achieved by a cinematographer. No other cinematographer has won three straight Oscars, and Lubezki, who won the Oscars for Gravity and Birdman, is the most eligible winner for yet another, thanks to his sky faced- wide lens-natural light portrayal of the main character's journey. With how much difficulty, Alejandro prepared for such long shots, where the camera almost turned anywhere, is near beyond anyone's idea. Though Lubezki already has a similar experience with Children of Men, this definitely must have been much tougher taking into the account the extreme sub zero degrees of the locations, loosely also helping it achieve the tag of being one of the most difficult films to be shot. The film reportedly faced countless obstacles not only related to weather but also due to number of staff either quitting in the middle of the production or being fired by the director (could be also due to weather). On several occasions he was asked to use technology instead of real locations due to seasonal changes which didn't help with the consistent look of the film. But Alejandro stayed firm on his stand of not using a green screen, only to let the actors feel the chill to their bones in order to generate authenticity. And for this he had to shoot in 12 different locations including US, Canada and Argentina. Without divulging much, the Bear attack scene and one other Horse chase is shockingly real for its closeness and the quick multiple movements of the camera, to ultimately provide audience a raw almost first hand perspective of the whole. These scenes are such, if not prepared, will most definitely make you spit a loud ""FUCK!"" Acting is top notch, though I really hope Tom gets at least an Oscar Nomination nod since he was snubbed in the Golden Globes, he is totally electrifying as the villain. I am sure, had he been given more scenes he would have gone past Leo. Leo gives another stellar performance to decorate his body of work, the filth scale he plays with is on par with Kill Bill sort of films though this is much higher in its aesthetic presentation. The writing doesn't quite match to its cinematography or acting, though that is not to say, its bad, but just that the standards set by those two other departments is so high, it makes others, difficult to get there. I'd definitely rate Alejandro's Birdman higher in screenplay. In all, this film is an intense, raw yet beautiful portrayal of a simple story backed with engaging pace and masterful direction. Easily on the top, along with the best films of the year."

The tenacity he uses to survive and persevere in the wilderness is rooted in an almost supernatural demand for vengeance--the title refers to someone who has come back from the dead with a dreadful purpose. A strikingly beautiful yet doggedly uncompromising film, dominated by Iñárritu's scorching but desolate vision, Emmanuel Lubezki's stunning photography (the untamed wild has rarely looked so gorgeous yet threatening at the same time), and DiCaprio's physical, mostly silent performance of a haggard obsessive who survives only for retribution (all three won Oscars for their work). A grueling experience at two-and-a-half hours where credibility is stretched at least one time too many for the sake of narrative convenience, but unforgettable no matter one's opinion.

","Alejandro G. Iñárritu is back with The Revenant after the masterpiece that was Birdman and this is one of the most stunning films I've seen.<br/><br/>Iñárritu returns with a brutal revenge drama set in the 1800s where we see Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) trying to find the man who left him for dead.<br/><br/>Hands down, this is one of the most visually breathtaking films you will ever see. The choice of utilising natural lighting instead of studio lights really paid off. The gorgeous cinematography is amazing to look upon and full immerses you into this world. DiCaprio delivers a phenomenal performance as Hugh Glass and his expressions fully convey the pain he's going through. He definitely deserved that Oscar. Tom Hardy is amazing as the selfish and despicable Fitzgerald. Not for one moment do you think of the actors during this movie as they're so believable as these characters.<br/><br/>You can tell Iñárritu was very passionate about this project since his direction and choice of shots are incredible. He uses a lot of long shots, especially during the intense action scenes, to really portray the rawness and realism of this world. There are some scenes in the movie which I have literally no idead how the crew did it. The violence is very brutal but not over the top in any way. Iñárritu makes the violence seem convincing through his long shots and not shying away from any of the brutalilty shown. The costumes and makeup are very fitting for the time period which further adds to the realism.<br/><br/>My only problem is that the plot is predictable and the runtime is a bit too long but the impressive cinematography, direction and acting makes up for it for me to say this is one of the best revenge survival films made.

"traviscockrell-09508","10","1","3","2 September 2018"," Outstanding, But Brutal, Extreme Violence In Leonardo DiCaprio's Revenge Western (Based On The True Events Of Hugh Glass)
","Survival and revenge are two terms to describe this exhilarating and wonderful masterpiece directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. The Revenant is a 2015 Western (at least I think it is in my own opinion) film directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. Set back in 1823, a frontiersman named Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his Pawnee son named Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) are a part of Andrew Henry's (Domhnall Gleeson) trappers. After Glass gets mauled by a grizzly bear, he is left extremely injured. However, everything changes when a fellow trapper named John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) kills Glass' son Hawk. Looking to avenge his son's murder, Glass sets out to travel miles and miles to get to Fitzgerald. Let's not forget that he also has to travel through the shivering cold and the snowy terrain.<br/><br/>I can't even believe that this movie is based on true events. If someone had to go through in what Glass went through in this movie, they would die instantly. As to the extreme violence, this two and a half hour movie shows pain and suffering throughout the whole entire movie. I would also definitely not recommend the Revenant to any young kids, because the violence is just way over the top. Despite the violence, this movie is extremely great and has many different advantages in how satisfying it is. The casting, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, did a phenomenal job on each of their characters. The director, who is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, provided a surprising lead in direction while never standing down. By the way, the filming and the making of this movie was pretty tough. The weather conditions they filmed it in and the snowy terrain obviously made it harder. Even some of the crew members quit, because of how difficult it was. On the other hand, one of the most terrific experiences in this movie was the beautiful cinematography! Emmanuel Lubezki also provided an extremely great touch in filming this movie. However, there is so much great subjects about this movie and it is awesome! I give credit to the cast for their outstanding performances in their characters, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu for his amazing direction, and Emmanuel Lubezki for his beautifully shot scenery on the Revenant. This truly was an amazing picture, but also extremely tough.<br/><br/>For everyone who has seen this movie, we all know that this movie is off the charts in violence. It's brutal and that's all I have to say about that. However, I loved this movie! The plot line was not only an interesting story, but it was also based on true events! Does Hugh Glass make it to Fitzgerald? Does Glass ever survive in the wilderness? Watch (or at least try to) the Revenant to find out what happens. I give the Revenant a 10 out of 10 for its extremely great plot, casting, direction, and filming! Everything about this movie was fantastic!<br/><br/>The Revenant: Won 3 Oscars - Best Actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), Best Director (Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu), and for Best Cinematography (Emmanuel Lubezki)<br/><br/>Short Note: I just started my IMDb channel!

"Kingslaay","Null","1","3","13 February 2017"," Saying this movie is Overrated is an understatement
","The academy has been known to give its awards to undeserving films over the years. Classic and acclaimed films such as Shawshank Redemption or Goodfellas have been passed over for other films. The Revenant certainly takes the cake. Leonardo is a great actor but for some reason the Academy decided to give him a best actor Oscar in this film over his performance in The Wolf of Wall Street. <br/><br/>This film has very little substance to it besides the fact that it is about revenge but to see how this revenge unfolds we have watch a long and dull film. A number of viewers raved about the nature and cinematography which was good but award an Oscar for cinematography and be done with it. Instead this ended up being the impetus for garnering praise for a very mediocre film. It absolutely bewilders and even saddens me that watching footage of nature for a quite a while I might add makes a good film. It doesn't matter that the plot was weak and one dimensional, it was hard to understand what was said, it was too long, boring and fruitless as long as the film is 'scenic'. Using that logic a porno film could be made in nature with beautiful scenery and be deemed a great film, it might even win a few Oscars. <br/><br/>Perhaps those who are blinded by this 'nature' and scenery should watch the Discovery Channel and National Geographic more often or take a trip or two to some scenic areas in New Zealand or Switzerland. Maybe then you could watch movies and accurately judge its worth. This was a very mediocre film but at least Leonardo finally got an Oscar."
"PetarNeo","10","1","3","5 January 2017"," It is an extremely beautiful and very intense movie
","Group of trappers travel through wilderness running away from Ariarka's, Hugh gets attacked by bear which led to many unexpected events and even some brutal scenes. Scenes at the beginning of the movie are absolutely incredible from great way of filming them to camera movement which went throughout whole movie. Bear scenes it very intense and greatly shot but somewhere at the beginning of the attack it felt like unreal which kinda lost later on and looking at beginning of attack where bear was made to look big so it power of him was multiplied later it seemed like they decided to get him to normal size, that could be only camera work to make him look bigger and later like normal bear. From that point where Glass was left to mercy of Fitzgerald and his betrayal which buildup from beginning meant only one thing, that it is going to be a wild hunt. All adaptations and surviving of Glass is incredible and his power to get to Fitzgerald is incredible. As movie goes we are coming closer to their final moments and when it happened it was incredible. So much rage, power, hatred and sadness were in that final scenes that it was horrifying to watch. Filming of Revenant and scenes were pretty beautiful and almost every scenes followed with some kind of nature and wilderness shot is great. Effect of loneliness and isolation is constantly on your mind from beginning to the end. DiCaprio and Hardy were both magnificent and their performances were astonishing. Leo as Hugh Glass is destroyed mentally but hatred, pain and sadness are filled in every scene where he's in. Tom as Fitzgerald was pretty terrifying giving a very dark and cold performance that was filled with cynicism and bad behavior. Directing of the movie was pretty sweet and Alejandro proved his worth. 4/4"
"pendenquejohn","5","1","3","30 December 2016"," Good but too unrealistic to be true
","The whole story started well and on a brilliant opening, then, it all quickly turned around a crippled man trying to survive in a supper hostile environment. By the way, the latter being an understatement. We're talking temperatures nearing -60°C, super cold water in which Di Caprio was constrained to dip himself to escape the Indians or even snow tempest. I'm not really sure how somebody being this disabled would survive in such an environment in reality.<br/><br/>I think the story was ruined by the angle with which this was filmed. It made the overall thing really slow and nearly unwatchable at times -; excruciating I should say, and not in a good sense.<br/><br/>I kind of understand where the whole story wanted to go in terms of showing the unlimited possibilities in terms of resistance of human beings but this was clearly pushed too far in terms of superhuman capabilities."
"zacknabo","7","1","3","30 September 2016"," Good for Hollywood--Middle of the Road for Innaritu (cheated by my expectations)
","First, my expectations: a film better than Babel but not near as good as Birdman. Result: I received what I was expectingalthough I was expecting a little better. DiCaprio as Hugh Glass is amazing and deserves every accolade there is. And they use a slew of real natives who are amazing (some actors, some non-actors), very 21st century indeed. The film is truly like nothing you have ever witnessed. No hyperbole. It's the first time anyone as used this particular camera: the 6.5k ARRI 65 (alongside a bevy of other high powered cameras and equipment). Then there is the fact that you have the incomparable Emmanuel Lubezki helming the cinematography, soaking up all the natural light and like an illusionist making it better than actual light. There aren't many more things that come to mind that are more beautiful than what Lubezki photographs in the remote Canadian wilderness and parts of Argentina (not where the film is set but where it was actually filmed). The natural vistas and their colors are awe-inspiring and seem to extend to eternity; a perfect symbol for what it is Glass must overcome. The trees seem to reach heaven, especially in the exquisite takes where the camera is set low, creating the impression that everything is larger than it is. The choice to use the camera he did shows Inarritu's continuing consciousness in mise-en-scene that is not seen as often in Hollywood anymore. The long takes are brilliant and Inarritu and Lubezki's depth of staging is wonderful, hopefully something that will be brought back to mainstream American cinema. The camera brings the audience right into the pulse-raising, survivalists, revenge film, which heightens the experience, making the travails, particularly Glass's, more visceral. The audience feels as if they can reach out and pull Leo away from the clutches of the GrizzlyBear. 1820s in the Great Plains. A group of frontiersman and fur trappers are making their way back to their base when Glass a tracker who has been living with Natives Americans for several years is attacked by a bear in one of the greatest uses of CGI that you'll see (I'm very picky about CGI). After this attack Glass is essentially left for dead. The only people that stay with him are his native son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), a young first timer, Bridger (Will Poulter), and the surly Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) who is doing it all for greed, as he has been promised more money. Glass is truly left for dead after Fitzgerald murders Hawk while the incapacitated Glass can only watch, setting in motionwell, the movie. Now, for Glass it is survive and kill Fitzgerald at all cost. All the while the camera roams steadily following the action, as the actors intertwine, utilizing a brutal mix of deep focus staging and in your lap foreground, putting the viewer smack in the center of this cold, unforgiving world.<br/><br/>While Tom Hardy is amazing at what he does. As always, as in this case, dove head into his character, truly bringing the vile John Fitzgerald to life, but the problem is that the character is a bit much, in the same way that the entire film's story is much. He does add comic relief and makes for a most despicable foe for Leo, just a slightly bit oversaturated and not in that great Kurosawa-epic way. This is my central problem with the filmit is overblown. The problem is in the presentation. The landscape and the images are almost hyper-real. There is this promotion of ""based on a true story,"" but it is based on a novel that is inspired by true events. This is being nitpicky, but from the opening scene where Glass is dreaming of being with the tribe his wife was from and then the second scene where the camp is attacked by a group of natives on horseback, there is this sense of realism, a sense that this is a true past reality. The Revenant is an American foundation story; American mythology, only I felt it was being presented as this gritty, sense of life in the 1820s (which many times it is). This is partly my fault. I just wished that the film was letting the audience know that this is a tale akin to John Ford and D.W. Griffith. I wish it was presented more as myth; the film would have been better served for it. The long take of the CGI bear mauling DiCaprio over and over again at least puts into question all of this hype and promotion of ""realism."" I love all kinds of film: realistic, surrealistic, mystical, mythical, magical and poetic realism, expressionist, impressionist, avant-gardejust don't give me a homemade movie of you putting mittens on your kittens yet package it in Criterion case of Andrei Rublev. It would be one thing if I thought Inarritu was going to be my James Fenimore Cooper and DiCaprio/Glass his La Longue Carabine and the film carried that mythical and Romantic ambiance to it, but Inarritu misfires. I mean, I'm not saying a man can't survive riding a horse (after nearly being eaten alive by a go**amn bear) off a cliff, hit a tree, land on the ground, come to, go over and gut the now dead horse, remove his entrails and strip naked, burrowing yourself in the horse's carcass to stay warm and aliveI'mjustsaying. But ""revenant"" is in the title, which would probably most accurately be a ""ghostly return""so I'm well aware that my expectation meter was dialed in the wrong direction, though the dial was turned there from mainly outside sources. In the beginning the dialogue is strong but by the end of the film becomes predictable clichés, sadly poeticism gets whittled down to nothing more than the ending of an over-the-top Blockbuster action flick. Myth or not, it's still better than 99% of mainstream or Hollywood films."
"RobTortureWright","8","1","3","29 September 2016"," Simply Undeniable
","DiCaprio's unbelievable performance and the fact it was shot in 100% natural light makes this a historic and monumentous piece of cinematography. <br/><br/>For me this was by no means a highly entertaining film, in fact it is a long, slow ravelling story and minus the final scenes it struggles to thrill and captivate... However, you simply cannot deny it is a work of pure legend by the director and is shot marvellously in natural light which would have been a tremendous ordeal to achieve. Combine that with an outstanding performance from Tom Hardy and a simply unbeatable performance by Leonardo DiCaprio and you get a true standout film which is worthy of every Oscar it and Leonardo earned. <br/><br/>Overall a methodically paced film that many will disagree on, but a real diamond in both directorial and acting brilliance."

"mariusjora","8","1","3","15 September 2016"," Iñárritu made sure that bright colors are reserved for the most spectacular shots where every stain of blood and burning of powder seem like a celebration.
","Imagine it's 1823 and you're somewhere near the Missouri River. You haven't eaten anything in the last few days except some buffalo-berries, so what do you do? You eat a buffalo liver, raw. If you're Gugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), the protagonist in ""The Revenant,"" that's how you pull it off. You first get lucky for a pack of wolves to chase down a buffalo, wait till the dusk for a Pawnee Indian to scare away the pack, then crawl over the snow to beg for a piece of animal gut. <br/><br/>""The Revenant"" (2015) stems from a story of a frontiersman, Hugh Glass, an employee of the 1823 Rocky Mountain Fur Company dispatched for an expedition to the upper Missouri River. Cinematographic choices, for those among you who have already seen Birdman (2014), might very well seem like déjà vu in ""The Revenant."" Alejandro González Iñárritu, the director, once again relies on long takes to achieve an immersive cinematic effect. This tendency flips the status quo for heavy use of montage techniques, oxygenating the film industry, making ""Birdman"" and ""The Revenant"" significant milestones within the Ostranenie crusade. <br/><br/>A trapper who trades fur in Missouri, Hugh Glass becomes what others like David Crockett only fantasized about becoming. After a grizzly mutilates his body, Glass finds himself surviving the cruel winter gnawing at roots and devouring raw jerking fish fiercely seeking revenge on his companions who left him for dead.<br/><br/>After Glass remains alone in the wilderness the story starts giving way to for Lubezki to celebrate the mesmerizing landscape. Even if little dialogue makes ""The Revenant"" obtuse, the clash between a single man and the vast wilderness makes sure to patch any gaps with a fabric of visually striking elements. <br/><br/>Lubezki's photography pushes the film far beyond the story, giving us those jaw-dropping scenic moments. A glimpse of the moon, the sun- rays scattering among trees, the Rocky Mountains at dawn and sunset, are shots which nudge us in a state of reverie if not complete submission. Diegetic sound and natural lights, void the imagery of any insincerity. The image becomes brutally pure. Watching these shots feels as if feathers caress our cheek while razors cut through the other. <br/><br/>The color choice resonates with the grandiose tragedy of the story. The color palette is cold with predominant shades of white, gray, green, and blue. The shades are somewhat dull reflecting the murky atmosphere of the winter. Iñárritu carefully selected bright colors such as shades of amber emanating from a kindle, or shades of red splattered on the snow as blood oozes and spills to contrast the dull setting and poeticize narrative events. During the night, when Glass rests his wounds against a fire in a cave he digs in a snow hill, the camera captures the small radiant cave cornered in the bottom-left side of the screen while the monstrous Rocky Mountains fill the second plane. Such a composition dramatizes the size of nature versus that of a single man while colors, shot using deep-focus, make this distinction striking. Iñárritu made sure that bright colors are reserved for the most spectacular shots where every stain of blood and burning of powder seem like a celebration.<br/><br/>Like in Birdman, Iñárritu effectively makes use of the long take technique. Almost all the intense scenes contain one or a few long takes and the results are engaging. The camera seamlessly follows the characters while it tilts, pans, slants, and zooms in and out to capture the microcosm, such as a flying arrow, as well as the macrocosm. The camera in this sense is more like a living thing, always distracted by either characters or elements of the mise-en-scène. The camera sits with some for a while only to get distracted by other characters or props and then follow those without any editing in-between. Lubezki uses this technique whenever possible, transforming it into a subversive cinematographic leitmotif. As for the viewer, the absence of editing in such scenes bypasses the typical flickering effect allowing us to enjoy a continuous experience of the action. The uninterrupted experience accounts for constructing our presence in the movie as it simulates our real-life existence where our eyes perceive the world in a continuous way. Each long take has an important cumulative effect of such experiences, unmercifully making us suffer alongside Glass while giving the film an innovative fluency. <br/><br/>""The Revenant"" is a striking visual spectacle orchestrated at finest. Even if the narrative is quite linear, visual elements disrupt that sense, making the film less an adventure and more of a pensive pilgrimage. Be prepared to discover DiCaprio overwhelmed by afflictions and void of physiological change. It's nothing like ""Birdman"" or ""The Hateful Eight,"" where scenes seem to follow the cause and effect logic; ""The Revenant"" is composed of relatively loose scenes where the cinematography is given central role. If you like reaching for these cinematographic pinnacles where the Lubezki's scenic photography escorts us from one scene to another, then pop some of the popcorn you've stashed in the kitchen and let ""The Revenant"" whip your soul for two hours and a half."
"Turfseer","6","1","3","19 August 2016"," Iñárritu's remarkable tale of early frontier survival is marred by fictional tale of revenge
","Wikipedia informs us that Chinese Whispers or The telephone game we played as kids ""is a game played around the world, in which one person whispers a message to another, which is passed through a line of people until the last player announces the message to the entire group."" Director and co-writer Alejandro G. Iñárritu decided to play this game when he made The Revenant. The original message was based on the story of one Hugh Glass, a fur trapper, who joined a trapping expedition searching for beaver pelts in what is now South Dakota in the early part of 1823. <br/><br/>According to historical accounts, Glass joined a party led by General William Ashley who met up with the Indian tribe Arikara (aka The Rees) and negotiated a trade of horses for gunpowder. After a trapper ended up having carnal relations with an Indian maiden (and got his throat slit), the Rees attacked the next day which is thrillingly depicted in Iñárritu's opening scene (some have argued that the scene is too long, but hey isn't this the movies?). <br/><br/>Iñárritu and co-writer Mark L. Smith now begin to tamper with the historical record by introducing the idea that Glass fathered a son, Hawk, with an Indian maiden, and she was killed during an early Indian massacre by U.S. troops. Hawk accompanies Glass on the expedition.<br/><br/>The break into second Act occurs when Glass is mauled by a bear. Whether the story is true or not, it was widely publicized throughout the United States, sealing Glass's status as a legendary figure. The bear attack scene is an extraordinary piece of filmmaking; Iñárritu, using CGI effects, re-creates the attack on Glass, who despite shooting and stabbing the creature, still ends up an inch from death (the bear seems to forget that he's attacked Glass, ending up pawing and sniffing him before it walks away!).<br/><br/>The next sequence appears to adhere to the basic facts of what happened. After attempting to lug the badly wounded Glass over hostile terrain in an improvised lean-to, the expedition's leader, Henry, offered cash if two in the group would stay with Glass until he expired. There were two volunteers, John Fitzgerald and a teenager named Bridger. <br/><br/>After the rest of trappers left, Iñárritu then turns The Revenant into a tale of revenge. Fitzgerald murders Glass's half-Pawnee son and takes off with his tools and weapons, with Bridger in tow. In the film, Glass eventually seeks to exact revenge for the murder of his son. In reality, Glass went after Fitzgerald merely for stealing his rifle!<br/><br/>Glass then attempts to survive in the wilderness and make his way to Fort Kiowa. Glass's account has him crawling part of the way there, with a broken leg and unable to speak, due to wounds to his throat caused by the bear. He might have survived in part by eating a rattlesnake. Iñárritu has him initially finding a minimal amount of meat in the crevices of carcasses of dead animals. <br/><br/>Iñárritu embellishes the Glass legend by creating the character of a Pawnee refugee, Hikuc, whose family is murdered by the Sioux. Hikuc helps Glass by attending to his wounds, setting him up in a tepee where he's able to sleep and recuperate. When Glass wakes up, he discovers Hikuc hanging from a tree, murdered by French traders (the French here are particularly noxious and evil, responsible for not only killing Glass's friend Hikuc but also raping the Arikara chief's daughter, Powaqa). Glass manages to free Powaqa and kill two of the French traders before escaping from them. <br/><br/>Before making it back to civilization, Iñárritu has Glass endure one last great ordeal. Chased by Arikara, Glass is forced to jump off a cliff while on horseback. His fall is broken by a pine tree below but his horse isn't so lucky. To endure the cold, Glass slits open the horse carcass and takes a pleasant nap inside its belly. It's all very cinematic but of course it never happened.<br/><br/>As history has it, Fitzgerald joined the Army as a scout and this prevented Glass from exacting vigilante justice. Instead, after he got his rifle back, the story goes that Glass forgave Fitzgerald. So much for a fight to death on the freezing tundra!<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio deserves all the accolades for toughing it out in an environment which would make most actors quite squeamish. And Tom Hardy is a fine villain, going up against the noble Glass. Nonetheless, put on your English sub-titles, since it's often difficult to understand the dialogue, which often sounds quite garbled. <br/><br/>According to Wikipedia, Iñárritu stated that ""there can only be disappointment and lack of fulfillment for anyone who looks to revenge as providing a higher purpose for living or a life defining purpose."" It's an odd statement since his protagonist Glass is bent on revenge throughout and the audience is asked to cheer him on. Just as he disparages revenge as a way to administer justice, Iñárritu revels in it to tell his story. And while Glass chooses not to issue the coup de grace at film's end (and has the Arikara finish the evil Fitzgerald off), it's not enough to suggest somehow Glass is absolved from his monomaniacal stand.<br/><br/>Iñárritu's telephone game is complete when he has his protagonist go off on into the mountains, communing with his dead wife, incorporating all the wisdom she imparted while she was alive. Unfortunately, the real Glass was not such a recipient of kindly Native American wisdom, having ended up victim of an Arikara scalping party in the spring of 1833."
"bm-25","7","1","3","4 June 2016"," Unremitting, implausible, impressive
","Leonardo wins an Oscar, finally, but for what?<br/><br/>Endurance, probably. And that goes for the audience too, in this long, unremitting tale of implausible survivable in a hugely impressive setting.<br/><br/>This film is an oddity. The Cinematography is peculiar in several respects. Many of the panning shots are notably using a wide angled lens which shows as distortion at the edges. (IMAX?) The camera is seen several times as participating in the action. For example - blood and breath appearing on the lens, the actors actually crashing into the camera during the last fight sequence and Leonardo breaking the fourth wall at the conclusion. There are additional sound-track artefacts that serve no other purpose than to irritate.<br/><br/>Then there is the plot. This, disappointingly, is utterly implausible. The idea that anyone would have survived such a Grizzly Bear attack at all, never mind in the freezing conditions and without medical intervention is pushing its credibility beyond limits. The ability of the lead to survive and recover requires an impossible suspension of disbelief. So, as you are you are watching it, you are constantly saying, ""not feasible"", ""oh come on"" and ""you must be friggin' joking""...<br/><br/>And why, BTW, did the Director insist on Tom Hardy's character's dialogue be utterly impenetrable? We should have had the foreign language subtitles for his character too. <br/><br/>The whole premise of the film, revenge, was left lacking as we neither cared whether any of the protagonists lived or died (except one death, which occurred fairly early).<br/><br/>You were, while watching, thinking, ""Wow, di Caprio suffered for his art while filming this"". Of course that was a problem, as you should have been thinking, ""Wow, 'lead character' managed to survive all that!""

","'The Revenant' is more a survival story than a revenge story, where the surrounding (and amazing) landscape often dwarfs the story. Tom Hardy turns in the role of his life to date, playing an antagonist whose point of view can be argued reasonably enough that he doesn't come off entirely as a cartoonish black hat villain. There are several scenes that are pretty much instant classics, including the opening one, where the director's ""follow the ball"" tendencies serve well to capture a sprawling battle in an open wooded area. Leonardo DiCaprio obviously suffered for his role, as one could easily surmise based upon some of the shots filmed on freezing and harsh locations, and certainly earned his ""Best Actor"" Oscar."

Mc Bride should have landed his nomination for visual effects too. Breath taking realistic action and panoramic landscape with underplayed natural sound effects. However, the grizzly itself was pitifully underwhelming. One cannot ever believe surviving two lengthy maulings, no matter how difficult it is to discard expensive left-over footage. I cannot however understand why Iñárritu had to deviate from the story with needless ornate sentimental flotsam, Inventing and predictably killing a son unforgivably destroyed the whole theme of the story. I really appreciated Tom Hardy's role as a hard boiled opportunist brute - without becoming just another stereotyped Western baddie. What I could not really fathom is how Leonardo even got nominated for leading role Oscar. His early lines were mostly in some remote N.American Indian tongue. His voice was then reduced to groaning for most of the rest of the film. With a face hidden with hoods,full facial body hair, grime and ice - what acting can possibly peep through? No amount of extreme survival tour de force stunts can ever be classified as acting. Perhaps Leonardo wanted us to know that he has graduated from dying within a few minutes of calm ice cold sea to surviving hours of freezing white water rivers. Oscar for effort at best."

The Revenant was undoubtedly an un-matched visual and artistic experience, the film won the Oscar for Cinematography and when you see the film it is easy to see why, every shot in this film is of nature I have heard there was no use of artificial lighting! Northern America has never been more grandly viewed than in this film. However the film also tells a fantastic story of Vengeance, trust and survival, it does all of this without ever feeling pretentious or over the top. Leonardo gives a brilliant performance and as we all know, this is Leo's first Oscar win, although he is criticised for a lack of dialogue, Leo makes of for this with his physical expression and stress. Action scenes in this movie are above anything I have ever seen, in a certain battle containing Tom Hardy (who also gives an outstanding performance) it was so hard to both watch, and turn away, and although there are limited major conflict scenes in this film (which never feels disappointment) every battle is so beautifully tense, brilliantly shot and choreographed, I can honestly say I had no idea what to expect and tried hard not to blink. Finally, I would like to say that this film is not for the impatient, the film often takes its time to display its epic cinematography which is obviously not for everyone. I will never give a 10/10, but this film got extremely close, definitely one of my favourite films."

","A highly anticipated contender for Oscars, ""The Revenant"" landed with winning the coveted awards for Best Director and Best Actor, giving Leonardo Di Caprio his much awaited Oscars and losing Best Picture to ""The Spotlight."" The film deserves a heavy applause for two very strong reasons. The first for the superb cinematography it uses which gives the depiction of the 18th century America and an expedition of the hunters in the snow capped mountains of North America. The landscapes and the camera angle chill your spines and frightens for the force of nature and isolation it can bring. For most of the part, the film uses the natural landscape than computer generated images which has dominated film making for quite a time which makes it a visual treat. The second reason to admire the film is the superb performance of Leonardo Di Caprio, who appears away from his Titanic fame boyish performances which he has been giving most of the time. Without much of the dialogues, he somewhat gets into the skin of the character sparkling the screen in his presence.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, the film is flawless technically and sets a benchmark in the cinematographic achievement in movies. But regarding the story and script, the film lacks a tightness and fails to grip at times. The tightness of Alejandro's earlier movies ""Amorres Perros"" and ""Babel"" is somewhat missing in this one. The film becomes a survival game in the wilderness of American landscape, somewhat familiar from Tom Hank's ""Cast Away."" Then the film draws to a revenge story where the protagonist avenges for the desolation from his friend who attempts to kill him and his son, which seems pretty obvious. There isn't much substance in the story and it somewhat drags and is interested in holding the viewers for the star power of Di Caprio with scars and anticipation to be free from the desolation rather than the story. Had the story been tighter and the length been trimmed a bit, the film could have been much memorable.<br/><br/>Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4"

","I am seeing quite a few bad reviews for this movie and all I can think is how? How could anyone have thought this movie was even slightly bad? This movie is almost three hours long but it does not even feel that long when watching it because it is so action packed and has scenes in it that will completely suck you in and just blow your mind. <br/><br/>Also, this movie had the most beautiful cinematography and special effects. And while there is not that much actual dialogue throughout the movie it does not need it because the events that happen in this movie speak more than dialogue ever could.<br/><br/>Another thing I would like to say is that Leo definitely earned his Oscar win for his performance in this movie, his win was long overdue. Well deserved win for Leo and a ten out of ten performance on his part. <br/><br/>All that being said, this movie was astonishing in so many ways. And it gets a 9 out of 10 stars from me."
"tengokuno","7","1","3","28 February 2016"," A worthless film.
","Translated from 3rd January review<br/><br/>Excellently acted, directed and filmed (especially filmed), The Revenant didn't however manage to captivate me once in its 150 minutes. Which means I had a lot of time to think about ""Why?"". It's because such a movie is useless to our world. <br/><br/>The story isn't interesting, or new, there isn't a single theme that wasn't presented in the exact same way in a previous film. You won't see any new ideas or techniques that would justify the making of this film except that they wanted to make an Oscar film. The director wanted to show off his skill, the same for the actors and technicians. So, they found an old story that would let them shine AND which traditionally catches the eye of the Oscar crowd. It's true, they added a modern angle to the treatment of the indigenous population by the white invaders but, it's nothing special either. I don't want this review to be negative. Tom Hardy gets completely lost in the role of Fitzgerald. DiCaprio is again fantastic in a slightly unusual role compared to what he played in the last few years. Where he played more verbally than physically. (Screaming his way through half of those films. Hugh Glass is a tragic character, a survivor, beaten down by the world of 1820's, not one who pumps his chest, getting ready to take on any adversary in his way. (Yes I'm talking about The Wolf of Wall Street here). Directing is, again, excellent. Inarritu demonstrating that he can also direct calm, somber and atmospheric scenes without dialogue. But, if it weren't for Emmanuel Lubezki, the movie wouldn't look, or flow nearly as well. Those in the sound department also pull their weight marvelously. It's very difficult to capture that feeling of solitude in the wilderness, but they managed to do it in this film. You can really feel the cold, the dampness and the loneliness, wherever you are while watching The Revenant. I don't want to take away from The Revenant any one of these technical achievements but that's the problem: it's a lot more of a technical spectacle than a story worth telling than a great film. Sort of a Transformers for the Oscar crowd."
"jake-law123","8","1","3","28 February 2016"," One of the most visually intricate films I've ever seen.
","After being mauled by a bear during a hunting expedition in the 1820's, fur trader Andrew Henry (Leonardo Dicaprio) is left for dead and buried alive after his half breed son is killed by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), resulting in a fierce and brutal struggle for survival as he attempts to make his way back to civilization for revenge against Fitzgerald.<br/><br/>Opening with a visually masterful fight scene between the hunting crew and the Arikara tribes, Alejandro Inarritu brilliantly captures (through extended takes and natural lighting) the complete feeling of being in the freezing wilderness. From walking in the rain to running in the snow, you feel every single nit bit of detail within the scene. Like Birdman, he likes to capture everything in one, making for a very strong directing job.<br/><br/>Overall, it is rich with environment, which is its main factor. Leo spends most of his time in the wilderness on his own, trying to survive. His desperation increases more and more as you see him progressively determined. From sleeping inside a horse to eating rotten boar flesh, Leo goes all out in here and is completely immersed in every scene he's in. I wish Tom Hardy got more screen time, there was some good potential for a very unique character study. Even though it was still good, I feel like they might have missed out.<br/><br/>Even though style over substance is usually not good, this is one of the most masterfully filmed movies I have ever seen. It makes me wonder how they got some of these shots. Compliments to them for the use of natural lighting, which is a good touch, and really pays off. I wish Alejandro did what he did in Birdman, and have more dream sequences, and more spiritual scenery to add to the gritty feeling. Once you factor out the detailed environment and long structure of it all, what you get is a pretty basic revenge story. With that said, it is so technically marvelous it overshadows it completely.<br/><br/>Regardless of its few complaints, it is one of the most riveting experiences I've ever had with a film. Watch in on Blu-Ray, on an HDTV, turn out the lights and turn on the surround sound, and get ready to travel to a new world, because this is the movie to do it."

"dakjets","7","1","3","28 February 2016"," Strong, but too brutal for my taste
","Most are already written by reviews of this movie here. Most words are already used, and many good reviews as well. Therefore will I do this review short about what I experienced as negative with this in many ways very great movie. The story is good and the action is intense. Lenoardo Di Caprio make an amazing effort. My objection to this movie is the brutality. For my part, it was all too much violence and brutality. This violence lasts throughout the film, and makes one gets tired of watching it. I think that this story fine could have managed without the explicit violence scene, even the famous scene with the bear that attack. That makes this movie difficult to watch, and I think that it may be too violent for many. There is not anyone who can stand or withstand to see such things, and this review is therefore a reminder to these, and the film should be considered carefully. Beyond that'll probably be many awards at this forward, and it will maybe be considered a classic in the years to come. The environment this film takes place is in is beautiful filmed. But the film had been just as good without the blood and the brutality."
"belaharris","9","1","3","21 February 2016"," Absolutely stunning cinematography
","This movie much like Innaritu's last takes cinematography to a whole new level in a gorgeously shot movie. front start to finish you are presented with breathtaking shots of the landscape and how DiCaprio's character deals with it. There were points where i felt like i was right next to the action and it was an incredibly immersive experience. one shot in particular astounded me: this shot was in the woods near the end of the movie where DiCaprios character is found; the screen is completely black and then the glow of torches starts to fade through the trees. i was shocked as i looked through a glowing forest at the men riding their horses toward me. This is the type of cinematographal prowess Innaritu is able to bring to the screen, really fantastic and i will be quite surprised if it doesn't take the Oscar for that category. <br/><br/>The acting was extremely well done, with Leonardo putting in a seller performance filled with anguish, and Tom Hardy making me absolutely despise his character by the end. The acting was complemented with a good story and a better script (or lack of rather), but i did find myself getting bored at times because sometimes things took just a little bit too long. what i mean to say is that it could have been a shorter movie. the first half of the movie was great and i got really interested in the story especially after his son died, but i began to forget about those conflicts as the movies went on. i do appreciate the survival parts but i felt that they were drawn out almost to the point that i lost interest in the conflicts between characters and got distracted by his conflict with nature. not that this is bad, on the contrary that can be very compelling as it kind of pulls your attention in the direction of the character, but for me it just took away from the previous plot lines and didn't advance its own enough. <br/><br/>Overall a fantastic film both technically and creatively, that shows off the brilliance of Innaritu"
"estebangonzalez10","8","1","3","19 February 2016"," Beautiful but exhausting
","""As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight. You breathe... keep breathing.""<br/><br/>It's only been a year since Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu delivered the award winning Birdman and somehow he managed to deliver another visual masterpiece in record time. To follow up such a groundbreaking film like Birdman, with an epic adventure film like The Revenant is mesmerizing. But Gonzalez doesn't deserve all the credit, his films have stood out because of Emmanuel Lubezki's groundbreaking cinematography. The best thing about The Revenant is without a doubt its visual style. And the same could be said about Lubezki's previous efforts: Gravity and Birdman. In three years Lubezki has delivered some of the most beautiful looking films of our decade (and I'm not even including The Tree of Life which he worked on in 2011). This man is pure genius and will without a doubt win his third Oscar in a row. I hope the two continue to work together and deliver more visually inspiring films. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio deserves all the accolades he's received for his physically demanding performance here. From the very first scene we see him face one obstacle after another as the opening sequence takes place while he is being attacked by a group of indians during a fur trading expedition. It's not much later when the much commented bear mauling scene takes place, but that is only the beginning of his struggles. DiCaprio gives it his all and even though this isn't the best performance of his career, it will finally be the one that gives him the Oscar. Tom Hardy also delivers a fantastic supporting performance as John Fitzgerald, the man who wants to leave him behind. The film ends up feeling like one long chase in a similar way as Mad Max Fury Road, although at a much slower pace. A survival/revenge film like this has never looked so beautiful. The film is a bit too long and it eventually begins to wear down, but it's a constant feast to the eyes despite the exhaustion."
"BobbyG","9","1","3","15 February 2016"," Great Moving Film
","Reading several of the negative reviews of this great film made my blood boil. <br/><br/>How dare you say this there is no character development? This is not a mini-series! There are time constraints and developing character generally takes more than three hours. God, you people can be awful, spoiled ingrates. This film brought me to tears during several scenes.<br/><br/>Getting that off my chest, I will now provide my opinion of this incredible production; which was completed in less than one year. <br/><br/>The Revenant is long at over 2 1/2 hours. And yes, it is a bit too long. Actually it is not, for those not marred by the instant gratification evidenced in modern society (you poor souls!). The cinematography and plot are so exceptional you won't notice the unusually long length.<br/><br/>The initial scene involving the battle with the Indians is stunning in its chaos and unpredictability. The viewer doesn't know who will live and die and by what means. The battle lines are obscured to a degree not seen in may films I've viewed.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is a long slog through nature in its extreme challenges and is moving. You may question the motivations and decisions of the subjects, but these are all conjecture by the director based on his interpretation of the true story.<br/><br/>I will watch this film again with the closed capture enabled because I only understood about 80% of what was said. It will be worthwhile in my opinion because, in its essence, this film depicts the good and evil, along with the greed and selflessness, in every man."
"santiagocosme","6","1","3","14 February 2016"," A cold movie.
","The highly appraised and one of the Oscars' favorite left me as cold as the landscape you see throughout. The big question that everyone will be asking themselves is: will Leonardo Di Caprio finally win an Oscar? On the evidence of this performance he shouldn't. For the second year in succession, Eddie Redmayne has to be the favorite to win the statue. <br/><br/>As for the movie, I think it will fall short of an Oscar too, but it's hard to see which one deserves it more than the Revenant. The bridge of spies would be the other favorite in my eyes, but it does not feel like an Oscar worthy movie. It's hard to tell really, and maybe irrelevant anyway. <br/><br/>The point is that The Revenant is a magnificent movie from the point of view of the photography, and I can only imagine the nightmare it must have been to record such a movie in absolute freezing conditions. But in the end, what matters is the emotions you feel when you watch it, and in that department it left completely uninspired. I understand that some people will like it a lot, but to me, it lacks punch and substance. Leonardo Di Caprio was probably crippled a little too long to make it really entertaining."
"mlgoult","7","1","3","7 February 2016"," Cinema as art or entrernainment
","As a piece of art this movie should deserve a 10 star rate. Stunning photography , great actors'performances and great filming with astonishing camera angles and movements. Cinema is not only art but entertainment - we go to the movies expecting to laugh, cry think and feel part of the story. In my opinion considering these aspects this movie fails. The movie tells a story of a frontiersman and pelt trader that is left by his own luck after considered near dead due to severe wounds caused by a bear attack. Everything that follows are the struggle for life and the revenge appetite to find the man that killed his son. A very well done movie production but based on a loose and not captivating story."
"Ziya90","9","1","3","7 February 2016"," Not pretentious, not boring, not overlong, not lack of substance
","The Revenant is an example of real cinema. It is not a pretentious, pseudo intellectual and pseudo artistic work, it is not a brainless blockbuster, it is not an example of ""style over substance"" film as it is not a story or dialog oriented bore-fest. Some people say that it was overlong. Why does everyone need short films nowadays? Because, they want to consume a movie as soon as possible, then go back their home or text messages by their precious cell phones? Another complaint for the movie is lack of story and depth. I have to disagree. The story in the film is not sophisticated maybe and maybe it is a conventional one for such an unconventional film (not a typical example of mainstream cinema though) However, this doesn't mean that the movie is shallow or it has nothing to say to the audience. There is no real character depth in the film, but do we really need ""Shakespearean"" characters for this film? This is not ""Who is afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" As for realism of the movie, of course there are some parts that require suspension of disbelief, but it does not ruin your experience. As for the bear scene, I didn't see anything like this before. Period. The movie could have been boring if Inarritu would have tried to tell us the love story between our survivor and his wife, because then the movie would be another Pocahontas tale or a very similar film with Terrence Malick's ""The New World."" Also The Revenant is not this year's Dances with Wolves or something. If we don't consider ""Man in Wilderness"", this is a totally unique and distinctive film. Honestly, I hated ""Birdman"", because it was pretentious and no heart and soul in the delivery. The Revenant is natural and emotional, yet not overly sentimental or heartwarming. I don't enjoy ""cold"" movies personally, but The Revenant is not such a movie. You feel the film. You feel the scenery. You feel the situation of the characters. However, the most important, you feel the film. Birdman? It is hard to say. Leonardo Di Caprio delivers very well, even if still his greatest performance is in ""What's eating Gilbert Grape?"" Nobody, but nobody can be better than Leo in that film in cinema history! Leo deserves the Oscar this time maybe (also he should have won in ""The Departed"") but honestly, if there is someone better than him in the movie, he is Tom Hardy! He does it again. One more time, he proves that he is one of the best actors in this generation and he steals every scene he is in. A trenchant, brutal and stunning performance! Leo's great performance is based on physical difficulties and emotion. Inarritu's direction is perfect here. No need to say that the scenery is beautiful, the cinematography is mesmerizing, the shots are terrific, the editing is brilliant, visual effects are superb etc. Don't expect some clichés like Di Caprio's character befriends Indians, then fight back etc. No. This is a different film. That's why it is not boring. The Revenant has a gripping story. It has a story. It has substance. Yes, maybe, in the second half, the movie loses its intensity and agonizing tone and maybe the final act is not that unusual or unforgettable or surprising, but still it delivers. The Revenant is not a thought provoking film, the revenge story is not bitter, intense or powerful like ""Unforgiven, but it has enough words to say about life and death, revenge, human nature and God. And I am very glad that the characters don't speak too much so we enjoy the great scenery."
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","3","6 February 2016"," A film with Oscar written all over it
","If all you knew about a film was its title, then this one would be rivalled in obscurity only by ""Sicario"". In the latter case, the word was explained at the opening of the movie; in this case, the viewer is left to infer the meaning from the narrative. A revenant is a person who returns, especially from the dead, and the term comes from a French word for ghost. In this case, the eponymous returner is tracker Hugh Glass (a stunning performance from Leonard Di Caprio) and screenwriter Mark L Smith has worked partly from the true story of an early 19th century Wyoming mountain man and party from a 2002 novel by Michael Punke. In a minimalist script, there is no back story or exposition - we are straight into the action - and there are long periods of no dialogue at all.<br/><br/>This is a genuinely international work. The lead star is American, of course, but the other three major roles are filled in accomplished style by actors from the British Isles - Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson, and Will Poulter - although all four are barely recognisable under so much facial hair. Director Alejandro González Iñ árritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki - who worked together on ""Birdman"" - are both Mexican. And the outdoor locations themselves - breathtakingly shot in natural light with clever camera angles - were in Canada and Argentina.<br/><br/>There is a rare physicality to this brilliant movie-making as the viewer goes through the life-threatening ordeals endured by Glass, whether the threat comes from native tribes, fellow fur trappers, wild animals, or 'just' the terrain and climate. The work has become best-known for the scene involving a bear attack but I was even more gripped by another sequence in which Glass is invited simply to blink. The last time I felt so exhausted at the end of a film was ""Touching The Void""."
"lopamudrax","9","1","3","4 February 2016"," Poetry juxtaposed on painting
","From the time the movie opens up it feels as if you have opened your eyelids and you are at the forefront of the elk hunt. This space that you are at very rarely strays during the duration. You are not a spectator, you are a fellow journeyman.<br/><br/>This movie is not just a film. It's a cinematic expression of the entire crew both on and off the screen. And the architect of that expression is Inarritu. I can only imagine how hard it must have been to convince the studios to see the vision just through the concept. After all it's just the constant battle of one man against the nature and the nature of man. The movie rests on his portrayal of his grit and tenacity. And would audiences who are used to all high tech visual effects and racing story lines be patient enough to sit through only one man's ordeal?<br/><br/>Well the answer lies at the heart and soul that the protagonist has poured, seeped, toiled into the character. With the camera focused on his each grimace, each torsion of his body Leonardo Di Caprio reigns tall from the moment the finger lays on the trigger of the gun. He is the bullet that you see even before the gun has been fired.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy one of my fav actors is the perfect foil to the intent of Di Caprio s character. Here i have to digress a bit. Both these actors were there in inception - one of my all time favorite. There we see the masterful Nolan cerebralise these characters and there too we see them doing the tango gracefully. In the revenant that dance form is waltz and both of them dance around their inevitable duet with poise and patience.<br/><br/>Am not a fan of the cold climate but when in spite of that i feel the desire to visit that place says a little something about the cinematography. Lubezki is the maestro painting his deft strokes. And back to the architect of this entire vision. Seriously one has to blind not to see the nuance of the vision that Inarittu lays in front of us. We are entrenched in the snow alone with him. Thanks for bringing such an expression where we see how mankind is indebted to mother nature. In spite of all the ravages we as a human race has inflicted on her nature still hides us and we hide inside her entrails"

The entire setting, with trapping company that puts its people to great dangers, they work for relatively modest amounts, people need to be paid to go to search for a lost man.... This is a strong statement against our greed, against our pseudo-civilizations where individuals are just insignificant pieces of world economy, without any attachment to life, nature, each other. ThE nature for protagonists is just a thing to exploit for human needs. Though, not for the Director, who is the only one presenting its above-any-moral beauty.<br/><br/>The main character is left empty and it is totally irrelevant will he live or die the moment after the film - he has nothing to live for.

"quincytheodore","9","1","3","3 February 2016"," A harsh winter for beast and man
","While having Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio is a definite boon, what really makes ""The Revenant"" a splendid cinematic experience is the utmost care for visual and cinematography. It's a series of immersive events taken with extreme care, minimal editing and a continuous shot after continuous shot of wintry landscape as it witnesses revenge and ordeal of savages.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) as he fights against beast, nature and fellow man to stay alive. There are a couple of other subplots though Glass' perspective takes the focus. One can argue that this is Leo's closest chance at Oscar in recent years, and it's hard not to see why. He's an expert on conveying emotions with sheer gestures and psychical attributes alone. If this movie is advertised as actual survival show, Leo would make people believe it.<br/><br/>On the other spectrum Tom Hardy as Fitzgerald is just equally amazing. He presents a much different persona than his other roles, I admittedly didn't recognize him for half of the movie. This is a brilliant act on his part to showcase the brutality of the time. Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter round up the crew nicely as duty bound captain and the more inexperienced frontiersman. The average length of scene is demanding and the cast delivers pleasantly.<br/><br/>The other subplots happen simultaneously as Glass' predicament, they could be highlighted more but this is just a slight scratch on the narrative and also not to impose on the main story line. Its visual is certainly a triumph in film making. There's no shortage of refinement on the sequences, whether it's dialogues or action. It's a precise, deliberate and unwavering presentation, captivating with its pronounced details as well as slight whisper or howl of the winter.<br/><br/>Few other movies manage to allure the audience into the world of the movie with stern excellent production and acting, ""The Revenant"" is truly breathtaking."

","Is The Revenant the best movie of the year? Surely not and in fact it's doubtful if it's a great movie at all. OK, so Alejandro Inarritu wanted to be realistic, moved to Argentina for more snow, had actors crawling naked in it and other bullshit like that, but seriously what is the point of the film? And what is so realistic about getting almost raped by a giant bear and attacked by uncountable Indians and elements of nature but still managing to survive to get revenge? Inarritu is a great director, perhaps the best (along with Christopher Nolan) of our time and the movie is technically and artistically perfect. If he hadn't already won the direction Oscar last year with Birdman, he would certainly get this one. DiCaprio's performance is brilliant but so is each and every of his performances. Still they'll finally grant him an Oscar for his crawling and growling in the Revenant but in reality it will be an Oscar for his entire career. Tom Hardy's performance is even better and he deserves it even more than DiCaprio but he is going to lose to ... Stallone (Jesus Christ Academy, you suck!). Nevertheless and despite some very impressive scenes (namely the entrance scene, the bear scene, the horse scene and the final revenge scene and that's it) and artistic beauty, a movie should have a ... script and this one has none. So it ends up being a Cast Away clone without the emotional touch of the last."
"The_FilmMeister","8","1","3","2 February 2016"," The Revenant (Review)
","After striking gold at the Academy Awards last year with 'Birdman', Alejandro González Iñárritu is back with 'The Revenant', a tale of revenge and suffering. 'The Revenant' has experienced a hard shoot, Iñárritu said it would be all well and good to film in a studio, but the film wouldn't have the same impact. Instead, the cast and crew shot on location and experienced extreme weather conditions. This film is particularly important for Leonardo DiCaprio who is overdue for an Academy Award and should probably finally win this year. 'The Revenant' has received 12 Oscar nominations and is expected to win a slew of them and possibly the big awards. I found 'Birdman' unengaging and pretentious at times and felt in a year where there were outstanding films such as 'Whiplash' and particularly, 'Boyhood', it was a very undeserving winner.<br/><br/>'The Revenant' is a visually stunning film and it boasts many outstanding sequences. It has some excellent central performances and boasts original cinematography and an atmospheric score. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy are both mesmerising here and Iñárritu has really developed as a director. The battle sequences are wonderfully crafted and there are some beautifully shot landscapes to create the film's atmosphere. My only gripes with 'The Revenant' are its pacing is a little stretched at parts and its story is a little simplistic for a 156 minute running time. But the execution is where 'The Revenant' wows and it really is a work of art.<br/><br/>The acting is where 'The Revenant' is most likely to flourish at the Academy Awards and Leonardo DiCaprio is stunning here. DiCaprio is a fantastic actor anyway and deserved to win for 'The Wolf of Wall Street', only he faced some fierce competition in that year in the form of Chiwetel Ejiofor and Matthew McConaughey, the latter ultimately taking the gong. His performance in 'The Revenant' is a very physical one and he carries the film with just his mannerisms and pure torture that his character is put through. Tom Hardy is also very good here, perhaps not quite Oscar-worthy, but he makes for a very interesting villain. His performance too is a very physical one and his character is well-developed. The last time DiCaprio and Hardy met on-screen was in Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' and they gel just as well here as they did there. The ultimate showdown between both actors in this film is breathtaking and is edge-of-the-seat entertaining. Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter are in supporting roles for this film and give sound performances.<br/><br/>Whilst the story is a rather simplistic for its lengthy run time, it is developed well enough so that one connects with the characters. This film is well-and-truly a revenge thriller first and a Western second. The suffering that DiCaprio's character experiences is at times, shocking and he goes to any lengths to survive. The battle sequences are especially mesmerising, particularly at the very beginning and the mauling of DiCaprio by a bear is extremely well crafted and frightening.<br/><br/>Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography here is stunning and he will most likely win his third Academy Award for this. Characters are generally kept to the left side of the frame to give the audience a feel for perspective and Lubezki's landscape shots are wonderful to behold and really bring a sense into the desperate and desolate world that one immerses themselves in. Although sadly illegible for the Academy Awards, the score by Ryuichi Sakamoto and Alva Noto here is endlessly atmospheric and heartfelt. It is used sparingly, but whenever the score is used it heightens the events being portrayed on-screen. Sakamoto has recently been battling cancer so it's a welcome return to form here and this is his first film score for an American film in a long time.<br/><br/>Overall, 'The Revenant' is a very impressive film and technically outstanding. It makes for a very satisfying watch and the combination of DiCaprio and Hardy is a match made in heaven. Iñárritu's direction is a lot more assured here and this is complimented by an atmospheric score and beautiful cinematography. This is a much better effort compared to 'Birdman' which very undeservedly took the top awards last year. If this went on to win Best Picture, I would be fairly happy. 'Room' is the best film of the pack but it does shut out some audiences who sadly won't appreciate it. 'The Revenant' is very impressive and satisfying for those who stick with it. Watch it on the biggest screen you can find!<br/><br/>**** / ***** (Excellent) <br/><br/>Read more reviews on thefilmmeister.com"
"christian-larson","10","1","3","1 February 2016"," One of the best looking films i have ever seen.
","The Revenant stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson. Its about the story of Hugh Glass, and its road to revenge against Fitzgerald. As i previously said, this movie has one of the best cinematography I have ever seen. There are really long shots, and wide shots throughout the movie and its mind blowing. Leonardo DiCaprio is phenomenal, his performance its mainly physical, not really talkative. I think Leo really does deserve the Oscar this time. Tom Hardy is also great. All the actors make an amazing work in the movie, even that kid from the maze runner. The story its really riveting as you want Hugh Glass to succeed in his long and hard journey of revenge. There is a scene with a bear, and its really something. The scene looks gross, and bloody but in a really necessary way, and it is really realistic. The only real flaw that I have is that the film makes some weird scenery and it is understandable for the character, but it just came off as not necessary. It does come off as pretentious but it really did not take me out from the amazing journey of Glass. 9.5/10"
"howard.schumann","8","1","3","31 January 2016"," Expresses a fierce determination and strength of will
","Set in 1823-24 in what is now South Dakota, Mexican filmmaker Alejandro Iñárritu's The Revenant is loosely based on the experience of American fur trapper Hugh Glass who miraculously survived a bear attack and sought revenge against a Texas mercenary who abandoned him and killed his son. Adapted from Michael Punke's book, ""The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge,"" and winner of the Golden Globe for Best Picture, it is a story of the resilience and endurance of a man fighting for survival under extreme weather conditions. Shot with natural light in minus forty-degree temperatures in Alberta, Canada, the film is a testament not only to the skills of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezski, but to Inarritu's commitment to the authenticity of his craft.<br/><br/>In the film, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a scout for trappers employed by the Rocky Mountain Trading Company. In the opening sequence, we learn that Glass was married to a Pawnee woman who was killed by soldiers. The scene then shifts to the trader's campsite where the men are attacked by warring Arikara Indians. The tribe, whose numbers had been decimated by a smallpox epidemic, was eager to trade pelts for horses and rifles but bore the scars of the white man's encroachment on their land. In the attack, the trappers suffer heavy casualties and only a few are left alive besides Glass: Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), Glass' half-Pawnee son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), young hunter Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) and frontiersman John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), all persuaded by Glass to attempt an overland route back to their Fort Kiowa headquarters.<br/><br/>Out hunting for food, Glass is viciously attacked by a bear and, though clinging to life, is buried alive by Fitzgerald who also kills his son. Though the bear is a CGI construction, the attack is stomach-churning in its gruesomeness and brings the viewer into the middle of an animal attack that has a startling feeling of reality. Amazingly regaining consciousness, Glass crawls through freezing snow and chilling waters to find Fitzgerald and revenge his son's murder. Surviving on scraps of animal carcasses, he is sustained by mystical messages of encouragement from his dead wife and the help of a Pawnee Indian who ends up being hung from a tree by the French with a sign around his neck saying ""We are all savages."" <br/><br/>The Revenant, though not as emotionally involving as it should be, meshes a powerful struggle for survival with elements of spiritual awareness. Unfortunately, however, its spiritual message does not include forgiveness and perpetuates the myth that wrongdoing can only be redeemed by superior force. It is nonetheless a physically stunning film whose natural beauty reminds us of the existence of a land with forests, rivers, and streams that has not yet been, as author Charles Eisenstein put it, ""destroyed by development: cordoned off, no-trespassed, filled in, cut down, paved over, and built up."" Though he has little dialogue, DiCaprio's performance is one of the best of his long career and worthy of an Oscar nomination, his eyes and body language expressing a fierce determination and strength of will. For Glass, there is only one way out of it and that's through it. It is a punishing test of endurance both for him and for the viewer."
"raptorguy14","6","1","3","31 January 2016"," Good movie, bad representation of history
","Let me start the review by saying that I actually enjoyed this movie. Sure it was much slower paced than most movies these days, but honestly, it's a survival story. What did you expect? The movie, based on a true story, centers around frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his struggle to survive in the wilderness after John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and a young Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) leave him for dead following a near fatal bear attack. Along the way, Glass is attacked twice by hostile Native Americans and manages to save an enslaved Native American girl from some French bad guys before finally being found by his exploration party. He and the leader of the party set out to find Fitzgerald after Bridger is arrested for treason and Glass eventually ends up killing Fitzgerald in a very well choreographed fight scene.<br/><br/>My main issue with the movie is the way they depicted Native Americans. The natives were depicted as being hostile savages always out for blood in the movie, only giving Glass a break after he saved one of their people. The reality is that the Native Americans didn't start sending arrows Glass's way whenever they caught a glimpse of him. They rushed to help him and provided him with supplies and sustenance that he probably would have died without. I thought we were beyond the idea that Native Americans were mindless fighting machines that needed to be put down by force. I guess the Emmy- winning Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee taught the writers nothing. Or maybe they haven't even seen it. Who knows.<br/><br/>Another big issue this movie has is in the way it ended. In the movie, Glass and Fitzgerald have one final bloody showdown. The fight is well choreographed but ends somewhat anticlimactically when Glass sends a dying Fitzgerald down the river (literally) to be scalped by Native Americans (who, again, are mindlessly and illogically hostile). The real confrontation was less violent but still interesting. After the events that took place, the real Fitzgerald moved to Nebraska and enlisted in the army at Fort Atkinson. The two had a confrontation but Glass decided to spare Fitzgerald's life because of the heavy penalty that came with murdering an enlisted army official. As for Jim Bridger, Glass gave him a pass due to how young and naive Bridger was at the time (he was still a teenager).<br/><br/>My opinion has always been this: If you want to make a movie about a fur trapper/explorer, go for it. If you want to loosely base it off of true events, go for it. Many people do this and are successful at it. As a standalone movie, The Revenant was good. And I understand that it's based on a book of the same name, but I have qualms about the book too.<br/><br/>However, if you want to make a movie/book based entirely on a true story, with the same character names, settings, etc., you have something of a responsibility to depict it accurately. You can put some embellished details here and there, that's fine, but twisting and warping reality to fit your concept of entertainment is pathetic and, to be frank, disrespectful to those involved. These were real people. These were real events. Real lives were affected. And especially when you paint Native Americans in such a disgustingly bad light, that's where I draw the line.<br/><br/>But I digress. Besides those major issues I have with the film, everything else was very well done. The production, the CGI, the acting, the dialogue (for the most part), the direction, etc. It was all good and it all worked well together. Do I think it's a good movie? For about the fourth-ish time, yes. Do I think it's a great movie? No, not exactly, and even though I like it, I don't think it deserves all the acclaim and attention it's getting. If it weren't for the major issues listed above, this movie would have gotten an 8, easily. But I also think it would have been just as interesting if they hadn't made the Native Americans villain-like and instead showed them helping him just as they did in real life. And to see Glass hunt down the man that left him for dead, only to spare his life when he does find him? That has a lot of emotional potential. I'm sure any director worth his weight in gold could make that work.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 6, but a reluctant 6 because I can tell they did everything they could to make this movie entertaining."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","3","31 January 2016"," Masterful craftsmanship elevates the brutal, challenging ""Revenant""
","Fresh off his Oscars for ""Birdman,"" Alejandro González Iñárritu makes a drastic change in scope and scale with ""The Revenant,"" a period survival drama set in the American frontier. But while the setting is wildly different, Iñárritu is still flexing a lot of his same filmmaking muscles. He really hones his unique cinematic stamp, thereby forcing most viewers to determine just how big of fans they are of his approach.<br/><br/>Working again with back-to-back Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki, Iñárritu has executed another visually immaculate picture worthy of a heap of technical awards. The challenge is the harrowing and brutal story serves as a sometimes painful contrast to the beauty of the craftsmanship.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio takes the plunge into cinematic hell with Iñárritu as Hugh Glass, the real-life early 19th century fur trapper and explorer. The film tells of his part in a fur-trading expedition and his legendary encounter with a grizzly bear, the man who left him for dead, and his subsequent pursuit of revenge. <br/><br/>Much of ""The Revenant"" is straightforward and grim. Iñárritu takes the viewer on a journey with his camera as the expedition is attacked from all sides by Arikara Native Americans in a series of gore-filled long shots. The rest of the film doesn't shy away from portraying the shoot-first savagery of the place and time, and also man's tumultuous relationship with nature. There are so many times when nature aggravates the situation but also times it alleviates it. Both nature and man prove to be merciful despite their brutality.<br/><br/>All these notions must be patiently synthesized from the film, which languishes compared to the pacing of similar survival stories. Iñárritu is far more interested in bringing poetry to the narrative than a gripping intensity. There are plenty of captivating moments, but also plenty of moments that exist as if solely to create a stunning visual portrait or add length to convey additional brutality to the circumstances of Glass' predicament. <br/><br/>The role of Glass is as unglamorous as it gets, which is really what sets it apart from the rest of DiCaprio's resume. Sure, it's showy, but horrific-makeup-scars showy, not sickly-charismatic-hair-perfectly-parted showy. So much of what DiCaprio does is understated, even if Iñárritu's camera pronounces that nuance. <br/><br/>Of the other roles, Tom Hardy makes for an excellent antagonist as Fitzgerald, the man who leaves Glass for dead (among other horrible things). The character exists primarily to embody the far extreme of greed and selfishness in this allegory about what motivates men, but Hardy puts his stamp on it to be sure.<br/><br/>Iñárritu and co-writer Mark L. Smith definitely aspire to a greater intellectual purpose for this film, but the delivery is anything but direct. Glass is constantly imagining his Native American wife throughout the story, for example, but it's hard to connect with these sparse moments of visual poetry. Yet ""The Revenant"" is still affecting and thought-provoking, especially if you take the time to really actively engage in viewing it, which is easier said than done given the runtime and filmmaking style.<br/><br/>A true experience of a film, ""The Revenant"" is so rich in production values, and its best moments are when those values immerse the viewer and inform the viewer's perspective on the story, rather than serve to create some ambiguous visual poetry. It's not a complete package, but it's an undeniable achievement.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"

","Ever since the first teaser for The Revenant came out, I was hyped out of my mind for this film. The amazing cinematography was already apparent in that 1 minute clip and is an amazing achievement for director Alejandro González Iñárritu . This was sure to be a cinematic masterpiece but would the story and characters be up to par with the visuals? Well, yes they are, but it's complicated...<br/><br/>As seen in the trailers The Reveant is about a man named Hugh Glass, played amazingly by Leonardo DiCaprio. Glass is traveling with a hunting party who go out right before winter to collect pelts to sell. Glass is responsible for the security of the companionship and has to make some tough calls in doing so. After a tragedy that befell him and his family, he never loses sight of his half-blood son Hawk. <br/><br/>Suddenly, the hunting party is under attack by a group of natives who force them to flee the scene and leave over twenty companions dead. Glass has to guide the party back to their stronghold but not everyone has much faith left in his judgment. Fitzgerald, portrayed by Tom Hardy, openly critiques Glass and his half-blood son. Things take a turn for the worse when DiCaprio's character is attacked by a bear in what is one of the most intense, gruesome and gritty scenes I have ever seen! The bear attack is a cinematic milestone on its own and is worth the price of admission if you have a strong enough stomach! It's after this attack that the story really picks up. <br/><br/>When Fitzgerald kills Hawk, he leaves Glass in a hole in the ground to die. It's at that point that the film turns into a tale of vengeance and survival as DiCaprio's character has to find a way to survive in brutal conditions on top of tracking down Fitzgerald to get his revenge.<br/><br/>What follows is a journey through a gorgeous and huge landscape, with danger around every corner. DiCaprio has to fight the elements, hunger, disease and death all while being hunted by natives. <br/><br/>As said earlier, The Revenant is visually breathtaking. Action scenes are often filmed in one shot that run for several minutes on end! It's this choice of not cutting up shots, that makes the action all the more intense (E.G. the bear attack) but more so for the drama! When DiCaprio is fighting the cold, you feel like you're right there with him, laying in the snow. When Glass is tending his gruesome wounds, you're cringing up and feel the pain he's going through. I'll just say what has to be said: DiCaprio has to win the Oscar this time! There is just no more way around him! If the academy wants even more dedication from DiCaprio before giving it to him, he's going to have to die, literally, while acting. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy is yet again on top of his game making him a serious contender for an Oscar in the near future! To see a British man play an American from the South, complete with the right accent and look, is just a massive achievement for Hardy as an actor! <br/><br/>The Revenant heavily relies on its sense of realism. In every aspect of it's storytelling, the sense of realism is there. The action is violent, gritty and bloody! The acting is in a realm above acting because none of the actors are pretending... They are actually freezing to death on screen in an unforgiving landscape and torturing weather! <br/><br/>The movie is not flawless however. There is one problem regarding the storytelling which I have to discuss. We as an audience are supposed to be devastated when Hawk is killed. The problem is that he isn't really likable as a character because he spends his time complaining and doesn't do much else. Though the relationship between Glass and his son is obviously that of a father and son but we never see them interact in a playful or fun way. Which doesn't help redeem Hawk's blandness. Glass is either harshly disciplining Hawk or they're hugging it out in flashbacks. So when Hawk dies, you're not really emotionally invested in what's happening because you don't care enough about Hawk to really be heartbroken. What does pull you into it however, is DiCaprio's performance! You really want to see him get his revenge but not because of what happened to his son, but because what he has to go through to get it. And while that's a major compliment to DiCaprio, it's also a flaw in the storytelling. <br/><br/>Another minor detail which I noticed was that the dubbing of certain lines really didn't match the movement of the lips. A lot of the native characters have this problem. Granted, their lines are all Indian which is really difficult to pull off given the use of long consecutive shots. However, this problem didn't occur for DiCaprio which is another compliment for him as an actor. <br/><br/>In summary I can say that The Revenant has met my expectations and that despite one apparent problem in the storytelling, The Revenant is a cinematic triumph! With amazing cinematography, superior acting and heart stopping action, The Revenant is a film you can't afford not to see in theaters!"
"jhmb2003","8","1","3","31 January 2016"," A sophisticated entertainment with a glimmer of poetry
","The Revenant is not a great movie, it is a solid, sophisticated entertainment, which sometimes achieves certain poetic intensity. But above all, it is a product made conscientiously to try and entertain big audiences, especially young people and adolescents. The plot, as known, is fairly linear and predictable, we do not care so much what will happen but how it will happen, and here the script writers have put their greatest efforts. The film is enhanced by multiple cinematographic, literary and historical references, although many of them may seem obvious to an experienced film viewer. The film succeeds at times to evoke the spirit of the novel Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy, because of its obsession with open spaces, exploring long distances and sometimes a true visionary power, trying to explore the American dream of racial domination and expansion under a standard of a relentless violence. Moreover, there are also references to other major films, such as Dersu Uzala, by Kurosawa, in a key scene in which the main character must share his helplessness with the Pawnee Indian. In my opinion, the movie reaches its splendor during this part. There are even references to ancient literary traditions, such as the Song of the Cid, an epic poem of the Spanish Middle Ages (a clue scene almost at the end of the movie). All told, the film, like all major Hollywood productions, suffers from gigantism, exaggerations and unnecessary cruelties of dramatic effects, and some implausibility. The characters still tend to be quite credible, but the superlative performances achieved disguise the little affection that writers have for their characters."
"lasttimeisaw","8","1","3","31 January 2016"," Ecstatic beauty of a linear survival tale
","Of course we can tease that DiCaprio has turned Inarritu's latest majestically-looking Western revenge saga as his almost-perfect Oscar-draw with all the exacting physical tribulations: severely mauled by a bear, being buried alive, worming his way in the wild, floating on the raging torrent, eating raw fish and bison liver, falling from a cliff and keeping warm inside a dead horse's cavity, etc. etc. some of those are real deal, others are cinematic creation, but there is no shame for an actor challenges himself to the extreme in order to win an Oscar award, although to many a cinephile, most of time Oscar looks like a joke, but for those whose career is making movies, getting the recognition from their peers is a huge honour and temptation rather difficult to refuse, also at least Leo does all those impressive stunts in his film instead of in the tiresome self- campaign.<br/><br/>Last year's Oscar winner Inarritu returns with an even more grandstanding showpiece, running over 2 and a half hours, the narrative is fairly simple, inspired by a true event, in 1820s, a member of a fur trading expedition, Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), survives a deadly bear attack and embarks on an astounding journey to avenge the killer of his Pawnee son Hawk (Goodluck). Basically, it is an eye- opening survival tale plus an old-fashion Western ending, but under Inarritu's perfectionist and harsh working ethos, DP Emmanuel Lubezki's mind-blowing visual grandeur (I'm talking about THE TREE OF LIFE level of magnificence, even the sky is not the limit for this guy!) and a fearless cast headed by DiCaprio and Hardy, we are awed to witness Hugh's entire ordeal with admiration and inconceivability. One sure thing, apart from Leo's Oscar chance, is Lubezki is on the fast track to fulfil his hat trick after GRAVITY (2013) and BIRDMAN (2014), one can only feel particularly sorry for Roger Deakins, who might lose to the same guy three times (consecutively) after his 13th nomination for SICARIO (2015) and still be Oscar-less.<br/><br/>Beyond the shadow of a doubt, this year finally belongs to Leonardo DiCaprio, personally I am not a fan of bodily transformation or endeavour, because the highest achievement of acting is reflected through an actor's expressions and articulation, to convey one's subtle or un-subtle emotions, other things are all bells and whistles, but after beholding all those exploits, one has to surrender to a feeling of commiseration, give Leo the damn Oscar!<br/><br/>An interesting side-note is that every time DiCaprio is nominated for an Oscar in leading role, there is always a collateral supporting nomination for his male co-star, first is Alan Alda in THE AVIATOR (2004), then, Djimon Hounsou in BLOOD DIAMOND (2006), next Jonah Hill in THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013), and this time the fluke comes upon Tom Hardy (three out of four, save Hounsou, their nominations happen out of nowhere without any significant precursors), who plays Hugh's nemesis John Fitzgerald, although it is a very dark character, Hardy generates great intimidation but as a whole not exceptionally superior to his other works, so the nomination could be conceived as a career-boost for his consistent output and a banner year in 2015 (with MAD MAX: FURY ROAD and LEGEND), although his co-star Domhnall Gleeson, has an even more staggering line-up (EX MACHINA, STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS and BROOKLYN).<br/><br/>After my tepid reception towards BIRDMAN, THE REVEMANT complacently shows more potentialities of Inarritu as a visionary auteur, his compassion for the indigenous and scorn to the Western colonisation, are all admiring, only if he could underplay the flourishes a little bit and find some source material more pioneering other than boosting self-worth and endurance, that's my little wishful thinking."
"Jegcpr","7","1","3","30 January 2016"," Close but no cigar.
","In my opinion this movie its good but its not perfect. Its good for obvious reasons, it has Leo DiCaprio on it, It has has Tom Hardy on it, its directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu and and it has scenes surrounded by beautiful scenery and captured all in a spectacular lens hold by no other than Emmanuel Lubezki which might just earn the movie an Oscar for best cinematography although the competition its pretty hard. I mean come on, Sicario and Mad Max had phenomenal cinematography, well just have to see. Beside that and now talking about Leo's performance I thought (for those of you who has already watched the movie) that the real bear for Leonardo was Tom Hardy. I thought that if Leonardo Dicaprio could make me want to see his scenes even more that the ones with Hardy then DiCaprio could actually win an Oscar for the first time. If Leonardo DiCaprio proves himself acting better than Tom Hardy then he could actually do it, he could actually win the Oscar. But I still doubt it. Hardy as expected for me acted so superior compared to Leonardo and Im not saying Leonardo DiCaprio isn't a good actor, i just think that when it comes to acting Leonardo DiCaprio still can't escape or ovecome himself. At the end he can't leave his trail and become something else, something different, something new. Tom Hardy in the other hand its so versatile and can actually leave no trail of himself when most needed. Proof of this is Bronson, Dark Knight Rises and now this. A well deserved nomination at best supporting actor. Now lets talk about the director. What happened to Alejandro. For a minute I thought I was watching a Terrence Malick movie not because of the narrative but because of the amazing cinematogrphy used many time in his movies. Also at times i felt i was seeing something from the Coen Brothers, Tarantino and even Arronofsky. ¿No more Multilinear Hyperlink Spatial Cinema? Anyway, if the story had been a little more interesting maybe and just maybe i could've accept that the movie wins the Oscar for best picture, but the story falls short and ends up resting on the cinematography and the performances of Tom Hardy and some of the performances by Leonardo DiCaprio (just some, the bear scene for example). Well, this was my honest opinion. I hope it helps somehow. Please excuse my English. Thank you very much."
"jan-scheidtweiler","8","1","3","30 January 2016"," The Epic Western revisited
","As most IMDb.com contributors, I have seen my share of Western movies. Most of them tend to glorify the conquest of the American West and contribute to the romantic image a lot of people still have of the Wild West. This movie is both a Western and an anti-Western: it tells us some very profound things about the way the United States was shaped in those early years (the story is set in the 1820's), but at the same time it does so in a very unromantic way. Maybe that's one reason why this movie has done so well with the jury that decides on the Oscar nominations: it's an epic Western, a genre held in high esteem in Hollywood history, but it is very much a Western revisited. The improbable chain of events frontiersman Hugh Glass is involved in, can sometimes get quite improbable: some scenes were so unlikely it drew laughs from the audience. Surely it is not a spoiler to mention that Mr. Di Caprio sleeps inside a horse (after having disembowled it) or has a close encounter with a grizzly bear. But also minor elements seem unlikely: e.g., how do you keep your gunpowder dry after having been submerged and swept away for miles on end by a glacial river ? Hugh Glass is, in many respects, very much a one dimensional character: the lone hero, lusting for revenge. But is doesn't do the movie justice just to leave it at that easy criticism. At the same time it is a quite profound movie. What moved me most about it was the way nature, and life itself, is portrayed. It is unforbidding, starkly beautiful and harsh and goes it's own course, indifferent to mankind. The overwhelming beauty of nature, the mountains, the rivers, is, besides Mr. Hardy and Mr. DiCaprio, a main character in this movie. There are many moving scenes where director Alejandro Inarritu draws our attention to just that: sometimes he just lets us watch the river, the moon or the trees. The way Hugh Glass slightly touches the dead horse as a sign of respect for being his 'host' is strangely compelling, although it's a detail in a movie that grips you right from the start with its daredevil adventure and gruesome action... Oscar experts have correctly noticed that this movie is also expertly well edited - the action scenes, especially the one where Mr. Di Caprio meets a grizzly bear are very, very skillful. A special mention also for the cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki: he makes the 1820's really come alive and adds reality to the scenes by using natural light and allowing his camera lens to be fogged or splattered with blood..."
"petergrump1","9","1","3","27 January 2016"," A Visceral Victory
","The Revenant does something very different from what we see today in films. It doesn't try to tell a story, but to have the audience experience it. <br/><br/>The Revenant is based on the real life journey of trapper Hugh Glass (Leonardo Dicaprio) as he makes his way across the American Wilderness in the early 1800s after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by his fellow trappers. There are also several subplots in the film that all culminate in the final, but by the end they all tie back to Glass's journey. <br/><br/>If you asked what The Revenant is in one word it would be visceral. For most of Glass's journey he is alone, and that means much of the film is without dialogue. The film chooses to tell its story through visuals instead, and this is certainly helped by the beautiful cinematography. The shots are so wide and expansive showing a huge, empty, snow- covered land that Glass must trek. It truly is so breathtaking that it seems to almost be alien, the land seems so unfamiliar by today's highly modernized society that the film is almost a fantasy. However, there is a point where the expansive shots become somewhat intrusive and break the narrative's flow, but it is hard to complain as each one is more beautiful than the last. There are also many nuances that help the film become more immersive, such as when characters breathe the camera lens will become foggy or the camera will switch from the perspective of the character to the perspective of the audience (This entails parts that go from a first person perspective to a third person perspective). These are small details, but they help the film create a much more realistic world. If you were forced to describe The Revenant with another word it would be unpleasant. From the brutally clear sound mixing to the downright terrifying action sequences, The Revenant is not for the faint of heart. The film immerses you in its reality, but that reality is an incredibly brutal one. Some scenes go on for so long while Glass endures such physical pain that is hard to watch, let alone stomach. Even the sounds and sights can be disorienting, confusing or just downright painful (such as one part where a man repeatedly scrapes a knife against a canteen) and even though the film going experience is certainly not a fun one because of this, but it almost puts you in Glass's shoes by subjecting you to the harsh reality that he lives in. <br/><br/>Now since a lot of the film is just Glass attempting to survive that means for the whole film to work, Leonardo Dicaprio has to be believable as Glass. He succeeds with flying colors, and with very few words. His actions and facial expressions communicate much of Glass's thoughts from disgust to anger to one scene where Glass shows a hint of joy. There are many little details in his performance that really help make it further believable. There is one part where all Glass does is turn around to investigate a strange sound, all Dicaprio has to do in this scene is turn around. However, there is a slight detail in his face that makes it more believable: he raises his eyebrow before turning around. It seems like a very small thing, but it shows Dicaprio's commitment to the role down to the slightest detail. Conclusion: While certainly not without its flaws, The Revenant is a brutal, harsh and quiet visceral experience, one that will draw you in, thrash you around and spit you out."
"mr-cashbilbo","8","1","3","27 January 2016"," A physically arduous film in the best way possible.
","The Revenant, straight off the bat is a great film, the acting is incredible with the standouts being Leonardo DiCaprio, Domhnall Gleeson and Tom Hardy in my opinion even outshining DiCaprio in some scenes. Ultimately though the best performance was delivered by DiCaprio. It takes place in 1820's America, following frontiersman Hugh Glass on a journey of revenge sparked during a fur trading expedition gone wrong. <br/><br/>The effects were astonishing as well, every shot in this film looks like a dope screensaver, the make-up is fantastic and the film is scored perfectly. The film is long (at 2 hrs 36 mins) and certainly feels long but I honestly couldn't look away from the screen. It takes realism to the next level with camera work and cinematography (being shot with only natural light) and the violence is not clean either, it's gritty, realistic and hard to watch but its very appropriate for the subject matter.This film is also very respectful in it's portrayal of native Americans. <br/><br/>All in all the pure devotion to this film really shines through due to the hard work of the passionate cast and crew, DiCaprio's devotion to this project alone is outstanding. To some this may seem long and arduous and hard to watch due to the extreme violence and gritty, realistic tone of the film but I found it thoroughly entertaining and would probably watch it for the scenery alone. Great flick, psyched to watch it again."

","When 'The Revenant' was announced, I figured it was just another movie that Leo signed on for to get his Oscar. Then the first trailer dropped and my opinion turned on a dime. This film was very well done. I see where people are coming from when they think the movie is hollow. However, people need to think a bit deeper in this film. There are multiple deeper messages than just being a revenge story throughout the piece. <br/><br/>First things first, Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is some of the greatest of all time. People will lean forward in their seats from multiple long and up close shots that blow your mind and make you wonder just how each shot was done.<br/><br/>Many people are talking about DiCaprio's performance and ignoring another large part of the film. While Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is mainly physical as he only has about 20 or so lines of dialogue (most of which not even in English), Tom Hardy's performance is mainly dialogue driven as he provides context for pivotal points within the film. Hardy and DiCaprio's performance go hand in hand to create a very interesting dynamic between the two characters.<br/><br/>The directing by Alejandro G. Innaritu is also extremely well done. The shots and acting wouldn't have been possible without his brains behind the computer. <br/><br/>Overall, the film overstays it's welcome a bit. The two and a half hour run time begins to become prevalent to the two hour mark. It would have been possible to shave off some scenes like the horse sleeping scene. I have a specific opinion that the last shot of a film is extremely important. I believe this film wastes it's last shot and leaves a strange taste in your mouth as opposed to the mystery it wants to leave you with. In the end, the film is well done and well delivered with the help of a likely Oscar winning performance from Leonardo DiCaprio and a strong supporting cast of Tom Hardy, Domnhall Gleason, and Will Poulter."

","The Revenant takes place before the Civil War and tells the story of frontiersman Hugh Glass, a navigator for a group of American fur trappers. After being betrayed and left for dead, Hugh ventures through the wilderness and endures through the beautiful yet brutal forces of nature to seek his revenge.<br/><br/>The direction and cinematography were excellent and were the driving force of the film. From the very beginning, Innaritu pulls you into the harsh world of Midwest Pre-Civil War America. If you're a fan of his camera-work in Birdman, be prepared for more of that. Innaritu's vision captures the right moments and details to gasp in horror and to cringe in pain. The film often cuts to location nature shots; every shot was absolutely beautiful. I felt like I was transported there and taking a beautiful morning hike when I was not being mauled by a bear.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Hugh Glass as our lead man braving through the winter. It was almost as if the film was an advertisement to convince the Academy to give DiCaprio his Oscar. ""Look at all of this crazy stuff he had to do this for this role! Give it to him!"" Jokes aside, DiCaprio performs the part well; his body and facial language were well executed and helped convey the pain and wear his body endures through the harsh winters and dangerous creatures within. I don't believe the performance to be Oscar-worthy compared to his other roles, because, in this film, he mostly acts in pain and suffering throughout. There isn't much in terms of character development and depth; Innaritu explores some of that in his flashbacks, but leaves the details subtle and easily missed.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy does an excellent job portraying the antagonist; he feels for his character and, though he is portrayed as a villain, manages to make the audience feel empathetic for him and understand his viewpoint.<br/><br/>What surprised me was Will Poulter's emotional performance as Jim Bridger. The emotion he conveys felt natural and tense at the right moments, and his interaction with Tom Hardy brewed some unexpected dynamics between the two in their respective roles.<br/><br/>What I found the film lacking in was its story and its pacing. The plot is very straightforward, and the form of the film presents it linearly. We get it, there's tension and Glass wants his revenge. The story has been told countless times in various (and better) forms. At times, the film felt so slow because of its lack of plot. While the length of the film helps accentuate how long Glass endures through the nature, there are a lot of times the film focuses on the atmosphere and intensity of the film rather than the actual plot and pacing.<br/><br/>Overall, The Revenant is a survivor and revenge film all in one. With a simple plot, Innaritu is able to focus on Glass' endurance and drive through the beauty and beast of nature."
"hamidnoori03","8","1","3","26 January 2016"," Wonderful directing and acting...I was just expecting more:..
","This movie would be a perfection if the audience are unaware of the magic that Inarittu can produce in his movies....movies like Birdman would be a great example... Still this movie did really amaze me with scenes like the bear attack and the ending scenes.. Leonardo Dicaprio did great as usual, but what is really important is Tom's performance because his performance shows us how much he has grown up as an actor since the days of Inception. As a big Leornardo Dicaprio fan I would recommend this movie before watching it myself, but now that I have watched it I can say it with lots of confidence that you will not be disappointed..."
"nmholland","9","1","3","26 January 2016"," Surprisingly Good for January
","The Revenant is directed by Alejandro Iñárritu and is based on the true events of an nineteenth century fur trapper named Hugh Glass (Leonardo Dicaprio) and his epic tale of redemption. After he is savagely attacked by a grizzly bear, Hugh must be taken care of by his fellow expeditioners, which proves to be hard. After his team leader accepts that he is just a burden, he pays three men to stay behind and take care of him, while the rest push on forward. The three men that stay behind are Hugh's Native American son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), a rival of Hugh's named Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), and another teenage boy named Bridger (Will Poulter). Fitzgerald eventually murders Hugh's son, buries Hugh alive, and takes off with Bridger, lying to him about Hawk's fate. Then, Hugh crawls out of his early grave to seek vengeance upon Fitzgerald.<br/><br/>I saw this movie the day it premiered in my state, on January 8, and walked in expecting a crappy January movie, and I was dead wrong. The Revenant, I think, is definitely an Oscar worthy movie, and only competition would feature Spotlight, Mad Max: Fury Road, and The Martian. If not for those three films, The Revenant would win without a doubt. First I'll discuss the better qualities, then I'll jump into the negatives.<br/><br/>To start off, this movie has literally the best cinematography in movie history, apart from Avatar (2009). This film looks absolutely beautiful. Some of the shots look unreal due to how amazing they look. When Iñárritu was filming The Revenant, he refused to use any lighting effects at all. Yes, obviously, the editing team enhanced it, but all lighting in the film was either form the sun, the moon, or fire. That's risky, and it worked out masterfully.<br/><br/>Another thing was Dicaprio's acting. It genuinely makes me mad that this man has yet to win an Oscar, but if he doesn't for this film, I'll just be that much more mad. He has already won the Golden Globe for best actor, but that's just not the same. Another great performance is Tom Hardy's. Tom Hardy is already an amazing actor, but this just shows off his skill even more. He really proves himself in this movie, and shows that his abilities are barely below, if not on par, with the greats like Dicaprio.<br/><br/>A third amazing thing about the film was the script. Prior to the live burial of Glass, there really wasn't too much dialogue throughout. It had bits and pieces here and there, mostly between Fitzgerald and Bridger, but there was still a large absence of lines. Some people will complain about this, but I think it really helps the film. This movie is supposed to be very real and wild, and in a situation like that, a man that's alone for most of the movie wouldn't really talk too much. So the lack of speaking really advances the film.<br/><br/>Now there are some bad things to the movie, just like every other one. It's main problem is the run time. The movie is good, of course, and the plot is exciting, but the movie seemed a little too long. The movie comes in at about 2 hours and 36 minutes. Now, personally think they should've shaved off 15 or 20 minutes, and it would've been a bit better. Obviously that's a small problem, but I can't say the movie's perfect when it's not.<br/><br/>So, overall, I would commend The Revenant for its cinematography, acting, directing, and script. After a lot of thought, I'd give The Revenant an A, or a 9 out of 10 stars."
"Wade_J","8","1","3","26 January 2016"," Yea it's gorgeous, but is there more to it?
","""The Revenant"" is Alejandro González Iñárritu's follow up to his Best Picture Winner: ""Birdman"". The film was shot using natural light, meaning that during production only a select number of hours were available for shooting each day. The crew was put through harsh winter conditions in pursuit of shooting the film in the most authentic way possible. However, is this all a giant gimmick for positive word of mouth or is this worthy of it's Best Picture nomination? I am partial to the latter. <br/><br/>What it excels at: <br/><br/>* The cinematography is absolutely stunning, utilizing long takes to fully immerse you in the frontier setting. I was shivering in my seat. The film is a technical masterpiece, the finest film-making of 2015.<br/><br/>*DiCaprio dedicates himself entirely to the role. He may not have too many lines of dialogue, but he compensates with excellent facial expressions and practical stunt work. Tom Hardy's Fitzgerald is an enthralling antagonist, who's motives are easy to grasp onto. <br/><br/>* The violence is brutal and bare knuckle. No quick cuts, No BS.<br/><br/>Possible flaws: <br/><br/>* The middle act can be repetitive, as it mainly involves a chain of scenes, in which DiCaprio's character must overcome nature's brutal conditions. <br/><br/>* The movie has underlying themes of revenge, religion and even capitalism. When the movie was over, it wasn't entirely clear (to me at least) what I was supposed to be walking away with in regards to the film's position on those themes.<br/><br/>Who I recommend it for: <br/><br/>Anyone who can appreciate stellar film- making and in the mood of an exhaustive but rewarding survival adventure. If you don't care much for beautiful landscape shots of nature, the 2nd act may feel a but lengthy."
"panchodh_12","7","1","3","26 January 2016"," Not your average Oscars movie
","The Revenant is, for the most of it, DiCaprio crawling and moaning. Of course, that gets tiring at some point. The movie could, easily, be half an hour shorter, and that would perhaps make it more enjoyable. But also The Revenant is a very ambitious movie. On the technical side, it is flawless, and it uses the natural scenarios, the lights and the sound perfectly. It is even more impressive when you know that it was only shot with natural light! At some points it seems like the plot (which isn't precisely noteworthy) is just an excuse for Iñárritu to shoot a wildlife documentary, because the landscapes are truly breathtaking, and they take a considerable amount of screen time.<br/><br/>What is most memorable from this film is, I think, the camera techniques. From extensively long shots depicting intense battle scenes, to clever, smooth transitions between scenes, the use of the camera has become something of Iñárritu's trademark. What I found most interesting was the ways in which he breaks the fourth wall at different points of the movie; from DiCaprio's final closeup to the staining of the camera with the actor's breath/blood. Acting-wise, Hardy's performance is definitely Oscar-worthy, unlike, in my opinion, DiCaprio's (not that he is a bad actor; I just wouldn't give an Oscar to a performance that is mostly, as I said before, moaning and crawling).<br/><br/>With its length, lack of dialogue, and somewhat experimental directing, this is not the most usual Hollywood's awards season blockbuster. One would expect the Academy to prefer more discreet dramas in the lines of The King's Speech or Million Dollar Baby, but, who knows, maybe I'm mistaken."
"AliceofX","8","1","3","26 January 2016"," Slow Moving Spectacle
","What strikes one about The Revenant is its realism. It gives the feeling that you're actually there as the characters are (literally) breathing unto the camera. It is a gorgeously looking movie that's a love letter to nature. However the cinematography is almost better than the story actually deserves.<br/><br/>The problem is that The Revenant drags its feet. It is a two and a half hour film and you feel it easily could have been shortened down to two hours of even less when you look at the actual substance of the story. Its slow movement and too many weird dream sequences can wear one's patience down.<br/><br/>That said if you don't mind slow moving films then The Revenant is highly recommendable. It is a quality drama film with solid performances. It is teeming with metaphors that will take many viewings to decipher. The story was good, but I did not like the ending. For all the time that it took to get there the final resolution felt quick. In fact the movie is less satisfying the more it goes on.<br/><br/>Overall The Revenant is a spectacle that's a visual joy, but I doubt its for everyone. I'm not even sure whether I liked it and my high score is due more to the film's obvious quality rather than personal favour."
"alanpetertravers","8","1","3","26 January 2016"," An endurance test like no other, compelling beauty vs brutality!
","Sit back, take a deep breath and brace yourself for a 2 and a half hour journey of the most gritty intense survival scenes you will ever witness this year! Nature truly is a beast! The Revanant is another visual masterpiece from the masterminds who brought us Birdman: Lubezki and Inarritu. However this time they have moved on from black comedy to give us a more realistic and bleak approach to a true story that depicts the survival instincts of Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) a 19th century Fur trapper and Frontiersman. <br/><br/>The one shot technique that made Birdman so unique is used sparingly in The Revenant but to even greater effect, namely the opening attack scene which is one of the most jaw dropping action scenes I have ever witnessed in cinema. You cannot help but be impressed no matter how pretentious you may have found the technique in Birdman. The sound and visuals literally bring you right into the action depicted on screen. You feel every arrow, shot and scream happening around you resulting in a fuelled, thrilling and dare I say claustrophobic sensation.<br/><br/>The Revenant contains some very long drawn out scenes designed to give the viewer a mesmerising (if a little uncomfortable) watch at times. The biggest example being the bear attack scene in which I was clenching my teeth throughout! You could be forgiven for believing they used a real bear at times as the use of CGI is incredible and is nurtured in impeccable detail from it's movement and behaviour though to the interaction with the Character.<br/><br/>The acting is undeniably Oscar worthy from both Dicaprio and Hardy. Dicaprio had the opportunity in this to act his absolute socks off, we literally feel every bone crunching movement and lung shattering breath that emerges from him after the onslaught which is hard to take at times. Surely he's gone through enough to finally earn himself that elusive Oscar that annually denies him but we'll have to wait and see! Hardy as usual gives what always seems like an effortless natural performance as Fitzgerald. He has one of those rare talents that goes beyond acting and simply just 'becomes' his character like DeNiro used to do in his younger years (before the joy of 'Grudge Match' and 'Dirty Granpa!' haha) Like his portrayal of Bane you can't understand half the words coming out of his mouth but it doesn't seem to matter, you know it's good! ;)<br/><br/>Beyond the intense brutality and dark tonal qualities of the film however lies a layer of immense beauty. The cinematography of Lubezki is overwhelmingly gorgeous and illustrates the natural surroundings in all it's glory giving an almost hypnotic feel to the film, one that is more than welcome to the viewer.<br/><br/>However, in all it's visual beauty and intense action scenes the story and screenplay leaves a little more to be desired and this is where I believe the movie falls short. The taglines and discussions will have you believe this is a great revenge story and they wouldn't be entirely wrong, however the revenge plot feels a little forced (possibly to give the main character even more motivation for his actions) and the relationship with his native son lacks emotion. The real emotion of the film comes from Glass' willingness to survive under the harshest of circumstances and his relationships with some of the Ankara natives he interacts with along the way. Sadly there is not enough screen time between him and his son to draw up a real bond for the viewer to care about and it's this problem that lets down the last 20mins of the film no matter how intense Inarritu makes them.<br/><br/>Having said that the movie hosts an incredibly haunting soundtrack, GRIPPING visuals and brilliant performances through out to make this movie a must see at the cinema. Some may not have the stomach to give it a second viewing but I personally would go see this again. Looking forward to Inarritu's next project. :)"

","The story of Hugh Glass and his survival through the cold winter is amazing. It's a strong and powerful story, and it was crazy to watch. <br/><br/>The cinematography - done by Emmanuel Lubezki - was absolutely over the top. Everything was filmed perfectly and it had some amazing shots, especially with Leonardo DiCaprio. But it shouldn't surprise anyone that Lubezki can do something so well. Anyway, the plot is a bit thin, but it shouldn't have been done differently, because I'm a fan of sticking to the real story as much as possibly, and Alejandro Iñárritu did a great job at changing small things about the story, so that it would fit a movie - maybe an Oscar- winning movie, who knows?<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy are absolutely flawless in this one. I couldn't recognize Hardy at all. If I hadn't know it was him from the beginning, I wouldn't have known. They played their roles so well, and even though there wasn't a lot of talk, and most of the conversations was foreign, it still worked because the actors did their part on showing us what they felt without saying anything.<br/><br/>It's a very strong movie, and there's not a lot of happy, fluffy feeling in it - just to let you know. It's an action movie about death and survival and races. It's beautifully done, and the costumes are amazing, and the make-up even better. You'll definitely miss something by not watching it."
"nlytnd_1","7","1","3","23 January 2016"," Visually Awesome! Mundane Storyline! Bear Scene is Epic! Overall Worth Watching!
","The one thing that really got me thinking upon completing this film is, how did DiCaprio know that this was going to be a good movie? I can't imagine anything about the script would cause an A list actor to jump on the role. It's essentially a vengeance type film (someone wronged/killed you or your family)... this film adds the extra element that the hero has to achieve this while being on deaths door and has to drudge through insanely beautiful terrain to do it. Also to note, the bear attack scene is unbelievable! It's the best CGI I've ever seen. Anyways, did DiCaprio go to a psychic, or maybe I'm just missing something? I would love to know what caused him to choose this role? I can imagine he wanted the challenge of doing something different from anything he had ever done before. With one of the big challenges in this role being very little dialogue and having to rely on facial expressions etc. Very difficult role and he was excellent as always (I'm not sure if this will get him the best actor nomination, but it may). I can imagine one of the motivating factors was, Dicaprio had just completed Wolf of Wall street, which I wouldn't be surprised if it holds the record for the most dialogue for a character in the history of cinema. So DiCaprio now jumps completely on the opposite side of the spectrum in this film. <br/><br/>Overall this movie is worth the watch for most people. As I said, the plot is very simple, but the visuals are perfect. <br/><br/>Some nit picks, which has spoilers. Watching the hero of the film drudge around in constant pain gets to be kind of draining. I can take it for a little bit, but dude! And when Hugh (Dicaprio) eventually catches up to the villain dude... I understand they want to make it suspenseful, but to me it comes across really lame and cheesy when everything for the most part had taken the straight arrow realistic movie style to that point only for it to result in your typical hero meets villain final fight scene, with back and forths with both people getting stabbed and beat etc. Hugh had been spot on with the gun up until the final scene where he grazes the villain at point blank range. Now we get to watch Hugh take more abuse...oye very!!! I would have rather the suspense revolve around the villain breaking away from Hugh to were it seems as though he just might be home free only for Hugh to do something drastic in order to find him and/or catch up with him. No need for corny back and forths."

Alongside this is once again the faultless Leonardo DiCaprio, with acting portrayed purely by emotions and minimal dialogue that captures the pain and struggle of Hugh Glass on a journey of survival, love and revenge. Tom hardy has proved himself to be one of the most sort after actors today, and you can see why. This may not be his best role but is one that is perfectly portrayed.<br/><br/>Finally this may be the year DiCaprio wins the Oscar for best actor and I can see why, he has already proved himself with countless great performances over the years so it will be about time, but ultimately the star of this film is the Director. From behind the camera Alejandro Inarritu has created a film that may be the most beautiful and powerful in the last decade."

","Unless you've been in a cave, you know this is the story of a frontiersman mauled by a bear and left by his comrades to die. It is a classic man against nature survival story. Add in bad guy French trappers, mostly hostile Native Americans and greedy deceitful individuals that round out the characters.<br/><br/>The real star is the environment. It is beautifully photographed. Plenty of ice, snow, running water and wind in the trees. The fact that this movie was made in obvious treacherous locations is just amazing.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio had best clear space on his mantel for all the awards he will pick up for this performance. In a time of dialogue driven movies, he is too cold, too alone and too hurt to say much. His performance is all over his frosted face. Tom Hardy is a bit of a one note bad guy. Will Poulter, best in ""We're the Millers"" was distractingly miscast.<br/><br/>Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu deserves the credit for getting this made and making it in what seemed like unworkable conditions. Unfortunately the hand of the director is felt more then once in distracting flashbacks and the now signature Inarritu levitation of characters. <br/><br/>The movie is too long, yet some things seemed rushed. Why did the Pawnee Indian leave DiCaprio except for a dramatic highly staged later scene? Why didn't the Captain take more men to track and capture Fitzgerald? The writer and director and the audience knew it would come down to a DiCaprio, Hardy fight at the end. The unsubtle tattoo on the girl and the marking on the canteen are fodder for future satire. <br/><br/>See this in a theater on the biggest screen available. There is a turn your stomach level of violence and gore. It may not be a good time at the movies, but it is remarkable movie making."
"eng-bebosco","8","1","3","20 January 2016"," Give Me Innaritu Direction and Lubezki Camera.. Give you A Stun Up..!
","Watching ""Birdman"" for the third time, I viewed it just to appreciate the cinematography. On first viewing I only wanted to immerse myself in what was promised to be a groundbreaking and highly enjoyable trip to the theater; it was, in no small measure. When you spend the entirety of the film looking for a ""cut,"" you aren't absorbing, you are monitoring. Knowing that Inarritu was using the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubeszki again for ""The Revenant,"" it was a chore not to measure cut lengths, camera movement, and blocking. This was not a distraction, just an affirmation that I would need to see this film again, and again simply for appreciation.<br/><br/>This story doesn't build to a finale so much as sustain a continued agony that is bearable to the viewer through character perseverance and beautiful filmmaker craft. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't demand pity for his situation, he doesn't relent in his drive long enough to evoke sympathetic emotions. From the first mechanically shot battle sequence, we are spectators to this man, and we don't want to leave him. The world that Glass resides in is beyond hostile, and there is very little reason why we should want him to survive so badly, but that feeling is sustained throughout. Revenge becomes a murky motivation until it needs a boost. Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald gives us plenty of reason to see Glass through to the end and exact it.<br/><br/>Fitzgerald is the soulless volunteer who callously leaves Hugh for dead and sees the world as carrying a debt that is owed to him. The pacing of Glass's survival juxtaposed to Fitzgerald's damnable existence back at base, fuel the audiences involvement in exquisite balance. Anytime you wonder ""What is Glass even fighting for anymore?"" Hardy steals a scene that demands retribution. Aside from Fitzgerald and the terrain, the local Native American Pawnee tribe are a continued threat, always fast on Glass's heals. As overwhelming as this may seem, there is never a moment where it doesn't feel authentic.<br/><br/>Due to the sustained tension throughout this movie, the climax doesn't pack the punch we are accustomed to. There is an unnecessary use of Dues Ex Machina in the final moments that doesn't hurt the plot, but makes it feel needlessly formulaic. Long-takes blended in with seamless choreography of action make this a prime candidate for Best Picture and Cinematography. Leo's performance is second to none this year. And it should be noted that if Inarritu pulls off an Oscar for directing, it will be the third consecutive Mexican won award, his second in a row. This is a great year for film, and whatever the cast and crew of The Revenant walk away with in February, I begrudge them nothing."
"theorobertfisher","7","1","3","19 January 2016"," Average film on an epic scale
","Firstly, the acting in this film cannot be questioned, Dicaprio, the underrated performance( in my opinion) of Tom hardy, Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson really bring alive what in fact is a simple, predictable script and formulaic story. The latter of which cannot be complained about as you must surely have a grasp on how the film will finish going in, with Dicaprio(Hugh Glass) finding and killing( or serving on a plate) Hardy(John Fitzgerald) in a brutal fight to the death which was beautifully shot and captured. <br/><br/>It is the way this film is captured that makes it Oscar bait and thus a 12 time nominated picture. With Inarriru and Lubezki choosing to shoot with natural light, in real locations, with some of the long takes that were so brilliantly seen in Birdman. Coupled with the engineering of an avalanche, the brutal almost life like bear attack and the actors willingness to push themselves that really take the film to another level than you'd expect from what is basically a 19th century Hollywood action movie with a 140 million dollar budget.<br/><br/>I was expecting the film to probably stand still at points and basically be time filling between the brutal battles at the beginning and end of the film, with basically just 2 hours of Dicaprio demonstrating his acting skills. However I was surprised at the amount of on screen time for both Hardy and Poulter who formed an interesting relationship on screen and I believe saved the audience from watching Hugh glass drag himself across the floor for 2 hours+, as we know Dicaprio has a talent for such a task(flashback to the Wolf of Wall Street) and I believe credit has to go to Inarritu for focusing not just on Glass and his remarkable story but allowing us to also revel in Hardy's performance, which I believe is his best to date and worthy of winning the supporting actor race. While Leonardo Dicaprio's performance cannot be denied and as much as he deserves recognition and will probably win best actor, I don't believe it's his best or in fact as commendable as Michael Faabender's effort in Steve jobs. <br/><br/>I imagine we will not see a film that feels so real and on a scale of this magnitude for some time and it is nice to see an era of real live action sequences (without CGI, minus the bear) beginning to emerge once again with this and of course Mad max Fury Road, which is why I believe people should look past the predictable nature of the script and see the epic scale of what Inarritu and Lubezki persevered for years to create."

","I mean seriously, how much longer do we have to wait for DiCaprio to get his first Oscar, the that seems to elude his grasp every time. What else does this man need to do to get the Oscar's respect. Usually the awards don't matter, but darn it I want Leo to get this award finally. Why? The Revenant offers perhaps Leo's best and most physical performance ever. In terms of best performance that's saying a lot as he's been in The Aviator, Titanic, and Inception, films he should have won for, but awards aside, Leo keeps gaining my respect. He's really the one who stands out in this film along with Tom Hardy who gives another nitty-gritty performance. Also, Alejandro Inarritu's subtle directing doesn't make this as over-the-top like if Tarantino did this, but Inarritu takes time to write the stories and makes this a very compelling survival story and revenge. But the one negative is the revenge isn't as sweet as I was hoping. Considering everything Hardy's character did, Leo should have gotten a more sweet revenge then what he got, but instead Inarritu takes the more mature route, and it does seem underwhelming after everything we as the audience has seen, I was expecting a bigger payoff. But other then that I'd say check it out. It definitely deserves the time to watch this. Now to grade. Acting: A Story: B+ Music: B+ Directing: A- Visual Effects: B Physicality: A+ Overall: B+"
"tomgillespie2002","8","1","3","9 January 2016"," Frequently breathtaking tale of survival
","Although it took home the Best Picture gong last year and I personally found it an immersing and wonderfully bizarre experience, Birdman Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) was far from the year's most satisfying movie. Still, director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu demonstrated enough desire to take the movie-going experience to the next level (with unfathomably long takes masterminded by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki) to have me excited about his next project, and the revelation that it was to be set in 1820's America around the legendary story of Hugh Glass had me foaming at the gills. While The Revenant is not the masterpiece I was hoping for, it is a gruelling, brutal and frequently breathtaking tale of survival.<br/><br/>Glass's story has been altered to fit a more conventional narrative, and the opening scenes introduce us, Terrence Malick-style, to his Pawnee wife (Grace Dove) and son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), in flashback. These floaty, dream-like moments quickly give way to the harshness of the Louisiana wilderness where Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his son are working as part of a fur-trapper party under the command of Captain Henry (Domhnall Glesson). While Glass hunts for pelts, the rest of the party are set upon by hostile Arikara Indians, who slaughter a third of the men before the ragged group, with Glass, escape down river. This opening scene, as teased in the trailer, is the film's Omaha Beach, and is captured by Lubezki's never-still camera, constantly swirling from one act of brutality to the next.<br/><br/>We jump on the back of the horse and off again, follow men as they kill and then be killed, under water and onto a boat, and then we are left to catch our breath. Combined with the eerie score, it makes for a delirious and awe-aspiring set-piece. As the group decide just how to get back to camp with their lives, they touch land again where Glass is set upon by a grizzly bear, in what is surely cinema's most convincing moment of man vs. nature. The attack has been compared to a rape, and as Glass screams for his life while being brutally and helplessly torn apart by the giant beast, it's hard to avoid the comparison. Found by his group, he is left in the care of the unhinged John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and youngster Jim Bridger (Will Pouler). Betrayed and left for dead, Glass must drag his broken body across 200 miles of wilderness for revenge.<br/><br/>The famously difficult shoot, in which the crew were given the task of shooting chronologically on location using natural lighting, all in the harshest of environments, certainly benefits the film. The exhaustion is etched on the character's faces, with DiCaprio in particular carrying the film on his shredded back as he sucks marrow from a long-dead animal carcass and snuggles up inside the body of a horse for warmth. The film doesn't so much celebrate the strength of human will when faced with impossible odds, but marvel at how much the human body can withstand in the most unwelcome of locations. Through Lubezki's lens, the wilderness has never been a more fearsome foe, but also rarely quite as beautiful. Both DiCaprio and Lubezki are surely odds on favourites come Oscar time - the former a talent deserving of Academy recognition and the latter looking for his third triumph in as many years.<br/><br/>However, the film is not without its flaws. The tweeks to Glass's real-life story (or what is known of it) mean that Inarritu has opted for a more conventional revenge flick that side-steps any deeper questions that may arise about America's dark history, and fails to add any real dimension to the other races caught up in the action. The Arikara's certainly have a reason for their relentless pursuit, but no explanation is given to why this group is so hostile. The same can be said for the team of French trappers, who appear briefly and serve as little more than a plot device. Near the end of its 150 minute running time, it ponders the purpose of revenge like a thousand movies before it but fails to say anything new. Yet, while it arguably fails thematically, The Revenant is at its best when its showing off, delivering a couple of key set-pieces that throw you head-first into the mayhem like nothing else I've seen, backed by impressive performances by DiCaprio and a mumbling Hardy."

","'THE REVENANT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>This year's Oscar hopeful, from last year's Academy Award winning director, Alejandro G. Iñárritu; is this action/western epic (inspired by the life of American frontiersman Hugh Glass). It's set in the 1820's, and tells the tale of Glass's obsession for revenge; against the man who killed his son. The movie was directed by Iñárritu, and co-written by Iñárritu and Mark L. Smith; based loosely on the 2002 novel, of the same name, by Michael Punke. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy; and it costars Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter and Forrest Goodluck. The film was originally budgeted at $60 million; but costs ballooned to $135 million, by the end of filming (due to excessive filming hardships). It's received mostly rave reviews from critics, and it's also expected to be nominated for several major Academy Awards; with DiCaprio a favorite to (finally) win Best Actor. Despite the painfully slow pacing (at times), I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The story is set in 1823, and it follows a hunting party; searching for pelts, in the Louisiana Purchase wilderness. The most experienced hunter, Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), is mauled by a mother grizzly bear; protecting her cubs. Glass's party tries to keep him alive, and take him with them; but he becomes too much of a burden, to their survival. Captain Andrew Henry (Gleeson) offers three men extra pay; to stay behind with Glass, until he passes (to give him a proper burial). Glass's son Hawk, a half-blooded Native American, volunteers; as do John Fitzgerald (Hardy) and Jim Bridger (Poulter). The opportunistic Fitzgerald attempts to kill Glass, by smothering him, and instead kills Hawk, to silence him; when the boy tries to rescue his father (unbeknownst to Bridger). Glass, who's then left for dead by the two others, miraculously survives his deadly wounds. He then makes it his mission, to get revenge on Fitzgerald; for the death of his son.<br/><br/>The movie looks breathtaking, and the story always seems very epic. The action scenes are spectacular, and also very realistic looking. DiCaprio is amazing in the film; and he definitely deserves an Oscar (like he has for years now). Tom Hardy (my favorite actor) is also very good, in his despicable antagonistic role. Iñárritu is a very gifted director; but (like any really talented artist) when he's given complete reign of a project (like this), he lets his ego get a little too inflated. He's said to be a very hard filmmaker to work with, but he definitely gets results (this film does seem self indulgent though). The pacing is way too slow; with 15 to 30 minutes more cut out of it, it could have been a true masterpiece. It's still a great film though, and it's definitely worth seeing; for it's stunning visuals, entertaining action sequences, and amazing performances.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/j9uf6E4pnlw"

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh glass who along with his son hawk are facing struggles with a fellow Indian group. After a hunting incident with a bear that mauls Hugh and leaves him In a state of near death, his fellow rival Fitzgerald feels that it would be best to put Hugh out of misery feeling that his state of near death would drag down the group, his plans are interfered when Hugh son hawk witnesses the event and attempts to stop it, but ends up getting killed. Being left for dead, Hugh vows revenge on Fitzgerald for the death of his son and will stop at nothing to pursue his enemy. I will say the music score and the performances of Leo and tom hardy make the film worth watching as the film feels like one of those old fashioned revenge stories."

He doesn't have a lot of lines in the film, but whenever he is on screen, he delivered. I was wondering, well a survival role, can he pull it off, and it turns out to my surprise, he succeeded. I recognized Leonardo as the character he was playing and not as himself in that role, and that's why I think that this time, he should get his long overdue Academy Award.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast were great too, Tom Hardy, Will Poulter, Domhnall Gleeson all of them delivered.

"eva-marieke","10","1","4","4 January 2017"," The Revenant Review
","Inspired by the story of American fur trapper and frontiersman Hugh Glass who survived a bear attack in the 1820s, Alejandro González Iñárritu created the exquisite and high-class masterpiece The Revenant (2015). The film's captivating screenplay by Mark L. Smith and Iñárritu, the breath- taking landscape shots by the extraordinary cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and the outstanding actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter are responsible for my favourite cinematic experience of all time. <br/><br/>A group of American trappers take part in an expedition along the Missouri river under Andrew Henry (Gleeson), when they are ambushed by Native American warriors. While the men try to get back cross-country, Hugh Glass (Oscar-winner DiCaprio) is mauled by a bear. John Fitzgerald (Hardy), although convinced Glass should be given the coup de grâce, and Jim Bridger (Poulter) agree to take him home for extra pay. However, the two leave Glass to die in the woods and return without him, telling everyone he was properly buried. Glass fights for survival and makes his way back to get revenge. <br/><br/>The film's staggering narrative and storytelling fascinated me when I first watched the film in the cinema. Because of my interest in film-making, I immediately noticed Emmanuel Lubezki's brilliant work of cinematography; his using of sweeping widescreen lenses for his breath-taking landscape shots and close-ups, the phenomenal tracking shots and the ingenious lengthy takes with almost no apparent edits made me more than a spectator – I felt as if I was out there in the cold with Glass, trying to survive in the wilderness. The Revenant not only let me immerse in the film – I was a part of it. During those two hours, I forgot the world around me and the fact that I was sitting in a cinema, all due to Iñárritu's absorbing storytelling. <br/><br/>Having adored Leonardo DiCaprio's acting in many films before, his performance in The Revenant topped everything I had ever seen because for this character he put emphasises on physicality rather than discourse. As Glass suffers – amongst other injuries – a wound to the throat which costs him his voice, DiCaprio acted merely through mimics, body language and occasional grunting, which left me speechless. <br/><br/>Iñárritu's thrilling story about revenge against nature and against people is brilliantly told through excellent camera work and acting like I have never seen before and deserves its three Academy Awards."
"sickofenjoyingmyself","9","1","4","5 November 2016"," Masterpiece
","It took me a while to watch The Revenant after it's release because somewhere deep down I just knew I had to pick the right moment to be ready for it. This is a masterpiece. No doubt about it. It's gripping, gritty, raw and remorselessly captivating. Leo Di Caprio and Tom Hardy are both excellent, and Di Caprio especially delivers one of film's most memorable performances. The location shots and visuals are absolutely stunning and the plot is excellent. It's too often the case that period dramas are simplified because of fear and lack of understanding. In this case the plot confronts the norm and delivers something so raw and hard hitting which gives it a timeless, heavyweight quality. Set some time aside to fully concentrate and appreciate a masterpiece."
"michaelRokeefe","9","1","4","21 June 2016"," A ""don't you dare miss"" Epic.
","Either too much or not enough can be said about THE REVENANT. Leonardo DiCaprio most definitely earned his Oscar; the movie was robbed of being Best Picture.<br/><br/>This snowy thriller is set in the early 1820's and follows the trials and tribulations of a fur trapper, Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), as he relentlessly seeks retribution against the fur trapping companions who left him for dead near the icy Missouri River after being mauled by a bear. Plus there will be hell to pay for one trapper, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who murdered Glass' Pawnee Indian son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck).<br/><br/>Exceptionally filmed, except sometimes the wilderness doesn't seem too remote. But still a beautiful movie to look at. Character development was well done and did not set a problem of who any villain might be. It was a little strange listening to 1800's trappers using modern slang. The sequence of the bear attack was hard to watch brutal. My other favorite scene is the climactic ruthless fight.<br/><br/>I believe this will be one of those movies one will want to watch again and again. It is already in my plans.<br/><br/>A very hard working cast that also features: Domhnall Gleeson, Fabrice Adde, Will Poulter, Duane Howard, Melaw Nakehk'o, Arthur Redcloud, Paul Anderson, Christopher Rosamond and Grace Dove."
"feakes","10","1","4","28 May 2016"," the Long Crawl of Hugh Glass.
","In 1823 a mountain man Named Hugh Glass was attacked by a bear. Glass was near death when the party he had been scouting for abandoned him. Glass did not die and spent six hard weeks crawling to fort Kiowa. Glass had been attacked in the middle of summer by the time he reached the fort it had turned to Fall. Glass survived and found the men that had left him and forgave them.<br/><br/>That is the real Story of Hugh Glass. That being said. Hollywood adapted the wonderfully written novel by Michael Punke and turned Hugh Glass into a 1800's version of Rambo. The Revenant Takes the Story of Hugh Glass and shakes it up a lot. By giving him a son and a Indian wife that is killed by a ruthless Army officer. And his son is murdered by a cowardly trapper. Glass did not have a family.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot. And the story is very engaging and pulls you in from the first shot. Leo finally got his Oscar for this movie and he deserved it as his was the best performance I've seen this year. It's a story basically of love loss revenge and redemption and it's beautifully told. The Story flows at a even pace and never falters. And for that it helps the film immensely. The question is Can this movie hold up under repeated viewings ? that is left to the person . Me personally I think it might hold up years from now But will it hold up to be called a classic ? the same way Casablanca and the Searchers are I think so. After all the film does show the harshness of life back then And the Mentality of the settlers and the Indians And it does so in such a stark brutal way that it's almost impossible to look away.<br/><br/>A movie that is Very beautifully made and well written that deserves to be seen at least once."
"gilfortuna-74120","9","1","4","9 March 2016"," Poetry in film form. Dark but beautiful.
","It's not about which story you tell. It's how you tell it that counts.<br/><br/>Now, while the accuracy of this statement might be debatable, it is certainly the truth in the case of The Revenant. Take the simplest story you can think of, and tell it in a way that is artistically striking. Not all films can pull it off, but this one does.<br/><br/>Sure, some viewers will leave the theater with a feeling that there was not enough substance here, that the movie drags itself too long, that there isn't enough character development, that some scenes are pointless as they don't advance the story, and may find the overall experience too shallow.<br/><br/>I advise you to look past those preconceptions. We're all too used to the typical Hollywood formula. But we should not be afraid to try a different approach to cinema. And honestly, this film isn't too alien in that regard. It walks a fine line between film for the masses and film for the artsy, hipster types, never drifting too far from one or another, and so it achieves a perfect balance. Your average movie-goer will be entertained throughout the experience. There is enough suspense, action, drama, tears and blood to satisfy the needs of such a consumer. But there's also more than that. There's some kind of poetry going on, that you may feel but may not be completely aware of. Is it due to the absolutely majestic environments? To the incredibly smart cinematography? To the gorgeous soundtrack? To the slow but steady pacing? It may be due to all those things, but there's also something more. And that extra mile may have something to do with the very believable acting. You don't feel like you're watching actors, you feel like those are real people, with real, dangerous, short lives. You can feel their emotions. Their fear, sadness, joy or anger is also your own. Even the cold from the snowy and icy landscapes seems real, and every time a character lights a fire, you can feel the warmth coming back to your bones.<br/><br/>There are, however, a couple of points where the immersion seems to fail. Sometimes, the amount of punishment that Glass (the main character, played by Leonardo DiCaprio) suffers is just too great for him to realistically survive. It's not that it theoretically couldn't happen, the thing is that, at certain points, you can feel it all comes down to convenient story-telling. But don't let it deter you from watching this movie. Any minor flaws are easily forgettable and forgivable.<br/><br/>Also, Leonardo DiCaprio nails it. As he always does."
"rblenheim","9","1","4","4 March 2016"," An existential tale of survival and revenge by the great Iñárritu
","Adapting the mostly true experiences of fur trapper Hugh Glass that took place in Montana and South Dakota in 1823, ""The Revenant"" is an amazing existential tale of survival and revenge that'll leave you feeling gutted and skinned, thanks to the remarkable vision and cinematic artistry of the great Alejandro G. Iñárritu, the director of last year's multi-Oscar-winning ""Birdman"", and who has just won his second Best Director Oscar for ""The Revenant"". He was also the Mexican genius who gave us three narrative-juggling films of great humanism: ""Amores Perros"", ""21 Grams"" and ""Babel"", the latter I consider his masterpiece.<br/><br/>Forget the stories of its difficult production (being filmed in authentic remote and bitter cold locations), and how star Leonardo DiCaprio actually suffered throughout by being immersed in freezing water, stuffed into a horse carcass or actually consuming a bison liver, what you'll bear witness to on the screen will pull you completely into its stark, ruthless, primal world and hold you there, thanks to DiCaprio's career-best performance as the film's protagonist which justifiably earned him his first Best Actor Oscar. The film is long (arguably too long) and unrelentingly slow, but few viewers will find themselves bored due to its calculated hypnotic pull, completely enwrapping viewers in its frozen world almost as much as Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" put us in the desert. Above all, it has two sequences that will stay with you forever: the grizzly bear attack which occurs, as do many sequences, in one seemingly single long take -- but I found even more effective the first Indian assault. That scene delivers such brutal realism I actually felt terrified as never before in a movie theater due to the scene's directorial staging of the trappers' panicking while the Indians' arrows frenetically strike the men's flesh with the force of stinging missiles. This scene makes every other Indian attack I've ever seen in a film postured and artificial.<br/><br/>Iñárritu is a Mexican genius, born in 1963, who managed to build up an extensive amount of cultural experiences through early travels, beginning at age 17 by crossing the Atlantic on a cargo ship then working his way across Europe and Africa. After his journeys, he returned to Mexico City, majored in communication, then began a career as a radio station host interviewing rock stars and hosting live concerts while single-handedly building WFM into the number one station in Mexico. All these experiences apparently became the source of his eclectic filmography, beginning with writing and directing a famous Mexican TV pilot, ""Behind the Money"", and making a few short films before beginning his feature career with ""Amores Perros"" in 2000. His best work conveys a cinematic exuberance close to a Mahler symphony in its scope, forming a synthesis of despair and joyfulness in rendering the human experience. ""The Revenant"" finds him at his most obsessive and committed during its long shoot in a way reminiscent of the epics of David Lean: an 80-day principal photographic schedule in the coldest weather at locations so remote it required more than nine months in unbearably torturous conditions, all due to Iñárritu's refusal to use computer-generated imagery (saving the few effects scenes that necessitated it). The director's monomania for realism became so intolerable that many crew members walked off the project (or were fired), and Tom Hardy wound up attacking the director, nearly strangling him. The efforts of Iñárritu (and his collaborators) can be seen in the final production.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Emmaunuel Lubezki (whose nickname is 'Chivo' which means 'goat' in Spanish) has an affinity with this director (he won an Oscar for Iñárritu's ""Birdman"" before winning one for ""The Revenant""). After tests on 35mm and 65mm film stock, Lubezki and director Iñárritu decided to shoot ""The Revenant"" on 6K high-resolution digital to be able to schedule one more hour of shooting time per day, almost exclusively in natural light for authenticity. And since lensing Alfonso Cuarón's ""Children of Men"", Chivo has been justifiably famous for long unbroken takes (in fact, most of ""Birdman"" is constructed as if its entire drama is uninterrupted by a cut), and he continues that tradition, if in a less obvious fashion, with ""The Revenant"" in its Indian assault and grizzly bear attack..<br/><br/>Though the film ultimately does not attain formal perfection, I left the theater carrying a new life experience unlike anything I'd seen before, achieved through Iñárritu's singular vision conveying a quintessential portrait of the American wilderness with great cinematic poetry. One of the year's most significant achievements in film."

","At over 2 and a half hours, Alejandro González Iñárritu's latest film is a true epic. A thrilling, survival western full of adventure, visually stunning camera-work, and some surprisingly strong brutality.<br/><br/>It has a very simple story, and handles it to near perfection, showing the most horrific side of both nature and humanity. While it may not suit everybody's tastes and may come as a disappointment to people who may be looking for better all around plot and haven't really done any research beyond the fact that it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and has been nominated for quite a few Oscars. If you're looking for the best film of all time, you may not really find it here, because there are some flaws.<br/><br/>From my point of view, while this was easily one of my favorite films to come out this year, the running time seemed like it could've been a bit shortened. I get that it is an epic film, but you could've cut around 10-20 minutes of the film and it would have a very similar impact on me. However, while it was a bit on the long side, I was never actually bored or anything throughout the film, I just needed to look down at my watch a couple of times.<br/><br/>The performances are spectacular. Leonardo DiCaprio deserves an Oscar at this point (he was horribly snubbed in 2013, when he didn't win the Oscar for his absolute greatest performance in the hilarious satire ""The Wolf of Wall Street""), and Tom Hardy does even better as the villainous murderer of DiCaprio's son who leaves him alone to die in the cold. Hardy manages to put in a lot of power and intensity into his performance, even more so than DiCaprio, and is one of the film's absolute highlights. He really transforms into this spectacular character!<br/><br/>The camera-work and filmmaking are breathtaking. They showcase the brutality in a way that made me feel as if I were really there, using some really long shots and fascinating camera angles, this is a true artistic masterpiece.<br/><br/>""The Revenant"" is a great film if you know what you're getting into."
"abouhelier-r","9","1","4","24 February 2016"," The Revenant
","A frontiersman on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team.<br/><br/>The Revenant is a brutal hymn to the beauty and terror of the natural world. The movie opens with a moment of serene beauty - almost Terrence-Malick-like. This film is filled with striking passages of pure cinema, it has some of the best cinematography my eyes have ever seen and I mean that. These scenes help the audience overcome the film considerable length and extreme carnage at time. There were moments in this very lengthy runtime where I gazed in awe watching some of the shots they were able to accomplish and I genuinely do not understand how they got them. <br/><br/>Revenge, as goes the old Klingon proverb, is a dish best served cold. This movie is as much a film about revenge as it is about men. An epic about the existential extremes, human beings will go to for revenge. Well, that and witnessing one of Hollywood's biggest stars endure a Passion of the Christ-like beating from man, beast and nature. The near constant threat of death from predators, starvation and exposure, combine into an impressive study of Human endurance and isolation that makes up the film's strong midsection. <br/><br/>Most importantly Leonardo DiCaprio's raw performance helps elevate what could have been just another man-versus-nature drama, even if he has very minimal dialogue and most of it is not even in English. This man has done everything at this point, but still manage to constantly surprised us. Though, no ones ever seen him suffer for his art quite so vividly on screen before. Now onto this Oscar nomination. He should have won a few time at this point and most of us are rooting for him with all our hearts; but right now it doesn't really matter anymore. A statuette doesn't actually matter. However, the performances he's been given us in his movies: THAT matters. Moreover, the supporting cast is uniformly terrific, from Domhnall Gleeson to Will Poulter and, of course, Tom Hardy.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is in fact also very good, even if his lines are the least intelligible element of the masterfully brilliant sound design. He tends to fall back into this habit he has to mumble - sometimes hitting Batman-Bane or Mad Max-Max level. <br/><br/>Generally immersive movies enclose, they put you inside, they dunk you down into what it is supposed to feel like. Here, the cinematography do the opposite: it exposes you to the elements. You are out in the cold, in the snow, under this grey sky. The imagery, with these primal landscapes and impressive natural lightning, is sublime. Some director may have been tempted to follow an Oscar win by a cushy comedy; But Alejandro Gonzàlez Inàrritu pushed himself and his crew to the limits against the elements. He defied conventional wisdom by shooting with natural light only, in chronological order and by doing so, has emerged with something we have never seen before. You almost feel uncomfortable watching this film for entertainment. The Revenant is filled with mesmerising violent piece of action choreography. The fights were dirty. Especially one jaw-droopingly limber steady-cam shot which pursues a character until he's killed, then switches to the killer until he's dispatched too and so on. It would look like showing off if it weren't so effective. <br/><br/>No spoilers, but this scene involving a bear is an amazing achievement. I don't know how they did it. I have no clue. When it was over, it took me a few minutes to lift my jaw off my lap. This scene is intense in the sense that it looks actually real. This film is so realistic that you would never ever want to hike in the woods if you see it, ever again. <br/><br/>Overall, The Revenant is a filmmaking triumph. You cannot afford to miss experiencing this on the big screen. It's a brutal, disturbing, violent movie in which it is one man against nature, and nature is not playing nice."
"apollon-6","4","1","4","7 February 2016"," Very shallow and meaningless story, but still not Iñárritu's worst
","Having seen previous A.G.Iñárritu's movies like Biutiful and Birdmen, I started this one with very low expectations and mainly because Di Caprio's genius would overcome Iñárritu's feebleness. I was surprised to see that this time there is a story and actors are not encouraged to overact. Frankly, the movie could be even called entertaining. And that's where good points finish. The bad sides are typical for this director. He sees things like red blood spilled over white snow as a highest form of art and tries to persuade the audience with unnecessary emphasis on guts and gore. Bud sadly, once again it's not convincing. The worst thing about this movie is that it's completely meaningless. Why a story like that should be told and seen - it remains a secret between Iñárritu and his devoted fans. One of the reasons is maybe to make people understand that if you are in the cold wilderness your best option is to take every chance to enter waters in order to recover and have you wounds healed. That's what Di Caprio's character did - he was almost gone but after swimming few times in the icy water and sleeping with his wet clothes on the snow instead of dying of hypothermia he got better and even quit creeping and felt good enough to walk. But it doesn't matter after all. Red blood over white snow is all that is meaningful."
"tom-cuypers95","8","1","4","3 February 2016"," ""The Revenant"" is a triumph in filmmaking, but not so much in storytelling.
","First and foremost I know that storytelling is an (if not the most) essential part of filmmaking, but when I use the term in my title here I refer to the superb cinematography, the top-notch acting performances and the all-round exquisite film language used by Iñárritu. <br/><br/>The only part that pushed my rating down to an eight (which is of course still a marvellous score) was the storytelling. This is a very straight-forward narrative with a very clear beginning, middle and end. That is not necessarily a bad thing but in this movie I sort of lost my interest a little bit in the middle of it, albeit very briefly. The comeback of Hugh Glass to the civilised world seemed stretched out a bit too thin for me. I get that meeting a friendly First Nation, who is later lynched, is an important narrative element in order to not portray these people as just the ""bad guys"" in the story. However, this sequence felt highly superfluous to me. The beginning and the ending were much stronger though quite predictable. But as is done too often, much of this is forgiven through the magic of the words ""based on a true story"". So the story, in all its simplicity, left me a bit disappointed. <br/><br/>Luckily Iñárritu hits a home run on every other aspect of his movie. The imposing landscapes and the overall look of the film, which somehow just exudes the cold, effortlessly draw you into the movie. The cinematography is truly breath-taking. As are Iñárritu's signature long tracking shots which add to the realism. This sense of gritty reality is best felt during the fight scenes. Especially during the final climactic duel between Glass and Fitzgerald, where it is nearly impossible not to flinch.<br/><br/>The same praise goes to the incredible acting performances. Though that is to be expected with a cast like this one. DiCaprio does an incredible job, which we are used from him, though sometimes he goes so far that his acting borders on a theatrical performance. Then again, that is not necessarily a bad thing, especially not in a story like that of ""The Revenant"". It is however Tom Hardy who, in my opinion, steals the show here. While he has played some great bad guys in the past, this role might be my favourite of his. He manages to keep your attention at all times as he delivers his hard and cold-blooded dialogue with impeccable timing. A truly riveting performance, so interesting to watch Hardy immediately sucks up all the attention when he's on screen. Looking to the other cast members I can say that Domhnall Gleeson continues to do a great job as we have seen so often the past year (seriously, it feels as if he has been in every good film these last years) and Will Poulter honestly surprised me, though I have not seen enough of him yet to justify my surprise. <br/><br/>To summarise, if you are only looking for a great story, you might be leaving the theatre a tad disappointed. However if you accept the simplicity of the narrative and just enjoy the fantastic movie- making that is masterfully displayed by Iñárritu and his crew, you might leave your seat with a feeling of exhilaration, just like I did."

"ofpsmith","9","1","4","31 January 2016"," This may well be Leonardo Dicaprio's first shot at an Oscar. But not for the faint hearted.
","This movie is brutal, violent, and unsettling. That's what makes it so great. That said it certainly isn't for everyone. Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an American frontiersman traveling with his convoy alongside his Native American son Hawk Glass (Forrest Goodluck). When Hugh is brutally mauled by a bear and barely able to stand, Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleason) assigns Hawk, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), and Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) to look after him. But after Fitzgerald tries to kill Hugh, Hawk is killed by Fitzgerald, and Hugh is partially buried alive. The rest of the movie is mostly Hugh trying to get back home. As I've previously stated it's very brutal and in some parts, hard to watch. It's certainly not a movie for the faint hearted, because trust me it gets intense. But if you can watch through that, you'll be able to enjoy this for the suspense thriller it is. It's still in theaters so if you can withstand the violence, go check it out."
"alcucchiara","10","1","4","26 January 2016"," DiCaprio's greatest performance rivaling The Great Gatsby.
","In 1971 I sat at the edge of my chair and watched in horror as actor Richard Harris struggled to climb a tree while a grizzly bear viciously tore at him and pulled him down. Such was the early scene in the western film, Man in the Wilderness... and I never forgot it because it was so very real. Now, we have a re-creation of that scene with no tree, but so disgustingly real that it is a masterpiece of creativity and ingenuity all by itself! I strongly recommend that you go see this movie, even if its only because the special effects in the first 15:minutes are crafted by computer geniuses. Now, if you are the type of person who cannot separate movie scenes from reality and are haunted at night by flashbacks of the violent scenes then by all means stay home! But then, let's get real...it is a fact that the European settlers have been attacked by bears and also by American Indians...and of course the settlers also attacked them. This is just history. The Revenant may be a very unusual story about survival in the midst of improbable odds but it certainly is not an impossibility. So, did it actually happen? I believe that portions are based on facts...perhaps not all of these unusual circumstances belong to the same individual, but likely were each experienced by one or more people during the 1700s. I am convinced that Dicaprio's performance deserves an Oscar, if for no other reason, because of the emotional challenges he was faced with in portraying the character that this film is based upon. I rated this film a ten, although it does slow down a bit upon approaching a predictable ending."
"bayleighwilliams","9","1","4","23 January 2016"," If you want to see a movie that will change your life, then watch The Revenant.
","""If Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't get an Oscar for this, I swear"" my cousin said next to me as the credits came up on the screen. I nodded in agreement, mouth slack in utter awe. My mind avalanched with every scene, every word, every sound. I saw this movie in IMAX at the AMC theater and I do not regret the extra money spent. <br/><br/>The Revenant is a movie based on true events in the 1820s about a group of fur traders journeying through the midwest. Among those traders is Hugh Glass played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Glass is the revenant, the one who comes back from the dead after being brutally attacked by a Grizzly and left to his own devices.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the movie soundtrack. From start to finish music supervisors, Ryuichi Sakomoto and Alva Noto curate this intense ethereal sound that tells the story by itself. ""The Revenant Main Theme"" song howls with wind and weeps with sweeping violin strokes. I wasn't just watching the movie, I was feeling it, too.<br/><br/>Kudos to Alejandro G. Inarritu for once again accomplishing a dramatic masterpiece the likes of Babel (2006), but even more fervent. Since the movie What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), with Leonardo DiCaprio, Innaritu said in an interview with Hollywood Reporter that ""there's something in Leo that I haven't seen in a long time."" He said to Leo, ""I would love to see you fragile, vulnerable--to see the man that can be broken."" <br/><br/>The star of the show never disappoints. DiCaprio spoke Pawnee effortlessly and a dead man's suffering even better. Supporting actor Tom Hardy played an equally exemplary role as Glass' foe, John Fitzgerald. He completely transforms for this character with a complimentary head scar and fowl mouth. While empathizing and marveling in Glass' trek, I was aghast and disgusted with Fitzgerald's. They were both extremely well-done and Oscar-deserving actors.<br/><br/>Yet another Oscar-worthy player in the game is undoubtedly the cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki known for Gravity (2013). The scenic stills of the bitter Canadian landscape juxtaposed with the harsh vulnerability of the character. Not only that, but the angles made me feel as if I were truly there, right next to DiCaprio. <br/><br/>This movie has changed my perspective on life's struggles. It gave me a deeper appreciation for what I had and an enlightening message about being human: being human is about wanting to survive. When you achieve that, nothing is more fulfilling. If you want to see a movie that will change your life, then watch The Revenant."

I know that sound pretentious but this is a really really deep movie and its hard to talk about it at all without sounding at least a little pretentious.

"g-white723","8","1","4","23 January 2016"," Visually Stunning Epic Western
","I think this movie can be classed in two categories - ""movies for the big screen"" and ""movies for men"". The last category is tongue-in-cheek because I know there is a 'movies for men' channel that usually shows really bad films. I watched this at the cinema with a group of friends. The women did not like it as much as men did - that is all I am saying, but all agreed that the cinematography was amazing.<br/><br/>It is a story of survival in the wilderness in 19th century America. I think fur trapping was a lucrative business at the time and these guys were out there doing their job when catastrophe falls on them. Leonardo DiCaprio (Glass) and Tom Hardy (Fitzgerald) are the two main actors in this film, and they do a good job. One of the main themes of the film is revenge and these two actors play well against each other. The other theme is survival and this picture is relentless in the displaying hardship endured in what appears to be a endless winter wonderland. The film is shot completely in winter which is great if you like epic landscapes and there is plenty to admire in the beautifully shot locations.<br/><br/>There is also a running theme through the film of Indian tribes and their relationship with the 'white people', who were pushing them off their land. Glass and Fitzgerald I felt represented different views of the settlers on the Indians. One was of including their culture, the other was excluding it. I thought it was quite interesting with the racism agenda at the current Oscars that this film, which could win the best film, does convey a subtle anti-racist message.<br/><br/>Two and half hours, but not boring at all. A must watch in a cinema though. The visual display is enough in itself to make it a good watch - 8/10."

Alejandro Inrarritu and Emmanuel Lubezki have really outdone themselves and clearly illustrate what cinema is all about. <br/><br/>The entire cast have brought their A-game and really have made it completely believable. Leonardo Di Caprio and Tom Hardy are not even noticeable in their roles which goes to show how dedicated and artistic they are in wanting to show their great acting craft which I believe is probably one of their best performances to date.<br/><br/>Amazing Cinematography which gives finally a break well needed from the rubbish that keeps pouring into the cinemas with the same camera shots and boring story structures, THIS FILM DOES JUSTICE for a change!<br/><br/>Outstanding performances and directing, without all that it would be a very simple boring film of revenge seen a million times.<br/><br/>I do believe however the film could have been much shortened down, simply because of irrelevant uses of showing landscapes and shots that don't set up or provide the visual literature needed to make the story flow but rather just feel like they've been dumped into the timeline to watch to kill some time. Although every shot is amazing in visuals, there's a lot that's unnecessary.<br/><br/>Guess the production wanted to show in the edit room what its like to be in those conditions and feel the characters emotions as the crew really went in those environments so I guess it was a way for them to watch it back and be proud- fair enough...<br/><br/>Bear attack is probably going to stay as an iconic scene in cinema history. No crappy cuts to the bear to make it feel scary, just a realistic attack that is horrifying but captivating and amazing.<br/><br/>I give this film a 9/10 because it gives you an cinema experience which as a film maker myself I believe in, its not a conventional film set to get only for the bank roll.<br/><br/>If you are up for an experience and something different- WATCH IT!"

","The Revenant satisfied all my senses on levels beyond my wildest imagination. Shot in natural light, director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (best known for his work on Gravity and Birdman) have outdone themselves with a scope and magnitude which I can't even begin to describe. The Revenant is raw, placing us in the life of Hugh Glass, a frontiersman in 1820's America, fighting for his life and seeking revenge after being left for dead. It's violent, tense and nerve- wracking, even when there's little going on. It never feels too long, even at 156 minutes. It starts with the most intense scenery to grace the big screen since Saving Private Ryan. Emmanuel Lubezki's camera ducks, dives and weaves around frontiersman and native Indians in one, brutal battle. He takes us from one death to another, over hills, under water, never favouring one side over the other, and yet we're still routing for our favourites, even though we've just met them. Leo's sublime, the hardships he ensure makes him an awards contender. He goes through unimaginable tasks most actors wouldn't. Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter are great alongside him, the latter quivering his way brilliantly through the film. I haven't come out of the cinema feeling in cold, in shock, and mostly, in awe. The Revenant is a must see on the big screen."

","One is difficult to answer how something so implausible, so absolutely fantastical can touch you more than your miserable, though definitely real, life. Yes, It is implausible, beginning with the unbelievably dedicated and self-sacrificing Captain and totally unassailable Glass. In this company Fitzgerald with his quite natural for human beings itch for gaining money and not being violently murdered by vicious Indians looks like the world evil and villain number one at the same time. Even given his sad story, told more than graphically to his young fellow.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but admire at those two grand actors picturing heroes rather atypical for modern cinema. One is trying to save his life not in a very picturesque way and losing all his appeal for female viewers. The other, having not more than a page of text, is stretching out all his actor abilities in order to grab the Award people desire for him more than he could possibly imagine. <br/><br/>If you ask me though, I would give the coveted Award to American landscape which is impossible to take eyes off. My language is too poor to describe horizon-less heaths, deep wild forests and steeply rocks above the fast and furious river. Or give it to the actor who played Grizzle, I almost died three times during this incredible (again) fight. Here is the case when it's better to see once than to read this for no matter how many times. <br/><br/>The last thing I want to add to my incomprehensible review is the sadness I always feel when it comes to American Indians pictured by Americans, doesn't matter if it's Pocahontas or The Last of The Mohicans.

"thatpunkadam","9","1","4","17 January 2016"," Crazed, animalistic, and committed
","Still, for as much as the environment is in the spotlight, DiCaprio and Hardy are undoubtedly the two consistent driving forces. Rendering John with an inherent craze, Hardy employs the same commutative eyes from The Dark Knight Rises and Mad Max: Fury Road, except behind a barbaric wad of facial hair, almost biker gang-esque—making his less morally inclined reflection of Hugh into a dangerously unpredictable survivalist. Not to be outdone, DiCaprio has reportedly called this role the most taxing of his career. Upon research it's easy to see why: not only did the vegetarian actor consume a hunk of raw bison's liver, but he also had to learn to properly shoot a musket, build a fire, speak both Pawnee and Arikara languages, and study ancient healing methods. But you don't need to hop on Google to fully appreciate DiCaprio's commitment, just witnessing the actor crawl through the snow and dirt, devour a raw fish—in a enormous fur coat, scraping bone marrow from an already-devoured corpse, the actor is evidently immersed in this animalistic transformation. And, interestingly enough, DiCaprio, speaking maybe 20 or so lines in the entire film, likely made the conscious decision to opt for a more physically demanding role when turning down the lead for Steve Jobs and Sorkin's witty dialogue. After all, since The Academy didn't award his vulgar wolf the year prior it only makes sense that now he actually has to become one.<br/><br/>FULL REVIEW HERE: indieadam.com/2016/01/17/the-revenant-2015-review-indieadam/"

","A good movie, but over hyped. If not for all the hype, I would say The Revenant is a solid movie. A break from Hollywood's political correct narrative where the storyline is black and white. With characters and groups are all evil or all good, The Revenant is a grey storyline clouded with the premise of what really happened! As it is in the wild, nomadically running around the social contract, and rule of law diminish into natural law. The law of nature where if one goes hungry if the hunt does not go well, you could be the one hunted. One could even understand the brute, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), was trying to survive as a cunning animal. The bear was trying to protect her cubs. The Revenant tries to show the brutality of nature. Would not be to quick in urban society if there were food shortages,people would revert back to 150 to 200 hundred years ago.

","After last year's astounding Birdman, which came to be one of my favourite movies of all time, I was looking forward to A. Iñárritu's new collaboration with the cinematographer E. Lubezki. And sadly, it fell a bit short of my exaggerated expectations.<br/><br/>From the standpoint of cinematography, Revenant is expectedly gorgeous. Beautiful environments (shot with natural lighting!), gritty realism of the depicted situations, scenes shot from unusual perspectives - everything is as close to perfection as possible.<br/><br/>However, as for the movie's plot and themes, everything turned out to be disappointingly straightforward. It's just a revenge tale. No subtle nuances, no amendments to the classic conception. Besides, I'd say it has some issues with the motivation of the Indian tribe that's hunting the protagonists for a good part of the movie. What is more, while the overall pacing is good for a 2,5+ hours-long movie, it does drop after the first hour noticeably only to pick up around half an hour later.<br/><br/>As for acting, everything is done professionally - both the lead and secondary role actors perform admirably, but as for DiCaprio, I honestly think he's had stronger and more interesting roles than having to growl, squirm, crawl and breath heavily for two and a half hours straight.<br/><br/>In the end, it's a wonderfully acted, breathtakingly filmed, meticulously polished classic tale about a man overcoming all obstacles imaginable to revenge the death of his loved ones, with no twists or additions plot-wise. Is it a good movie? Yes, definitely, very much so. But is it Oscar-worthy? We will find out this February, but I personally wouldn't say so."
"matthewssilverhammer","8","1","4","15 January 2016"," A Lesson in Fearless Filmmaking
","Unless you're a sadist, The Revenant won't make you ""feel good"". Its aims are more visceral than that. Yes, the already infamous bear attack sequence is unlike anything you've ever seen, but that's not all that will puncture your skin. The splash of water. The smoke of gunfire. The embers from the fire. The spit escaping from freeze-dried lips. The blood-stained rivers and snow. You feel every bit. Pulling from master filmmakers like Malick, Tarchovsky, and Kurosawa, Inarritu gives us a poetic western that, while not quite as impenetrable as its influences, still stuns with an intensity only matched by its graceful beauty. The unbelievable story of Hugh Glass, an 1800s frontiersman left for dead in a snow-covered wasteland, is a story of endurance. But unlike this year's Martian, which celebrated hard-science as a means of survival, Revenant is focuses on sheer force of will. The trials Glass suffers are abandoned with intensity, and DiCaprio gives an unrelentingly committed performance. However, the real star is director of photography Emmauel Lubezki (Birdman, Gravity), who delivers a shockingly graceful look at a merciless subject. Fluid, gritty, and focused, we're given a beautiful 360-degree view of the treacherous snow-scape. Director Innaritu doesn't give us quite the full scope of character that Lubezki does of visuals. The dialogue is passable at best, and clichéd and ham-fisted at worst. This made the 156 minutes drag some, especially in the middle. Luckily, the strength of the themes still comes through: despite whom or what we encounter, our only true enemy is death. Bleak? Surebut Revenant rises above its misery as a lesson in fearless filmmaking."

"darkknight3993-1","6","1","4","13 January 2016"," Pushing pain's limits
","The bleak image from the trailer of Leonardo DiCaprio's face as he writhes uncomfortably on a cot, unable to speak or move, really sums up this film. Alejandro Iñárritu successfully contrasts the beauty of the American Western frontier with the ugliness of humanity, but forgoes embedding a solid narrative while doing so. Each piece of imagery is as striking as the last, but the narrative that drives these images forward made me wonder how many times Glass (DiCaprio) was going to be tortured before he accomplished his task. The audience at the theater around me cringed a little bit more with each new gash, contortion, and bone fracture, and rightfully so. The images of nature serve as brief respites between the intense pain that Leo must have actually physically gone through to act out this role.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire film, it is evident that Iñárritu wanted to de-romanticize the American Western film genre. By setting the film in the dead of winter, viewers are given insight on how difficult battling both man and nature must have been at this point in time. Without giving away too many plot details, the movie is a classic revenge story, but does not stay focused on the revenge aspect for too long. In fact, at one point Iñárritu explicitly reminds his audience that the movie indeed is a revenge film, and not just a montage of DiCaprio getting the crap beaten out of him. Even with sparse dialogue, Iñárritu manages to convey the emotions of the characters brilliantly with the use of some clever camera work and the outstanding acting of the cast. Most of the credit has to be given to Leo here, he breathes life into Glass, with every pained facial expression, and eyes hungry for sweet vengeance.<br/><br/>Though The Revenant manages to break new ground in visual storytelling, offering some of the most breathtaking shots I've ever seen in cinema, and yet something is lacking. The muddled flashback sequences did elucidate enough of the back story of Glass' character, and yet, we never feel the true extent of his plight. If the script was structured in such a way as to make the viewer care more about Glass and his son, I would have been doubly engrossed in this film, but the scenery and cinematography speak for themselves. I can only hope that Iñárritu returns to this style of film, because with a few tweaks to the screenplay, this movie could have been a must watch."

","This is a beautifully set movie. The basic plot unfortunately was fairly formulaic.<br/><br/>As a Canadian in the throws of winter I don't particularly enjoy watching a movie set in the cold of winter as well. I have enough of that when I step outside! My biggest problem with this movie is simple reality. You do not go fording across a stream in winter on foot or on a house without consequences. Mountain streams can be freezing cold in spring(I have panned for gold in the mountains), so you can imagine how cold they are during the winter. To most this would seem a trivial thing, but I would hate for any kids to think this was OK. <br/><br/>I also really don't go in for this over the top superhuman effort stuff. This character never seems to get ten miles without taking some horrible physical damage. <br/><br/>Unlike most of this genre of film, this movie is totally without humour which makes the unrelenting suffering particularly hard to watch. It reminds me of ""up"" which I couldn't watch to the end.

","The Revenant is an ironic tragedy, set in the frontier in the 1800s and featuring a cast entirely of men. Yet it is not about them, their masculinity or an examination of male friendship. The film's Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu is employing much broader themes that transcend the specifics of gender and stereotypes. The film could be viewed simplistically as a bloody revenge story on horseback but it inherits complexity through its contrasting themes and images. Similar to Iñárritu's previous film Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), it is about different facets of the human condition but differentiates itself through the way these traits are tested through the myth of righteous violence. Whereas Birdman overflowed brilliantly with many different ideas, Iñárritu' has learnt to judiciously select his themes. The film uses its characters to develop a consistent pattern for its thematic and ideological goals, starting with its antagonist. Tom Hardy as the film's villain Fitzgerald embodies the notion of self-preservation, which provides his character with some accessibility to his psychology, surpassing his slurred accent and intimidating nature. He is a man with patches sitting between his long shaggy hair, which makes it visible that he was at some point nearly scalped, an incident fuelling his desire to protect himself before others and survive.<br/><br/>An observant way the film shows how much his wounds trouble him is when he tells someone to stop scraping their knife because the noise reminds him of his encounter with death. The incident from his past ignites his current attitude because although they belong to the same company of troops delivering pelts, Fitzgerald is reluctant to help his fellow traveler Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) after he is mauled by a bear. The other men in the group try caring for him in the snowy woodlands, but Fitzgerald insists on leaving him and also preparing to kill him. The scenes where the men, including Fitzgerald, are carrying his body on a stretcher through the icy terrain are an example of the film creating a broad morality question for its characters about self- preservation through its image and its setting rather than emphasising the physical toughness of its characters. The film is also less scattershot than Birdman in its ideologies and aims. Iñárritu, presumably spurred by the difficulty of the frost conditions, has realised the need for narrative discipline, using the images exclusively rather than dialogue to enhance its universal ideas such as self-preservation. Another example of the film divorcing itself from gender is through its protagonist Hugh Glass, who is not challenged solely by mindless violence and masculinity as some have argued. Rather, he is tested by the weight of his compassion, which drives him blindly towards righteous violence. Every scene in the film questions one's compassion and empathy on the path to revenge, long before Glass can right his young Indian son's death at Fitzgerald's hand, who also left him for dead. The most transparent example of compassion for his child is the physical turmoil Glass experiences to avenge him. Throughout the film, Leonardo DiCaprio shows extraordinary physicality to crawl through the ice and snow. The enormous physical strains, enduring the cuts on his back, having his throat slashed, curling up by handmade fires, dodging arrows and avoiding starvation, become a visual pattern and image system showing the physical endurance a person could pursue out of love for their children. The geography and compositions further compliment and enhance the emotional and physical struggle. The camera zooms tightly on Glass's face to show the strain and urgency of his body but retracts to both wide and extreme long shots to highlight the extremity of the wintery conditions and underline the physical duration he is imposing on himself out of love.<br/><br/>The Revenant also expresses compassion and empathy's problematic nature in a series of exciting episodes, such as the aforementioned scenes of the men torn on carrying Glass's body. Additionally, flashbacks and dreams visualise the murder of Glass's wife and her village being destroyed by officers, which are factors of guilt, love and madness driving him towards Fitzgerald. In another tense scene, he is attempting to steal a horse from a camp but his escape is interrupted by a woman being assaulted, prompting Glass to choose to aid her and blow his cover. Similarly, an Indian helps Glass recover from his wounds but the bond results in the man being hanged and branded a traitor. These are examples of the film questioning the value of their friendship and helping others and whether it outweighs our own wellbeing. Glass also finds compassion in the wildlife because after his horse is destroyed in a terrible fall, he removes its entrails and places himself inside its body to stay warm. It is metaphorical and a contrast to the film's bear attack scene, where the bear launches itself at him to protect its cubs. Being inside the horse is a mirror of when he was crushed underneath the bear, only now he understands the pain of an animal attempting to protect itself. These memorable episodes reflect the film's narrative economics, using the landscapes, the action scenes and character development to divorce itself from gender stereotypes and comment on the physical and mental toll of compassion as one pursues revenge and becomes increasingly dehumanised."

","After winning 3 major Oscars last year, it did not take writer and director Alejandro González Iñárritu long to come up with his next work that garners major awards attention. Recently, he won Best Drama Movie and Best Director at the Golden Globes for ""The Revenant"". Also it looks like this is finally the movie that gives Leonardo DiCaprio his first Academy Award. It is a pretty long film, runs for over 150 minutes and takes place in snowy America. The first parts of the film show us a group of fur traders. When the central character is attacked by a bear, they decide to leave him back and the film is basically split into two different parts: Glass' fight for survival and what the other gang members are doing at the same time. These include Tom Hardy's character, the main antagonist. I found him interesting to watch too. It becomes obvious how he is not only ruthless and greedy, but also how he is somewhat of an outsider in the group with the other people mostly admiring Glass for his perseverance. Also the scene when the young guy threatens him with his gun is pretty memorable. After Fitzgerald realizes the gun won't fire and it was never his intention to kill him, he lets him live too. A multi-layered character. Not just pure evil.<br/><br/>Lets take a look at DiCaprio now. It is basically a 100% physical performance, almost non-verbal. He speaks only very few words in this film, occasionally in Indian language. His scene with the bear mauling him is certainly among the most memorable of the cinema year 2015. Very tough to watch, yet it's equally difficult to look away. His scenes with his Indian pal or the Native American references in this film could have been better in my opinion and did not really make an emotional impact on me. Nonetheless, the people behind this film succeeded with the really difficult task of making a film this long that does not (or almost never) drag at all. It is also one of these films that you should really watch on the big screen if you have the opportunity. The cold, bare, mean snowy landscapes make this very atmospheric. Will Emmanuel Lubezki win a third Oscar in a row for his work here? It certainly seems a possibility right now. Even if I would not rank this movie among the very best of 2015 for me, it was still a thrilling watch for the most part and DiCaprio's performance alone makes it worth the watch. Also always nice to see Domhnall Gleeson play a good guy like he does in here. I like him as an actor. Back to Leo, the last shot on his face was truly memorable when we see him look right at the camera. Very very haunting. Go check it out."

","This movie was a let down. A horrible and incomplete music score. If there was a moment with music, nearly all of it was random orchestral chords where someone turned up the volume really fast, then turned it down just as quick. Way too many scenery shots - we got the point on the first 2 or 3 shots - that this 2h48m movie could have easily been chopped down to 2h. It was like like a tourist having never been to a place most people have - they take pictures of everything and have to show every picture to everyone. While Leo was good, for mostly non- dialogue role, the character isn't prominent enough to take any awards home (like he should have with his earlier movies)."

Just don't try to understand what he is saying for most of the movie unless you are from the back woods of Arkansas. They never say where they are at in the U.S. but they give plenty of hints if you pay attention. Another thing, take a jacket with you when you see this movie because it's going to make you feel cold even if it's 98F outside.

"mike3386","7","1","4","8 January 2016"," The Sound of Snow
","I expected more. <br/><br/>This movie tries, it really does, but in 2 hours and 36 minutes I began to long for the sound of the human voice, much like ""Cast Away"" (2000), not to mention that even mountain beauty begins to look like just so much more snow after awhile, especially when filmed in constant dreariness.<br/><br/>The actual, fact-based premise is virtually unbelievable; nevertheless, the director heaped on even more, e.g., from single-shot pistols firing more than once to 50 Indians unable to bring down one severely crippled man at 25 feet.<br/><br/>Little things begin to grate after a couple hours, e.g., long close-ups of Leo's snot-frozen beard, horses that were clearly malnourished, and grime and filth so constant that I wanted to take a shower. Character development is nonexistent, with only Captain Henry piquing our interest anyway. Jim Bridger, one of America's most famous mountain men, comes across mostly as a sniveling teenage murder accomplice.<br/><br/>In the final analysis perhaps I'm hardest on films I love the most, i.e., the Western genre, to which this qualifies, but instead of a lasting memorial chronicle of the West like ""Dances With Wolves"" (1990), we're left with yet another grimy, gory, outdoor thriller with a bear."
"StevePulaski","7","1","4","8 January 2016"," A meditative look into character expressions and beautifully detailed landscapes
","It's 1823 and a gang of hunters are searching for pelts in the wilderness of the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase. The land is made even more treacherous with the presence of the Native American Arikara Indians, who have staged an ambush for the hunters, leaving only ten of the men with no other option but to take a raft deeper into the wilderness.<br/><br/>Amidst the ambush, the team's most experienced hunter and guider Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) winds up being mauled by a mother grizzly bear in effort to protect her cubs. In the process, he is seriously injured, with his throat slit, his back mangled and bloodied, and his entire body left in a ravaged mess. The gang finds the mangled Glass and is uncertain what to do with him, despite the party's loudest voice, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), suggesting they simply put Glass out of his misery and move forward. Nonetheless, they do their best to care for him until two young boys, Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) and Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), Glass's son, offer to stay behind and care for Glass, with Fitzgerald keeping a watchful eye.<br/><br/>When Bridger is gone gathering water, Fitzgerald winds up killing Hawk when he begins to weep for his father, leaving a helpless Glass to witness his boy be murdered right before his eyes. When Bridger finally returns, Fitzgerald claims to be unsure of Hawk's whereabouts and demands that the two leave quickly, claiming he saw Indians down by the creek, leaving Glass for dead. As the weather worsens, with blizzards and avalanches abound, Glass does his best to maintain his health and his safety as he finds his way back to camp to exact revenge on Fitzgerald for his son's death.<br/><br/>It was only logical that, after giving us the terrific ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" a year ago, writer/director Alejandro G. Iñárritu would stun us all again with a film that is sure to grace the Academy Awards with plenty of nominations. Iñárritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki are the best director/cinematographer team of 2015, alongside Quentin Tarantino and Robert Richardson for ""The Hateful Eight,"" and Denis Villeneueve and Roger Deakins for ""Sicario."" With that, Iñárritu and Lubezki (also the cinematographer on ""Birdman"" and ""Gravity"") embellish uncommonly natural locational beauty to contrast with the downright evilness of the characters that inhabit the land.<br/><br/>Iñárritu and Lubezki, similar to the Ultra Panavision 70 route that Tarantino and Richardson opted for with ""The Hateful Eight,"" capture the lavish land of Alaska with plenty of evocative wide-angle shots that do wonders in showcasing the facial details of the characters in addition to the details of the background. ""The Revenant"" is as much about the frigid conditions of the brutal wilderness as it is about character redemption, and Iñárritu and Lubezki do a tremendous job of keeping both in mind as the film progresses. These kinds of films really bring forth a meditative light, and I'll say some moments in the film make you become lost in the scenery and the land itself.<br/><br/>The biggest battle with ""The Revenant"" isn't so much the unflinching sequence that shows Glass getting mauled by a grizzly bear, complete with blood-curdling screams, bone-crunching, and every other nasty auditory detail of a mauling, but its length and its simplicity. Coming off of ""Birdman,"" a film I still regard as pretty under-seen given its accolades and a truly fascinating tale of potential and struggling to live up to your own name, Iñárritu takes a complete one-eighty with this film, being that it's in a totally different setting and focuses on much clearer character motivations.<br/><br/>Because of that, after seeing him tackle such lofty ideas in ""Birdman,"" ""The Revenant"" can't help but feel slight in comparison, or even on its own. Once you get through the extremely brutal sequences in the beginning of the film, the remainder of the film's weight rests on the shoulders of DiCaprio, a proved performer who even seems to struggle with the emptiness of his character. While I don't believe this should be the film to finally earn DiCaprio the Oscar, his performance in the film is much more physical than it was ever meant to be anything else. On that note, he succeeds incredibly, never appearing unbelievable or corny, but yet, there's not much to view Glass as other than a revenge-seeking man.<br/><br/>And being that this film is one-hundred and fifty-six minutes, just eleven-minutes shy of the theatrical cut of ""The Hateful Eight,"" a film with far more dialog and character interest, ""The Revenant"" is sometimes a chore to sit through, despite all it does well for its simple story. Iñárritu and Lubezki's directorial and cinematographical work needs to be appreciated and praised, and DiCaprio's performance also needs to find its way to be commended for its physicality (also, don't sleep on Will Poulter, who shows some real emotional chops playing both conflicted and manipulated), yet that shouldn't excuse ""The Revenant"" for its slight nature overall."
"ligonlaw","6","1","4","8 January 2016"," Extremely Violent, Harsh World Without Much Dialogue
","""The Revenant"" should be rewarded for beautiful cinematography during the awards season. It is difficult to understate the gore and graphic violence on display. In the early going, the trapper played by Leonard DiCaprio is nearly eaten by a bear, and his throat is mauled. Thereafter, there is almost no dialogue from him. This film takes place in the western U.S. in the 1820s and purports to be a true tale about an adventurer named Hugh Glass.<br/><br/>The director does not shy away from any of the bloody cruelty suffered by the protagonist. The environment is hostile because both man and beast are ferocious. Men are vicious and untrustworthy. <br/><br/>Adding to the unintelligible dialogue are the native American dialects which were spoken (with subtitles.)<br/><br/>Even though we witness terrific violence and slaughter, the carnage is laid out as simply factual. We know little about the lead character except that he has a strong survival instinct. <br/><br/>It reminded me of work by Terrence Malick - the minimization of dialogue and the lack of human connectedness."
"ThomasDrufke","8","1","4","7 January 2016"," You Only Die Twice
","A year ago around this time I think everyone predicted that The Revenant would finally be the film to get Leonardo DiCaprio his Oscar. While I'm not sure his performance holds up against the other greats of 2015, particularly Fassbender as Steve Jobs, I will say that The Revenant is a cinematic achievement and one that should be recognized. It contains probably the most impressive cinematography of any film of this past year to go along with the jarring brutality this story brings to the table. While I don't think The Revenant is the best film of the year, it certainly deserves to be in the discussion.<br/><br/>The Revenant is a far more artsy film than I expected. It's directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, director of last years' best picture winner Birdman, and done so brilliantly. The direction along with Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is some of the best of the year. I think the problem with the film lies more with the script, also co-written by Iñárritu. The film is centered on DiCaprio's character seeking revenge against the man who left him for dead and killed his son after getting mauled by a bear, but the film lacks balance in its storytelling. I love the brutal, raw, grittiness of the story and you certainly feel the intensity in those scenes. But the minimal dialogue and in Tom Hardy's case, sometimes inaudible dialogue, you sometimes lose the emotional connection to the characters.<br/><br/>The gorgeous cinematography does tend to overtake the films other appealing aspects, such as the great performances from Hardy and DiCaprio. Knowing about the incredibly difficult shoot they went through behind the scenes attempting to make the film helps their Oscar case in my opinion now that I've seen it. But I somehow still expected more from both of them. <br/><br/>One of the best parts about The Revenant, that The Hateful Eight also did extremely well, was set the tone of the film through its atmosphere. In both films you feel what the characters feel. When DiCaprio was hungry or thirsty, I was too. It helps that the film was shot entirely in natural light and real locations, which is unusual for a main stream feature. There are plenty of memorable scenes in The Revenant including an incredible opening long-take fight sequence, the now famous bear mauling, and the films brutally bloody climax. The Revenant is far from a let down, but I also don't think it reaches the heights that we expected when we heard about the film over a year ago.<br/><br/>+DiCaprio's commitment<br/><br/>+Legendary cinematography<br/><br/>+Memorable scenes<br/><br/>+Sets the atmosphere perfectly<br/><br/>-Perhaps a little too artsy<br/><br/>-Lacks balance in its storytelling<br/><br/>8.2/10"
"aciessi","8","1","4","7 January 2016"," Chilling
","For those of you looking for an action movie, move along. It's another artsy movie from Alejandro Gonzalez-Innaritu. For anyone wondering, it's not as good as Birdman, but I think that was going to be a given. What is quite surprising, and most incredible about this movie, is Leonardo DiCaprio. He's given one earth-shattering performance after another, and just when you think you've seen it all, he appears in this. He just tortures himself. Crawling in the snow with his bare fingers, chowing down on bloody deer meat, sleeping inside a warm horse like a Tauntaun. He's simply fantastic. If he doesn't win the Oscar this year, he'll never win one.<br/><br/>The other standout is the cinematography. It's the best of it's kind I've seen since ""There Will Be Blood"". Every scene looked absolutely breathtaking. Without question, Chivo is the best cinematographer working in the business today. As long as he keeps shooting movies, everyone needs to step aside and let him show us all how it's done.<br/><br/>Among all this praise, I don't think it's a perfect movie. It's biggest flaw is the casting of Tom Hardy. We've all been hearing praise for his performance, and at times, he does do a good job. But he sounds exactly the same as he did in Lawless. It's the same voice. It's probably the same voice for Bane too, but we won't be able to ever know for sure behind the mask. That garbled, bullfrog.. yeah, try something else next time, Tom. Also, I kind of would have liked the movie to do without the stereotypical Native American side characters. I was having ""Dances with Wolves"" flashbacks. Plus, it didn't really advance the main story, other than the fact that those were people who the American's were fighting at that time. Then again, i've never read the actual story.. but even if I did, I think that Glass's journey was far more interesting cinematically."
"robinfeng91","9","1","4","7 January 2016"," Fascinating movie, another smash hit for Inarritu
","Wow, what a roll Alejandro González Iñárritu is on! After his Oscar-winning hit of Birdman, he now returns with a stellar picture with The Revenant. I also liked 21 Grams and Babel, and together with his two latest films he really shows what a breadth he has, I definitely rank him as one of the strongest film-makers we have.<br/><br/>The Revenant impresses for many reasons. Technically, it is a masterpiece. The audience will recognise the fluid, almost levitating cinematography from Birdman but instead of the more confined spaces of a Broadway Theatre, The Revenant brilliantly cuts between close-up shots of battles between soldiers and Native Americans and wide-panorama shots of great American landscapes, equally beautiful and brutal for ""The Revenant"" - Glass played by Leonardo Di Caprio. Di Caprio delivers one of the strongest performances of an already strong career, showing that his versatility as an actor is on par with the greatest as he delivers a gritty and strenuous physical performance. <br/><br/>SPOILERS WILL FOLLOW But my strongest take-away from this piece is not its technical virtuosity, but its humanistic theme. One of the main topics of The Revenant is survival and perseverance against all odds. In this sense it is not unsimilar to this year's The Martian, where a man is left for dead, survives and must go to extraordinary lengths to make his way back. The other theme, of course absent in The Martian, is about revenge and justice. What really resonated with me was the ending and in my interpretation, how it shows the difference between achieving justice and having revenge. I found the climactic scene very powerful, when Glass finally has the opportunity to have the revenge he literally has crawled from the grave to exert, but realises that his son won't be brought back by killing his killer and that only God can be Fitzgerald's final judge. As a viewer, we feel that Glass has made the morally right decision, and we are rewarded with what has to be poetic justice as we see that the Indian girl that Glass inadvertently but compassionately has rescued from captivity has been reunited with her tribe and we know that Fitzgerald drifts away to his final destiny in the river. Glass doesn't know that the tribe has been travelling as far as he has to find her, but as viewers we see that at least in fiction, true justice is possible, and this of course is the beauty of fiction. This theme of the value of revenge also echoes Inarritu's 21 Grams where a women also is obsessed with revenge.<br/><br/>On another level, I also view this movie as commentary about the historic period and issues it touches - the colonialization of North America and the Native Americans, a conflict that I still believe lingers in the American psyche. Glass symbolises a man who has lived in peace and in mutual acceptance with Natives, in contrast to Fitzgerald, once near-scalped, ever-greedy and with the attitude that ""they're all savages"". In this movie, Glass is the protagonist and Fitzgerald the antagonist, but in reality, which camp's perspective actually won?<br/><br/>In the end, I did rate this movie 8 out of 10. Why not 9 or 10? I did feel that the many parts that depicts Glass's struggle and way back were a bit unnecessary and repetitive. While Leo's performance certainly is admirable, it's maybe not as multifaceted as one could hope, it is basically only hardship, love for his son and revenge, not much more. My strongest concern is that I don't think its theme of survival against the odds, which takes up the biggest part of the movie, is as strong as its theme about revenge and justice. This meant that there were stretches of the movie where I felt more reaction than emotion, reaction to gore or Glass's bad luck, rather than true, deep emotion. All in all, I still think it is a very good movie and would recommend anyone to see it, given that they aren't sensitive to blood and violence."

"vickster-47248","10","1","5","29 April 2016"," Breath taking
","I can understand why this film is not for everyone, being 2.5 hours long and moving at a much slower pace than that suggested by the trailer.<br/><br/>However, I have to say that I really did enjoy it and have seen it 3 times now. I don't want to bore people but I have to say that the scenery is absolutely breath taking. The bear attack is very well shot, and it's almost unbelievable that it's CGI, apart from the fact that they wouldn't risk Leo being mauled by a grizzly bear in real life. <br/><br/>Leo's performance as Hugh glass is very good and would make Bear Grylls proud! However, I really have to say that Tom Hardys performance is excellent in this film. He is a very versatile actor and is calmly chilling as he justifies committing the most horrific acts without remorse. <br/><br/>The violence is this film is not gratuitous and is very well done. However, I couldn't help but grimace (in a good way if possible) during the end scene where Leo and Tom try to hack one another apart ! <br/><br/>I have never been an intellectual with films but I think that this film is also very good because like others before it, it shows how the actions and behaviour of so called civilised people is more brutal and depraved than that of the native Indians whom they refer to as savages.<br/><br/>Overall, I think that this is a breath taking film worth a watch. However, I think that if you are in the mood for a light hearted fast paced action flick (and there's nothing wrong with that) then please leave viewing this until another night."
"Mobithailand","7","1","5","29 March 2016"," Too many holes in the plot..
","Although heavily tipped to win, this film just missed out on winning the 'best film' Oscar but picked up a bunch of BAFTAS, including best film.<br/><br/>I am of two minds about it. It is entertaining, and my Thai wife also enjoyed it, due to the sparsity of dialogue. After all, not a whole heap happens and the plot is easy to follow. <br/><br/>The film is set in the 1820's in America's northern plains (The Dakotas) and it is a story of a fur trapping trip that goes horribly wrong.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio plays a frontiersman and fur trapper who is employed as an expert guide to a team of desperate, wild and violent fur trappers, led by a US army captain. The trapper gang lose many of their fellow trappers when they are attacked by Indians. Subsequent to this, DiCaprio is all but killed by a bear protecting her cubs. He is left for dead.<br/><br/>So far so good.<br/><br/>After this, I have serious a credibility problem with the story. Everything that happens up to the point when DiCaprio is mauled by a bear tells us that not one of this gang of semi-lawless ruffians, including the US Army Captain, would have had any compunction in leaving their guide to die alone, once it became clear that he was not going to survive.<br/><br/>They were in a desperate situation; they had already lost more than half their number to the Indians, the sub-zero weather was appalling, and they were in constant danger of further attacks.<br/><br/>Would anyone in their right mind leave two men behind – separated from the safety of the main party to await Di Caprio's death, just to give him a proper burial? What about all the other men who died? I didn't see any of them getting a decent burial. Sorry, but that part of the story is sheer tosh and predicates the nonsense that follows.<br/><br/>The baddie – Tom Hardy – volunteers to stay behind and watch over DiCaprio's demise, (for a bonus), but soon tires of this and buries him alive assuming he would soon die anyway. Even this lacks credulity – he didn't have any compunctions in killing DiCaprio's son and the second man who stayed with him. Why take a chance and leave Di Caprio in the hole to die? Why not finish him off?<br/><br/>Of course, DiCaprio didn't die, and after numerous brushes with near death, he finally staggers into the fort, where the baddie takes off in a rush.<br/><br/>By this time Di Caprio is near to death and painfully malnourished and weak from his horrendous adventures. Yet he is allowed to accompany the Captain to track down the baddie. Only two of them from the well- manned fort went after the baddie – the Captain and a barely alive DiCaprio<br/><br/>Sorry, again – total tosh!<br/><br/>DiCaprio, Hardy and the rest of the cast play their parts admirably. The cinematography is astonishing and the story holds your attention. It's a good yarn with some great photography, but it's a long way from being a great movie. For starters, there's too many holes in the plot – it's a bit like a boys' own comic story.<br/><br/>As for DiCaprio winning the best actor award – well apart from a few hoarse mutterings which are largely incomprehensible, he says very little. We can't see any 'acting expressions' because he is covered from head to foot with furs and shaggy beard throughout the entire movie. For sure, he does all that is asked of him, but is it really an Oscar-winning performance?<br/><br/>I reckon that a mute person, equally clad with fur and beard could have done the part just as well. The few lines he utters could have easily been dubbed in and nobody would have been any the wiser. If it was anyone but DiCaprio in this part, I doubt whether the various academies would be raving about it. Do you win an Oscar for bravery and sleeping inside a dead horse or do you get it for acting?<br/><br/>The Revenant is worth seeing, but if there's anyone in this movie who deserves an acting Oscar, it's the English baddie – Tom Hardy."

DiCaprio played Hugh Glass, a trapper who was left for dead from several men including Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald, who is revealed to be quite selfish most of the time. Hardy also gave a fine performance that also got him an Oscar nomination though he lost to Mark Ryland in The Bridge of Spies. Anyway, the nature shots taking place in winter look rough most of the time, appropriately so, so to speak. Oh, and that sequence involving that bear looked really brutal, that's for sure!

What sets this film apart is a visually overwhelming experience where you can almost feel the hardships DiCaprio as Glass is going through yourself. Impressive nature, great music, memorable scenes (and not only the bear), painstaking emotion. And no, it's not necessary to have emotion in a scene and explore it verbally for hours. That's not what they did in those days anyway. This is the kind of film that stays with you long after, for which you need to go to a cinema for the mind-blowing camera-work.

About what's really important when the chips are down and we are reduced to our bare essentials. About closeness of individuals, about honor, about justice, about revenge, about survival.

","It's only been a year since Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu delivered the award winning Birdman and somehow he managed to deliver another visual masterpiece in record time. To follow up such a groundbreaking film like Birdman, with an epic adventure film like The Revenant is mesmerizing. But Gonzalez doesn't deserve all the credit, his films have stood out because of Emmanuel Lubezki's groundbreaking cinematography. The best thing about The Revenant is without a doubt its visual style. And the same could be said about Lubezki's previous efforts: Gravity and Birdman. In three years Lubezki has delivered some of the most beautiful looking films of our decade (and I'm not even including The Tree of Life which he worked on in 2011). This man is pure genius and will without a doubt win his third Oscar in a row. I hope the two continue to work together and deliver more visually inspiring films. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio deserves all the accolades he's received for his physically demanding performance here. From the very first scene we see him face one obstacle after another as the opening sequence takes place while he is being attacked by a group of Indians during a fur trading expedition. It's not much later when the much commented bear mauling scene takes place, but that is only the beginning of his struggles. DiCaprio gives it his all and even though this isn't the best performance of his career, it will finally be the one that gives him the Oscar. Tom Hardy also delivers a fantastic supporting performance as John Fitzgerald, the man who wants to leave him behind. The film ends up feeling like one long chase in a similar way as Mad Max Fury Road, although at a much slower pace. A survival/revenge film like this has never looked so beautiful. The film is a bit too long and it eventually begins to wear down, but it's a constant feast to the eyes despite the exhaustion."

","(Spoilers) This was a great adventure, a story of survival. With a tremendous mood setting soundtrack and beautiful, very intelligent scenery. I was immersed for the first time in years. I found myself getting anxious and tense along with the characters, that does not happen often anymore. This truly is a gem. Story aside, it brought me way back to the first time I saw Dances With Wolves. A very long movie but, you just get pulled in. I only gave it a 9/10 because some supporting cast members annoyed me. Hugh's boy almost felt like they were too close in age, the boy just seemed older than he should have been. I like Will Poulter, however, I cant look at him without hearing him sing ""Waterfalls"", from We Are the Millers.<br/><br/>Leonardo may have won best actor, but without Tom Hardy, the movie doesn't have nearly the same effect. He was perfect, ""Tom Hardy disappeared into his character so well that for half the movie I thought he was Christian Bale. You really see and believe his inner struggle between doing what was right and what was easy or selfish. It was hard to hate him completely. A very interesting character.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson was another pleasant surprise. Not at all the Cardboard General he was in Star Wars.<br/><br/>Definitely a great movie to snuggle up for a long cozy night on the couch with a special someone."

","The Revenant tells the story of frontiersman, Hugh Glass(Leonardo DiCaprio). In the 1820s while on a fur trading expedition, Glass gets severely mauled by a bear. His companions on the trip decide that, even though he's alive, he's struggling to remain that way. Therefore, due to the difficulties of lugging Glass around in the bitter cold, they decide to leave him behind. Now, Hugh Glass begins to battle for his survival in the extreme climatic conditions, while also plotting his revenge against all of the people who leave him to die. <br/><br/>The Revenant is not only an outstanding film but also, a one of a kind experience on the big screen. Director Alejandro G. Inarritu strikes gold yet again, with this revenge drama. What is staggeringly brilliant is, how different this movie is, compared to Inarritu's previous movie, Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014). Inarritu & cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki have yet again adopted revolutionary shooting techniques for this film. Just like how Birdman was shot in one continuous take, this film uses only natural lighting throughout its run-time. The locations are breathtaking. The thing that has to be appreciated the most is that, not an ounce of all the various locales, were shot in front of a green screen. The CGI rendered animals are extremely realistic, with the highlight being the bear, of course. The music by Alva Noto & Ryuichi Sakamoto is haunting & divine, at the same time. Though this film is flawless, there is quite a lot of gore, which some people might find disturbing. The performances are one, among the various highlights of the film. Leonardo DiCaprio has given one of the best performances in Hollywood history, as Hugh Glass. DiCaprio portrays a variety of complex & subtle emotions, just through his eyes. This is because DiCaprio is on his own, for the most part of the film. Tom Hardy is spectacular as John Fitzgerald. Domhnall Gleeson is great as Captain Andrew Henry. Will Poulter is superb as Bridger. Forrest Goodluck is amazing in his Hollywood debut, as Hawk. The supporting cast is awesome too. The Revenant is a must watch. It deserves all the accolades & praise it has received & is yet to receive. Go, grab that Oscar, Leo!"
"ElMaruecan82","7","1","5","21 February 2016"," After a second thought, I'd rather rewatch ""The Martian""...
","In 1823, in the wild Northern Plains of America, trapper Hugh Glass, played by never-Oscar-winning Leonardo Di Caprio, is savagely attacked by a bear, in a scene that became an instant buzz-maker and as far his (mis)adventures would go, only the starter. Indeed, he later witnesses the killing of his half-Native son by the bad guy, Fitzgerald (played by Tom Hardy) and is left for dead in the freezing forest, with a body so severely mauled he can hardly breath, speak, or walk. Glass crawls his way out to the next river and then begins the harrowing journey of a man within an inch of life, but an eternity on the scale of his revenge. The only character I can recall who went through a worse situation in a film was a certain Jim Caviezl in a Mel Gibson's Biblical film. <br/><br/>As hackneyed as it sounds, ""The Revenant"" is one of these films the expression 'cinematic experience' was invented for. It is a survival-into-wilderness tale that elevates the word 'pain' to unexplored territories, not even ""Cast Away"", and certainly not ""The Martian"". I complained about co-nominee Damon not having enough scenes to show the 'physical' struggle of a man trapped in a hopeless situation but if I had to rewatch a film, I guess I'd still go with ""The Martian"". I know no performance came close to Leo's and his Oscar win is as a mathematical certainty as the Titanic sinking. But there's a limit to how long a performance mostly made of suffering, grunting and agonizing can please you, no matter how good it is. François Truffaut said ""a movie should either show the joy or the agony of making the film"", now, talk about overkill.<br/><br/>And Leo gets the lion share of recognition, and the awards... poor Caviezel didn't work with the right director. Speaking of whom, Inarritu and cinematographer Lubeski also deserve credit for overcoming the technical difficulties that undermined the shooting, from the weather to the lighting (even if it's not difficult to make beautiful cinematography out of beautiful landscapes). There's something in Inarritu's directing that literally made 'nature' alive and watching ""The Revenant"" was like penetrating the hostile wilderness, feeling like the pelt-trappers waiting for an arrow to erase one of us from life. Those were the unsettled days where men with greed by way of bravery, paved the way to the conquest of a yet unknown America. This 'unknown' feeling is conveyed in the opening sequence that reminds of the landing massacre in ""Saving Private Ryan"", where you know the quietness of nature is only the omen of an imminent violence. <br/><br/>And from the graphicness, you know it's not a 'savage' vs. 'civilized world' thing, it's just men protecting their possessions, expressing their natural instinct, like Glass protecting his son from the suspicious eyes of the other trappers or the mother bear attacking Glass to protect her cubs. What I own, I protect. I liked that aspect. And this is why ""The Revenant"" didn't need the surreal moments, where Glass is haunted by the visions of his deceased wife, like in ""Gladiator"" (a part I didn't like either). A film of such sober ambitions on the field of storytelling shouldn't indulge to usual supernatural 'interludes', especially when they're so expected in Native-themed movies.<br/><br/>Actually, I'm not even sure the film needed the revenge either, which was a first departure from the real story. Apparently, there was a need of a human antagonist, as the unscrupulous and manipulative Fitzgerald. So, for all its harrowing visuals, the film sticks with the classic ""good vs. evil"" thing. Still, Tom Hardy adds a lively touch to a rather introspective film. He's menacing, truly intimidating and sometimes, his eyes speak more than his actions, so despite the verbal richness of his role, he still says more with his eyes, and looks like a ferocious beast who'd never hesitate to attack when smelling the danger. The final confrontation, although conventional, is like the recreation of the bear scene, proving that once you hit a man's deepest instincts, the beasts inside awakens. What I own, I protect, and for what I protect, I kill. <br/><br/>And it's only when he remembers the words from a Native helper that Glass stops acting like an animal. And this is when you get the meaning of the title. ""The Revenant"" carries this come-back notion, but it also has to do with the French translation as 'revenant' is a 'soul' or a 'spirit'. Hugh Glass is much alive, as he carries the soul of a deceased family, and it's his connection to the world of the dead that keeps guiding him in his road for survival and his quest for justice. It's powerful, but did we need to have it said, on the nose? <br/><br/>Now, what lies behind this last shot? <br/><br/>Maybe the sadness of a man whose soul can rest now, but whose heart is still tormented. An end that is waiting for a new beginning? A sort of 'what now?' I'm still puzzled by that last shot, but I think there's an interesting correlation with Leo's role, so much has been said about it: he swam in cold waters, ate a raw buffalo liver, and went through the most painful extreme, he'll get his overdue Oscar, and he'll never have a more difficult role. So what can he do after? <br/><br/>Well, I just want to conclude in a lighter tone and say 'give him the Oscar and give him a break, and a few fun roles in movies that express –this time- the joy of making a film.'"

"caseynicholson","10","1","5","8 February 2016"," One of the Best Films in Recent Memory
","I think of myself as an amateur film critic, and because of that I often find myself being let down by movies that are popular with mass audiences. I tend to be critical of things that others never notice, it's not at all unusual for me to go see the latest blockbuster that everyone is talking about and leave feeling quite let down. As such, I went into ""The Revenant"" with a bit of skepticism--it's getting rave reviews, but would it really be as good as everyone is saying? I assumed that the answer was probably no.<br/><br/>That said, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this movie is one of the best films in recent memory. Indeed, ""instant classic"" is not too strong a term here. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a pioneer in the American west whose party is attacked by Indians. The attack leaves the group's numbers decimated, and DiCaprio spends most of the movie injured beyond hope of recovery, only to regain his health and have to overcome the wild frontier to meet back up with his lost group of explorers.<br/><br/>One of the things that makes this movie great is that it is in every way a bona fide ""Western"", but without the hackneyed conventions of most films in that genre. You won't find any cowboy hats in this movie, or a soundtrack from a spaghetti flick. The film is based on real events that occurred in 1823, and as such the attire and wardrobe of the cast is firmly ""pioneer"". And yet, the movie is nothing if not accurately called a cowboys and Indians film--indeed, probably the most realistic such film to have ever been made, at least so far as showing tensions between natives and Europeans. And the film's climax is as intriguing and suspenseful as any Western out there--no marching ten paces to turn and shoot type of thing, mind you, but an epic showdown between the film's main characters.<br/><br/>If I had to offer up any criticism for this movie it would be the simple fact that I find it impossible to see Leonardo DiCaprio as whatever role he's playing these days. Sure, he's a good actor, and he certainly put himself through a lot to make this movie. But I still felt like I was watching Leonardo DiCaprio, not the character he was assigned to play. That doesn't make his performance bad--it just means that the film might have benefited from going with a different actor who wasn't quite so overused at this point. The movie is strong enough to stand on its own merits without DiCaprio's presence--but this one qualm aside, Dicaprio's being overused still doesn't detract from the movie.<br/><br/>I'd also note that the movie does start a little bit....not slow, really, but just in a way that I found hard to get into at first. Fortunately the story grew on me as it went along. I wasn't sure how I felt about the direction of the film thirty minutes into things, but by the second hour I was quite hooked.<br/><br/>All in all, I have to give this one a perfect ten stars. I saved this one for the last of this year's eight Best Picture nominees, having watched all seven in a row in hopes that the crowd might be right for once and that ""The Revenant"" would indeed be the Best Picture of 2015. I enjoyed all the other movies this year, especially ""The Martian"", which was my favorite going into this film. But I must say that ""The Revenant"" proved to be in a class by itself. This one stands apart as the kind of movie that isn't just enjoyable, but an iconic epic that will be remembered for years to come. Bravo. 10/10."
"YellowManReanimated","10","1","5","27 January 2016"," One of the greatest films of all time
","And I do not say that lightly.<br/><br/>This film was a triumph of the art and craft that is filmmaking. Its epic landscapes, wondrously and heartbreakingly captured by Lubezki, are the first thing that makes this film stand out. The environment in which Glass' story takes place is brought to life in a way which few films are able to achieve. You feel Glass' sense of familiarity and awe with what he is surrounded by. An untamed land filled with fauna and flora of various description. That the film is able to bristle with life and natural resonance in such a way is the main aspect which sets this experience apart and places it among the pantheon of superlative cinema.<br/><br/>The story, deceptively simple, is actually a story which reaches back to the epic storytelling traditions of timeless Homerian and Shakespearian classics. Glass is on his own personal odyssey of revenge. Like King Lear, he is cast amongst the wilderness, it is up to him to survive. He is also challenged to keep hold of his humanity amidst the loss he has suffered at the hands of cruel, barbaric self-interest. Hardy is the Iago of the piece, a man consumed with malignant malevolence, seemingly compelled to cause misery and suffering to those around him, no doubt a mirroring of his own tortured soul. The film has brief, precious moments of gallantry, generosity and understanding, but they occur among a sea of brutality, both human and otherwise. The film's protagonist, like Josey Wales and Ethan Edwards, is cast into a twilight existence, a purgatory of sorts between life and death. He must find an inspiration which reaches deeper than his hate in order to find salvation. <br/><br/>In this way Glass' journey mirrors our own. In order to find value in our lives we must be driven by what we wish to become, not what we wish to destroy. This story gives us this journey and this challenge and it does so in the richest, most effective manner I have experienced in a long time. It strips away our apparent civilisation and takes us back fundamentally to our most primal routes.<br/><br/>Iñárritu serves up a treat here; a spectacle with heart and life. His direction is focused and fearless. He shows us the essence of who we are without the need for distortion or equivocation. His story is so firmly allied to what it is to be human that in its purity it ascends to the highest peaks of cinematic achievement."

"thepauloloughlin","10","1","5","25 January 2016"," A True Masterpiece. The Revenant (2015) Movie Review
","From Academy Award Winning director, Alejandro G. Inarritu and 6 Time Oscar Nominee , Leonardo DiCaprio comes ""The Revenant"", inspired by true events and based in part on the novel of the same name by Michael Punke.<br/><br/>The film starts off with a group of men in the 1820s, searching for pelts (animal skins) in the 1820s. However, a member of the group, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), is brutally attacked by a grizzly bear, doing great damage to his legs and torso. Following this, the rest of the group struggle to carry him on a stretcher, especially when approaching high, rocky ground. The leader of the group, Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) gives orders to three members of the group, Bridger (Will Poulter), John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) & Glass' son to stay behind and watch over Glass. Fitzgerald soon gets tired of this, kills the son and buries Glass alive, leaving him for dead. Days later, Glass awakens and must get back to their camp, enduring the inability to walk, freezing cold temperatures, and of course the long journey home. But he is driven by revenge for what Fitzgerald did to him. <br/><br/>This is probably one of the most intense movies I have ever seen. Watching the screen with my undivided attention, I could hardly believe some of the things happening on screen. The opening battle scene was in my opinion epic, you could really believe that all those men really were being killed in the most brutal ways possible. The bear scene will be something not forgotten for many years to come, with flawless visual effects, making the entire scene very realistic, with small but effective touches put in here and there to make it that bit more credible. For example, when the bear breathes out while close to the camera, you can see the camera being fogged up momentarily: small but effective.<br/><br/>If Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't win an Oscar this year, then he never will. This is one of the greatest performances by an actor I have seen in quite some time. He really sells the fact that his character is constantly in pain, and for also climbing inside the carcass of a real horse, just for a movie. If that's not dedication, then I don't know what is.<br/><br/>It's not just DiCaprio that deserves praise, though. Tom Hardy puts in another intimidating, evocative and breathtaking performance as John Fitzgerald. I really felt a strong sense of hatred towards this selfish character near the end of the film and greatly anticipated the excellent climax to the film.<br/><br/>Finally, I must give credit to the director, Alejandro G. Inarritu. After winning 3 Oscars, most directors would sit back and take it easy for a few years, but Inarritu has brought us a film with breathtaking visuals and a great story that will be adored by film- viewers for generations to come.<br/><br/>The Revenant is nothing less than a true masterpiece. This is definitely the best film I've seen in 2015 and I'd strongly advise anyone to go out and see this movie while it's still in cinemas.<br/><br/>Rating: 5/5"
"mohancraig","10","1","5","25 January 2016"," This is what movies should be!
","Our group was split about which movie to see so half of us saw the Revenant and the other half saw the Hateful 8 (which I'd already seen twice)... man was I glad I saw the Revenant instead. The cinematography is just stunning, the CGI is most realistic (although you know it must be CGI because they can't train animals to do that stuff) and the story-line is compelling beyond belief.<br/><br/>Because of all the running water in the movie I wanted to go pee after the first hour but each time a few minutes would pass another amazing event would happen which kept me glued to my seat as I didn't want to miss a single thing; see this movie if you love great film-making."
"allieb0828","10","1","5","24 January 2016"," This movie was brilliant & beautiful
","I was very worried about how this movie was going too turn out to be honest! I never even wanted to see this movie at first but my friends had dragged me to the movie theater. The movie started off very action packed and had a lot of sad moments in the beginning and Leonardo had portrayed his character so well. Tom Hardy is known as the ""villain"" in the movie, and i never even noticed him at first because all of the dirt covering his face, his long beard, and messed up teeth. I really hope they both get Oscars for their performances because it was truly one of those movies that you have to go see in the movie theater. The picture and scenery was truly beautiful and Leonardo was on his own through out most of the movie and the stuff that he had to do too survive was truly mesmerizing and disturbing at the same time. I applaud everyone in this movie because it was truly a great movie!"
"alexcook95","10","1","5","24 January 2016"," A beautiful piece of cinematography
","I was already a huge fan of both DiCaprio and Hardy's work and The Revenant is just another stellar film to be added to their collection. Right from the get go you are immersed into their world and it totally consumes you. Not only with their incredible performances but also with the entire supporting cast. More importantly, the landscapes are just mesmerizing. Every single scene is artistic and beautifully captured, just adding to the wonderful story that is being told. Considering the length of the film, Inarritu has done a brilliant job of ensuring that you are never bored and constantly entertained. The action is gritty and tense and keeps you on the edge of your seat. There is a dark realism to this film as well, ranging from the harsh environment they are living in, to the mercurial characters that inhabit it. This is easily going to be one of the biggest hits of the year and it's only just started. I highly recommend people go and see this."

"MOscarbradley","10","1","5","24 January 2016"," Bold and innovative.
","Sometimes I wonder if it's just me; at other times I'm convinced that critical snobbery really is alive and well. For many critics a director can do anything but be successful. The latest case in point is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu who may be raking in the Oscars but is now fashionable to slag off and for that very reason. Nothing like back to back gold statuettes to attract those critical brickbats, Last year Inarritu won both the Best Director and Best Picture Oscars for ""Birdman"", not to mention the screenplay prize. In a year that also saw ""Boyhood"" I felt this was a bit excessive but while ""Birdman"" may not have been the year's Best PIcture it was infinitely better than many critics suggested; bold, innovative and one of the great movies about the theatre. Now we have ""The Revenant"", a two-and-a-half hour wilderness epic about survival that has just received 12 Oscar nominations and would appear very much the one to beat when it comes to handing out the awards. It's also become very fashionable, in some critical quarters, to pan it and to pan Inarritu, not just for having the audacity in making it in the first place, but suddenly for his entire body of work, as if success at the Oscars was beneath a real artist.<br/><br/>Okay, I don't think it's a masterpiece but it's also bold, innovative and the work of a visionary director who isn't afraid to take chances even if they don't always pay off. Basically it's the story of one man, Hugh Glass, (a terrific Leonardo Di Caprio), left for dead by his fellow trappers in the wilderness, (the title comes from the French for ghost or perhaps more appropriately someone returning from the dead), as he makes his way back to what passes for civilization to extract his revenge.<br/><br/>It's a long and grueling picture, never more so than for Di Caprio who is really put through the mill here and while there are several scenes of action and excitement there are equally long stretches when absolutely nothing happens. Perhaps, with a bit of judicious pruning, Inarritu could have made a tighter film, (there is only so much of Di Caprio wandering through the snowy wastes we can take), but I am also out on whether shrinking the film would have improved it. What we have is very much Inarritu's vision, warts and all, and in an age when commercial film-makers tend to play safe, it's great to see someone break the rules.<br/><br/>Visually it's extraordinary, (once again the stunning cinematography is in the safe hands of Emmanuel Lubezki), and as well as Di Caprio there is equally fine work from Domhnall Gleeson as the captain who tries to save him and Tom Hardy, (stealing every scene he's in), as the villainous Fitzgerald. Last year I felt ""Birdman's"" Oscar glory was undeserved; this year I will have no such reservations when ""The Revenant"" sweeps the board."
"svorva","8","1","5","22 January 2016"," Best of 2015
","Declaring a movie the best of the year is not going to make you many friends. This act is a little pretentious, only serving to isolate most listeners. But 2015 was a disappointing year. The marquee names (Spielberg, Tarantino, Russell?) failed to deliver movies with any chances of reaching the top half of each director's filmography. The awards bait was lukewarm, our dear indie and international friends largely failed to make any ripples in the pond. I concede we got the best summer movie of recent memory, but I just need something more to care about. The Revenant is the best movie of the year because it is ambitious and beautiful. A dangerous film, with many potential vulnerabilities that were solved by its reliance on exemplary talent. I am simply giddy that 2015 delivered a film this great.<br/><br/>The Revenant is a western/thriller meditation on vengeance and survival. Frontiersman Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) is betrayed and abandoned by comrade (Hardy) who murdered his son (Forrest Goodluck, not that you likely care, but what a name). The next two thirds is Glass' relentless pursuit. Sure, obviously other events happen along the journey, but largely it is a straight foreword plot with simple motivations. Some complexity is introduced by side Native American characters who are also dealing with tragedy. But at its core, Revenant is sparse. This emptiness allows for creative space to be filled with stylistic bravado. The Revenant is continually interrupted by unrushed shots of natural magnificence. This style can best be described as more watchable Malick. I am sure most popular criticism will be aimed at this decision. Sure it's a reasonably long run time, but I was certainly not bored. Thrillers are all about manipulating the temporal. Each break is a conflicted dose of both relaxation and stress. Relaxation derived from simple gorgeousness, stress because it is a distraction from imminent peril.<br/><br/>Style over substance films are extremely risky. Potentially irritably ostentatious, these movie can needle or put an audience to sleep with ease. Enter our artists/champions. No one can perfectly answer what a director brings to a movie, but Inarritu has established himself as a titan. The Revenant is a grand vision that requires virtually every aspect to be synchronized. I credit Inarritu. Slightly more tangible are Lubezki's contributions. The cinematographer made brutal action scenes and calm portrayals of trees equally stunning to behold. DiCaprio's role in this is almost impossible. He was asked to carry an entire movie largely without talking. Not to mention wrestle a CGI bear. He was up to the task, there is not an off note in his performance. Hardy is even more likable. His role is less demanding, but he is equally brilliant. Hardy plays pure evil unabashed with an impeccable drawl. If we just skipped the Oscars this year and threw them all at The Revenant's creators, I would not be overly disappointed.<br/><br/>Praise be to The Revenant. I refuse to even acknowledge the many I know who will simply find this movie frustrating. I am excited, and hopefully contagious. Movies of this caliber simply need to be celebrated."
"sbhkchillax","10","1","5","21 January 2016"," a marvel of film making and packed with great performances
","The Revenant is one of those movies that get made once in many years.The movie provides a breath taking experience both in terms of cinematic representation of nature's beauty and it's ugliness.The movie revolves around the life of fur trapper Hugh Glass and his ordeal to take revenge. The details provided by director Alejandro Iñárritu is simply genius, at some point viewers are compelled to step back and think how is this possible to shoot. Cinematography is perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio has given the best performance of his life, he was able to successfully portray the pain and suffering of Hugh Glass. In simple words if The Revenant doesn't fetch Leo his Oscar then nothing can. Tom Hardy also gave an amazing performance he is in race for an Oscar as well. A word of caution though this movie is not for the faint-hearted. It is brutal and gut-wrenching so buck up and have a good LONG time watching The Revenant. <br/><br/>* watch out for the bear scene*"
"pastrunho","10","1","5","18 January 2016"," Insane!
","Oh. My. God. The Revenant was absolutely amazing! Di Caprio in one of his best performances, especially considering the incredible physical and mental (he actually did eat a real buffalo liver) exertion he had to put in this act. Tom Hardy, if possible, even better than Leo himself. Rising like a phoenix this actor is growing brilliantly, better and better every film. He deserves the Oscar not only for his incredible talent shown in this film but for the amazing development he's had in the last years. Iñárritu seriously overtook himself. The directing of this film is unbelievable. Starting with the scene of the battle at the beginning, one long incredible take of pure magic to the very end of it. His writing is great as well. Even if based in part on a novel, his touch is strongly present in the screenplay. The cinematography was the best part of all. Lubezki did an incredible work. The photography was seriously insane. And if you consider that all the film is entirely shot using natural light only (boom — mind blown!). I won't be surprised if he wins the 3rd Oscar in a row. This film deserves, at least, 4 of the most important Oscars."

"crimsonjis","10","1","5","16 January 2016"," One of the best films of all time
","First, before I begin this review I would like to say that I will talk in depth about many aspects of the movie and plot, and how they are good, but I will not tell you what happens in the plot of the movie EXCEPT who the main antagonist is. So if you are not up for that then I suggest clicking off, but I have still out a spoiler warning just to be on the safe side. <br/><br/>Now this movie has to be one of the best movies I have seen up to date so far. The reason why is because I believe that they did everything near perfect. First, let us talk about performances because they are one of the things that make this movie great. The performances in this movie were phenomenal, but in particular, Leonardo's performance had to be one of the best that I have seen up to date. Why is this performance so good? The reason why is because throughout watching this film I found that playing this role looked like it must have been one of the hardest roles to play in movie history, and Leonardo did it perfectly. Not only did he perform the scenes well, but he also did an amazing job portraying all the characters mental and physical struggles that he will have to endure as he goes through his journey, which made Leonardo's performance even more beautiful to watch. I would also like to mention Tom Hardy's performance as well. I found that he gave a good performance. He did a good job not only as a supporting character, but also as an antagonist, which was important for the movie as a hole. <br/><br/>Next, I would like to talk about scenery and the action sequences. First off, the scenery in this film looked so incredibly beautiful. What made it beautiful was not only the amazing shots of the sky, mountains, and snow, but also the fact that there was almost no CGI whatsoever. These both made the scenery look a lot more crisp and amazing. Now the action sequences, I honestly think that the action sequences were well done. They were quick paced, and combined with the score (which I will talk about later) were also thrilling and made the scenes come to life across the screen. <br/><br/>Last but not least the Cinematography and score. The cinematography in this movie was just extremely good. They did an excellent job on it and it really helped escalate the intensity of the movie, which prevented it from being boring and dry. The score also goes hand and hand with the cinematography and overall the movie itself. It perfectly fit in all the right places and made scenes even more thrilling and dramatic as well. <br/><br/>Now before I end this review I did not talk about the plot much not only to prevent spoilers but also because it is based on a true story so I decided to not focus on that. I would also like to say that Alejandro González Iñárritu is an amazing director that deserves his accomplishments and success. <br/><br/>Overall, I would give this a 9.5 because no movie is perfect and I might have missed something on the way. Thank you for reading and I hope you have a wonderful day."
"seansisson","10","1","5","15 January 2016"," If you're a film fan...watch it.
","I had high hopes for The Revenant. The director made my favorite film last year (Birdman), a movie unlike any I'd seen prior. Yes, I've seen other films about the frontier, but I've never seen anything like The Revenant. It was incredibly beautiful, intense, visceral, chilling, and ultra real... I'm officially an Inarritu fanboy...And I'm seriously pulling for Dicaprio at the Academy Awards. Somebody give that man an Oscar before he kills himself trying to get one! What a committed performance! This movie is so beautiful, it makes my head hurt. Emmanuel Lubezki...pick up your Oscar at the front desk...I think Alejandro will take the best director Oscar again..."
"Richie-67-485852","7","1","5","12 January 2016"," The Revenant is relevant
","This is worth watching just to get a taste of what early settlers faced and how hard it was to earn a living sometimes at the cost of your own life too. No excuses are allowed for anyone that chooses to live off the land and take their chances. This is understood by those who do it. We get to see how being injured in the wild is not good. The weather never lets up and if you cannot hunt, you slowly starve to death. Its harsh to say the least. The rewards are there too. Collecting monies for doing this allows one to move up in the world to something better although risky and no guarantees because getting in and doing the work is one thing, getting out to collect is another. The local Indians just go nuts when they see a white man. Then, the competition is fierce as well. The laws that exist in civilization don't apply out there but men still use it as a guide on how far they are willing to go with each other. I thought that came in loud and clear. The star of the movie put in some good work but I don't see it as outstanding or Oscar worthy but what do I know? Politics and money may say different. Worth seeing but only once. Big screen does it justice but cable will do as well. No cold drinks during this movie as just watching it makes one cold. Good snack and popcorn for the taste not the tenseness. Enjoy..."
"sainegirl","5","1","5","12 January 2016"," All because it's Di' Caprio
","I found this movie too long and gross. Don't get me wrong, I love gory and violent movies (I'm a Tarantino lover so... ) but I found The Revenant irritating. The gore in this movie was just plain annoying and over played, especially when he was being mauled by the bear. Jeez. I found this movie a tad boring, almost turned off after the first 30mins. I only finished watching it (and gave it a 7/10) because of my loyalty to Di' Caprio (He's Legendary). The story line was so cliché. Man who has lost everything goes to seek vengeance, defying all odds cause he has nothing to lose, then he finally meets his nemesis and they have the last fight where he obviously wins after much struggle. Tch.<br/><br/>I felt the director was trying too hard to be heartless, killing off some particular characters. On the bright side, great cinematography and Leonardo. ❤️what How has he never won an Oscar? That's just cruel. Tom Hardy was another wonder, legendary performance I must say."
"kenniadel","8","1","5","12 January 2016"," Refreshingly Wholistic
","It's that refreshingly wholistic approach (which some viewers might perceive as nihilism on the director's part) that I found to be the film's biggest accomplishment: it depicts the people in this story as just another species trying to survive in that perilous frontier-world. The emphasis is not really on the moral aspects of the brutal injustice that the main character suffers or how the Native Americans are cruelly exploited; we witness all that - but Iñarritu keeps a certain emotional distance, as if he were shooting a documentary about predatory wildlife. And just like the bear's attack, most of the violence in this film comes as a reaction of defense. Be it self- defense, defending one's offspring or defending territory and valuable resources. Even the character that comes closest to an actual villain is driven by fear - not hate, and his most obvious character defects were caused by a very traumatizing experience. As in nature, there is a simple (if often brutal) logic to why most characters, men or beasts, act the way they do in 'The Revenant' (OK, maybe not the French - but I didn't say the film was perfect, did I). And the bear attack was the most realistic depiction of an animal attack I have ever seen on film."
"alex-ogden","9","1","5","8 January 2016"," Hell is Cold as Snow, and Blood as Thick as Ice
","For starters there may be some mild spoilers, I'll try to avoid that as much as I can though. This film is, in a nutshell, The Grey meets The Last of the Mohicans. And it's brilliant. Forget Star Wars, this is really the best film all year. I'm not ever sure where to start except for the fact that I don't write many reviews, unless I really feel moved to say something about a film. This film is beautiful and raw. With one of it's main draws being the cinematography being some of the most beautiful I've seen in years. (Every frame could be a picture worthy of being hung in your house as fine art, on par with Ansel Adam's photographs) It's shot by the same man who shot Children of Men (another beautiful and raw film). Anyways I digress. This film is a triumphs showing the resolve of the human spirit in as horrible a situation as ever put to film. Seriously leave the kids at home for this one, I've seen some gory movies in my days and this one made me uneasy at times. Hugh Glass is a fur trapper in the 1820s American West who's wife was killed by Americans prior to the film and his fur trapping crew by Indians. Shortly afterward they flee and Glass explores and scouts their surrounding area of their camp where he's attacked by a bear. It gets worse, after bandaging him up they leave him with his boy and two others to basically have a few men around to give him a proper burial. It gets worse, one of the men kills his son as he's basically paralyzed watching. It gets worse, he then is truly left for dead in a shallow grave where he isn't even fully buried. It gets worse.. but if I went on I'd ruin the movie. Okay spoilers over (even though you can deduct this from the trailers, I decided to play it safe with IMDb). The reason to see this film is one just how beautifully shot it is. Two DiCapprio's (most likely) Oscar Snub performance, as a man driven to his limits to survive and get revenge. Three for the most engaging film I've seen all year that demands your attention till the end. I was blown away by the rawness of this film. It's a difficult watch for sure, but one of the most engrossing films of recent memory. And with some neat symbolism, reoccurring motifs to give it some thematic heft, and riveting story it's hard to miss. While at deeper glance it might be a little light on story, as it is pretty straight forward. It's at heart a man v. nature, man v. self, man v. man conflict movie, and what else do you really need to have a good story. Most films only attempt a conflict around one of these ideas. While some of the dialogue seems too modern (mainly the swear words). And gunpowder muskets that never seem to be affected by snow or water. You'd be hard-pressed to survive a situation like this and not want to tell a hard boiled tale of survival of how you were a shining example of true grit and resolve."

"efimmazhnik","8","1","5","6 January 2016"," Revenge in God's hands
","Another great film from Alejandro González Iñárritu who is clearly an outstanding director. Beginning with his early ""Amores perros"", his films are always make you think about some paramount life laws. <br/><br/>This film is a veracious Western with a tale of revenge. It describes a story of Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), an American frontiersman, fur trapper and explorer, miraculously survived after the attack of grizzly bear and left for dead by his fellows. From the first frames, this movie gets you into what is happening like a rough river Missouri in which neighborhood the main events of the film were placed. Overcoming incredible obstacles, he gets over great distance almost crawling in order to avenge John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) for the murder of his son. In its entirety, this film is rather weakly filled with emotions. But in general, various incidents and scenes, characters and symbols, all of this is quite clearly creates the atmosphere of resistance and desire to live. Apparently, visuals are playing the most important role in this creation. Perhaps the best operator of modernity Emmanuel Lubezki completely immerses you in an atmosphere of wild nature. The camera clouds up, gets wet, covered with frost or blood, together with the main characters. It really blurs the border between subject and object. In point of fact, the visual structure of ""The Revenant"" uses all the tricks Iñárritu used earlier in ""Birdman"" - the narrative is interspersed by flashbacks, dreams, hallucinations, the character meets the ghosts of the past to help him see the way, and so on. And it does serves its purpose. Separately want to mention successfully used Kubrick-style symbols, including biblical. For instance, there is a small link in the film, when antagonist said that all the will of God. After half of the film protagonist answered him, that revenge in God's hands. This bunch is seems to be very important in this film since it reveals its central idea. <br/><br/>In sum, the film turned out to be quite strong and tough. Of course, it will go down in history as one of the most powerful films. It is necessary to watch the film exclusively at the movie theater, all the basic capacity is concentrated on the visual aspect. <br/><br/>8/10."

The photography is remarkable, and the camera is dirty and steamy when it comes close to the characters face, to emphasize their agony. A Leonardo Di Caprio that gives us a good example of Stanislavskij school. The plot is very simple. The main protagonist is forsaken by his mates under an inch of soil, torn apart by a grizzly. He snakes and limps to reach his camp and get his revenge for his son murder. Leo's interpretation and the direction, with long sequences shots, let the spectator taste the multiple fighting and chasing scenes. A must seen movie that I hope can finally bring an Oscar to Di Caprio, thinking about the countless efforts that he did to show us a dirty, wounded, feverish, vengeful character."
"authenticallysumit","9","1","5","5 January 2016"," The one where Inarritu, Leo, Tom Hardy and Lubezki got together
","9/10 *Even though this movie showcases my favorite actor and favorite cinematographer at their very best,THIS IS AN UNBIASED REVIEW*<br/><br/>I had been waiting for this movie since long because of the big names it carried and boy was I impressed! Hugh Glass, the American frontiersman played by Leonardo, is left to dead by his men after being badly injured in a deadly combat with a bear in the wild, in perhaps the most amazing scene of the movie. What follows is an excruciating (in real) and amazing (in reel) journey of survival in the most gruesome conditions. The Revenant rides off to a brilliant start with the first few minutes already setting up the mood for the tale to be followed. But, hold on, this isn't just another ""Cast Away"". Inarritu gave a blend of humane touch with spirituality to it and made the movie appealing and poignant. Glass's character is developed as he makes his way battling against death. Glass does it all. Fighting against a wild bear, healing himself in the weirdest places, sleeping inside an animal carcass and many other things. Leonardo gave another 'Oscar-worthy' performance and chances are high that this could be it. Tom Hardy, however, is the surprise package of the movie. Had I not known before that Tom Hardy is acting in this movie, I'd have totally failed to recognize him. (Give the poor soul a movie where he can carry a normal look!) He has given an equally powerful performance as Leo's and develops as a great antagonist with his crispy accent. There are some very powerful scenes in the movies that you can expect from any movie which has Lubezki as its cinematographer. He's the master of his skill and perfectly shoots every scene. The art of cinematography and camera work is yet to be learnt from him by many on how to develop the best intensity in a shot. Lubezki uses lenses to capture the gruesome cold almost as if you could feel Glass's struggle to catch his breath and the 'longers' to develop the intensity of the combats. The usual metaphorical elements that Inarritu is expert at, and the fantastic acting that the leads have done, add to the brilliance of every scene. The movie carries on with a slow pace, just like you'd expect from a survival tale. It has its ups and downs. Some pretty intense scene and some scenes where one might catch a yawn or two but Inarritu makes sure the same tone is maintained throughout. Inarritu has given his usual strokes in between embellishing the script even further. To be honest, this could have just been an average movie had Inarritu not directed it. The visually stunning cinematography and the great performances are its backbones and they support the movie throughout. It's a great adaptation of the novel but more than that, the movie carries on its own due to the amazing teamwork by each and every unit of the movie."

","Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Hugh Glass, a fur trapper, who in the 1820s, was part of a fur trapping expedition, who was attacked by a grizzly bear and left for dead by his companions. His major rival, John Fitzgerald, portrayed by the great British actor Tom Hardy, using a dead on Texas accent, make The Revenant one of the best films of 2015. The scenery is awesome and the story a compelling one. My only criticism is that at over two and a half hours, it is a little too long. The director, Alejandro Inarritu, could have tightened up the editing a bit and still had an excellent movie. Even so, The Revenant is worth watching."

","While not my type of film, there's no mistaking it; The Revenant is one outstandingly made film. From cinematography, story, acting, scoreit's probably destined to win best picture. <br/><br/>While not my favorite movie of the year, again, not my brand of cinema and the movie never seemed to end, I wouldn't have a problem with it taking home the gold. Maybe Leo can FINALLY win one, as well. As good as he's been in the past, if he didn't give his all here, I don't know what it'll take.<br/><br/>While the story begins confusing – very little is spelled out, it becomes fairly simple. In probably thee most realistic animal attacks I've seen, the 1800's Cap'n Glass wrestles with a bear and is eventually left for dead by his men. When the even worse circumstance happens, it's man vs. nature leading into man vs. man.<br/><br/>The Revenant isn't a movie I ever want to see again, but I can appreciate all the efforts, scope, heart and depth that went into this production. It's an unmistakably realistic Western if I've ever seen one.<br/><br/>Not for kids and not for the mainstream, it's still recommended for cinema and (real) Old West lovers."
"james_scott_mcs","8","1","5","27 December 2015"," Good old school style western. Reminded me of Jeremiah Johnson. But...
","I really enjoyed this movie. And any fan of the older westerns like Jeremiah Johnson will probably also like it. With the cinemas filled with CGI jammed movies with very little story, this movie was really refreshing. The one CGI obvious effect was the bear attack. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty good. And there was no way to do that scene any other way. The acting was pretty good, but as most of the movie Leo crawling and grunting, there is only so much to go by. But I think Leo should get an Oscar just for his performance in such insanely nasty conditions. <br/><br/>This movie isn't filmed in some back lot. It was filmed in the winter in Canada and Argentina. Which brings me to the filmography, probably the best seen in a long time. You can tell that they took great care to use only natural lighting. The lighting and camera work was beautiful. You can feel the dread and cold and dreary weather. Which I read led to a lot of delays, but I think it was well worth it. <br/><br/>The writing was pretty good. I think if they kept parts of the movie closer to the original tale, it would of made for a better movie. Now I know Glass probably exaggerated on his original telling. It had some parts, such as he avoided gangrene by tearing open a rotten log and allowing the maggots to eat the dead flesh. But overall the script wasn't to unbelievable. But.....<br/><br/>****Spoilers below****** There are some parts that just have you going ""Oh, come on!"". My biggest one, was the scene in the river. Anyone that is remotely familiar with water survival knows you have a few minutes before you pass out and die. And that's under ideal conditions. We don't know how long he was in there, but it was clearly a long time. Yes Glass did go down the river, but he had built a crude raft. Fixing a hole in your throat with gunpowder. I know this is an old western trick to cauterize a wound. But surely it would of simply sealed the hole open and not closed the hole. <br/><br/>My big surprise was after seeing the movie and doing research about the real Glass. Is that the ending is nearly completely false. Not gonna spoil that one, but let's just say it would of been a boring ending.<br/><br/>Overall a pretty good movie. Mostly believable. Beautifully filmed. Nicely acted. And Leo earned my respect for performing in such conditions."

","There aren't many moments in the movie that aren't intense as hell. The brutality of the Indian attack that opens the story is barely over when the picture launches into the media hyped bear attack on the principal character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. I'm not a fan of his but I can recognize the amount of effort that went into this role, and so I feel his Best Actor award is well earned. Before the Oscars were announced I had a feeling the picture would take the top award as well, that was before I saw the film. I can see how this movie might not have been at the top of Academy members' voting lists. It's not an easy picture to watch, as many of the scenes like the one showing the results of the bear mauling are cringe worthy. It reminded me of the wounds in ""The Passion of the Christ"" and leaves you wondering how mere mortals could possibly survive them even in normal conditions, let alone the harsh environment trapper Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) found himself in. One's attention as the viewer is constantly reminded of the unforgiving nature of the terrain Glass must fight his way through to seek vengeance on the man who left him for dead. The entire picture is a testament to one man's perseverance, exemplified by Glass's own words in my summary line above."

","Wow. Just wow. No movie has ever engaged me so much yet have very little dialogue being said. First off, the good things (and there's a lot). The cinematography is amazing. I've never seen a movie looking as beautiful as this does. There were some action scenes where it was all one really long shot just like in Alejandro González Iñárritu's last film, Birdman. Also, all the performances in this movie were top notch. Leonardo Dicaprio is at his best in this movie, even though he has barely any lines, and Tom Hardy gives the best performance I've seen from him so far. Even the supporting characters, which include Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson, were really good. Another thing is that this movie is the grittiest movie I've ever watched. There are parts where it can get very violent and disturbing. Fortunately, it helped add some very intense and memorable scenes (*cough cough* the bear scene *cough cough*). Now the only thing wrong with the movie is not necessarily what came out of my experience of the movie, but rather what it might be like for all audiences. This is not a movie for everyone. There are people who might find this movie boring because of its slow pace at some points and the very little dialogue that there is. This is not a bad thing though. Everyone has their preferences so some people might find the movie boring. Also, there is one really small scene concerning Hugh Glass's wife that was a little too strange and didn't make sense. But that's just me. In the end, this is a near perfect film. It is the most beautiful yet the grittiest film I've ever seen. I give this a 10 out of 10."

","The Revenant is /amazing/.<br/><br/>It's genuinely not my kind of thing (I literally went because General Hux (Gleeson) is in it), but oh gosh, it took my breath away. The cinematography is some of the best I have /ever/ seen in a movie; it's so aesthetically pleasing as well. I've never cried over a bit of bloody snow before, oh wow.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson have such amazing acting skills in this movie; I freaking fell in love with Domhnall's character, again, my life is over. If Leo doesn't get his Oscar for this movie, then the Committee are just biased against him not getting one. Tom Hardy's character is a total freaking dick, #FuckFitzgerald, but I love that I hated one of Hardy's characters – it shows just how an amazing actor he is, to make a fan detest his character. Domhnall Gleeson's character is just a sweetheart, you really just want the best for him and you just wanna wrap him up in bubble wrap and a blanket.<br/><br/>There are a few trigger warnings – gore obviously, there's a small r*pe scene which lasts, I'd say about 15-25 seconds, and yea, there's a lot of animals that 'die'. There's gore throughout the film, there's not really much you can do to avoid it (you'd be ignoring about 60-70% of the movie). (Note – this was not tagged as spoilers as it gives nothing in the plot away. It's just a warning for people that may be effected by these things.)<br/><br/>Honestly, I wish I could permanently implant it into my hippocampus, I am so taken aback. I feel so raw yet so... I don't know how to explain it, like emotionally strong at the same time? (That may be my autism.)

"eddie_baggins","9","1","6","11 January 2016"," A brutal yet beautiful western
","After the Revenant breathes it's last icy cold breaths of a long and unrelentingly fierce runtime, there is almost assured chances that you as a witness to the events laid before you on the screen so frequently beautifully yet so uncompromising will be in need of a quick and needed respite from partaking in Alejandro González Iñárritu's intense and breathtaking tale of revenge and the will to survive.<br/><br/>Without question one of the harshest big screen blockbusters that has ever graced our screens, the Revenant more than likely came out the way it has thanks to Iñárritu's huge success with last years much loved Birdman, and if Birdman's reception did indeed secure the Revenant's huge budget and also secure Iñárritu the chance to create his movie the way he so invisioned, then we as cinema lovers should be thanking our lucky stars.<br/><br/>Working on the largest scale yet seen in his career, Iñárritu alongside his willing cast and crew and in particular trusted D.O.P Emmanuel Lubezki (who has his third straight Oscar in the bag after this effort), create an almost fever dream of a movie that fills it's every frame with stark beauty or jaw dropping feats of filmmaking skill that burst out of the blocks with a white knuckle opening stanza and are no better showcased than in a scarily in your face bear attack. Highlighting these moments in the film however are quite arbetory as the Revenant is filled with moments that will last long in the memory and feature a Leonardo DiCaprio performance that will likely see the great modern day actor finally secure that long overdue Best Actor Oscar.<br/><br/>Giving all new meaning to a bad day at the office, poor old frontiersman Hugh Glass is having an incredibly unfortunate run of bad luck that sees him not only become a grizzly's plaything but a near dead man that just seems to keep on copping it from nature and from mankind. It's not a performance that requires DiCaprio to chew on dialouge as his role here is literally 5 – 10 mins of talking but it's a role that sees the renowned actor dive head first into a physically demanding and full bodied turn.<br/><br/>From his central battle with a grizzly, cosy nights with his horse friend and yummy buffalo dinners just to name a few, DiCaprio becomes Hugh Glass and while it's arguable that this is in fact his ""best"" ever performance, in a field that pales in comparison, DiCaprio seems the front runner at the soon to be held Oscars. While DiCaprio is the clear standout, he is ably supported by another rough and mumbling Tom Hardy turn as the films villain Fitzgerald and the increasingly impressive Domhnall Gleeson as good hearted army man Captain Andrew Henry.<br/><br/>Whilst it would be easy to go on at length concerning the Revenant's many highlights and successes the film does fall ever so short in a couple of matters that stop it from becoming a genuine fully fledged immaculate motion picture.<br/><br/>There's a sufficient lack at times of emotional engagement to the characters and events in the film and the picture as a whole could've done with a sharper edit as there are times when scenes play out too long or events become blurred in a myriad procession of bad luck after bad luck but overall these are slight and insignificant criticisms when held up to the films wins and Iñárritu and his crew should be highly commended for crafting a film that utilises nature and realism like many films could only but dream of.<br/><br/>A film that deserves to be seen on the largest screen available to your viewing needs, the Revenant is a western like none other and a big budgeted film that walks entirely to its own beat. Most often jaw droppingly filmed, violently intense, impeccably staged and featuring an award worthy turn from DiCaprio, the Revenant is must watch material that even though we may only be a few weeks into 2016, we already have a front runner for film of the year.<br/><br/>4 1/2 prolonged bear maulings out of 5"
"RforFilm","8","1","6","12 January 2016"," The Revenant goes through bear mauling to Indian attacks to push Leonardo DiCaprio through this interesting dark western
","The biggest distinction between older westerns (made before the 1970s) and the more current ones is how they portray the atmosphere. Both establish well enough that it was an unforgiving environment, but there is something safer about the older ones; an idea that you could at least get a drink from the saloon without a chance of getting shot. Now of course, we know that even a walk down main street was never a guarantee as there were a lot of deaths due to idiots with guns or greedy individuals who have surrendered their humanity in order to survive. <br/><br/>We're lucky that we live in such a time period where we've found treatments for so many injuries and diseases that the lifespan has spun out of control. Back when even reaching sixty was a stretch is becoming more of the common middle ground. Back then, if you were lucky enough to make it through the madness that was the ""survival of the fittest attitude"", you still had to last through horrible diseases, attacks from unfriendly Native Americans, and of course, the forces of natures. The story of one frontiersman and his trek through the wilderness shows no mercy in The Revenant.<br/><br/>In the early days of conquering the west in 1832, a military party of hunters and trappers are ambushed by the Arikara tribe. The attack leads to two thirds dead and the escaped survivors weary and trying to make their way back to civilization. Under the command of Captain Andrew Henry, it's agreed by fur trapper Hugh Glass (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) to ditch their only boat to hike the rest of the way, in order to avoid any more Indian attacks. Glass gets mauled by a mother grizzly bear and is wounded to the point where the rest of his party is convinced that he's going to die.<br/><br/>Two men stay behind in order to wait for Glass to die so they can give him a proper burial, John Fitzgerald (played by Tom Hardy) and Jim Bridger (played by Will Poulter). Fitzgerald grows impatient and convinces Bridger to leave Glass behind so they can get to a nearby fort sooner for warmth and food. Even with the broken leg, broken ribs, and exposed wounds from the bear attack, Glass regains conciseness and proceeds to head in the direction that Fitzgerald was going to get his revenge for leaving him behind. Glass faces cold temperatures, his own wounds, and still hostile Indians in order to get to safety.<br/><br/>Directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu (Birdman), then you'll see that not only did he create a dark western, but wanted to make sure his actors would understand how harsh the environment was. The Revenant is self aware of how uncomfortable and gritty it is (even more so then The Hateful Eight) as is Leonardo DiCaprio who is the one to suffer the most. He gives everything he has for this nearly silent (yet still speaking two Native American languages) frontiersman who goes through hell, literally and figuratively, for the performance that looked to be so hard, that if he doesn't finally get an Oscar, is clear proof that the academy hates him for no real reason.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy and Will Poulter manage to stand out in their own scenes, even knowing that there's no way they could have outshined DiCaprio. <br/><br/>The Revenant makes for a very interesting journey that unfortunately is plagued by it's own tone. Since were following one guy's journey home, the two and a half hour running time is a lot to ask of it's audience. It worked better for Cast Away as the environment constantly changed, while we're stuck in this grim, snowy setting the entire time. <br/><br/>I'll give this eight bear skins out of ten. Aside from being the major justification to finally let Leonardo DiCaprio, The Revenant happens to be a pretty good journey into the harsh west. It's understandably not for everyone, but if your can stomach the worst from animal guts and broken bones, then this journey into hell is an interesting one."

","OK, so first of all, I have way too much to say about this movie. It's intense as all get out. Visually striking, the camera work was great. As Leo took a slice to the cheek from fellow cast mate Tom Hardy, blood smeared the camera lens giving it authentic brutality for us as viewers. The sound was so crisp, my own ears were ringing after the arrows released from the bows of the Indians effortlessly whistled by and hit a nearby tree trunk 5 minutes before! This was truly a visual film for me. The color palette was so rich, I honestly can't remember the last time I saw a movie that was filled with such vibrancy! It's gross but I could literally smell the sweat coming from everyone in the theater because of the intensity this film brought. I could taste the dryness in my mouth after my heart sank several times during the emotional gut-wrenching heartbreaks. So, I think its safe to say, my 5 senses were definitely utilized to the fullest extent! Haha! But back to visuals, I loved how Alejandro González Iñárritu (Director of Revenant) created moments in the film to give the audience time to absorb all of the epic potency that were birthed in the scenes before. For example, a battle between former allies now turned foes comes to a close in a 30 second scene that focuses on the still waters of a ravine to reflect on what just happened and how the currents are always changing. Just like in life too. Or the loss of a loved one ending in a scene gliding through the dark skies with a faint glowing light breaking through the clouds to suggest that that loved one is now truly home safe and sound. But the dark skies don't make the pain any easier. The symbolism and metaphorical allusions had my heart and mind racing which made this film even more enjoyable. To top it all off, Ryuichi Nakamoto, responsible for composing the musical score was absolutely phenomenal. I'm a music guy so this was definitely the icing on the cake for me. All in all, fantastic movie. With intensity aside though, the film did offer some lighthearted moments as well to go along with the excellent structure that Iñárritu already had going for its mint condition exoskeleton of a movie! I don't usually do long, drawn-out movie reviews for just any movie but this one was worth it. Although, It's definitely not for the faint of heart as my cousin and I were outmatched in age by at least 20 or 30 years ha ha! I see this film winning many awards or at least being nominated for a some! Now........... for crying out loud, will someone please give Leo his Oscar already! Hahaha!"
"baehr_adam","10","1","6","9 January 2016"," The Indomitable Spirit of Revenge is Cold Hearted!!!!!
","Holy Smokes. I just finished watching this captivating movie a little while ago and it was Absolutely Phenomenal. I will start with the story which is about the explorer named Hugh Glass who is left for dead by a friend after a brutal bear attack in the American Frontier of 1823. The story is extremely solid especially since it's based on a true story. I did find the story dragging a few times but it doesn't take off of the score. I will now move onto the acting which was Breathtaking with both Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio playing their roles to Perfection like in every movie they have ever done prior. I must say that the two of them together make for one Hell of a powerful movie experience. The other actors played their roles just as well even though they were minor in comparison. I will now move onto the action which was if I dare say the most Savage and Barbarous Adaptation of combat during that time period which took place on the American Frontier of the 1800's. I mean it was Masterfully shot and truly one of a kind even to present day Military movies. The military movies of today pale in comparison to just how Ruthless it was back then for the men who fought. I will now move onto the Cinematography which was done by Emmanuel Lubezki which is a Master of his Arts. I mean they shot the film in both Canada and Argentina and a small part in America but the dedication it takes to travel all the way to South America for snow just to double as the American Frontier says volumes on how dedicated the cast and crew were on this film. I can't stress enough how visually stunning the shots were and how realistic it all felt and the music was on point even though it was sparse it was still Amazing. I will close with this statement and that is that you must go and watch this film. I mean it's one of the Best Films and the most refreshingly original films in terms of the cinematography and the depth of the characters will power to evoke just how Indomitable the human body and the human spirit can be when it wants something bad enough."
"z-99949","10","1","6","8 January 2016"," Outstanding performance, an epic masterpiece
","At a glimpse, The Revenant seems like a movie you would reluctantly sit and spend more than 150 minutes on if you are not into that kind of adventure-drama you get to see from the vague sequences of the trailer. Nevertheless, once you start watching the very first minutes, you are there, almost transfixed by the lifelike dynamic of events taking place at a good pace, captivated by the actors' brilliant performance and their tenacious struggle for survival, the violent encounters, the sufferings, the awe-inspiring natural and wild landscapes. <br/><br/>DiCaprio gives an outstanding performance as the movie leading character Hugh Glass. Tom Hardy compliments the cast as his tough antagonist, the manipulative and fugitive John Fitzgerald. More than anything else, the movie focuses on the love for life, deep-rooted into men's psyches, deeper than their fears. Nature's powers above man's will, is another force that drives the movie events. Inspiring is the well depicted audacity of the men involved in their quests, both the protagonists and the local Indians. There is a fine line between loyalty and betrayal. You get to see individuals haunted by their past, determined for their future goals. In nowadays more and more emasculated urban society, through this movie, you get a nice cold breeze of early 19th century struggle for life, manhood and never-ending efforts for survival. <br/><br/>The camera smoothly shifts between wide angle landscapes and close- up focusing on actions which offers an absolutely rewarding experience. The director aimed at natural lighting which adds to the authenticity of what you see. The camera proximity to the object or characters along the movie offers stunning captions of brutal confrontations between men, the man and the animal as well as characters' facial expressions that reveal inner battles when no word is spoken. I saw the movie on a PC screen, no doubt the visual satisfaction is doubled on a theater screen. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is like the flashing light of a lighthouse: unexpected, dramatic, keeping on its own rhythm, yet adding for better to the overall drama of the movie. It reminds of brief sequences of the chords of Tchaikovsky's last symphony final movement: there is a long void and then similar sharp tragic notes of strings. <br/><br/>Nine months of filming in remote wild environment, natural light, very good cast and few CGI have produced an exceptionally good film. This is an epic masterpiece and a real achievement of cinematography."
"rockandhockey","10","1","6","7 January 2016"," Perfect combination of pain, despair, revenge, and justice
","I am writing this after just getting out of watching this movie for the first time, but this movie is about as close to perfect as I can perceive. As my title says, this movie portrays Leo's characters pain, despair, revenge, and justice better than anything ever. <br/><br/>I went into this movie with high expectations. i had heard from friends that this could be Leo's chance to finally win an Oscar, and being an avid fan of his, this excited me. But realistically, this could be nominated and win every category that it can. The entire story was seamless. For me, after watching it only once, I didn't see any plot holes, I was entranced from beginning to end, and the ending left me speechless. Needless to say, I was absolutely blown away.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy, while only a supporting role, and very much the antagonist of this story, was incredible. He portrayed his character beautifully, showing the hate for the Native Americans so vividly, but also showing the side of him that made you understand that he did everything because he believed it to be the right thing to do. His character was eerily funny, making me laugh at times where I felt terrible for laughing (but that could just be the twisted side of me). <br/><br/>Leo, on the other hand, was just as great, obviously playing the protagonist. He displayed the pain that his character felt perfectly (although a lot of that credit has to go to the director). In his eyes, in every shot, you could see the drive for his character to find justice. He showed the fear he had to overcome after the bear attack that was displayed in the trailer. While he said very few actual words the entire film, each seemed to rock me to the core. His struggle to find revenge for the people he loved was so pure and real, I'm truly baffled by the how beautifully he portrayed his character.<br/><br/>Finally, my favorite part of this movie was that it displayed the life of the settlers of the west unbelievably well. It showed how difficult life was, the vast difficulties that the settlers had with the natives (warranted or not), the struggles that every person living there had with money, cold, food, and generally trying to survive. And to top it all off, it was set in an incredible part of the US, in (in my opinion) the most beautiful time of the year there. While sitting there feeling horrible for the various characters, I sat there marveling at the beauty of the land around them, appreciating the all too infrequent looks back into the past. <br/><br/>All in all, Alejandro G. Iñárritu has created another masterpiece. I would highly recommend any person who truly loves movies to go and see it for yourself. Fare warning, it was bloody, gruesome, and full of swearing, but it is also perfectly placed in order to make the movie so much better. I loved this movie, will be buying it when it comes out on DVD, and will watch the Oscars that much more anxiously because I truly believe this could be Leo's time to finally win an Oscar (along with probably 6 or 7 more for the rest of the movie and cast). While saying something is a 10 out of 10 is difficult, this movie has earned it. Pay the 10 bucks and see it in theaters while you can. ENJOY!!"

The captivating performance by Leo and the way the film was shot in low, natural light went hand in hand to really plunge your senses in this eerie and dangerous environment.

","When I read about this movie I was pretty excited and when I read that Leonardo Di Caprio was in it I was even more excited but then I red that Innaratu was directing and that took some joy away from me. I mean we all know that his last movie 'Birdman' was rather a disappointment and I didn't really get why he got the Oscar for that. However, in this movie he makes up for everything he did wrong in Birdman. With many mind-blowing shots of some amazing landscapes and many really great camera angles this movie will blow everyones mind that knows to appreciate the little details of movie making. Innaratu really convinced me that he deserved an Oscar with this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is at his best here. He already delivered a mind blowing performance in his last picture but this one was even better. Without many words and very little dialogue for his character DiCaprio manages to take the viewer on an adventure. The way he binds the audience to the screen with just his body acting and all the emotions he portrays only with his face throughout the movie is unbelievable. Together with the great camera work and the great performances of both DiCaprio and Tom Hardy this movie is just a masterpiece. Everything fits together, the music, with the shots and the situation and the whole storyline. <br/><br/>In my opinion many viewers who do not appreciate the little details of movie making and especially know to appreciate things like camera work and music and cinematography and all those things will be bored by this movie, but when we take all this into account this movie is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I hope it will be enough this time for Leonardo DiCaprio to win an Oscar because all the other movies that might be nominated don't have a main character that is portrayed this convincingly."

Mr. Hardy performs negative role best I ever sow him do, as opposed to Di Caprio's betrayed and tortured-soul character. As the story unveils, hard game of cruel survival sucks the viewer in. Almost sublime music follows the mostly nonverbal but deeply atmospheric narration. Being depict are rudimentary drives of a stripped human being: food, family...

","It's a heart-bleeding thriller about love and forgiveness. Adapted by Inarritu from a novel by Michael Punke, the film is loosely based on a real incident from 1823. Inarritu's stylistic gifts embraces the audience to tag along with the protagonist without blinking for 156 minutes. The boundary-pusher director insisted on filming with natural daylights which made panoramic long shots look absolutely stunning. <br/><br/>The close-ups of the cast are often shot at an interestingly low angle, showing right through the character's eyes in moments of high drama, Lubezki even allows their breath to fog the lens. He repeated his uncanny vision through the lens which took me back to 'The Tree of Life' era where we told a story through lights and colors. Last but not least is the DiCaprio/Hardy duel has pushed Leo's craft to the kind of physical and psychological extremes that a younger performer would not never concern himself with. Right picks for the right genre I'd call it.<br/><br/>All and all the entire package has made this movie a visceral sensation, filled with blood yet tender make the project brilliant and vibrant and an excuse to reminded us to be more forgiving  to love and to be loved."
"wesleyhaag","8","1","7","8 January 2016"," One of the most beautiful movies you will ever see.
","Like many, I walked into the theater expecting a great film; somehow I got more. The film from start to finish was beautiful, every shot could be framed and put in to an art gallery. However, if the film was only a spectacle for the eyes, then it is no more than the newest Transformer film. Thus, obviously, the film was more. Although the plot was simple, a man left for dead who seeks revenge on those who are responsible, there is no moment in the movie where you will be bored. The audience remains hooked and continuously roots for Hugh Glass (the protagonist of the film) even as the odds of his survival become slimmer every second. This is due to the captivating soundtrack, spectacular cinematography, and of course stellar acting performances. Leonardo DeCaprio's performance, although one with very little dialogue, is mesmerizing. DeCaprio did not need to say any words, in fact, if he had it could have made his performance silly by overacting. Instead, DeCaprio is able to express his emotions with his physical performance. Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson also gave fantastic performances. Hardy taking a role that was outside his comfort zone, the antagonist, and somehow manages to own it. Another name that needs to be mentioned is Alejandro González Iñárritu, who yet again delivers a film ahead of it's time. If the Oscars go as they should, this should be that film that pisses off all the other films because it is hogging all of the Oscars."

Let the whole mess half bake for 256 minutes at maximum carnage. The result is a film in which Iñarritù's undeniable talent succumbs to the public's insatiable appetite for screen violence for its own sake. James Bond on his best day could not take the sadistic punishment meted out to Leonardo di Caprio in this parable of 'vengeance is mine'. Somewhere along the line, amidst all the gore, punctuated by delicate and sometimes mawkish moments of dreamlike spirituality, the story loses sight of itself. Not to say that the hundred million budget wasn't well spent. The opening battle scene and the near-fatal encounter, early on, are superbly done. Some of the best CGI I've ever seen put to good use. Worth the price of the ticket just to see these two sequences. Otherwise, Iñarritù should get back to what he does best: shooting a tight screenplay with great acting and less grand philosophizing about nature."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","1","8","11 January 2016"," A masterpiece
","If the rumblings from director Alexander Gonzalez Inarritu and his intrepid cast and crew about The Revenant being the most tumultuous, challenging shoot of their lives are true, it's all in service of the loftiest of causes one could achieve: to produce great art. I say that without pretension or monocle wagging patronization, and mark my words: The Revenant is by and far the greatest film this year, and possibly of the last decade. It is monumental in scale, meticulous in pacing and erects the fundamental pillars of the human condition so flawlessly that we feel we are watching actual history materialize before our eyes, untethered from the notion that it's just a movie. <br/><br/>Let's start with the ocular deity that is Emmanuel Lubezki: This film contains the best cinematography I have ever seen in my life. The bold location scouting is a catalyst for the prodigy of a DOP to work his ethereal magic. Time and time again throughout the film I found myself marvelling at the stunning patience and skill displayed by the man in attaining his precious shots, constantly chafed by what I imagine was an impossibly stressful environment, bogged down by time constraints and the pure, uncaring call of nature itself. He shot with natural light for all but one scene, an unimaginable achievement that plays out in endless beauty that rocks your soul to its foundation for the entire two and a half hour running time. The locations, lovingly culled from deep within northern Canada and briefly Argentina, are an unforgiving cacophony of serene snowfalls, cascading rivers and jagged, untamed mountain ranges. This is the landscape I have grown up in no call home and to such holy places captured with such reverence on film, gilding a story of such primordial importance had me next to tears. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio pulls out all the stops in his ferocious portrayal of Hugh Glass, a frontiersman who lives by his feral gut instinct alone, attempting to guide his fur trapping expedition through the terrain while looking out for his half Pawnee Native son who he already rescued from aching tragedy years before. After a harrowing raid in the dawning minutes of the film that makes it abundantly clear how serious thee film intends to be, he and a small band of men are stranded and forced to contend with the land, and the threat of the natives finding them. Glass then gets attacked by a bear in a nerve shattering sequence that had my adrenal glands running a marathon. The frank, unapologetic nature in which the scene plays out reminds us all that nature isn't our playground of opportunity and commerce, but a living organism that can bite the hand that it refuses to feed with alarming abandon. The sheer level of carnage inflicted upon Glass by both beast and man will shake you to your core, as will the excellent makeup and CGI effects that drive the point deep into your retinas. Tom Hardy disappears into his role better than Glass's expedition blends into the treacherous blizzards, playing John Fitzgerald, a cowardly creature who is content to leave Glass to the elements and seek fortune elsewhere, dragging sympathetic Jim Bridger (Will Poulter, excellent) along with him. The military component of their expedition (Domhall Gleeson, superb) suspects Fitzgerald and is wary. Hardy is the very definition of an acting chameleon, and disappears headlong into the role that had me riveted, and rooting for a best supporting actor win. The entire cast was subjected to a brutal nine weeks exposed to the elements, each other, and the raw, archetypal narrative of the piece that was being made, and each of them shows it in spades. <br/><br/>At its core it's a revenge piece, spurred by aching character interaction involving Leo,and his family in affecting flashbacks. Leo goes through somewhat of a transformation here.. He loses all he has left to an uncaring, cold faced world that would sooner see him tossed around a mosses stained forest in pieces than avenged. But his Hugh Glass rages against the dying of the light right alongside Lubezki's lens, creating in tandem the perfect voyage of a man who has become so consumed with the forces of nature in his quest to attain some semblance of his former self, that he has become somewhat of an element himself. Leo truly deserves gold this time around. <br/><br/>Adventure/survival epics are my favourite. This one stands out, and yet.. does more than that, if possible. It delves deep into the lush, echoing vastness of the past and pulls forth a story so human, so recognizable, in such a force of construction where the fruits of everyone's labour are so obvious, it can't help but be worshipped as a classic in the art form of cinema and a treatise on how to excel in every single area of the medium."

","The Revenant is directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu and is written by Mark L. Smith and Alejandro González Iñárritu. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, and Will Poulter along with Domhall Gleeson and Forrest Goodluck.<br/><br/>A frontiersman named Hugh Glass on an fur trade expedition in the 1820s is on a quest for survival after being brutally mauled by a bear.<br/><br/>The Revenant is a movie that really grew on me over the course of a week. When I initially saw it, Christmas Day, I hated this movie with a passion, but after a week of contemplation, I can officially say The Revenant is one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>If for nothing else, this movie is spectacular just on a visual level. With an astounding feat in cinematography,mastery of CGI, (especially in a scene with a huge bear) and the use of natural lighting, this movie transports you to the unforgiving and ill- tempered wilderness, Mister Hugh Glass had to trudge through.<br/><br/>The direction by Iñárritu in this movie was a bit uneven. He made the active decision to use continuous shots which worked to some extent, but when the focus is placed on multiple moving subjects, it becomes rather disorienting. With that said, these continuous shots work at holding the intensity when the focus is placed directly on DiCaprio and/or Hardy.<br/><br/>Moving past its visual style and into the depths of tits plot, this movie was met with a myriad of problems. The largest of these problems involved this movie's genre. Unsure if its a survival drama or a revenge thriller but sure it wants to be art-house, The Revenant, in turn, fails at all three. It flops as a art-house movie because there isn't enough in the story to be something mind bending. It fails as a revenge thriller because aside from three phenomenal confrontations, revenge is rarely mentioned. Finally, it fails as a survival drama because of the predictability behind Glass' character.<br/><br/>Speaking of Mister Glass and switching back to the positives, Leonardo DiCaprio barely uttering a word in English, gives the single best physical performance, I think I've ever seen. DiCaprio masters his character to deliver a spectacle of absolute realism. Brooding, somber, and broken DiCaprio earns himself another Oscar nod.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is also absolutely astounding and does manage to out shine DiCaprio in some scenes nearing the end of the movie. I foresee a possible Oscar nod on his part as well. A major surprise for me was to see Will Poulter deliver a very nuanced performance, more than holding his own against the two seasoned actors.<br/><br/>The Revenant is a deeply flawed but ultimately wholly entertaining movie with great performances all-round and a great deal of visual charm. The Revenant gets a B+ or a 7/10."

","This film was once again directed by Alessandro Gonzalez Inaritu, who won the Oscar for Best Director Award, and once again won the Oscar for Best Director Award. This film also won the Oscar Best Best Film Award. In fact, this film can also be named the soul reviver or the soul of the dead.
The film tells that Grass was seriously injured by a bear while hunting, and was then taken care of by fellow Fitz players. He took over 300 dollars and took care of it. He carelessly killed Glass's son and tricked Jim away. Grasse. Later, Grass survived stubbornly and insisted on looking for Fitz 's revenge. Finally, with the death of the captain, he succeeded in revenge on a river.
The beginning of the movie begins with a series of long shots that are extremely difficult to shoot. The Indians besieged the team of Grasse, the setting of natural light, the fleeing of water, smoke, horses, and dragons. A racial and alien killing is being staged . The five-minute fight with Bear in the woods is also a long shot that the director is good at. Every time the bear attacks, every time the Grass groans, this sense of reality makes the viewer 's heart beat, knife. See blood. The scenes shot in the movie are magnificent and magnificent. They are vast and magnificent nature, mysterious and dangerous ice fields, and high and distant mountains, set against a small person, and constitute a picture of the confrontation between man and nature. Man and life The epic of struggle. The climax of the film followed the survival of Grasse. Grasse, who was seriously injured, climbed out of the grave, burned the wound with gunpowder, and dived into the river to escape the pursuit of the Li people. After such torture, he survived, returned to the camp, and officially began his revenge. The violent aesthetic mixed with the film is not violence for survival, but an instinctively weak meat and strong food. Grass 's lines are very few. Basically, it is a unicorn drama, especially in the endless ice field. The lonely is not only the loneliness of the body but also the loneliness of the loss of wife and child. The expression of Grass seems to be a line, speechless and deep, and the viewer has pity for the pain of survival. His belief is the narration that runs through the film many times in the dream. ""As long as you can breathe, you must fight and continue to breathe."" The reason for living is revenge and faith.
I noticed the images used in the film: the birds flying out of the chest after the death of my wife, the death knell in the dream, and the sky flashed through the sky and fell into flames. At the beginning, I thought that the kind of bird was a crow, which represented the messenger of death. Later, I thought that it could also represent the freedom of death. Because of the suffering in the world, I was happy after death. This can also explain that when Grass saw his wife happy Image. The death knell can also be regarded as the death of a son. The moment when the falling sky fire appeared, it made me think it was ""Icarus"" in ancient Greek mythology-with a pair of waxy wings, flying to the sun, and finally falling, he represents the pursuit of faith, which should be in the movie It also refers to the passing away of Grasse's faith, and should also represent the demise of the tribe represented by his wife and children and the Poni people who saved him. All three images can be regarded as death or the loss of an existing thing. This is a part of Grasse's confrontation. This part-death belongs to a powerful and irreversible nature. Grasse's life is as small as a mustard. Under one kind of contrast, it became more and more small and could not withstand a blow. Highlighting life and life 's revenge is not worth mentioning in such a natural environment, so that the phrase ""The revenge is in the hands of God"" that flashed over at the end of Glass 's revenge on Fitz will not be abrupt. This kind of person struggling with swords and arrows and cold snow and ice, fighting a shot hanging in the line, tells us that life is paid and impermanent. Grass 's instantaneous understanding of God seemed to him that he had to follow suit. It was like a mission, like a gift from you against nature.
This film is about the life of ice and fire. With the help of people's understanding of life, it can resonate with the soul of the viewer. In the art, sound effects, shots, and narrative, you can pick it out separately. The best Oscar film is really named Return."

But it's the slavish long takes and the way they're stitched together that sometimes detracts from the flow, encouraging you to think more technically about it.
Tom Hardy is superb, a very different but equally good performance to DiCaprio as a proper balls to bone villain. Even though his mad babbling is brilliant, the film is neck deep in too much dialogue; The Revenant is a film where the esoteric imagery and stillness fight against the action and the obvious long takes and both fight against the hamfisted plot delivery and talking. It's a film that could have been excellent at one of those three things but with all of them in abundance, doesn't quite feel like an out of body experience, instead feels a lot like a well calculated man made movie.
DiCaprio's pain is palpable, the locations are blisteringly raw and untouched by humankind, and the final fight for revenge is like a video game QTE from the year 2045. It's memorable and epic and in many ways a masterpiece, but it's far from perfect."

Leo plays a scout tracker type of woodsman ""Hugh Glass"" who witnessed his son murdered by the psychotic ""Fitzgerald"" played by the always excellent Tom Hardy & here you will hate him, it's a mix of primal raw survival tale & a mission of vengeance through the unforgiving winter terrain of mountains & wild rivers & snow storms & Savage Indians as well as savage frontiersmen & hunters & wild bears as our survivor just keeps going with every breath getting closer.
It's an extremely wild ride & shows how brutal those times were for any race of people, I'm surprised anyone could survive during those dark times but they did.
""The Revenant"" is a journey & adventure during those extreme western frontier times, so it's a period piece drama also but mainly IT'S a film of a man who has lost everything & has nothing to lose so with a heart full of rage he seeks revenge for his murdered son.

"FilmLion","9","0","1","29 December 2019"," Awards for this incredibly bleak yet stirring movie were earned!
","If you would take away the visually stunning photography and scenery as well the great score of this movie, you would still be left with a great movie. Leonardo DiCaprio definitely earned his Oscar for his portrayal frontiersman Hugh Glass. Tom Hardy deserves his nomination for his portrayal of John Fitzgerald (this character has got to be among the most evil and soulless characters in film history!)<br/><br/>I feel that some of the negative reviews of this movie come from the fact that viewers want to pigeonhole this movie into either the category of adventure or action. Although it has plenty of both of the aforementioned elements, it is really a survival / justice movie. But in the end, it is just better not to try to pigeonhole this film which is much more complex than it appears on the surface.<br/><br/>The scene where Hugh Glass is attacked and mauled by a bear is so graphic, it will make even the most seasoned movie watcher wince a bit. Not only is the CGI used for the bear incredible, but you can really feel the pain that Dicaprio's character is experiencing. However, this scene also is a part of the reason why I didn't give this movie a full 10: In reality, the injuries that the Glass character received from the bear attack (combined with all the other physical injuries he received throughout the film) would most likely resulted in his death. Or would have left him incapacitated to the point he would have died of exposure.<br/><br/>This movie has no dull moments, and for me it seemed far less than its running time of 156 minutes, due to its intense pace.<br/><br/>This film is a must-see saga for any serious movie

"kenobio-68005","9","0","2","13 November 2019"," The Revenant
","The Revenant is a powerful movie heavily relying on determination and father/son relationship.<br/><br/>The story is set in America during the 1820s. Due to an Indian attack, a colony has to manage to escape from the Indians' arrows, killing most of its men. While they search for a new settlement, Hugh Glass, a skilled hunter, gets attacked by a bear and is left highly injured. While keeping an eye on his bloody still-breathing corpse, the cold drives John Fitzgerald, member of the colony, hysterical and kills Glass' son, Hawk. The hunter's corpse left for dead, his determination and hunger for revenge keeps him from dying and will have to go though the wild cold of the America's mountains to accomplish his duty.<br/><br/>The cast is composed with actors gifted with excellent acting skills. Leonardo DiCaprio, who won an Oscar for his performance, demonstrates the character's paternel love for his son and thirst of revenge on the one who murdered his own son. Talking about Fitzgerald, Tom Hardy portrays so well the mad colonist who wants to live on his own and get money, even killing on his way to obtain that American Dream. Domhnall Gleeson plays the serious and helpful colony's leader, and Will Poulter, the youth scared of the wilderness of America.<br/><br/>This movie is incredibly beautiful. The shots of the mountains, rivers and forests, real of CGI, are breathtaking. The plot, even if it takes the idea of revenge, stills holds and you can really see Glass' development and recovery after his deadly battle. The costumes and makeup are realistic and the acting skills are incredible. Go watch this movie if you haven't already."

Director Alejandro Inarritu incorporates a visceral cinematography style as found in Saving Private Ryan (1998) into his own visual aspect of men battling each other and seems to take advantage of the use of sharp artistic images along with crisp sound effects that made Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) so powerful and realistic. Using haunting and powerful strains of music that at times echo Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, Inarritu enhances the movie's lengthy edits without dialogue.

","19 January 2016. Leonardo deCaprio like his role as Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) shows that he understands suffering well as a mountain man in Revenant. Director Alejandro Inarritu incorporates a visceral cinematography style as found in Saving Private Ryan (1998) into his own visual aspect of men battling each other and seems to take advantage of the use of sharp artistic images along with crisp sound effects that made Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) so powerful and realistic.

Revenant has many similarities to another stunning survival movie, Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (2006) and the epic western, Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves that won best movie Oscars twenty-five years ago.<br/><br/>Yet unlike more personally and sustain intensity of the true to life survival film, Kevin Macdonald's Touching the Void (2003, there are plot weaknesses throughout the movie that mildly detract from the movie's rhythm and authenticity. There is a scene beautifully shot from high above a river and yet realistically the actual path to the river seems impossibly difficult to navigate as that point in the movie. There isn't any actual shot of the use of flint in making an actual fire. And likely another in an extremely cold river would have died within minutes of hypothermia. The death scene of a single Indian seems unlikely when the white man survives nearby. And any person trying to avoid being tracked is also a fool to walk in a visually stunning scene in the middle of an open and barren now field. Finally it is unlikely a manhunt as choreographed in The Revenant would have unfolded so blatantly easily as it did.<br/><br/>A major problem with this movie is how the director pushes the limits of artistic presentation over the storyline. Sean Penn's survival movie, Into The Wild (2007) is a good example where the director's fantastic camera eye for beauty begins to transform into the foreground of the movie's plot, and here in The Revenant falling into a tree scene is one glaring example of overkill towards unbelievability. The last problem with this movie is its ending which is overly extended and the Indian women's character development and role in the movie is severely minimized to the point that a most poignant redemption ending is lost and overlooked.<br/><br/>The Revenant deserves best acting, cinematographic awards, but it can't quite offer the completeness for best movie."

Survival and revenge are basic instincts, and this was a basic film, although pretty. The over-the-top bleakness did bring some unintentional laughs, though. You can't bear that kind of misery without laughing at it. Unless you're working with pretentious writers and directors, I guess."

","Iñárritu's selection of dramatic and kinetic camera shots paired with Lubezki's cinematography makes this a very attractive film.

Nonetheless, DiCaprio's perseverant and relentless Hugh Glass is a worthy winner of an Oscar - which should have really been awarded for his sublime performance in Django Unchained.<br/><br/>Afterthought: Had to watch the film in subtitles as Hardy is very difficult to understand.

It brings the American frontier wilderness to life in a way no other film has done - there are a few quibbles about historical accuracy, but who cares about that? It misses greatness because the ending takes too long and is not quite right - it's a pulp novelist's ending rather than a film maker's, a little bit pretentious and unsatisfying. As someone once said about Unforgiven, the Western must always revert to type. In other words, what we need is catharsis."

","Based on a true story: In 1823, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an experienced hunter and trapper working with other trappers in the northwestern U.S. While facing hardship and difficulties in the wild, Glass is betrayed. The movie chronicles his survival and his quest for revenge.<br/><br/>Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has created brilliant scenes within the elements of nature. He is greatly aided by cinematographer Emmanuel Lukezki. The many aerial vistas (filmed in southern Argentina and the western regions of Canada and the U.S.) reward the eyes and there is great excitement in battle scenes and the now famous and unforgettable scene involving a grizzly bear. The filmmakers can also be credited for keeping the viewers' interest during all of its 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>At one point, I found it too hard to accept that one man (Glass) could withstand so much and not only survive but even thrive at times. After some research, I learned that the events of the first half of the film are indeed true but the second half was fictionalized for dramatic purposes.<br/><br/>In a very unusual performance, DiCaprio deserves credit for a film in which he is mostly silent. There are moments of intense emotion with his great struggles and he can definitely elicit sympathy in his silence.<br/><br/>""The Revenant"" is certainly a good film overall but probably not worthy of all the awards it received.

","Let's say it, this film is one of the Oscar-flop of 2016. Beautiful object, by an excellent filmmaker, but for once has planted. The Academy (and others) did not see anything.<br/><br/>The immediate impression is very positive. The photography is spectacular, costumes, makeup perfect (it's like) and the physical commitment of all the actors is impressive. The rhythm is slow, the plans are long and fluid. The story ... that's where it gets stuck.
This film is gold wrapping that wraps a bronze medal (it could have been chocolate)<br/><br/>I think Father Iñárritu got lost in his technical performance and the intensity of the context of his shooting.
After the very successful Birdman, who already put in play a technical challenge (very long shots) but was touching and fascinating by his scenario, his characters and this subtle game between the theatrical form and cinematograph, here he adds a technical layer but forget about everything else.
Because for the form, it is difficult to do better. Mainly thanks to the shooting locations and the magic of the weather phenomena. Magic that made several team members left the shoot because of the difficult conditions.
Here too we are dealing with long, very smooth shots, but because there is a but, this process is not ideal in all situations. And not all the time. The specificity of cinema is the succession of different points of view. The transition from one plane to another is an alchemy that creates our emotional involvement. A little like the chemistry that makes it possible to obtain a 3rd ingredient from the two completely different 1sts, the assembly makes it possible to create a sensation which is born from this succession of different images. Here this process involves us in what is happening on the screen (being a witness continuously of everything that happens) but curiously I found that it prevented me at the same time from entering the heart Of the history. I floated around the characters and in these snow-covered forests but I was not there.
I think that's where the technical process became its own justification and no longer a way of telling the story. Each day of shooting, the whole team repeated (blocking) these very complicated plans and at the end of the day, they had about 1 h 30 to turn the shots or plans. That's probably what made the filming so hard and long. A system to be able to say that one kept his line, that one preserved an artistic integrity.
Unfortunately, when a method becomes its own raison d'être, it condemns the purpose of the company: tell a story, make us live emotions.<br/><br/>There are several moments when wow have it in his head, but the heart is not there. Because the story is very linear and does not carry major issues. For short, it comes down to: argument, left for dead, survival, revenge, end.
During each of these stages, few moral questions are raised. There are some, but they remain confined to the facts presented. We leave the wounded man to his fate: but he is still alive, yes, but the Indians are coming. That kind. For a good part of the movie, DiCaprio struggles like hell. This kind of experience forces the one who lives it to make profound changes, such as during a pilgrimage. Here (almost) nothing. The character advances, survives, fights but nothing lets feel that he really lives the situation. Probably because the process (yet): paste a wide-angle lens on the nose of the actors imposes a way of seeing things that does not necessarily stick with what we tell. The system becomes its own disadvantage and kills what has spawned it.
We are very far from Seul au Monde, with Tom Hanks, where we feel transformed over the course of his adventure. I was infinitely more excited when I saw The Gray with Liam Neeson. Same context, the Indians in less, the soul and more,
The physical commitment of the actor is admirable but that's not what makes you vibrate. There are indeed some effects of style (appearances of his wife and son - adoptive) but which are only dreams, visions. They show us what he lost.<br/><br/>Painful detail that must be taken into account before seeing this film: its masochism. The number of sufferings through which the protagonist goes is such that it made me think of Mel Gibson's Passion. 2 hours of whipping. Here it is a little that, more varied. Such a martyr is almost survivalist pornography.<br/><br/>All this for what? A story of revenge. History of fat and cruel colonists.
Iñárritu has offered us some sumptuous films like 21 Grams or Babel. But here, the shell is empty, because I do not see what can be removed. Even the best filmmakers can crash. Iñárritu often talks about the ego in his interviews. And in general, it is people who have trouble getting rid of it who talk about it the most. I think he got himself here.<br/><br/>This film has the form of a work of art but does not have the substance. Its shape is reminiscent of Terrence Malick's films except that it is sorely lacking in sensitivity. Malick (in The Tree of Life for example) shows a succession of moments of life, without necessarily linking them by a dramatic plot, but everything digs in us and throughout the film, we are brought into this state that makes the films so wonderful sometimes. Here we live viscerally events (which is already not bad) but nothing ""hollow"".
We could make a musical analogy: this film is a bit like the last albums of the Dream Theater group. Formerly the spearhead of progressive hard-rock inventive, sensitive and technically very high level. Today they play their own farce, flowing in an infinite complexity but without soul.<br/><br/>In view of the beauty of the film's photography, the intensity of the actors' play (should they overplay for that to be seen behind their hair and their disheveled beard? Or is it to compensate for the emptiness of the characters?) and its slow form, it is easy to believe in a great movie. Iñárritu probably believes it. To believe is not to be.
In any case, I did not find what makes me go sit in a dark room.
I bet in a little while, nobody will talk about this movie anymore. Only time reveals what's true and what's not."
"joecoby45","9","0","2","17 January 2018"," Amazing in every regard except for story.
","Its a shame that in a movie with such exceptional directing, acting, cinematography, music, and production design that the story couldn't have been amazing as well. That's not to say that the story here is necessarily bad it just feels a little thin especially for a 2 1/2 hour film. <br/><br/>There are definitely elements of a compelling story here, especially when it comes to the internal and external conflicts of the two main characters, Hugh Glass and John Fitzgerald (played marvelously by Leonardo DiCaprio in a career best performance and Tom Hardy) Hardy in particular is the most fleshed out and interesting character and has several monologues that let you get to know him as a person and its pretty riveting.<br/><br/>The movie clearly is not trying to be story driven, instead its more focused on imagery and themes and does both very well. In fact basically everything about this movie is spectacular hence the high rating, but if it had a better story this could easily be a 10/10 and one of the greatest films ever made. Still worth a watch at least once, especially if your interested in making films yourself someday because their is plenty of mastery here both behind and in front of the camera. <br/><br/>To talk a little more in detail about the acting its superb all around. I'm not always the biggest fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, in fact I think he has given many overrated/underwhelming performances, but he knocks it out of the park here with a subtle and nuanced performance. DiCaprio shows a ton of emotion here despite not having very many lines which is not something I would have thought was in his ability's but I was proven wrong here. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy is exceptional as the main antagonist of the film. He does a good job making his character not feel evil necessarily, but like an ordinary man who's trying to survive and painfully unfeeling towards his fellow man due to his past. Its Hardy's best work since Bronson. <br/><br/>Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson are also both totally believable in supporting roles as well."

","Hugh Glass is working as a guide for a group of trappers when they are ambushed by a group of native Arikara who are looking for their chief's kidnapped daughter. The surviving trappers along with Glass and his son escape down river but not long afterwards Glass is horrifically mauled by a bear. He manages to kill it but only just survives. While the main party go ahead to get help Glass is left with his son and two of the trappers. Fitzgerald, the elder trapper thinks they should leave him despite being paid a bonus. When he thinks they are alone he tries to smother Glass but is stopped by his son who he then murders. Glass is then left all alone in the wilderness and isn't expected to last more than a few hours however he does survive and struggles back to health and starts to make his way back to Fort Kiowa. He will have a struggle to find anything to eat and must cross hostile territory to get there; it will test him to the limit of his endurance. Meanwhile Fitzgerald has made it back to Fort Kiowa and has told everybody he did everything he could to save Glass; when Glass finally gets there he will want his revenge.<br/><br/>Like so many stories 'based on real events' a little bit of reading suggests quite a few liberties have been taken with the actual facts that doesn't matter too much though as this is still a fine story. The opening ambush is exciting and quickly got me gripped. The story got even more tense afterwards. The bear attack was brilliantly shot in a way that made it look very real and very brutal. Once he is alone in the wilderness the film perfectly captures the bleakness of terrain; you can almost feel the cold as Glass struggles through snow, icy water and even shelters inside the remains of a dead horse. The cast does a fine job; it isn't surprising that Leonardo DiCaprio earned an Oscar for this he did a great job as Glass and certainly suffered for his art in the freezing conditions. The rest of the cast are impressive too; especially Tom Hardy, who plays the villainous Fitzgerald. At two and a half hours this certainly isn't a short film but at no time did I find myself looking at the clock. Overall I'd certainly recommend it although some of the more violent scenes might bother some viewers."

","I'm probably going to get some flak for the rating I am giving The Revenant, but I didn't think it was as good as everyone said it was. Stick around and see why.<br/><br/>Synopsis: While exploring the uncharted wilderness in 1823, legendary frontiersman Hugh Glass sustains injuries from a brutal bear attack. When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home while avoiding natives on their own hunt. Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry terrain to track down John Fitzgerald, the former confidant who betrayed and abandoned him. Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy Director: Alejandro G. Inarritu<br/><br/>Okay, if anyone knows the real story of this movie is based off of, then you know that Hugh Glass did not exact his revenge on the men who left him for dead. First thing, it wasn't the dead of winter when he was mauled, it was actually in the middle of the summer. His son wasn't killed by anyone, his son actually lived a full life. These are just two of the many things that have been changed. As I do understand why the film makers took the liberties with the story, I don't think they needed to take it that far. And truthfully, that is the main reason I gave the movie a 7.<br/><br/>The reason I gave it a 7 is because of how slow paced the movie was. Although it added to the tone of the movie, it just played out too long. The movie was only two and a half hours long, but until the last thirty minutes it felt like four hours. Adding that I constantly had to keep lowering and raising my volume didn't help.<br/><br/>There are a lot of good things though. Even though I didn't like the changes they did make to the story, I still love this story. I wish they would have kept it the real ending where Glass forgave the two men who left him. But, the story is still a tale of survival. The man had to go through a lot to walk up to the men and say what he had to say.<br/><br/>Alejandro is a great director. I absolutely love his movies, especially Babel and Biutiful. This is probably one of his not so good movies, but still better than most of his movies. Can't wait to see what he has next.<br/><br/>Do I think Leo deserved the Oscar for this movie? No I don't. Tom on the other hand should have won. He stole the show, once again. I honestly think the Academy gave Leo the award for all the years they passed him up. He did a decent job in this movie, but he didn't do anything to extreme like he has done in movies like Wolf of Wall Street, The Aviator, Gangs of New York, or The Departed. Geez, I never realized he deserved the Oscar for movies he did with Scorsese<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Even though I don't like the idea of them changing the story quite a bit I do believe this movie is a watchable movie, hands down. <br/><br/>Rating: 7 out of 10"

","Icy water trickles gently over the rocks. All is quiet. As the camera tilts up and pans to the right, the barrel of a gun creeps out from behind a tree. Two armed hunters are now visible, moving with caution over the steady flow of the stream.<br/><br/>A nearby gunshot shatters the calm. The men stop. Another shot.<br/><br/>Screams of terror and fury fill the air as the two men return to their hunting party. Arikara Indians gallop around the camp of fur trappers. Their arrows whiz past the two men, piercing the skulls of others around them.<br/><br/>A small group of survivors flees the Arikara. Reaching a boat offshore, the remaining trappers drift down the Missouri River, battered and defeated, carrying only a fraction of the beaver furs they'd trapped over the past few months.<br/><br/>This opening scene from ""The Revenant"" captures the brutality exhibited in the true story of its protagonist Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), a legendary frontiersman and fur trapper in the 1820s.<br/><br/>Following the slaughtering of trappers at the beginning of the film, Glass guides the surviving group back to its outpost, Fort Kiowa. As Glass is scouting ahead he is attacked by a grizzly bear and mauled to the edge of death.<br/><br/>Finding Glass underneath the dead beast, captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) leaves him in the care of his half-native son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) and John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), as it seems that Glass will succumb to his wounds.<br/><br/>After a failed attempt to smother Glass, Fitzgerald kills Hawk, buries Glass alive and deceives Bridger about his actions as they press on toward Fort Kiowa. Determined to find Fitzgerald, Glass uses his wit and skill to survive and sets out on a 200-mile path of vengeance across the Northern Plains of America, and you are with him every step of the way.<br/><br/>You squirm in your seat as Glass cauterizes his own wounds. You taste the blood and scales of the raw fish as Glass rips it open with his teeth. You lose your appetite for that next handful of popcorn as Glass guts a horse and uses its carcass as a sleeping bag. <br/><br/>The authenticity of ""The Revenant"" is not only the product of DiCaprio's dedication, but also of the entire cast and crew. Director Alejandro G. Inarritu was unwavering about filming in strictly natural light, which gave the cast and crew a mere 90 minutes of shooting time each day.<br/><br/>Inarritu and his team journeyed for hours in minus 25 degree weather to locations in the Canadian and Argentinian mountains. The production ran five months over schedule and $35 million over budget, but the hell that the cast and crew endured was not in vain.<br/><br/>The cinematography is masterful. The close ups are so close at times that DiCaprio's breath fogs up the lens, further intensifying the emotional impact of his performance. The landscape choices and use of all natural light result in breathtaking shots such as one scene when Fitzgerald and Bridger are keeping warm by the fire. As darkness falls, sparks dance upward off of the flames; the camera angle shows them gently float toward the heavens and vanish into the twinkling of the night sky.<br/><br/>""The Revenant"" is nominated for 12 Academy Awards, the most at this year's ceremony. Its direction is nearly flawless, its performances, unsettling. But above all, Inarritu paints a captivating portrait of human suffering and the incredible resiliency of a man with a heart of vengeance."

","The visual is breathtaking and so most of my rating has gone on that aspect of the film. I felt the length of the film was too long for such a straightforward story-line. The acting was faultless, the setting gloomy but stunning and the period of history compelling but just far too long."
"pniemeyer-47222","7","0","2","4 April 2017"," Technically accomplished, but left me a bit cold.
","This is really more of a 6.5 out of 10, but maybe I'm just splitting hairs. The cinematography is amazing to the point of being distracting. It's as if Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu, upon realizing that we have the means to shoot a scene of Leonardo Dicaprio being mauled by a bear in extended, agonizing close-up, decided that every scene should be shot in that way. Maybe I'm overthinking things, but that ended up taking me out of the action. The bear is obviously CG, and since we know that director Innaritu and cinematographer Emmaneul Lubezki are using some digital trickery to make the whole thing appear to be one seamless shot, what's the point? I almost think that scene would have been more effective had it consisted of separate shots, so that a real bear could be employed in long shots, with cuts to a close-up of an animatronic paw crushing Leo or something like that.<br/><br/>I should probably talk about the plot now. The story concerns a couple of fur trappers on the Western frontier in the 19th century, who are set upon by violent Natives and have to turn back. When one of them (Leonardo Dicaprio, resorting to masochistic extremes in order to win that Oscar) has a heated debate with a grizzly over which of them deserves to continue breathing, the group leaves him for dead. Tom Hardy plays another member of the trapper group, and he, rather than the bear, is the true villain of the piece. I won't give away what he does, suffice to say that if it weren't for his performance, my rating would be at least two stars lower.<br/><br/>This isn't a bad movie. I know I'm being snarky, but it really isn't. That said, I liked Innaritu more when his head wasn't quite so far up his own ass. ""Babel"" might overreach somewhat, but it has a lot more to say than this bloated film. The scenes with Leo forced to fend for himself in the wilderness verge on misery porn. There is something inherently thrilling about watching people survive on limited resources (see ""Castaway"" for a superior example of this).<br/><br/>This is the kind of film where I can admire certain parts more than I can say I like the whole. Those tracking shots are impressing, sure. There are some fantasy/dream sequences that are well-shot, but that I can't make head or tail of. The sheer physical torment that Dicaprio must have put himself through for this role is admirable, but then again, he was so much more fun in ""The Departed"". I just wish the film weren't so dead-set on being great that it sometimes forgets to be good."

","This movie was so hyped but ended up rather boring. For most of the movie, nothing happens at all. It could have been 1-hour long and we wouldn't miss a thing.<br/><br/>Di Caprio's performance was OK, but in my opinion he had many better movies, including Inception, Departed, Wolf of Wall Street...

","Revenant, someone who has come back basically from the dead. This applies to many people in life that make a dramatic return when not being on the ""scene"" for a long period of time, as well as an emergence. A revenant is present in the movie business as well. Many actors dream of winning the coveted Academy Award. Despite being nominated for the award four times previously, Leonardo DiCaprio could never win one despite his most famous works. Some of those on the list include Titanic, Shutter Island, The Wolf of Wall Street, Django Unchained, Catch Me If You Can, The Great Gatsby, Inception, and even Romeo + Juliet. Nevertheless, he was able to achieve what many actors dream of, which is to capture an Academy Award. This would be his first, and for a movie made in 2015, which portrayed him in a whole different role than what he usually plays. This movie that is so hyped up is called ""The Revenant."" This is the tale of courage against the odds of nature, and the determination and grit that one gets from within. One thing to note, as well, is that this movie was based on a true story of an American frontiersman. There were many good movies worth noting in 2015, but none could compared to this one. Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, ""The Revenant"" is a must watch even though it was made it 2015 due to the awesome plot, the unbelievable acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, and the great cinematography showing the beautiful landscape of Argentina and Canada.<br/><br/>The tale that Alejandro González Iñárritu got the attention of many audiences with the story of Hugh Glass. Surprisingly this is based on a true story that happened many, many years ago. The story may seem a bit cheesy with the fact that the protagonist overcomes many obstacles within nature. It is also a story of revenge, and Iñárritu reshapes the famed Hugh Glass to a character that everyone can get behind and support, sort of like Rudy. This movie also shows survival, which is captured as Glass does and many others did some actions that shows what one must do to survive in the wilderness. Iñárritu draws people to this story, and it hits people on an emotional level, which separates this movie from the competition.<br/><br/>An actor as eloquent in his craft as Leonardo DiCaprio should be rewarded for nailing a role that was unlike others. The usual characters that DiCaprio portrays is the handsome stud, most of the time having a decent amount of money, that all the girls fall in love with and the guys are jealous of. This is true for his films like Romeo + Juliet, The Wolf of Wall Street, The Great Gatsby, Titanic, and Inception. In The Revenant, DiCaprio plays a scruffy, unattractive, wild frontiersman that at first glance looks nothing like the DiCaprio we all know. Playing this character also meant that doing some gross, gnarly stuff that a person would never imagine DiCaprio doing. Only a really strong actor can play roles that break their usual role norms, and this is what DiCaprio does to make The Revenant one of the best movies.<br/><br/>Earth is such a beautiful place with many wonders all over, and Iñárritu captures them in South America and Canada. It is very noteworthy that the conditions in which the shots were filmed was inhospitable especially the parts in Canada. The movie was about a frontiersman and his survival in the wilderness, and the rough conditions were caught nicely. However, the beauty of the landscape was shown despite all the snow and mist. The last scenes that were shot in Argentina had to be the best I've seen in a while. Even though this was towards the end and not the main location like how Canada was, the landscape and the terrain that they filmed at were jaw droppingly good. Alejandro González Iñárritu captured both the beauty and the dark side of Mother Nature elegantly in this masterpiece that leaves audiences in awe.<br/><br/>If you have never watched this movie, you must. It has aspects that almost everyone can enjoy whether you are intrigued by cinematography, an award-winning actor, or a compelling story."

I kept thinking to myself, ""this looks like a Terrance Malick film"", which has everything to do with Lubezki's work with Malick on the acclaimed 'The Tree of Life' and the grossly overlooked 'The New World', which remains my favorite historical love story to date. A warning to those squeamish towards violence, 'The Revenant' is brutal; placing the audience in the heart of the battle to the point where you can smell the death and decay. By contrast, I've never seen more breathtaking panoramic shots of nature on the silver screen.

"Floated2","7","0","1","22 February 2017"," Visually an Experience
","The Revenant is based in part on the exploits of Hugh Glass where we see Leonardo DiCaprio as Glass, a Scots-American soldier in the early 19th century. Glass has son (Forrest Goodluck) by an absent native woman, and something about this, or his basic authority, triggers the bitter resentment of fellow hunting party member John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). Quickly within several key moments of the film, wee see that Glass is suddenly mauled by a bear, and Fitzgerald wants to leave him behind. Later another member of the hunter's team Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) is somehow convinced to go along with that, although he later claims not to have understood Fitzgerald, and we believe him.<br/><br/>The Renevant besides it's well visuals and great acting from the leads DiCaprio and Hardy, the films comes off rather boring and not as exciting or entertaining as a whole, as it is being praise for. Yes, the acting makes the film passable and the cinematography is well done, with great shots of the outside. Though in it's story arc, the film does not capitalize as it should. There were not many twists or turns which keeps the audience prepared and waiting for, unfortunately. Mainly due to the film's long running time (two hours 36 minutes), at certain points it becomes dull and almost predictable. The ending is quite well done, as expected."

","Personally i was aware what to expect going to the movies. Alejandro Iñárritu and Leonardo Di Caprio. The director who made some cinematic history with ""Birdman"" (besides the German one-take-movie Victoria""). On his side everybody's darling and environmentalist (Thank you for that!) Leo. I saw the teaser trailer and i was convinced: this will be big!<br/><br/>The pictures: raw, visually stunning. The camera: supports calm, breathing and oppressive moments; follows impressive perspectives, for example an American Indian on his horse riding straight into a battle. The music: disturbing and overwhelming, cautious and imposing.<br/><br/>Somewhere i heard, some find the film too brutal, too long, or say the story is too simple.<br/><br/>I answer you this:<br/><br/>The raw violence in this case is a great tool to show the suffer and the anger of the characters. The length of the movie is just fitting. It takes just as much time as it needs to lead you into a world of pain and the demand of vengeance. A desire which suppresses the hurt of loss, drives a man's ungovernable will to live, who believes that revenge is everything he has left.<br/><br/>More to the simple"" story: In beautiful, powerful and wordless scenes - the memories of our protagonist - lies a past soaked by identity and love, between treason and humanity. It's up to the audience to fill the gaps of Glass' past, it demands your full attention and emotions.<br/><br/>Last but not least: The message, free to go. A confessing democratic will maybe question the proved judiciary seeing the loner with his vigilante justice. And someone who considers vengeance the same as punishment may will recognize that even revenge won't bring back any losses.<br/><br/>So my advice is, take some time to watch this piece of art! Thanks!<br/><br/>Need to mention - trivia: Leo ate real bison liver to be as much authentic as he can for his performance and the movie. The bear sequence is a cinematic highlight although in this age of CGI overloaded movies."

","Director Alejandro González Iñárritu, known most recently for directing ""Birdman,"" has created a visually stunning movie of survival and revenge. It's clearly the fruit of much labor on behalf of the director and all the actors. It shows and works in the movie. Unfortunately the audience has to labor as well through a lot of slow scenes, some of which are probably unnecessary.<br/><br/>The two main roles are played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy. Their characters are rough, gritty, and at times difficult to watch. There are some scenes in this film that made even me feel like hiding my eyes. Is this any surprise since this movie is about frontiersmen surviving in sub zero temperatures. There are Indians, hatchets, musket type rifles, buffalo, and bears. Aside: This film contains the most frightening bear maul I've ever seen on film. Even Paul Bunyan would recoil.<br/><br/>Short synopsis: Hugh Glass is a frontiersman alongside Jon Fitzgerald and a group of rough ones. They are making their way through the snowy forest terrain. Through a course of events and a bear mauling of Hugh, the story becomes one of survival. Hugh is determined to survive the attack and take revenge on those who abandoned him for dead.<br/><br/>My conclusions: There is a signature drum soundtrack but not as extensive as the one in ""Birdman."" The camera pans and zooms are also signature of Iñárritu. It's a long sit but I can say that fans of ""Birdman"" and westerns about revenge will probably really enjoy this movie. The cinematography is incredible. My wife and I actually felt cold in some of the scenes even though we had a raging fire going with the heater on. Movie lovers and reviewers especially will enjoy this movie. I foresee Oscar nods. It's one of the best of 2015 for sure. I did find it overly long and belabored at times though and that made it lose a star with me."

The film comes from director Alejandro Iñárritu, who delivered one of my personal favorite films in 2014 with BIRDMAN. It's (very) loosely based on the true tale of fur-trapper Hugh Glass with DiCaprio in the main role. The film is set in the early nineteenth century on the American frontier where Glass and his half-Pawnee son are acting as guides for a team of trappers when they're attacked by a raiding party of Arikara warriors. With many of their men dead and the Arikara on their trail, the men are forced to hike through the wilderness to the closest fort and Glass is the man to get them there. Unfortunately he's attacked by a grizzly bear and left mangled, so the team decides it best to leave a couple of men behind to tend to the fatally injured Glass while they continue on. Once Glass succumbs to his wounds, the men are instructed to give him a proper burial and start for the fort themselves. One of the men (Hardy) who volunteers to remain behind (there was a cash bonus in it for him, you see) gets a little impatient and opts to bury Glass prematurely, killing Glass's son in the process when he interferes. Helplessly witnessing the events, Glass summons his remaining strength to go after the man who murdered his son and sets off on an impossible quest across the freezing wilderness, injured and alone.<br/><br/>THE REVENANT is a sort of film experience. The plot is very simple: a quest for revenge. There aren't exactly a lot of twists and turns to the story; it's very straightforward. It's the experience of watching Glass undergo just an insane amount of trials and tribulations to accomplish his goal that I find so mesmerizing. It is two and a half hours of DiCaprio dragging his dying, mutilated Glass through freezing temperatures while scrounging for heat and food with an angry Arikara war party on his tail. I really want to know how much of this movie was done for real because DiCaprio does some pretty gnarly things for this role. I believe I'd read somewhere that he'd really chowed on some raw fish, scales and all, for the scene where he fishes one out of the river and maybe even the hunk o' bison he very visibly gags down later on. Butwhat about that horse scene? I know Iñárritu was dedicated to capturing realism in the struggle, and that horse looked real enough. I don't know. If it was special effects, congratulations to the SFX crew that put that together because, wow, you could've fooled me. Leonardo DiCaprio must've really wanted that Oscar because, regardless of what's real and what's SFX, he went through some rough times filming this movie. Iñárritu is one of the most artistic modern filmmakers I'm aware of and I'm sure the production was rough on all parties involved to get it right. But it all serves a purpose, as THE REVENANT is one of the most beautiful (and grueling) films you'll find from 2015, a year when big budget CG blockbusters dominated the market. Most visually remarkable films nowadays spend countless hours in front of a green screen; meanwhile, Iñárritu is out in the wilderness using natural light to present an amazing tale of survival.<br/><br/>Well, survival and revenge. Glass isn't just dragging himself back to civilization because he refuses to die in a half-finished hole in the ground. He's hunting the man who murdered his son, and that man is Tom Hardy. Hardy, who maybe should've won that Oscar himself for best supporting actor here, gets the far more interesting character. His man, John Fitzgerald, is at a bad point in his life. All he's got going for himself is the money he stands to make on this fur-trapping expedition and the Arikara threw a wrench into that plan. All he wants is to get the furs back to the fort and get his paycheck and Glass, unlucky as he may have been with that bear attack, is jeopardizing all of it. His motivations are clear though he's far from sympathetic. He's racist toward the natives (and therefore butts heads with Glass's half-Indian son long before their final confrontation) and only worried about his own needs. Once you become accustomed to his mush-mouthed dialogue delivery Hardy steals the show with his performance and I started finding myself more interested in the movie when it cut away from Glass's struggles to check in on Fitzgerald and his scheme. DiCaprio is great in the movie but, no matter what movie or role, I always look at him and see DiCaprio; Hardy is the total opposite, disappearing into whatever role he's performing. THE REVENANT acts as a solid comparison between the two critically-lauded actors and gives me further appreciation for Hardy and his talent. Between the two of them and Iñárritu's filmmaking prowess, THE REVENANT comes highly recommended from me. It can feel its length at times but even when the pace slows there's always something incredible just around the corner to recapture your interest. Moreover, you get a good sense for the blood, sweat, and tears that went into making the film from the entire cast and crew. Give it a watch."

","""The Revenant"" is like necessary evil; it is so easy to admire but very difficult to love. It resides in a mundane world notwithstanding being very beautiful to look at. Perhaps that is the vision of director Alejandro G. Iñárritu – to construct a picture that is formidable in its filmmaking and at the same time paints Hugh Glass's (Leonardo DiCaprio) steadfastness and his legendary journey for survival. Either way, I still regard his previous work which is ""Birdman"" to be the superior movie overall.<br/><br/>It was built on a very simple tale – a son is being killed, and the protagonist goes all-out to hunt down the criminal. Although the movie has 'revenge' elements in it, it is best interpreted as a survival-drama instead of a revenge-drama picture. DiCaprio delivered a performance which led to his first Oscar win while Tom Hardy's act as the movie's villain Fitzgerald was just astonishing. Tom Hardy is no doubt one of the best actors working in Hollywood today where we've seen him in lots of movies and had been in all sorts of characters. Will Poulter was great too, but I can't say the same for Domhall Gleeson's performance. The film's cinematography led by Emmanuel Lubezki is eye-popping, despite being shot on digital instead of film.<br/><br/>It is still as solid as it tried to be. Performances are great, cinematography is great, although DiCaprio's historic triumph will overshadow the movie's other achievements. I can understand the film's difficulty in entering the top 5% of critics' choice last year. This ugly-pretty picture adopted a serious tone that seemed to be too joyless. ""The Revenant"" is clearly not for the masses. The rudiments of its ideas are to sculpt an artistic, expressive art, but primarily not to entertain. The accolades that had gotten the film's great success is surely, I guessed now, is well-deserved.<br/><br/>(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)"

","An inadequate script is superbly executed in The Revenant, turning half a movie's worth of material into an exhausting, if occasionally transcendent, trek that congratulates the viewer for having survived its icy blasts of testosterone.<br/><br/>Based in part on the exploits of Hugh Glass—or at least on several books about him—the two-and-a-half-hour film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Glass, a Scots-American trapper in the early 19th century. (He was called Zach Bass when Richard Harris played the same character in 1971's Man in the Wilderness.) Slogging through the chilly Rockies, our guy is scouting for a fur-swapping outfit loosely held together by a quasi-officer played by Domhnall Gleeson. Glass has an almost-grown son (Forrest Goodluck) by an absent native woman, and something about this, or his basic authority, triggers the bitter resentment of fellow hunting party member John Fitzgerald, played by Tom Hardy, with an accent so thick-tongued I still have no idea what he said about anything.<br/><br/>Far from the main party, Glass is suddenly mauled by a bear in the most stomach-churning scene of the season, and Fitzgerald wants to leave him behind. The much younger Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) is somehow convinced to go along with that, although he later claims not to have understood Fitzgerald, and we believe him. The gravely wounded scout then suffers one depredation after another in his quest to return to civilization, and of course to wreak revenge on the dudes who deserted him.<br/><br/>In real life, Glass never saw Fitzgerald again, and Bridger went on to become a famous explorer. But director Alejandro G. Iñárritu, having survived his bout of urban satire with Birdman, isn't content to let nature inflict its wintry drama on our hero's body. Sure, Leonardo's character has to cut open a horse and crawl inside it to survive a snowstorm, but he also needs multiple foes of the human kind. That's a shame, because the real drama here is in the landscapes captured by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki—mostly in Alberta, then Argentina, when they ran out of snow. The movie labours hard to capture the humbling spirituality of The Tree of Life and other Terrence Malick films, but its sometimes astounding beauty remains surprisingly shallow."
"tel-34508","9","0","1","12 December 2016"," A beautifully constructed yet slightly imperfect achievement!
","I find a large amount of awe when it comes to the career of Leonardo DiCaprio. I cannot think of a film hr has been in which could be considered terrible. He has consistently proved that his ability to act is stellar whatever he may be. Whether that be a corrupted stockbroker, a man on the run from the FBI or even an undercover cop, Leo can surely do an unprecedented amount of good! Today, I want to focus on one of his latest works. In which he plays folk legend Hugh Glass; who has a taste for revenge. I'm talking about his Academy Award role in ""The Revenant"". This masterfully constructed film comes from 3-time Oscar winner Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who most people will know him for his work on Birdman (Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) and Babel. His film the previous year stole 4 of the big awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Writing (all of which I believe should have gone to Grand Budapest Hotel but that is beside the point. I want to start with my dislikes, because it's always best to get the negatives out of the way in order to have the good stuff in the end. OK, even as a casual watcher when I watched it for the 4th time, I began to see some continuity issues, believe me, these are tiny issues but they are things I have picked up on since I have begun studying film. But for a person who only watched to enjoy, then this will go completely unnoticed. I also find some scenes to be completely unnecessary, although I won't go into what those scenes are, if you have watched it or plan to watch it, then you will understand the scenes I'm talking about. Now, let's get into the good stuff, probably the best part about this film is the use of lighting. Every single shot has been created with natural lighting, which gives the film a beautifully striking yet slightly dull colour pallet. Bright whites, dark blues/purples and thick blacks give the film a visually striking and gorgeous look. It also doesn't hurt that the cinematography is stunning as well. Every shot is beautiful and has been thought about in great detail, the open plains, deep forests and soaring mountain ranges of North America truly are a spectacle. And this all comes from Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki, who is also known for his work on both Birdman as well as Children of men. Let's take a look at performances. I cannot start to talk about the performances in The Revenant without mentioning my thoughts on 2015's Best Actor winner. I personally believe that year, Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Dalton Trumbo blew the competition away. Despite my thoughts on who I believe should have won, I still think Leo is spectacular in this film, Leo has most definitely set the bat for acing in this type of film genre. A leading actor cannot be amazing without an excellent supporting actor, and Tom Hardy secures that place masterfully. Once again, I did not agree with Mark Rylance Oscar steal in 2015, despite it not being an awful performance. Mark may have taken the award, but Tom deserved it even more than he did, his character is distasteful and sinister, and Tom captures this essence beautifully; it truly is an unforgettable performance. I would overall give this film a 9/10, it is by no means perfect, but what is here is so interesting and engaging, the flaws die down in the grand scheme of the overall film."

","The Revenant is one of my favorite movies of all time. It follows the story of Hugh Glass, a man who was betrayed by a man he trusted, and will stop at nothing to track him down. The plot is pretty simple, yes. But that doesn't mean the movie is bad. DiCaprio put his heart and soul into this movie. Despite saying almost nothing throughout the movie, you always know how he's feeling. His face always tells you everything you need to know. Not just any actor can do that. Tom Hardy also does a great job with his character. The movie is beautiful. It was filmed pretty much all on location, with only natural lighting. People complain about the amount of still shots and shots of nature, but I though it did a nice job of slowing the pace, showing where the character was, and showing you just how beautiful nature is. The whole movie builds up to the ending, and you will not be let down. When the movie ended, no one left the theater until the credits were over. My friend and I didn't even speak until we after the 45 minute ride home. We were too amazed with what we had just seen. Please, please, PLEASE go see this film.

","""The Revenant"" is based on a true story of a fur trader who is left behind for dead by his fellow frontiersman after being attacked by a grizzly bear, a great plot to make a film from. I read some bad reviews of this film and I do not see why so many people are bashing it. I'm not saying this film is one of my all-time favorites but it is a good film. Some parts probably went kind of slow and monotonous but that still didn't take away from how good this film is. The acting was good and Leonardo DiCaprio did deserve an Oscar for his role in this film. The Cinematography was great! I did have to get use to the wide angle shots that were in this film but it didn't take me long to warm up to it. One good thing about this film was that the writers and director did not make this film mainly about Leonardo DiCaprio's character (Hugh Glass) getting revenge on his fellow frontiersman but made it mostly about Hugh Glass' (Leonardo DiCaprio) survival in the snowy woods after a bear attack. This is probably why so many people gave this film a bad review. Don't go into this film expecting Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) to be a big macho man slaughtering everything in sight just to get revenge on his fellow frontiersman because that is not what it's really about. It's an intense film about him trying to survive."
"happy_hangman","7","0","2","17 October 2016"," Gruelling
","'The Revenant' is visually stunning. Looks fantastic, and both landscape and action scenes are handled with genuinely cinematic flair. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the narrative doesn't do anything or go anywhere unexpected. Our relentless revenger, Mr DiCaprio, starts off gnarled and surly, and ends the same way. Similarly, Tom Hardy's villain is clearly an irredeemable villain from his first grumblesome grunt. The nearest we get to character development comes through the portrayal of the young Captain in charge of the trapping exhibition - and his fate, too, is telegraphed. <br/><br/>Leo is good, as is Hardy, but they are caricatures - I've seen both give many much more complex and nuanced performances, and don't really see why THIS revenger-greatest-hits should get them so many gong nominations. It's a commonplace revenge flick with Art-house sensibilities."
"sbstevenson-02099","10","0","2","14 October 2016"," Just absolutely beautiful
","First things first, this film is amazing, but it shouldn't have been the one Leo got his first Oscar for. However, it's quite fitting that it was, considering Leo's involvement with conservation and climate change. The film has one of the most intense opening scenes I have ever watched, and ever will. The basic premise of the film is a story about one mans quest for some brutal and bloody revenge after being left for dead. The acting is perfect for the genre of film that it is, the soundtrack fits phenomenally well with the film and the scenery and camera work is just breath taking. A lot of people have marked this movie down as being a film that spends too much time looking at the background, and yes it does have a lot of wide shots and scenery moments, but these just add to the beauty of the film and put across how beautiful parts of the world can be. As a student of Conservation and Wildlife this film just ticked every single box for me. The Revenant is definitely a film that should be remembered. As for who should watch it, it won't be everyone's cup of tea. Due to the setting and the era it takes place in, there are a lot of controversial issues touched upon and it is very gory and bloody at points. The film is rated 15, and you should take that into consideration, as well as the fact that its an absolutely stunning film about revenge, betrayal and the natural world."
"georgidianov","8","0","2","10 October 2016"," DiCaprio's un-bear-able performance in The Revenant should not win award
","Forty actors and actresses have received two or more Academy Awards. Only six of them have received three or more, with Katharine Hepburn, the recipient of four best actress Oscars, top of the table. Walter Andrew Brennan was the first to receive three or more Academy Awards in 1940. He was followed by Hepburn in 1969, Ingrid Bergman in 1974, Jack Nicholson in 1997, Meryl Streep in 2011, and by Daniel Day-Lewis four years ago. An all-time cinematographic injustice was resolved in 2016, when we could finally listen ""and the Oscar goes toLeonardo DiCaprio"" for the first time. It is just a shame that it is not for his best performance in a movie. <br/><br/>The American actor and producer Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio, was once nominated for Best Picture (as a producer) for ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and for his acting roles in five occasions. But the Academy Awards gave him the 24-carat-gold little statuette for a Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role because of all his attempts rather than his quality of acting. Can someone kindly explain what kind of acting this role involved? His character barely speaks Pawnee and Arikara languages in the movie, spending the whole 156 minutes crawling, falling over a cliff, yelling, sleeping, pillaging, riding a horse, making fire, being carried around picturesque landscapes and being attacked by a bear. This is not the way to win an Oscar just because one has never won it before. People who support him for this movie's roles should look up into perspective because they are wrong and they do not have the ability for sharp critics. Smart movie connoisseurs would prefer to give the Oscar to the fake bear rather than to the Titanic star who is a complete passenger in this film. It does not matter how tough the production or shooting schedule was. An Oscar should not be given via attrition of recent years, nor because he has been overlooked for past performances. If there were awards given out for going through the most hardship while making a movie, surely DiCaprio would be the winner. Though he sleeps in a dead horse and grows a beard in The Revenant, cinema-goers cannot really believe in Hugh Glass, the main character he tries to portray. Leo was better in Shutter Island, Catch me if you can or Django Unchained for example – they all showed the best of Leo. <br/><br/>DiCaprio(named Leo because his pregnant mother was looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in an Italian museum when he first kicked) was handpicked by Robert De Niro from 400 young actors for his breakthrough role in ""This Boy's Life"" (1993). One year later, at the age of 20, he was first nominated for an Oscar for his first best supporting actor role for ""What's eating Gilbert Grape"" (1994). He was nominated again for The Aviator (2004), Blood Diamond (2007) and The Wolf of Wall Street (2014), but failed to secure the coveted golden statue. What is more, last year everyone thought that the 41-year-old star was going to win the Oscar when Matthew McConaughey took home the Best Actor award for his appearance in ""Dallas Buyers Club"". <br/><br/>Although many actors' dreams will come true this year when they get their own Oscar Academy Award, there is a sizeable list of actors and actresses, who have never won an Oscar for best Actor or Actress prize. An analysis by FiveThirtyEight, a website that focuses on opinion poll analysis, looked at the 2016's Oscars Predictions and applied its mathematical models to produce internal predictions, guessing four out of six categories correctly. The website also compiled a list of contemporary actors who have been nominated for more than three times for acting awards and had never won, and rated them in terms of who deserved to win the most for the first time. They found that Matt Damon (nominated this year for ""The Martian"") is the actor who most deserves to win whereas Leo was twenty-second on the list. But is it the fact of winning an Oscar always the best thing for an actor's career and creativity? Maybe not winning might spur actors on to greater work. For example, Paul Newman won his Oscar at the age of 62 on his eighth go. Alfred Hitchcock never won an Oscar over a whole career of sparkling masterpieces. Peter O'Toole was nominated eight times and only ever picked up an honorary award <br/><br/>For the time being, DiCaprio has been delivering astonishing performances for over 20 years without having won an Oscar. There is no sign that he plans on stopping soon. If cinema-goers have deduced something from Kate Winslet and Julianne Moore's recent Oscar wins, it is that sometimes it just takes multiple nominations before you get the gold. Nonetheless, Leonardo DiCaprio should not be remembered as Oscar winner because of this movie. It does not represent his real acting potential as a leading man and it will not be as memorable as it was going to be if he was given the Oscar for one of his previous nominations. In fact, the lack of an Oscar could push him to take on more challenging roles and never ever seen projects."

","In discussions of Alejandro Inarritu's movie The Revenant, some will readily argue that the entirety of the film is a compilation of Leonardo DiCaprio on all fours gasping for air. Where this argument typically ends, however, is on the topic of a much more introspective character study of the main character. Hugh Glass was a man who was believed dead, but was ""resurrected"" in order to strike his son's murderer with a cold vengeance. This film is is one of the greatest of the year, and masterfully allows the characters to speak more emotions than words. Through this impeccable acting performance, we are able to feel the savagery radiating off the characters and the raw hatred that can consume us as humans. The film portrays one man hunting another relentlessly for no reason other than revenge. The simple plot allows for more complex themes to be explored expertly. In a strangely beautiful portrayal of persistence, Glass is willing to crawl across the Arctic to annihilate his foe. We experience the passionate hatred of the man and learn that at the core of every human, we are capable of doing unthinkable things through such negative emotions. While watching this production, it is hard to not wonder if love is truly stronger than hatred. The Revenant, directed by Alejandro Inarritu, was revealing in the sense that it proves that humans are savages at their core."

","If you had included this sort of unique technical execution in a movie that had a better story, you would have had an amazing movie. I don't think anyone would deny that the camera-work and sound mixing and such were top notch in this movie, even down to the shots that served only the purpose of passing time. But the general consensus seems to be that people had a hard time staying interested because of the story. In some ways, the tale of survival is pretty incredible, definitely much better than most movies based on true events. But it did drag on longer than it probably needed to.<br/><br/>The characters were deeper than I had expected, but not enough to make me fully invested in them. Tom Hardy's character would have been more despicable if he'd had more of a motive for leaving Hugh Glass. It seemed like he just got annoyed with the inconvenience of his job, which is perfectly normal for the average person, but it's not interesting to have a villain who just does bad things because he feels like it. I had similar problems with Hugh Glass. He's driven by revenge and the will to survive, but the goal never has any progression. Realistically, I suppose it doesn't need to because he has a hard enough time just trying to meet his basic needs. The only thing that really kept me interested was wanting to see how the inevitable confrontation between Glass and John Fitzgerald would turn out. There are pretty standard techniques used to give us emotional access to the characters. These failed to hold my attention, probably because I don't have any experience with betrayal or the loss of a loved one at the level that Hugh Glass does. Honestly, it was easier to relate to the Hawk's friend who travels with Fitzgerald because he's so conflicted. This doesn't reflect poorly on the writing or acting, but I feel like it's worth noting.<br/><br/>Anyone who wants to go into production should watch this movie and study the opening sequence. The camera-work will blow you away, especially since it was shot live and not computer generated. So this is a must for all budding DP's and directors (and even professionals). For those interested in writing, this provides some good examples of how to use a location as a character. The acting won't blow you away, but it seems like everyone took a lot of pride in their role and gave it the best performance they could. Even DiCaprio's performance wasn't his best. He certainly earned his title as an Oscar winning actor, but it probably should have come from a different performance.<br/><br/>To casual viewers, you may want to be a little wary. This has enough slow part that you'll be bored if you only watch movies for action. The action scenes themselves are very exhilarating, but they come infrequently. It's also pretty long and can get a bit laborious to watch at times. I was able to get through it without much trouble, but I would have liked it to be shorter. It got a decent amount of hype, and it sort of lives up to it, but don't get your hopes too high. Overall Rating: 7.8/10."

","Laid up with an injured knee I saw the Revenant for sale at 2.89 on demand so I ordered it. I had heard from friends that went to see it that it was boring and too drawn out, but I disagree. I think the reason this type of movie is becoming increasingly unpopular and not relatable is because they are about subtle details. In today's society everything is fast paced and encapsulated. The Revenant took the time to show the period, the struggle, what mattered in life and when life did or did not matter. It was gritty in the display of survival in the elements and against foes. The actors were very authentic in their delivery especially Tom Hardy, and I was pleasantly surprised with Leonardo because I really didn't think he could get that dirty and raw. I thought it was very unhollywood all the characters looked stressed by the elements and the Indians looked rough and rugged even the women. All in all I thought this was a good flick that was an accurate and well portrayed period piece. I would have given a 7.5 if I could. It was certainly worth the 3 bucks!"

","This movie is brutal. Walking into the movie I expected certain things from Innaritu. <br/><br/>1. Pushing forward film making as a medium technically He certainly did as many agree this is a technical masterpiece. The natural lighting is well worth the pain the crew went through, this film just breaths wilderness and the atmosphere throws you right in. The fight scenes were spectacular and the CGI bear looks great.<br/><br/>2. Pushing the best performances out of your actors What I got from this was an amazing performance from Leo and Tom Hardy. It really felt Leo pushed his limit in this film, even though he rarely talked. Through grunting and struggle, he successful portrayed his feelings to the audience. Tom Hardy really nailed the despicable guy in this film and was just a great casting choice. <br/><br/>Overall, I got what I expected perfectly and a bit more of brutality, however it did everything perfectly."

Leo definitely didn't disappoint and rightfully so received his long overdue Oscar for this movie and after watching the movie their is no question as to why.

I'm a harsh critic and usually have something I dislike about movies but this movie is just flawless and beautiful! Not normally my type of film either but everything about this movie is captivating and just amazing! The only thing that was disappointing is that I didn't get to see it when it was out in theatres because I was injured. This movie is definitely a rare find nowadays and was just so different from anything I've ever seen and will definitely be a film to be remembered!

","The Revenant is to Leonardo Dicaprio what Training Day was to Denzel Washington. Now what I mean by this is that they both won Oscars for their great performance but should they have won it for these particular movies? Leonardo Dicaprio is by far my favorite actor, he is my idol, my hero but I have to say that the movie I believed he should've won an Oscar was for The Departed, on my top five of all time list check that out if you will, many people say Denzel should've won for another movie I agree even though I liked his performance in Training Day but he really should've won for Malcolm X. Enough of that its all about Leo his long awaited Oscar has finally come to him I've waited so long for this and The Revenant finally got Leo his Oscar it follows the story of Hugh Glass a motherfucking beast who was abandoned by his squad who also killed his son, he also got attacked and molested by a bear but I can't get a text back damn J I love you. This movie shows how committed Leo will get for a role his performance was fantastic but as a Leonardo fan boy it pains me to say that he wasn't my favorite actor, I love Leo but man to me Tom Hardy stole the show, he was so good at being bad, he was the villain you love to hate but you always got to admit that he was a savage in here. That's Hardy. Leonardo will won the Oscar for his physical performance not his acting which is what I wanted some great acting, if you're the best actor of you're generation live up to the hype and props to Tom for showing that he can go toe to toe with a veteran but nonetheless the movies great, the cast is great but that isn't the main attraction it's the scenery it is so beautiful like a girl I know. The director Iñárritu and cinematographer Lubezki crafted a terrible hell in a beautiful hell. The movies really violent so watch out for that but so beautiful to look at. A movie very well done won't promise that you'll get bored so don't watch if you have ADD and ADHD."

The realism and grittiness of it just draws you in and keeps you there for the whole run time. I see a lot of complaints about the plot, and I understand why many people would think that it doesn't fit. This is about a man who loses everything except his thirst for revenge.

"ciorogar_alex","9","0","2","12 August 2016"," The Revenant - Review
","Watching Alejandro G. Iñárritu's The Revenant was a harrowing yet inspirational experience. After the multiple Academy Awards winning Birdman, the Mexican director brings Leo and still-rising Hardy together on the big screen again (after Inception) for this inspired-by-true-events poetic Western.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, Samuel L. Jackson and Christian Bale were both supposed to star, which would have been fine since the producers decided to keep Tom Hanks at a distance (survivor or no). The Book of Job theme is remarkably entwined with a bizarre but sturdy Revenge plot. Moreover, the crawling-all-over-the-place and his Bear Grylls impersonation are a gruesome reminder that you're witnessing an American odyssey. All of it – topped by Emmanuel Lubezki extraordinary work as the Director of Photography (Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow; The Coen Brother's Burn after Reading – to name just a hefty few of his past achievements as a cinematographer).<br/><br/>DiCaprio is brutally manhandled by a bear. Brought back to life from his spiritual death (his son and spouse are relentlessly murdered), Hugh Glass spends a night in a horse's dead womb-like carcass, right after being herb-hazed in a dream filled shamanic journey. All for (interracial) love. Winter in the mountains will never look the same again."
"Tarx309","10","0","1","10 August 2016"," Best movie I saw all year
","""Best movie I saw all year"" is not something I say lightly. The Revenant is not only an unforgettable movie with top notch acting and cinematography, it is a filmmaking triumph. Going into the theatre I had seen no trailers, clips or much advertising at all. However, I was astounded by the movie I saw. Alejandro G. Iñárritu's has crafted a supremely brutal and harsh movie with outstanding realism as it portrays a vivid tale of human endurance and revenge. Iñárritu takes complete control of the movie with outstanding directing that was not matched by anyone in 2015. He rightfully won the Oscar, Bafta, Golden Globe and every other award for directing. He carries the movie with such commendable intensity and confidence that a movie like this needs. He successfully builds up the tension throughout the movie, from the brutal beginning scene to the amazing climax. It is hard to imagine anyone else doing such a good job at directing this movie - and perhaps that is because no one else could.<br/><br/>However Iñárritu is not the only great filmmaker here. The films cinematography is especially good. Three-time Oscar winning Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is sensationally vivid and realistic - nothing short of masterful. The makeup, costume design and visual effects are also strong, but it is the acting that really shines. Leonardo DiCaprio (finally) snagged an Oscar for his outstanding turn as Hugh Glass; a performance that was not even closely matched this year. It is by far his most difficult role yet, and at the same time, perhaps his best. Glass' quest for revenge is edge-of-your-seat stuff - a relentless quest that leaves the audience in awe. Tom Hardy also was nominated for Best Actor here, but for some outrageous reason was beaten by Mark Rylance. Given his performance and difficult character in this movie, that seems preposterous when you begin to contemplate it. He successfully plays one of the most authentically evil villains in recent history - a character with no signs of either empathy or morals. Not an easy role to play, but perhaps that's why they chose Tom Hardy for the job.<br/><br/>The whole cast is at the top of their game, with the supporting cast of Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter and Forrest Goodluck all giving surprisingly good performances. All the characters are original and particularly realistic, which helps to make this an especially relentless and authentic movie. The Revenant is as thrilling and brutal and as a sheet of sharp ice held to the skin, but by gosh, it's entertaining."

It broke my heart to see him play the bad guy, because he is so HOT! (Sorry, I'm a woman and with the two of them in this movie, I thought I was in heaven. I digress). <br/><br/>But if you're looking for a great suspense film where you cheer for DiCaprio's survival and pray for the bad guys demise, this is the movie for you."
"bkoganbing","8","0","1","8 August 2016"," Survival
","A favorite era of mine for film stories has always been the mountain man era in the American west. No white people in great numbers, just single shot weapons, they were the ones outnumbered so survival against the Indians was far more an even struggle than in the post Civil War west. The Revenant by dint of its many nominations has laid claim to being the greatest film about that era ever made. It goes up against such items as Across The Wide Missouri, The Big Sky, and Mountain Men, Jeremiah Johnson all pretty good films.<br/><br/>It would have been hard to deny Leonardo DiCaprio a Best Actor Oscar this time around. He's on screen for most of the time and with minimal dialog DiCaprio has to use facial expressions and body language to convey his emotions. He does it well and should share his Oscar with the cameraman who did all those closeups of him.<br/><br/>The plot is best compared to another mountain man picture A Man Called Horse that starred Richard Harris. DiCaprio who was guide to the expedition of fur trappers is badly mauled by a grizzly bear and is after being toted for quite a distance is abandoned by Tom Hardy who claims he died. DiCaprio just wants to settle the score. Unlike Richard Harris he does not find a friendly tribe of Indians to take him in. His survival is his personal story.<br/><br/>The Revenant also won the Cinematography Oscar for the shooting of the rugged winter country these men are in. It's so good the landscape, cold and forbidding, becomes almost a character in the film.<br/><br/>Like The Old Man And The Sea was for Spencer Tracy The Revenant is a personal film for Leonardo DiCaprio. Unlike Tracy who had that magnificent speaking voice for the narration, no narration here. Just anguished expressions convey what DiCaprio is feeling.<br/><br/>Leo got his Oscar and it was a deserved one for The Revenant. It's a great film, but very brutal at times."
"jay-techie2007","9","0","2","29 July 2016"," Watch it for the intense story and Tom Hardy
","This is one of those very intense movies (like Prisoners) which you appreciate but you can't watch it more than once. <br/><br/>Story (9/10): The story tells about a struggle of a frontiersman who was critically injured in a bear attack and left alone to die by his hunting team. Shot in a backdrop of Dakotas of the 1820s with freezing winters, his struggle is not just to survive it but also avenge the murder of his son by one of his own team members. And all of this in the middle of escaping other hostile enemy teams. While the story is inspired by Mark Smith's novel of the same name, it is the screenplay that has projected the grief and pain (emotional as well as physical) of Hugh Glass, the protagonist played by Di Caprio, beautifully. <br/><br/>Acting (8/10): While Di Caprio is the lead actor, I am not sure if I would count this as one of his best performances. He has done his usual good but I felt it was Tom Hardy who walked away with the movie with his brilliant projection of the nemesis, John Fitzgerald. His expressions, dialog delivery, and voice modulation were impeccable, something which reminded me of Warrior (I haven't watched Mad Max Fury yet!). Unfortunately, besides these two, others have hardly received any dedicated screen time. <br/><br/>Direction (9/10): Alejandro G. Iñárritu has brought the best of his work in this movie. I haven't watched any of his earlier movies but given the ratings, he has been consistent and he, perhaps, needed this one amazing movie that would establish himself among the elites. In Revenant, his knowledge around making the best use of camera work, shooting the bear attack sequence, projecting Glass' grief which watching his son die, conceptualizing some of the scenes which seem too good to be true and modulating the intensity of the movie has helped to create an amazing piece of motion picture. However, his pacing the movie went for a toss and an overstretched climax is the last thing you would want in such a dark movie. I would have loved it to be a 2 hour 10-15minutes movie instead of full 2.5 hours. Also, he seems to have gone overboard in showing Glass critically injured to the extent that one feels that it didn't make any sense for his team to keep him alive, let alone for him to survive the biting chills of the North. <br/><br/>Overall (9/10): Overall, one must watch Revenant for the intense story and Tom Hardy."

"jsrobinson132","8","0","1","23 July 2016"," Breathtakingly Beautiful Scenery Backdropping The Worst That Humanity Can Do To Each Other
","The Revenant surprised me in more ways than one!<br/><br/>I went along to a screening of this film today having a fairly good idea of what to expect after watching the trailer and reading a couple of non-spoiler reviews – a harrowing tale of survival set amongst a cold and desolate wilderness area somewhere in the north of America. Apart from a compelling story, what came as a wonderful surprise was the stunning cinematography captured by a brilliant team of cameramen under the very clever eye of a skilled director. Just the panning shots from ground level up into the magnificent tree canopies are enough to feed your spirit as one season gives way to another or daylight changes to a night sky – and as the tiny ice crystals coating their spindly branches then glimmer in the moonlight. Add into the mix those awe-inspiring Rocky Mountains, so often cut through by fast flowing rivers that forge their way down breathtaking gorges and canyons, and you have a panorama to rival those in other epics like Doctor Zhivago and Dances With Wolves. Every scene was breathtakingly beautiful, while many, and often at the same time, were grotesquely gory. The filmmakers incorporated a backdrop of the most stunning of scenery with the worst humanity can do to each other and both were played out in all of their fullness. Even in the most horrific of scenes, the background was a visual wonder. Based on a true story, this cinematic marvel was shot in the wilds of Alberta and British Columbia in Canada – and much to my delight, around many of the places my husband and I visited only 18 months earlier so it was easy to recognise a few, and make me long to go back for a longer visit. Then for one unforgettable scene where Leonardo DiCaprio had to brave a freezing cold river and subsequent waterfall, the location moved to Montana in the USA. Finally, the cast and crew had to be transported to the southernmost reaches of Argentina for the chilling – and yes, both meanings of the word – climax when the snow started melting in the north. With not only these eye-catching earthly wonders on display, audiences are also privy to two other phenomenal events – a spectacular meteor shower that comes to a watery grave, along with witnessing the power and destruction of a full- blown avalanche in all of its glory. The storyline is one of the most brutal anyone could ever imagine. Knowing it is what actually happened to a living being definitely makes your skin crawl, especially when you see the exceptional attention to detail the makeup artists put in to simulate the deep wounds from the hell on earth Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), along with many of his cast mates, are subjected to. As well as those cleverly delivered technical additions, the scenes move fast and furious, often taking you to places you're not expecting. Personally, I flinched visibly three times throughout the movie – two accompanied by very audible gasps with a hand covering my mouth as these scenes unfolded with either brute force or by taking an unexpected turn  well, actually it was a very long plunge. I can only say I'm glad the director didn't decide to shoot them in 3D! This is definitely a film whose breathtaking landscapes should first be appreciated in a full cinema. For the screening I went along to today, much to my delight South Bank Cineplex delivered it on their huge Imax screen so each scene was absolutely captivating. And yet, this wasn't the only thing that held me captive or made me thankful I decided to discover why it was nominated so often, as well as won so many awards already, even before the Oscars have been held – a woman on her own watching a very blokey film. Mark L. Smith and Alejandro González Iñárritu have written a heartstopping screenplay based on fact that is definitely worth the telling in all of its gore and ruggedness. And if you really stop to think about it as the credits start to roll, the final few seconds contain a subtle but wonderful tie to the opening. I'm not going to tell you what it is  you'll just have to go along to see for yourself, but don't forget to note those first few lines spoken by Hugh Glass in the Pawnee language so you can then reflect on them at the end, and maybe in a similar fashion to me. A very well-deserved 8 out of 10. P.S. Now I know why we were warned on our Canadian tour to talk loudly and make a lot of noise when wandering through the North American wilderness during bear season! I advise everyone else to remember as well after seeing this stunning film."
"The Grand Master","9","0","2","19 July 2016"," Excellent viewing, visually stunning cinematography, and Leonardo Di Caprio nets himself a long overdue Academy Award.
","The Revenant is a movie that puts forward visually stunning cinematography ahead of its excellent storyline that keeps viewers in their seats. Leonardo Di Caprio and Tom Hardy are brilliant in their respective roles and Alejandro G. Iñárritu has done an amazing job as director.<br/><br/>Set in the 1800's, frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo Di Caprio) acts as a guide for a group of fur trappers led by Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). They come under attack by a savage group of Indians which sees many of their men killed and the remaining trappers are forced to escape and leave most of the furs they acquired behind. After escaping to safety, the men abandon their boat and work their way back to their outpost Fort Kiowa on foot. During the journey, Hugh Glass is savagely mauled by a bear and left barely clinging for life. One of the fellow trappers John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) abandons Glass and leaves him to die in the wilderness, deceitfully telling the others that they were forced to abandon Glass after supposedly coming under attack. Swearing revenge on Fitzgerald, Glass must dig deep and utilize his survival skills to find his own way back home through the rough winter terrain while avoiding the natives. <br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio has gone from strength to strength throughout his career. His pretty boy era with Romeo & Juliet (1996), Titanic (1997) and The Beach (2000) is well and truly behind him. His star power has rapidly inclined with movies such as Catch Me If You Can (2002), The Aviator (2004), Blood Diamond and The Departed (both 2006), and Inception (2010). In my opinion, The Wolf Of Wall Street (2013) should have netted him an Academy Award however he was very unlikely to miss out with Matthew McConaughey instead emerging as the victor for Dallas Buyers Club (2013). Here in The Revenant, Leonardo Di Caprio finally earns himself a long overdue Academy Award as the tormented Hugh Glass.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy who also co-starred with Leonardo Di Caprio in Inception (2010) is another actor who always gets better in every movie he appears in. After audiences sat up and took notice of Tom Hardy in Bronson (2008), Tom Hardy hit the big time and has since gone from strength to strength with movies such as The Dark Knight Rises (2012) and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). Here in The Revenant, Tom Hardy's performance is nothing short of excellent and he sees himself unlucky not to have won for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>Alejandro G. Iñárritu direction is brilliant but the cinematography is a visually strikingly spectacle and the musical score is powerfully amazing.<br/><br/>The Revenant is one of those excellent movies that you will only have to see once. The violence is brutal and bloody, and the movie goes for at least 156 minutes. Well deserving of its accolades, although it was very unlucky not to have earned the Best Picture Academy Award. Overall The Revenant is well deserving viewing, and Leonardo Di Caprio turns in an award winning performance that sees him deserve every bit of praise coming his way.<br/><br/>9/10."

","Academy Award winning director Alejandro Inarittu delivered a powerful new film with his vision on the tale of frontiersman, Hugh Glass, and his harrowing survival. The man who survived a savage mauling by a wild grizzly bear and left for dead by his fellow fur traders, but managed to crawl to civilization and formulated revenge against two of his former comrades. <br/><br/>In the pivotal role of Glass is a primarily mute Leonardo DiCaprio who finally took home his overdue Academy Award for Best Actor. The transformations that DiCaprio undergoes is fiercely harsh as the film spins its tale; going from a fur trapper into a man hellbent on avenging the wrongs done to him. The mauling scene is the most excruciating moment to watch as DiCaprio is being tossed around and torn apart (five hours of convincing makeup) like a rag doll. Those who doubt the power of the performance have either not seen the film or did and just weren't convinced based on their observations.<br/><br/>Pulling an excellent sinister performance as fellow explorer Fitzgerald is Tom Hardy. He plays a man who is unconcerned of the well-being of others except his own survival. Though historically the whole expedition agrees to leave Glass to die, in the film the filmmakers place the blame for the decision on Hardy's Fitzgerald as to play up the drama. We do anxiously await for Fitzgerald to get what is coming to him, but we do find him a fascinating character thanks to Hardy's charisma.<br/><br/>The filming locations make the viewer feel the isolation of the story's players. The incidents all took place in the wilds of South Dakota which was ""no man's land"" back in the 1820s. Nothing but snow and ice surround the determined Hugh Glass as he travels to Fort Kiowa, braving the brutal winter temperatures. It's a terrifying thought to how lost one could get if you don't know the way."

","""I ain't afraid to die anymore. I'd done it already."" <br/><br/>You have movies with bloody scenes so exaggerated that it actually becomes laughable. Take for example ""The hateful Eight"". Liters of blood spatter around in this film. It's not really meant to be funny but it isn't shocking either after a while. The key moment in ""The Revenant"" however, is so incredibly realistic and bloody painful to behold. A dashing exploit of CGI and choreography. The interplay between DiCaprio and the computer animated bear had to be meticulously coordinated. I think this required some scrupulous work, resulting in an impressive battle scene. Had it been a real-life, trained bear, I'd give this bear an Oscar.<br/><br/>Now Leonardo DiCaprio snatched the coveted statuette away from the bear. In my opinion Leo deserved it, but not specifically for this film. I have no doubt that the circumstances this film was made in, must have been heavy and mostly inhuman. The extreme cold in the icy landscape over there in the far north and the difficult primitive conditions of life for these trappers weren't faked images. But for DiCaprio there wasn't much acting involved during the largest part of the film. Mostly it was just groaning with a lot of splashing spittle. Although he did this in a very convincing way. His facial expression showed his feelings. No need for heaps of words. So he's not a chatterbox as in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". That's the movie he deserved an Oscar for, in my opinion.<br/><br/>""The Revenant"" is the ultimate survival film. A brilliant film about the struggle between man and nature. A beautiful film, full of fascinating images, that slowly takes the form of a revenge movie. The revenge Hugh Glass wants, is the thread running through this film. A film about a profound willpower and perseverance. A survival film that easily surpasses essentially all other similar films. The scene with the horse is pretty hallucinating and a pinnacle of inventiveness when it comes to survival skills. This film being based on a true story, makes it all the more impressive. In my opinion this film can be added to the list of other legendary films.<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

Kudos to a victorious DiCaprio and an always reliable Inarritu for their dynamic teaming as actor/director. DiCaprio gives a nuanced, layered performance as a tortured soul in search of redemption and revenge, and Inarritu stages his journey as a soul-searching quest for salvation where man faces obstacles from nature, animal, and the worst beast of all... fellow man himself. Tom Hardy should also be acknowledged for delivering a solid, villainous portrayal as a treacherous, back- stabbing brute.

"mike_diamond","10","0","2","26 June 2016"," Iñárritu + Lubezki = Oscars
","For the second consecutive year, Alejandro González Iñárritu has directed my favourite film of the year. His partnership with Emmanuel Lubezki, anticipated to win his record- setting third straight Academy Award for cinematography, is unparalleled in Hollywood. Their combination of artistic vision and technical capacity has produced an astonishing film.<br/><br/>The Revenant is a story set in the 1820's about a fur trader named John Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is attacked by a bear and left for dead by his companions.<br/><br/>The opening scene, which took a month to rehearse, has as many moving parts as a finely crafted watch. The fur traders' camp is attacked by a band of Arikara Indians who are looking for the Chief's captured daughter. The opening salvo, an arrow through the neck, triggers a cascading battle sequence as the traders attempt to save their booty and their lives. This is when Lubezki is at his best. His technical capability is on full display as he captures the action in one uninterrupted shot, highlighted by moving the camera from a stationary position to a horse in full gallop without cutting. Lubezki's insistence on using natural light, surely influenced by his previous work with Terrence Malick, presented a unique challenge given that the film was shot in the dead of winter, but once executed, rewards the audience with breathtaking scenery.<br/><br/>Supported by a talented cast, including standout Will Poulter, Leo and Tom Hardy are exemplary. Leo will win his first Oscar, and not because of his body of work, but because he deserves it."

","So I year after, I finally had the opportunity to watch The Revenant. You are perplexed by the exuberant beauty and unrestrained brutality of nature. Iñárritu offers an interesting premise to explore, in which the harshest wilderness conditions can pale when confronted with the ruthless, unrestricted instincts of human nature. At the end, you end up realizing that both are complements of the same chaotic system. Perhaps, more atypical, and even exceptional, is to find the self- restraint and empathy that has evolved in humans under such harsh conditions. Survival of the fittest becomes gets extrapolated with survival through revenge motivation. An array of humans feelings and conditions get explored. The innocence of naive behaviors or basic instincts are explored. It also interesting to see how feebleness of order and morality. Food for thought under the turbulent world order that is unfolding."
"gljbradley","7","0","2","24 June 2016"," Such An Agonizing, Flawed Yet Beautiful Movie
","Well, I had FINALLY seen the film. My folks and I had seen it a few days ago and it was great!!! I enjoyed it! I was really impressed and blown away by it to where I'm still trying to process it. The acting was phenomenal(in a perfect world, Leo and Tom BOTH won their well-deserved Oscars), the direction was great, the story was okay, the flow was good, the cinematography was hypnotizing, the visuals were amazing, the music was beautiful, and it was very thought-provoking. It was slow at times and dragged on a bit. But it was still interesting enough to keep you hooked. It was like being transported to another world.<br/><br/>This film was loosely based off of the ordeal and journey of Hugh Glass, and did an incredible job bringing to life a story of an almost hard-to-believe event from history. It's unbelievable to think about all of the stuff that the real Hugh Glass went through! I've read some of what really happened to the historical figure and...wow! The human spirit is something else! Like 'Man in the Wilderness', this film shows that you should never give in and never give up hope. Don't let setbacks keep you down. This film and its 1971 ancestor has shown that even in the midst of misery, we can survive difficult situations when we put our minds and hearts to it. This film was extremely bleak and disheartening. It was raw, intense, disturbing, and extremely brutal! But it still had signs of hope and beauty that makes it worthwhile.<br/><br/>There are many things I love about this film. Too many to name. Here are some. I love the symbolic, spiritual, and philosophical aspect of it. I love it when he speaks Pawnee. He sounds both natural and rather awkward. I love the way nature was presented as a character of its own. I love how he interacts with other characters, especially Hawk and Hikuc. I even love how Glass' body movements are basically animal-like sometimes. In one scene for example, he appeared to be moving on the ground like a predatory animal(i.e. wolf, lion, panther) towards his ""prey"" but in a more quiet, stealth manner. It's like when he needs or wants to be, he comes across as beastly and dangerous. I think it's rather cool and badass.<br/><br/>I admittedly have some issues with this film. The first issue is, like a lot of people are saying, that they should've addressed the hypothermia and pneumonia situation. He was in the winter weather most of the time and been in freezing water. His clothes being constantly wet and cold due to the snow mostly won't do him any favors. I mean, realistically, there's no way he couldn't have caught pneumonia at some point and not get seriously ill. Especially with the horrific, somewhat treated injuries he'd sustained from the bear attack that can cause serious infections. The filmmakers could've at least showed a scene or two of him trying to dry out his clothes as he's trying to keep warm. And trying not to get submersed in the freezing water too much. That's just unbelievable. The second issue I have is the wife subplot. I wasn't feeling that part of the story. It felt so superfluous, hollow, forced, and disconnected with much of the film. I wish they could've allowed us to truly get to know his wife besides seeing her briefly in flashbacks or as an illusion or symbol. Instead of a randomly fleeting memory, illusion, or symbol, the filmmakers should've established her more as a person so we can get to know her better and fully understand Glass' emotionally traumatic pain. Unfortunately, that situation wasn't executed well and probably should've been left on the cutting room floor. Oddly enough, though, I was on board with the son subplot and thought the portrayal of father/son relationship was beautiful. I wish they could've had more scenes between Glass and his son, Hawk. The third issue is, once again, like a lot of people are saying, is Glass and Captain Henry going after Fitzgerald by themselves instead of having several men with them. How ridiculously stupid is that! Even if it's just two against one, that one could most likely put up a fight with the right resources and tools. Especially knowing how dangerous, unpredictable, and shrewd he is. Perhaps this was to show how the naivety, bad judgment, and terrible decisions can have deadly consequences. Especially by a respected captain. Still, it could've been handled better by the writers. Along with that, I would've loved for the filmmakers to let us know how much time has passed since the bear attack. It felt like it was days but logically, it could've been weeks. Also, not really an issue but I wish there were more scenes with Glass and his friend that saved his life. They had an amazing chemistry and it had a sense of warmth when it comes to the heart. Lastly, though I agree that there were some parts that could've been trimmed down, I wouldn't have mind at all if the film was longer. <br/><br/>Despite several flaws and inaccuracies, the film was very well done and extremely beautiful. It was like an imperfect, gorgeous canvas.<br/><br/>7.8/10"
"bysin","8","0","2","22 June 2016"," A classical revenge movie
","It's more like a documentary than common film. The scenes in this movie are incredible and the environment, the background are consistent through the movie, it's quite beautiful, I have to say. Although some people might find it brutal and violent, it is, but that's another kind of beauty, the nature of human-beings. Glass, a man who can speak both Pawnee and English, follows some kind of belief to implement his revenge, from this prospect, it's quite a classical way for such a movie. When his son was killed, he made up all he had and he could have to revenge. Just like what he was always saying in his mind: ""breathe, keep breathing and when you have the breath, fight."" He tried his best even better than the best to survive to trace down Fitzgerald. He hided himself inside the body of a house to go through a cold night. He's also lucky when he's in his worst form, a Pawnee help him, but who was killed by some Frenches. He revenged for the Pawnee, killed Frenches and saved a girl of Akiraka. Finally he managed to find Fitzgerald and fought with him, through a fierce and original fight with him, he eventually killed Fitzgerald to death, although Fitzgerald's life was ended by several Akirakans. By the end, he seemed to see his wife again."

The action is amazing. The lighting and cinematography is spectacular. The sound design is great. The pacing is very good. The script while it is I guess a revenge movie is great. All the subplots have a resolution. So you may be wondering ""What are the problems you have with this absolute masterpiece?"". Well, the music isn't great. It's just good. Not great, good. Some parts are great, others not so much. Also there are some dream sequences that I think could have been cut out. And there is one moment so stupid that I had to check my brain to see if it was still working afterwards.I will not say what it is because I will not give any spoilers in my reviews for movies under 10 years old.

"leonblackwood","8","0","3","13 June 2016"," Brilliant throughout! 8/10
","Review: What a brilliant movie! It did take me some time to watch, because I kept on rewinding the amazing bear fighting scenes, and I was totally gripped throughout. The whole ""lost in the wilderness"" experience was believable and very well directed. The cinematography was truly amazing and the intensity, right from the beginning, was unique and brilliantly performed from the whole cast. DiCaprio (Hugh Glass), really pushed the boundaries with his realistic performance, and the emotion that he showed, in such an impossible situation, was definitely an Oscar winning achievement. Personally, I think that Tom Hardy should have won an Oscar for his performance, because he was the perfect villain and he sported the rough look well, which reminded me a lot of Barnes (Tom Berenger), in Platoon, who was also was a warrior and turned against his fellow soldier. Anyway, I didn't know anything about this film before I watched it, so I was a bit worried about the length of the film but I personally could have done with an other hour. The whole revenge side of the movie, was totally understandable but I still think that he was able to get back on his feet, a bit too quick. The director also gave the Indians an understandable mission but they were quite creepy and brutal. The showdown at the end, was definitely worth waiting for but I just couldn't get over the beer scene near the beginning, which caused the main problem with Glass right from the start. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it has to be the best film of this year so far. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Round-Up: With films like Minions, Frozen and Transformers making over a Billion dollars at the box office, it's a shame that a movie like this, doesn't get the returns that it deserves. It certainly won a lot of awards and it has firmly put the Mexican director, Alejandro G. Inarritu, 52, on the map, but I still think that it deserved more. As he also wrote this movie, he certainly gave this project his all, and with all of the location problems, due to weather, it was a miracle that it finally got released. He also directed, the successful Birdman, which also won a lot of awards but I personally don't think it was anywhere near as great, as this movie. Biutiful, starring Javier Bardem was also a well made film, and with 21 Grams and Babel in his filmography, he has a lot to be thankful for. After having 2 successful years on the trot, in terms of awards and box office takings, it will be good to see what he comes up with next, and I'm sure that the pressure to release another successful hit, will make him take a break for a while, and give it much thought.<br/><br/>Budget: $135million Worldwide Gross: $532.5million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/adventure/thrillers starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter, Paul Anderson, Kristoffer Joner and Joshua Burge. 8/10"
"a-moawad","9","0","3","13 June 2016"," Why It deserves three Oscars and much more?
","This movie took three Oscars a best director, actor and cinematographer Might be for the following reasons: Best cinematography for using the minimum dialogue and maximum visuals to show the inner felling of Hugh glass in every scene specifically when he is approaching death. The protagonist is not only destroyed mentally by the death of his family but also destroyed physically by the bear attack which left him speechless and It gets worse and worse by the ruthless and evil heart of John fretz portrayed by the infamous Tom hardy. I can feel how it took a hard, long time to direct by maintaining the continuity of either the shots or the cinematography and sometimes nature uncontrollable atmosphere. Let's not forget the great acting skills by Leonardo DiCaprio who survived coldness, eating raw meat and horseback riding that looks like riding a bicycle . It's a one of the great and most educational film I've ever seen and it will be mined in the history of Hollywood as one of the greatest films for years to come.Can't forget the great talented writers that tried to tell us revenge won't make you relieved or satisfied but it will let you carry a heavy burden that could Weigh your movement and only make it worse."
"ashenm","7","0","2","10 June 2016"," Not as good as I hoped
","There is a great story here but every cliché from every native American conflict film is in it. The pace of the film seems to wander and reminded me of Alejandro González Iñárritu's previous film Birdman - which I did like. The hero - Hughe Glass wants to jump into freezing water at every opportunity which does get a bit irritating. The cast and acting hold the film together although Tom Hardy does mumble a bit. The story is the powerful part of the film and the direction should not get in the way, for example David Lean and Lawrence of Arabia. The CGI bear is not as realistic as it could be. The make up on the Native Americans is believable and highly menacing, the subtle colours worked well. If you are going to watch it make sure it's on Blu Ray as the scenery is stunning."
"neibrad","8","0","3","3 June 2016"," Visually stunning. Shockingly realistic.
","Buckle down and be prepared: This ain't no Disney film. Survival horror in the same league as Gravity, intense acting and cinematography that is stunning. There are jaw dropping sequences and quite a few where I had to look away: It's very realistic. There are a couple of down sides: The dialog in places is far too modern. I really don't think they would have spoken like that in those times. I maybe would have given this 9 stars, but I had to deduct one ( apologies to Leo: A well deserved Oscar ), It's because of, once again, Tom Hardy's ridiculous accent. OK I get it. You want an Oscar for character acting. But please dude. Stop with the stupid accents. I could only get about one word in five. At first I didn't realise it was him hiding behind the beard and then I thought 'oh no...'. Come back Jeff Bridges all is forgiven."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","3","2 June 2016"," The art of suffering, pain and loss
","Alejandro G. Iñárritu has always been a bit of hit and miss director for me. I've always admired his vision, his willingness to push the art form and his unmistakable style. But his stories and characters have always left me wanting, just a little bit. They've always felt like they're experiments first and fulfilling experiences second.<br/><br/>Not so with this film. This film blew me away from the very first second and simply get blowing. The vast cold landscape of Northern USA opens in front of your eyes in rich shades of dark brown, grey and green. No artificial lighting was used to film this epic and yet it's all so rich and detailed, and all the more real for it. And the camera-work is equally as impressive. It moves seamlessly with the character, sweeping low and high as needed, like on wings. And it's not afraid to hold a shot. There are a lot of long takes, like you, the viewer, are part of the story and cautiously approaching certain scenes and sights, afraid of what you'll find. Visually one of the most impressive and beautiful films I've seen in a long while.<br/><br/>The story is somewhat loosely based on the real life events that took place in the early 1800s. Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a fur trapper and a scout working for a trapper company led by Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). The company is forced to flee after being ambushed by Native Americans, but in the midst of their flight Glass is savagely mauled by a mother bear and shortly after left for dead by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), a trapper very much interested in his own personal survival. The film then follow Glass's slow and painful journey across the wilderness as he tries to reach this one man, who condemned him to a cold death in the middle of nowhere.<br/><br/>DiCaprio won his first Academy Award for this role and I say it's well-earned. He spends much of the film mutely struggling to put one foot in front of the other, erratically interrupted by stilled grunts of pain, but yet you still know exactly what's playing in his mind with every step. The feelings of betrayal and need for vengeance, the flickering and undying spark of life, the resolve to never stop moving. It's all there, behind his eyes, across his stained and bloodied face.<br/><br/>Not to say that the rest of the cast in in any way untalented, but it's very much DiCaprio's show. And when he finally reaches the end of his journey and locks eyes with his quarry. A chilling moment.<br/><br/>It's not a film for everyone. It very much earns its R rating, containing strong and disturbing scenes. But it's beautiful in execution, from the visuals to the acting to the music and the story. Very much my favourite movie thus far from 2015."
"amandawhite-25294","9","0","4","30 May 2016"," Great Film!
","I thought this film was VERY well directed and a particular moment at the end of the film shocked me in a good way! Throughout the whole film the protagonist had been close to death, and on the very last scene a close up is used to show his teary eyes as he see's his dead wife. The camera then stays on his face and a long duration is used which in my opinion kept my attention. The very last seconds before the film ends the actor looks straight at the camera, an extremely unconventional thing to do which is why I was so surprised by this occurring, however this worked so well I believe as the tears in the actors eyes along with the close up and directly addressing the audience made me feel slightly uncomfortable as I had been allowed to become attached to the character throughout the film, and now with him directly addressing me, it made me feel as if I needed to help the character in a sense as for me this was a very effective way to end this film as it kept me talking about it even after it had finished, as it was also a cliff hanger, so we don't know whether he died or survived. I would definitely recommend it to others, as the technique and camera angles used in the film have inspired and influenced me, which I may be able to use in my own short film."
"richgruss-74357","9","0","2","25 May 2016"," Cinematography will make history
","Westerns have their own vocabulary, with their swelling brass-heavy orchestrations, expansive sky shots, and the campfire code of rugged, manly suffering in silence. Those of us who don't care for all this aesthetic grit would usually avoid an offering like this, but this piece is absolutely unmissable. <br/><br/>Yes, there are a lot of Western tropes--the hero who transcends culture by taking a Native American wife and speaking her language, the mute respect between fellow hardy travelers, and of course the (exceptionally gruesome) shootout at the end (which is this case is performed with hacking instruments)--but the filming at some points is unlike anything I've ever seen. The bear attack includes, among the standard close-up shaky hand-held shots, mercilessly steady middle shots and terrifying deep-focus angles as the bear runs up. Likewise, the Native American attack in the beginning has the same revolutionary filming that stops your heart by putting right in the middle, an effect achieved through genuine artistry rather than just by tacky 3D. These two scenes alone make the movie worth watching on the big screen."

","I am a 13-year-old student so I'm not able to see as many movies in cinemas as I'd like to so I missed this one. 6 months I waited to see my favourite directors next film after it had already come out and wow, was I stunned after I finally watched it on a large television with surround sound. The cinematography beats Birdman for me.<br/><br/>Is this better than Birdman? Probably not, but Birdman has never been the same than in the movie theatre. I think the setting alone, and the way the brutal action sequences take place really give this film opportunity for some beautiful shots. The film is emotional and you understand Hugh Glass's motivation as a character and even though the revenge story doesn't kick in until the 50-minute mark what leads up to that is only excellent cinematography, brutal battle sequences, character development and the setting up for the character conflict and Leonardo DiCaprio as Glass and Tom Hardy as Fitzgerald really sell their butting of heads. They are both fantastic. Both are great. I would say Leo has been better but it's not like he wasn't absolutely incredible in this one. His physical performance alone is extremely impressive and the range of emotions he is able to display on his face comes as no surprise. I haven't seen enough of Tom Hardy's films to say this is his best performance but this is definitely his best from what I've seen. Everyone else is brilliant and you care enough about every one to genuinely feel concerned about what is going to happen to them except Tom Hardy as Fitzgerald who you will definitely hate.<br/><br/>Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is excellent at displaying tone and atmosphere and through the aesthetics, cinematography, the music and the fact that they are on location filming with natural light makes you truly feel like you are in this cold, brutal environment. <br/><br/>I also love how the Revenant changes up it's story before any segment gets either boring or tired which is why I was always engaged and never bored. <br/><br/>There is one technical flaw that I noticed and it's probably about 1 minute of the film spread out in about a 20 minute segment and that was how the dialogue only just didn't match up with the lips of the actors. And a flaw in the presentation was any time Hugh's dead wife is doing something inhumane in one of the dream sequences it's kind of hilarious but those flaws really only take up about three minutes of the movie in total. <br/><br/>To sum it up, I loved this movie. I thought it was an incredible experience with amazing visuals whether practical effects, long, beautiful shots of physical brutality or an amazing looking CGI bear, it's themes were presented in a visual and non- preachy way and I loved at the end where it suggested Hugh's in-capability to die through his continuous breathing despite being so severely wounded thus the Revenant and once someone pointed that out to me it made me appreciate the film even more. This film was an experience, something this incredible film-maker does so well and I cannot wait for his next film and that is why I'm giving the Revenant the first 9/10 of 2015."

","After being left for dead the main protagonist Hugh Glass sets out on a path of vengeance on the ones who has left him to die. Based off of the incredible true story of fur trapper Hugh Glass.<br/><br/>This film is gritty and rugged, watching Leo's Hugh Glass pull himself through the brutalities and struggles you could really feel the pain and agony of this character. The geography of the location is epic and the sheer size and spectacle of the landscapes really reflects the journey that Hugh Glass has to take. Watching the movie really immerses the audience with this environment that Hugh Glass has to push through.<br/><br/>The Revenant had such amazing cinematography and was just beautiful, an incredible feat when considering that the entire film was shot under natural lighting. Through using the lighting of the different natural elements it makes the film feel so much more organic and really makes it an immersive experience. The wilderness and remote locations where these scenes were shot are spectacular. This film needed to be shot entirely under natural lighting to do this landscape justice. Watching everything Hugh Glass is put through and this journey he takes, this is something different. The sheer epicness and scale of the film was definitely worth the ticket. <br/><br/>This film was not only gritty and violent but gets really disturbing, you just see this man against nature throughout the entire film. Glass goes through punishment after punishment, you really see how small he is amongst this vast landscape yet he stays in there time after time. This one man is being pit against this entire landmass (very well shown as this grand environment through the cinematography) it is a film of human accomplishment. One of the scenes involving a bear was one of the most amazing and brutal scenes I have ever seen yet it wasn't over the top and is instead very realistic which I feel is a great thing the pull off in addition to all the other amazing work done in this film.<br/><br/>Leo Dicaprio is really good in this film too, he pulls of this character who is mostly isolated in this film and even with other people around barely says anything. His physical performance sold all of these emotions, while he was paralyzed you could just see his struggling and agony of unable to do something or move. When he is pushing through all of these challenges he was shaking, shivering and absolutely in pain yet his facial expressions tell another story, a focused attention and a very clear target. <br/><br/>All of this combined makes it so exciting yet realistic at the same time. Terrific acting, great cinematography and gritty action makes this film amazing. One of the only flaws would probably be its prolonged run time as the second act could get kinda repetitive but overall it was great amazing style and doesn't lack substance either. Watching The Revenant was an immersive experience, it is more than just a third person look at a story but audiences are really indulged is this environment."

","This movie is great I do not see a lot to criticize here. The long scenes that are played out perfectly for how much room for error those types of shots can have. There is more ambition is a single shot of that movie than in recent movies that have been getting praise lately. It is slow it is s not quite what u want it to be but it is s not like any movie you have seen and that is what counts. I watched a DVD screen of this movie and it still blew me away. No way it can suck the beautiful imagery can often be thought as pretentious but it is just different than what any cinematographer is doing nowadays.<br/><br/>Let the beautiful shots engross you and get lost in this wicked story that is played out kind of weird I must admit I found the ending not satisfying but so have I in most of the movies I like the most. Ur not supposed to love a movie like this like the other blockbusters we get these days. And Leo isn't going to get the Oscar and neither is the director whatever his name is even though he should get it for this instead of bird man. <br/><br/>Comments on the cinematography: if a bright light source gets in the frame any lens will flare a bit. Some times the shot will have a bright light source that can't be avoided. Modern lenses flare much less, but still flare while certain isomorphic lenses specifically ones with a lens element that is only curved in the horizontal axis have a distinct horizontal lens flare which used to be avoided most times but is now embraced (JJ Abrams ). The Vintage C-series Panavision isomorphic lenses happen to flare like this and they ALSO happen to be some of the most beautiful lenses ever created! They get used all the time over modern glass and people either avoid or embrace the flares depending on the shot.<br/><br/>You can have visible light sources in current master prime level Zeiss, Arri and especially Leica lenses and get practically no flare. That's what decades of coatings R+D gets you compared to lenses from the 50s, 60s and 70s.<br/><br/>They get used now, after being shelved for many years largely thanks to the rise of Super-35. Flares are technically an artifact but the way these unambiguous would flare was embraced in the 1970s, survived through the '80s and then all but died for while. Music videos and certain commercials brought them back as well as a post-digital re-interest in film looks to differentiate a project from all the homogeneous, bland looking digital cinema being made. We're currently in a peak of what has been a cyclical interest in the look."

There were some changes to the original story line from Man In the Wilderness, but I'm not sure they added to the film in a way that improved it from the original. I also find it strange that there has been no reference that it is a remake on any of the T.V. shows that review movies.

","The conclusion is completely inconsistent with the driving force and direction of the rest of the story and an all too convenient third option in the last moments--though foreshadowed, feels so out of the blue it cheapens the drama built up till that moment to Saturday morning cartoon morality. Otherwise, the visual intensity and sense of desolation and scale is superbly captured through the lens, choreography, wardrobe, location, props and casting. It is an undeniable masterpiece until the last three minutes, and if Iñarritu could Brazil or Blade Runner this, he should definitely release an alternate ending or simply cut off its tail and slap on a director's cut on it.<br/><br/>There could be a deeper interpretation meant to elevate this movie beyond this first impression, if so, the blame for allowing this poor interpretation still falls on the filmmakers."

","Released in late 2015, ""The Revenant"" stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass, a man who in real life survives a mauling by a grizzly bear and makes his way crawling and stumbling 200 miles to Fort Kiowa, in South Dakota, after being abandoned without supplies or weapons by fellow explorers and fur traders during General Ashley's expedition of 1823. Vengeful, Glass then sets out to confront his trapping partners who left him to die. The movie's loosely based on these events, but the locations are far removed from the Missouri River area of South Dakota, which makes for a more scenic experience in light of the locations being spectacular. <br/><br/>The story was first made into a movie as 1971's ""Man in the Wilderness"" starring Richard Harris and John Huston. Whereas that movie has the better story ""The Revenant"" has the better filmmaking. It's not just that it's a more expensive production with outstanding location shooting and quality actors, but also the modern filmmaking technique is superlative. If you like wilderness survival/adventure movies then ""The Revenant"" is a must. While the film runs over two and a half hours it kept my attention throughout and didn't seem that long. It's thoroughly realistic except that it's marred by Road Runner-like sequences (you'll know what I mean). <br/><br/>The film runs 156 minutes and was shot in Alberta, British Columbia, Montana, Arizona, Mexico and Argentina.<br/><br/>GRADE: B"

","There is a lot to like in The Revenant. The cinematography is jaw dropping and the landscape is a character in it's own right - the camera work is excellent throughout, with some real bravura camera moments. The camera work makes one feel intimate with the action and one goes through the horrific series of events that Glass endures. A special mention for the sound design, which I thought was sublime. I felt that that the filmmakers were trying to capture the time in all of it's brutality and I think that they managed that with a combination of expert editing, grading and production design.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is great, in a grunty kind of way - I don't think it's his best performance by far but I think he was due an Oscar. I thought Tom Hardy was much better and it took me a while to actually register it was him at all. I had no problem with understanding the dialogue - a common complaint, it seems - and thought that the mumbled and incoherent utterances of the trappers was in-keeping with the period.<br/><br/>There is a fair amount of digital work here that is sometimes excellent (the bear scene) and sometimes not (the herd of Buffalo). But I imagine there was way more as some of the shots must have been impossible without - which means they were outstanding in that I couldn't spot them.<br/><br/>The main issue is that this is not a very complicated movie. For all the needless shots of running water and leaves shot through with shafts of light, this was - essentially - Rocky II. He gets beat up, left for dead and comes back for revenge in a classic re-birth storyline (I lost count at 3 at the amount of times he emerged out of some kind of chrysalis...). I don't have a problem with that but in order to give weight to this the film- makers added 45 minutes of 'meanwhile back at the ranch...' shots that broke the flow. <br/><br/>If you accept that this is a simple, brutal story and nothing more then you will enjoy it. But maybe only the once. But that bear scene is awesome."

","This is the best movie that I've seen in a long time. Of course, I love a true story, especially when it's so outrageous that it's too hard to believe! This is the story of Hugh Glass, a real mountain man. His buddy Jim Bridger is said to have been the original mountain man, but I don't think so. The movie left out a lot of Glass's story, like he was pursued by Indians along his way back to the fort, but proved himself almost invincible to the point that the Natives left him alone. The details of this event are convoluted, and the history can't be for certain, but the story is captivating, and the movie captures the drama. Acting, GREAT, script, GREAT, scenery, GREAT.

","I'm not great at describing shot composition or style, but I can say that the sheer variety of striking visuals is what gives the film its energy. The trappers walking through a tall forest with mirror-like water up to their thighs, the Aguirre-like views of a threatening shoreline as the men make their way downriver, the nighttime scene of three raging bonfires in the snow as the hero devours raw bison on his hands and knees, the hero's hand erupting up out of the grave (really, the director did that), the half-ruined stone church with a silently tolling bell, the sunlight piercing through the Fort's looming walls, the small bird emerging from a woman's bullet wound, and on and on. That's without mentioning the underwater shots where the river's clarity tells you just how bloody cold it is, or all the shocking viscera (this is a really violent movie, because otherwise it would be narrated by David Attenburough), or the endless Peter Jackson landscapes, or shots of smoke rising into tree branches because metaphor... it's a real banquet. It reminded me of those red goggle toys you have as kids, where you slide a paper disc with film into it and pull a lever to look at packs of wolves, cedar trees, Niagra Falls... only this time... for revenge.<br/><br/>A timeless classic"

","Native ancestry in the South has always been of interest to me, because there are so many people that are descendants of Native tribes, and to be honest, a lot of them don't even know it. This doesn't apply to you of course, because you know of your ancestry, but there are a LOT of accounts of families that had certain members who had ""features"" that resembled Native blood, but their families always insisted that they were all White, or ""pure"". You can draw your own conclusions on how that happened, but to put it bluntly, most folks didn't want others knowing that there was even a remote chance that Native blood got into their family at any point, due to the Native American perception long ago. The same can be said for African Americans as well, but I've been told many stories of Natives intermingling with Whites, and the stories being covered up to keep the family's ""good name"". Of course, that was long ago, but even my father's family, who are of Swedish descent and lived in Kansas, had this happen, and many of them knew about it, but denied it.<br/><br/>The last few decades seemed to have brought a reversal, and now people seem to have a great pride of having Native ancestry, and I'm glad. But everyone should have a shared pride and interest in all branches of their ancestry, always, lest cultures and history be forgotten.<br/><br/>Best movie of the year"

That isn't exactly what happens here but for the men who left Glass for dead it may as well be accurate.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is Hugh Glass, and for this role he finally won his Best Actor Oscar. He is part of a medium sized hunting party, they are amassing animal hides to take back to civilization to sell. They have to watch for Native Americans who can be deadly.<br/><br/>But Glass tangles with a Grizzly Bear that surprises him. He survives but is very badly wounded and when his men find him do not believe he will survive much longer. His nemesis is Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald, also a member of the party but only wanting to take care of himself, and with a hostile attitude towards Natives.<br/><br/>This is a long movie, right at 2 1/2 hours, but it is a very captivating story with great cinematography, mostly in the Canadian mountains in winter.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS: Left behind in the snowy woods to watch over Glass are his son, a half-breed, a young soldier, and Fitzgerald, who only wants to get back to his pelts and get his profits. He kills the son and buries Glass, still alive, and they leave. But Glass doesn't ever give up, he pulls himself out of the grave and crawls because his legs are damaged.

","The Revenant is a visually stunning movie with a simple plot that dates back to ancient days-revenge. Revenge for leaving one for dead, revenge for killing one's son. The movie immediately starts off with a long fight sequence between the westerners and the native red Indians which besides being tense and introducing us to two major parties at play in the movie, give us a little history lesson as well. That's what the Revenant was very good at, giving information amidst all the chaos. It is not long after when Hugh Glass, leading his team through unknown terrain gets mauled by a bear. The scene is bloody and might be disturbing for some but serves as the main plot point. He is then abandoned by his team by his nemesis(Tom Hardy's) trickery and his son is killed while he is left to recover on his own, find his son's killer while at the same time escaping from the red Indians. There starts his epic tale of survival that is full of suspense and entertaining to watch. The final sequences of the movie are brilliant and the movie has an ending that in my opinion couldn't be better. The directing was amazing and many of the scenes was picturesque. No doubt Alejandro Innaritu deserved an Oscar. And last but not the least, the review would not be complete without praising its star and Oscar winner Leonardo DiCaprio. He really outdid himself in this film and Tom Hardy complemented his acting by playing the antagonist perfectly. Great casting and a superb experience."
"lmaryjuarez","10","0","3","24 April 2016"," A flawed masterpiece
","Just saw the movie today without much expectations except for the fact that i knew that it was a movie directed by Alejandro and i just had to see it. And much less to my surprise, i was blown away.<br/><br/>I remember watching his movie Biutiful(few years back) and i felt how much similar it was to Revenant in terms of the spiritual context and cinematic devices used in it. My favourite bits were those dream sequences and the quiet parts of the movie where Leo mostly had to rely on conveying emotions through eyes. Chivo did a work that is beyond fantastic,grandiose or anything superlative.<br/><br/>I just feel blessed to have witnessed such a powerful cinema. Such visceral intensity left me in awe as i walked out of the hall. Voyeuristic pleasure at best.<br/><br/>BTW what would you make of that falling star? Recurring motif since Birdman(i could be wrong though)? How is it related to this movie? Also the lingering breaths of Leo juxtaposed to different set of imagery, particularly the one that pans into the vast expanse of the clouds(somewhere in the middle of the movie)?<br/><br/>I hear Mallick referenced a lot, and I can definitely see it. It has the same poetic sensibility, but it also delivers the survival movie goods without being too sentimental about nature. The dream sequences, voiceovers, and incredible cinematography that sort of lets the natural beauty take over and tell the story. I also noticed the way the movie showed long processes (like cutting open the horse or building shelters) would portray the actor doing everything in a series of short clips. Very 'Mallickian.' I haven't been so cold in the theater since ""The Grey"". It really tapped into something primal. This is also a somewhat refreshing movie considering the homogenized sterile landscape that America has become these last few decades. It's good to remember the fragility of civility.<br/><br/>Edit: Tom Hardy was believable and had eyes that matched the relentless indifference of the terrain. Also, Leo really gave his body to the role, floating down cold rivers, crawling through freezing mud, maintaining the nuance of the role, but not distractedly so. He definitely deserves the Oscar."

","Oscar winning and world renowned movie, the revenant, is a brutally honest and somewhat savage movie that appeals to the watcher's human nature while depicting a plot for revenge. It starts off with a dream that shows the era in which the movie is set. Mr. Glass, portrayed by Leonardo Di Caprio, is the main character. His clan is brutally murdered in his dream and he is left alone with his son as the only survivors. They ally with some Englishmen who trade coats and fur. He has remarkable navigation skills and this greatly helps the Englishmen in their travels and when they have to run away from other clans. On one such expedition, Mr. Glass is wounded almost fatally by a bear and he is left in an embarrassing shape. One of the Englishmen, greedy and scared, kills Mr. Glass's son and almost kills him as well. He is left alone as the others flee for their lives. The rest of the movie is set into a revenge mission and depicts the survival of Mr. Glass and how he manages to get himself to come back to exact said revenge. The movie has a poetic tone to it but at the same time is filled with gut wrenching violence. The simple weaponry combined with the drive for revenge fueled by anger and the cryptic nature set by the deaths of his family members make for an enthralling, action packed ending that satisfies the watcher after Mr. Glass's survival exploits. On a final note, the movie does have its level of brilliance, but going in with the expectation that o e should generally have when about to watch an Oscar winning movie can ruin it for you. The movie has to experienced without pre conceptions and without expecting action around every corner. The real essence of the movie lies in the fact that it dips in and out of depression and satisfaction to deliver a completely new experience to the viewer."

"jakeskate-94456","Null","0","1","19 April 2016"," The Revenant Review: Grab Breath
","Spoilers<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio won his first Oscar taking on the role of legendary frontiersman Hugh Glass, in the remarkable film, The Revenant. The movie, based in the 1820's Wyoming Rocky Mountains, in and of itself was beautifully made, making use of all natural lighting and the breathtaking wilderness scenes accompanying Calgary and Alberta, Canada, as well the trip to Argentina during shooting. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu also picked up an Oscar for Best Director even though the film came with its woes. DiCaprio and Inarritu fought blistering weather, crew defections, and ironically, a lack of snow for needed scenes, but the issues did not in the least tarnish the final product. In fact, the brutal filming conditions most certainly added to the film's overall authenticity.<br/><br/>Glass, in history is often overshadowed by the larger than life Jim Bridger, who also plays a role in the film as a strapping young fur trapper played by Will Poulter who is portrayed selflessly sacrificing his time and safety to look after the incapacitated Glass after a terrifyingly realistic bear mauling. But it is once Glass comes to that his unprecedented pathway into legendary status unfolds. Although the fact that the heavy driver of the film, the murder of Hawk (Forest Goodluck), Glass's half-Pawnee son, by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) is historically inaccurate, the immenseness of the film and the portrayal of the indomitable human spirit against all odds is tenaciously awe-inspiring making a little creative license largely forgivable. <br/><br/>The film is truly gritty, hard hitting, and it's immersive illustration of the dangerously beautiful frontiers life makes the modern day viewer's eye scarcely wander from the screen over the span of its near three hour long run. We find ourselves invested throughout the film as it conjures up emotions scarcely felt in the modern world and it testifies of the range of feeling a person can have, the unforgiving wilderness coaxing it out of each of us and bringing them to the surface.<br/><br/>There is a surreal and melancholic attitude saturating the entirety of the film, as long segments of it are devoid of human speech. It isn't needed for the most part as we see that the premise is set around a man who, for one, after the bear slashes his throat finds it painful and nearly impossible to speak, and for two, is alone in a grand and harsh landscape with only visions of his wife to keep him moving.<br/><br/>Maulings aside, we follow Glass gruelingly clawing his way from beyond the grave to outmaneuvering the incessant barrage of arrows whizzing past his head at any given moment to hurdling off cliffs, diving into freezing cold rapids, and TaunTaun-ing it up by settling into the hollowed out cavity the warm corpse of his stolen horse provides all to hunt down and exact revenge on Fitzgerald. Of which upon finding him spares him the death he deserves, albeit after an epic and gory slash and hack fight scene. The Natives, however, make an appearance at this point and make short work of Fitzgerald while somberly making their way passed Glass, allowing him the breath he needs to begin to make peace with all he's been through.<br/><br/>Throughout, the film is tense in every manner, but the underlying tone of the film whispers from the dust and gives us ever needed moments of relief through the masterfully incorporated vision scenes where Glass, in his agony beholds his lost and beautiful Pawnee wife(Grace Dove). She comes to him at his lowest moments, in one scene hovering horizontally over his beleaguered and beaten body well he wept alone and destitute, her dress whipping in the wind through the gray, overcast light. She says ""As long as you can still grab breath, you fight."""
"Tehmeh","9","0","1","15 April 2016"," Tries a little too hard, but it's damn impressive nonetheless.
","Revenant is a movie that almost everyone interested in it has already seen. So here's a useless review. I'll try to summarize my impressions in short, compact sentences.<br/><br/>There's an eerie feeling of ""being there"" when watching Revenant. The cinematography is majestic, and I would recommend seeing this movie for its visual excellence alone, because you don't have to be a film snob to appreciate the craft of cinema being displayed in a masterful manner like this. The setting - ruthless nature - is made to be hauntingly wide and cramped at the same time. It feels so impressive, so huge that it's about to swallow you. This is a good thing, and I loved the unnerving respect I felt towards it all.<br/><br/>Leonardo Dicaprio won the Oscar for his performance. It's certainly not a bad performance, but Tom Hardy delivers the best acting of the bunch. Hardy is so good that I developed a newfound respect for the guy. I already liked him, but I didn't know he was capable of something like this. It's a shame he didn't get the academy award. He stole the show performance-wise, and it was most likely my favorite performance of the whole year. If you have seen this film, you know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Dicaprio acts with his face and his groans. Throughout the movie, his character is suffering and surviving. I like how he's used here, because when he tries to do the accent (in the beginning of the movie), it's noticeable. I'm looking at the actor, not the character, and it takes me away from the movie. Because of that, it's a good thing to have Leo in a physical role for that reason alone. He does a fine job, and nobody can blame him for the lack of effort. However, it feels a bit forced at times. I shouldn't feel bored when I watch a character suffering, but at times I was. I know the movie is about suffering and overcoming extremely hopeless situations, but I could see the ""Oscar push"" at times. Parts of this movie that included Dicaprio's character overstayed their welcome. That said, his performance is memorable.<br/><br/>This isn't a deep movie story-wise. It's about surviving against all odds. It's about willpower and vengeance. We have seen this story many times in many forms, and while that's not a bad thing in itself, the story doesn't really grip you. If someone complains about a hollow story, I can't really disagree. Of course there are some cool things to spice things up: an interesting time period along with some (not really subtle) racial politics.<br/><br/>There are a few artsy dream sequences which try to inform us about our main character and also give us some breathing room, because there's only so much we can handle constant suffering. They succeed in what they try to do - and they are also gorgeous to look at - but they don't fit seamlessly to the rest of the film. Revenant is a long movie, and it also feels like a long movie. I would have removed the dream sequences along with 10+ minutes of groaning, but then again, there is something impressive in every minute of it.<br/><br/>This is a very violent movie. It's inherently brutal. It dances the fine line of being disturbingly violent without shocking the audience too much or throwing in gore just for the sake of gore. But If you are very sensitive to realistic violence, be warned. There is a scene involving a bear which is as stunning as it is horrifying. Yes, it's the scene you have probably heard about. I heard about it beforehand too, but nothing could prepare me for it. It was so well done, and I can't remember the last time I was genuinely shocked and awed in a movie theater like this.<br/><br/>In the end, Revenant is impressive. It's a little hollow, it can be boring at times and it tries a bit too hard, but this is a movie about the details. It's about the craft of cinema, the art of film-making and what people still can do with it. Hauntingly beautiful cinematography, quality acting (especially from Tom Hardy), great camera-work and a few memorable, stunning scenes. When the details of a movie are handled like this, it's easy to forgive its faults.<br/><br/>Recommended for everyone, except for small children and people with bear-related, traumatic psychological issues."

","'The Revenant' deserves all the praise for the artistry, cinematography and acting depicted in this film. However, there is a heaviness to this movie, but not in a good way.<br/><br/>To be fair, DiCaprio and Hardy shine with their performances with the latter being the more interesting. The reason why I say that is due to Hardy's character of Fitzgerald just having more dialogue as well as more interactions in the film. This being a story of survival, it's understandable why DiCaprio groans and grunts his way through the movie to the final act. He lacks in dialogue so it's hard to tell what he's thinking rather than what he's doing which is crawling and limping his way back home after a savage bear attack.<br/><br/>Only one person deserved an Oscar for a hand in this film, yet...it shouldn't have been DiCaprio. Alejandro Inarritu won his second Oscar for this as well he should have, cause his directing was brilliant. Of that same year, I saw 'Black Mass', and Johnny Depp's performance in that particular film was far superior than DiCaprio's, hence the reason I found it unfair, cause a nomination for Depp would have mean't another deserving Oscar snub for DiCaprio.<br/><br/>'The Revenant' is still one of the better films of 2015, but it could easily lose an audience just by pacing alone."

","Birdman was Alejandro Gonzalez Iñaritu's love affair, The Revenant is his marriage. In fact, this 2 and a half hour epic feels like it it's bound to leave a signature mark on the filmography this 21st century director genius will leave behind him. Paired with an incredibly dedicated and intriguing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, this visceral experience that takes place in the Louisiana territory in 19th century United States of America provides the main backdrop for the film. The film's greatest advantage is Iñaritu's innovative and characteristic use of camera – one that allows you to experience a story not through the cinema's seat looking at a picture screen, but through the bystander traveller position the director creates. Through his highly-intimate at times, while panoramic and aerial at other times style of filming, Iñaritu tells a story in a different way than the more commonly observed style of storytelling seen in American cinema. The story of the Revenant is one mainly told through the various emotions and mental experiences our lead character goes through. Instead of the director creating a narrative to explain Glass' past, he takes you into the mind-set of this man, the dreams he sees when he closes his eyes, ones that would fuel his spirit and give him resilience. Glass embodies the character of an incredibly courageous and persevering father, one that had to face incredible tragedy and misgivings in his life, and one that ultimately comes face to face with the ultimate tragedy: losing his son, the last remaining member of the loving family he once had. Through this movie, the audience experiences the vast array of emotions that a person can go through when pushed to the edge, like vengeance, and how when faced with inexplicable and unbearable sorrow, this notion alone can give you the strength to continue surviving. There is a deep hatred that is created when someone kills the one you love so much, and this hatred, and need to avenge his son's murder is what ultimately drives the actions of the character. We are taken along to get to see this man getting stronger and stronger , following his wife's advice, one he'd always give his son: When there is a storm, and you stand in front of a tree, if you look at its branches, you swear it will fall, But if you watch the trunk, you will see it's stability. We feel the intense pain seen through his eyes when he first sees his dead son, we feel his desire to remain alive every time he hears his wife's voice. The brief moments of bliss amongst him and the native, the kindness given by a stranger considered the 'enemy', one that was spared by his own men. We experience this human rise from that crippling body and finally let go of that potent hatred and let his prey's fate rest in the hands of god, the hands of nature. It is a story with such profound impact, one so rarely seen through this current list of already existing and simplistic forms of storytelling that so often feel unattached. Alejandro doesn't attempt to explain a story, he becomes the story, and together with the breath-taking cinematography of Chino, and DiCaprio's stellar performance, he allows us to not just listen to a story, but to experience a story, and become a part of it."

","This is a great movie and certainly worth your time but there were so many blatant mistakes in reality that after the first few, I started actually watching for them (to pick them apart). Whomever the wilderness-survival consultant was, on this film was daft. You don't have to be any kind of outdoors person to notice.<br/><br/>I found myself comparing it to the great movie JEREMIAH JOHNSON which is an epic woodsman - survival - frontier - wilderness movie. ( and since Im being reminiscent when is any one going to finally re-do Mrs Mike?) Leonardo DiCaprio is a fantastic actor with limitless scope but obviously he has never, ever gone fishing. WHy would an actor allow himself to look like such a fool so many times in one movie? Was he told they would edit those parts out? Sushi may be trendy ( is it still? ) but you would bleed like a sieve if you bit into a raw fish that had not been scaled.<br/><br/>There are other major mistakes in this film and you don't have to be a rocket scientist to see them, they're obvious. You would only have to go sledding in the winter when you're a child to be able to see the huge mistakes slap you, in your frozen little red cheeks.<br/><br/>Movies, of course, stretch the bounds of possibilities and I DO remember sitting my children down after they saw ROBOCOP and explaining to them, that in the REAL world, you cant shoot someone 22 times and rip their arms off and expect the hospital to fix you up! Thats the movies.<br/><br/>This film too, may lead some intelligence-challenged person to *chuckle* have sushi al fresco~ and in this world, it wouldn't surprise me if that person could SUE for being mislead.<br/><br/>I also have to make the point that you obviously don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that freezing cold water can kill real quick and ironically Id like to point out that Leonardo DiCaprio explained this in detail in the film TITANIC.<br/><br/>So I wonder if the handsome character in The Revenant actually may have had super human alien DNA which enabled to him to withstand the harshest circumstances that Nature can throw at him because, it was literally super human resistance.<br/><br/>Finally, put that all aside and ignore the ""misses"" on realism, and this is a great movie with a action packed story, and a well written script that very much captures the uncivilized behaviour and survival skills of men at that time period.<br/><br/>It has MANY memorable scenes that absolutely make it worth buying and Tom Hardy hasn't got enough recognition for his performance which was outstanding, raw, menacing and made me downright hate him. Which was a total switch from his role in LAWLESS. If Tom Hardy hasn't literally ""arrived"" yet, he is on his way to the top with a bullet. His versatility as an actor and his handsome mug is comparable to Harrison Ford and Robert Redford. Mark my words.<br/><br/>This movie is absolutely worth seeing and adding to your collection."

","The Revenant (2015): Dir: Alejandro G. Inarritu / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter, Forrest Goodluck: Gruelling and gritty film about facing nature, man and animal at its most extreme and secluded. Set in 1823 with a hunting expedition gone wrong when natives invade seeking blood and pelts. A few survivors escape blood shed on a boat but must take a winter forest route to avoid detection. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a grinding performance as Hugh Glass, a hunter and scout who is attacked by a bear and nearly mauled to death until he killed the bear. Tom Hardy plays antagonist John Fitzgerald who is a greedy member of the hunting party. He kills Glass's native son and leaves him buried alive. Motivated by revenge, Glass crawls, limps and presses forward for the confrontation Fitzgerald dreads happening. Domhnall Gleeson plays Andrew Henry, captain of the expedition who wants Fitzgerald brought to justice when he learns what happened. Will Poulter plays a young trapper deceived by Fitzgerald leaving him guilt ridden when he learns that Glass could be alive. Forrest Goodluck plays Hawk, Glass's native son who is subdued by insults and ridicule by Fitzgerald before being killed. Alejandro G. Inarritu follows up his success with Birdman with lavish and ominous images of snow covered forests as well as extreme violence including a chase that follows Glass and a horse over a cliff. It is a brutal and direct film about man's greed and another man's desire to strive through the valley of death to claim the justice when all is taken away. Score: 10 / 10"

","Just saw the Revenant! Any movie with Leonardo Di Caprio is great really! The movie Revenant was good and it had a great amount of beautiful scenery that could make someone appreciate the movie even more. This movie definitely showed a powerful aspect of how human civilization was very primitive and it was literally sink or swim in those times. Aside from the serious religious banter garbage I really enjoyed the movie a lot. This movie also showed a lot of historical events with how whites/Caucasian people robbed everything from the Natives in the first place and how it caused an intense war between the Natives and whites. I honestly love the accuracy of what some whites did to the Natives, not because it's enjoyable because it's not but rather because all the facts are being shown. I also, really enjoyed seeing the main character develop as a character of strength and determination. I really enjoyed seeing the corruption in Christianity with their history and their messed up values like every other religion though! I am totally sick of the god references though from that movie. But all in all 8 out of 10"
"jessica_lindimore","7","0","3","18 March 2016"," The Revenant -- Contains Spoilers
","CONTAINS SPOILERS The Revenant is a film that fits into genres such as adventure, drama, thriller, and western. The major actors within the film are as follows:  Leonardo DiCaprio – Hugh Glass  Tom Hardy – John Fitzgerald  Domhnall Gleeson – Captain Andrew Henry  Will Poulter – Bridger  Forrest Goodluck – Hawk<br/><br/>The film was inspired by the real life experience of Hugh Glass, a frontiersman in the 1820s America. Glass and his son Hawk were navigators on a team of fur trappers during a harsh winter in America around the 1820s. The film follows the team as they are hunted down by a tribe of Native Americans looking for the Chief's daughter. One day, as the team rests, Glass decides to venture on to look for the route they will be following, as he is walking through the woods, he is mauled by a bear. As it quickly becomes too difficult to care for Glass, the Captain asks who would like to stay with Glass while the others go get help. Hawk, Bridger, and Fitzgerald (who is only in it for the money) volunteer to stay behind. <br/><br/>A couple days pass and Fitzgerald decides Glass isn't going to make it so he tries to kill him but Hawk gets in the way and is stabbed. Fitzgerald then makes up a story that the Native Americans are close and that he and Bridger must leave Glass in a makeshift grave in order to survive. Glass, who is still alive, soon finds the strength to pull himself up and make his way to the main camp to get revenge on Fitzgerald for killing his son. <br/><br/>The Revenant and the film Unbroken are movies with a theme of survival. The Revenant also has a theme of revenge twisted within it. The entire movie revolves around the theme of survival whether it is the fur trapping team running from the Native Americans or Glass living through the bear attack to get his revenge on Fitzgerald. Survival and revenge play a role together in the sense that Glass would not have survived without that need for revenge on Fitzgerald. <br/><br/>The make-up and costume design was a technique used to help sell the theme of survival and revenge. After Glass gets mauled by the bear we see so much blood and gore that it makes the audience think there is no way he is able to survive. We see the pain Glass endures when he tries to stand on his broken ankle for the first time. <br/><br/>The camera work in this film was amazing. In one of the first scenes when the fur trappers are being hunted by the Native Americans, we see all different camera angles. The ones I found most appealing were shots where it looked as if the camera man were running away from the tribe shooting. You get to see arrows flying in from all directions and men dropping as they are being shot. When Glass is forced to float down the river is another example of great camera work. We see shots above water and then shots below the water level and it makes you feel as if you are right there beside Glass trying to fight for your life. <br/><br/>All in all the film is pretty good. I rather enjoy films based on survival, but not so much the revenge part. There are a few parts throughout the film I became a little bored and thought they could have cut some of the scenes out, bit again a good film and the acting was pretty amazing from all the actors involved."

Btw: What I particularly liked about the movie was the quiet which also seemed to be an unbearable element for some of my fellow moviegoers. In the rear row were 3 British lads in suits who had to fill these breaks with their constant tedious BlaBla. As I wrote in the title: this movie is only for a certain audience.

","The four-way battle of man vs. man vs. nature vs. himself has never been construed in the way The Revenant does in this Oscar-nominated epic survival film. Once again, Alejandro González Iñárritu blesses us with a masterclass visual poetry as he cements his spot into one of the world's visionary directors in cinema. The Revenant, inspired by true events, tells the gruesome tale of Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), an experienced frontiersman on a fur-trading expedition to a journey to retribution after being abandoned by his comrades. Stuck amid miles of harsh and uncharted wilderness, Glass is fueled by only two things to survive: his insurmountable love for his family and his desire for revenge.<br/><br/>Snippets of peaceful life and the sound of soothing calm water open the film, and we are subjected to this dream-like meditative state of life, a false security from the maelstrom that ensues in the next frame – when a gang of Hawkeyes and Katniss Everdeens Arikara Native Americans lay slaughter on Glass' fur-trapping team. In this thrilling one- take action sequence, the film's first arrow whooshes through a mouth and then a series of sheer carnage follows. Shotguns are fired, axes are swung, faces are bashed. For the love of pelts, the Peter Pan books taught as wrong—this is what war among aboriginals looks like. The film begins with a testosterone-driven start but in its entirety the film succeeds in bringing out heavy themes of loss and redemption.<br/><br/>Full review here: www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/the-revenant"

","This was the film which enraptured my mind long before when I saw its trailers. Innaritu always comes up with some soul wrenching stuff that stays with you for a long time even after watching it loosely. Creative thoughts, mind boggling scripting and beguiling cinematography all leading to a smart conventional film. And what else remains to make a film more grasping and scintillating? Leonardo Dicaprio with his not the best but enlightened acting steals your every nerve to praise the beauty of the film. This is the drama you might want to forget what Innaritu did with his previous Birdman. If Birdman gained an Oscar for a mild direction, this is a sure winner in most of the compartments. Each dialogues or I should say each quotes used in the film is inspirational. The scenes will seize your heart with all it's beauty and you might want to embrace it all after the movie. If you are in search for some stunning film this one surely is for you. What makes this film a little average is the pace it runs with in the second half. Leonard's character should have got some more words to share but it's alright as long as the film is more enlightening."

","Glass lives with the spirit of his slaughtered wife and in the last shot appears to rejoin her in the spirit world. Indeed the title may connote dreamer and avenger but it literally means a returning spirit. As he says before his last mission, ""I ain't afraid to die anymore. I'd done it already."" Hawk says to the moribund Glass, then Glass says to dead Hawk what he said to his dead wife: ""I'm right here. You hear me?"" The spirits are there to address. This rebuts Fitzgerald's last remark: ""You came all this way just for your revenge, huh? Did you enjoy it, Glass?... 'Cause there ain't nothing' gon' bring your boy back.""<br/><br/>The Revenant is a classic case of style over substance. Fantastic actors, slipping effortlessly into a range of clichéd characters, stunning cinematography, and zero emotion.

","After watching this film on the big screen, my second time overall, I was still in awe of this beautiful looking film. It's SO GORGEOUS, sure the film has it's other strong suits but the direction (Inarittu) and cinematography (Lubezki), two categories it won Oscars in, is so overwhelming I couldn't understand why a certain section of the audience did not find this a good watch. It is a very old school film it has this strong 70's vibe where the story is not told and is left for you to figure out. I watched this with a friend who did not enjoy this as much and suggested that the movie would have been better if DiCaprio's character Hugh Glass narrated in the film and spelled out his ordeals to the audience. I called my friend a pleb because I am a high and mighty jerk like that but on a serious note while a narration would have helped with the casual audience, it would also promote spoon feeding hand holding which has become the norm of today's films. The performances were great and a movie like this falls apart if the performances are not good they are the only thing connecting the audience to the film. Well deserved Oscar for DiCaprio, arguably career best performance from him, Tom Hardy was great too shame no Oscar though, some scenes were so intense I could feel it taking a mental toll on me of which the bear mauling scene was on the forefront. Overall a very visceral movie which used only natural light while filming and will stand the test of time, something which this year's winner Spotlight cannot claim."

","This motion picture excels in all facets of film-making, period. First and foremost: script/plot/story = completely compelling.

Third: Cinematography, which as in all truly great films is rendered so perfectly as to become an integral element that, without which, the movie would slip significantly in impacted meaning and significance. Fourth: Costumes and make-up, bringing savage wilderness to life for 21st Century denizens as we current movie goers most certainly are. Fifth: best and not overly utilized CG available to movies today. So, to bring all up-to-date, forget Scorsese and DiCaprio, as Leonardo has now fully matured and broken his chains to get and take the best dramatic role of his already-illustrious career. Sad note: Leonardo did not humbly accept the Oscar as recognition for his artistic contribution to film, but instead selfishly and egotistically used the long-overdue Oscar a a platform for his empty-headed political view of today's world. Kinda glad he hasn't reproduced by now, but this movie is intensely extraordinary."

","This is going to be a hard review to do. On one hand, you have a film that has breathtaking cinematography and amazing practical visual effects. Not to even mention the acting. But on the other hand, you have a movie that is designed for the festival circuit. It has the long pauses between scenes, the long exposure shots of nature for you to come to terms that the film only used natural lights and there was no addition of exterior light set up. Not to mention the length time of the story could've been done in half the time. <br/><br/>I have been a fan of Leo for a while now. I believe that he should've won for What's eating Gilbert Grape and Blood Diamond, but it wasn't meant to be.<br/><br/>Acting in the Revenant is of extremely high caliber. Leonardo DiCaprio does a fantastic job showing his acting range in emotion and through use of expression rather then dialogue as it is kept to a minimum. All of the cast did a fantastic job. Tom Hardy was better then what i was expecting, i have found that in some films he has the tendency to go back and do certain traits of his own, but in this film he was really kept to his character.<br/><br/>Story; as most people already know that the story is based on a book by the same title. It follows the struggle of Hugh Glass as he is left for dead after a bear had mauled him. The film really allows Leo the freedom to capture our attention and grab us by the throat as we watch him growl, cough, bleed and struggle to make out one sound. The story of survival and vengeance of Hugh Glass is extremely interesting and will have your attention. However, the constant cuts to the 30 seconds clips of nature and the surrounding forests or mountain rivers are beautiful but are distracting and in some way make you lose concentration and you start to wonder how long would this film have been if it was cut properly. <br/><br/>This is a great film, for those who love to capture and analyse every aspect of a movie. It has incredible visual effects, great acting, incredible camera work and fantastic score. But for those who are casual movie goers and just want to watch the story and are not as intrigued by the practical side of making films, will be left looking at their watch and thinking when is this film going to end."

","After watching The Revenant one is bound to impressed by certain aspects of the movie. One, with Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography. One just can't help but be in awe of his art. <br/><br/>Second, with the acting performances of ‪Leonardo DiCaprio‬ and Tom Hardy and in that order. DiCaprio's Oscar is thoroughly deserved. No argument(s) can justify otherwise, especially in comparison to the competition on offer. Given he gets to speak very little English, the part can qualify as non-English which puts DiCaprio in a very special league of Oscar winners. His performance reminds one of Tom Hank's gruelling portrayal in Cast Away. As for Hardy, he is undoubtedly robbed off an Oscar. It's his portrayal of a mangy mongrel that makes the movie deviously entertaining. <br/><br/>Third, of course by Inarritu's cinematic vision. The Revenant may far from being a great film (actually, that's for the time to decide) but it is nothing short of a bold statement which will inspire other leading filmmakers to push their boundaries. The film is more about survival than it's about revenge and that's where most people have got it wrong. Laymen may call it man versus wild but those with keener observation will perceive it as a treatise on man's symbiotic relationship with mother nature. The only way to watch it is on the big screen else you would be doing a great injustice to yourself.<br/><br/>For more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blog ""A Potpourri of Vestiges""."

","Watched a 4k digital version on a large screen (IMAX, but the version presented was anything but that). <br/><br/>Now, if anyone has seen Mel Gibson's 'Apocalypto', that movie can give you a fair idea on what to expect, both in terms of this being a frenetically paced set-piece rolling after set- piece, with the makers not holding back on period gore throughout. Tough to sit through, but its an experience of sorts. <br/><br/>What I was nevertheless surprised by, is how little of the main plot has been given away by this movie's trailers and many reviews. Kudos both to the marketing team of the movie, and fans who did check themselves while trying to describe their own experience while viewing this. <br/><br/>Other than 'Apocalypto', this one also shares DNA with 'Mad Max: Fury road' and 'Birdman: the unexpected value of ignorance' (Inarritu's own creation from last year). While the former comparison has more to do with the forceful and relentless nature of things, the latter comparison is due to the fact that we are forced to inhabit the same world that the main lead does, and follow him around throughout, from beginning to end. <br/><br/>The way this is made, hearkens back to what director Peter Weir might have been going for with his underrated/under-seen 'The Way back' (Jim Sturgess, Saoirse Ronan, Ed Harris, Colin Farrell), but did not quite get, keeping that one firmly in the almost-R/PG-13 mainstream zone.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy plays the heavy, interestingly reunited with his co-star from 'Inception', Leonardo DiCaprio, who has to be one of the most punished lead characters ever put on film. Will this work the Oscar magic for him though? Considering this is a very controversial year for the Oscars, even a win this year might just be considered pyrrhic due to the color of his skin (the controversy sheds light on a fair point, but this nomination might just not be a part of it).<br/><br/>All that shouldn't detract from the fact that this was well put together, from cinematography to score, direction to editing, and yes, makes this a superior movie to Apocalypto even.<br/><br/>I'm heading to the (censored) (L)I(e)max viewing this week, and do feel this is one for multiple viewings.<br/><br/>More thoughts from 2 viewing, on a (L)I(e)max screen, with ambient construction noise screwing up the sound design playing back, and one side of the digitally projected image flickering continually.<br/><br/>Observed that Domhnall Gleeson (Ex machina, About time, Force awakens, Shadow dancer, son of Brendan 'Troy' 'Calvary' 'Garda' Gleeson) acquired himself admirably, having the 3rd best presence, allegiance DiCaprio and Hardy (unfairly overlooked for a spring actor nomination, that, imo, he was a 'Locke' for)...<br/><br/>The other comparisons we could make, include 'The last of the Mohicans' and 'The Road' (even 'The Walking Dead'), and though I felt this was better than 'Apocalypto', overall, I still found this wanting in the action set-piece department.<br/><br/>I do know that I have to read the book this one's based on, especially to understand about the Sioux and the Pawnee tribes that are very much a party of this tale."

","Leonardo Dicaprio keep appearing in powerful movies with his impacting acting but keep denied to take home the academy award. This time I guess he will make it.<br/><br/>About the movie, it's a movie based on real life explorer Hugh Glass, about how he survived in his expedition while attacked and wounded by a grizzly and abandoned by his mates.<br/><br/>In the my opinion the movie is stretched about half an hour too much but still it wasn't a boring survival movie we witness normally. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu kept it pacey and eventful. The only cheers come from the audience is actually the last 15 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Dicaprio as usual at his best, he is just perfect for the movies set up in 18th and early 19th century. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy makes delicious villain here,to be honest I was never fan of Hardy even when he appeared in 'Dark Knight Rises', but in this one he really sparked. A true old fashioned villain who justifies his wrong doing, from stealing to killing.<br/><br/>And you can see Will Poulter in a completely different avatar if you still remember him from 'We're The Millers'<br/><br/>It was a real treat to watch if you like the movies from the American civil war era.

His face is so amazing made me really feel pity for him even though whatever he did. And Leo, He is great too, but i think sometime in this movies his emotion is a bit overdone and the scene when Glass eat uncooked food with a fire next to him i think it's an excessive sacrifice.

","Let's be clear, I've had huge expectations regarding Inaritu's ""The Revenant"". And after watching it yesterday night, I feel like I'm finally up to the task of writing a small review of it.<br/><br/>First of all, I'm a fan of Inaritu, and this is probably one of the most cinematographic movies I've ever seen. Some landscapes are just breath-taking and the way he chose to film some scenes makes me believe that, after ""Birdman"", Inaritu is showing himself as one of the best directors out there.<br/><br/>I've seen almost every Di Caprio's movies, and since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", I hadn't seen any role in which he had such great power. Really an intense performance, keeping in mind that they had to film it in cold conditions.<br/><br/>I have been disappointed in Tom Hardy's, feeling like he just thought ""Well, now that I'm bankable, I can just act in a basic way and still be acclaimed"" - apart from his accent, nothing too fancy to see in his acting performance in The Revenant.<br/><br/>2 hours and 40 minutes felt like 4 hours at some points. I think some scenes could've been deleted, or at least shortened.<br/><br/>The Revenant is a bit of a deception, maybe I had too high expectations. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, but not the masterpiece the critics are selling us.<br/><br/>This might be a ""light"" review, but since I believe a lot of you are going to see it, I didn't want to spoil or talk too much about the story itself and things related.<br/><br/>I rate it 7 out of 10, but keep in mind that if it was not for Inaritu and Di Caprio, the rate would've been much lower."

","As usual with movies I went into the movie with little or no knowledge about what the movie was about. The only thing I knew before seeing the Revenant was that it was hotly tipped for Oscar success. I'm sure most of the star actors must be teased about considering whether roles may earn them Oscar glory. Can't imagine that Leonardo DiCaprio didn't start drafting up the Oscar speech as he read the script for the Revenant.<br/><br/>To be fair there's no doubt that DiCaprio is very good in this movie and the fact that he's never won an Oscar before must make him a shoe in for best actor this year. He plays Hugh Glass struggling for survival in the early part of the 19th century. There's no doubt that it's an epic journey, but not one that I could ever really engage in. Couldn't help throughout thinking throughout the film that DiCaprio's next line was going to be be ""please give me an Oscar, so I don't have to go through this again"". For me it's a worthy film, but not one I'll be watching again anytime soon. Guess that sums up most films that the academy likes."

Each character has a strong personality in this film and Alejandro González Iñárritu definitely brought out the best out of all them. <br/><br/>Alejandro González Iñárritu keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat, delivering really intense action sequences throughout, and makes you appreciate movies a lot more.<br/><br/>Some of the viewers might argue that the film is too long (2 Hours and 36 minutes), but the film definitely has many action and thrilling sequences to make you forget about time."

","I went to the movie theater thinking that The Revenant would be a masterpiece, considering both its cast and trailer. The movie has a very significant amount of violence, and might not be suitable for all audiences. Even though it's a great movie, it has a few downs.<br/><br/>Every actor had an outstanding performance, with Di Caprio taking the upper hand. With that in mind, I believe that his Oscar is well deserved (which he should've won in The Wolf of Wall Street, by the way). Although the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat most of the time, the movie is very slow and doesn't seem to move forward which, combined with its cliché plot, makes it a bit boring sometimes. Not to mention that it's a very long movie (2h36min) that should have had a wider story to work with.<br/><br/>In my opinion, The Revenant deserves a 7/10 for the cast's performance and a few gore scenes that exceeded many levels."

","I went to see ""The Revenant"" on the day that it was nominated for 12 Oscars, which certainly sets the expectation that it is going to be good – and it is. But I saw it described by DiCaprio as an ""epic art-house western"" and that's a good description. In the same way that Iñárritu's ""Birdman"" (this time last year) was unarguably a brilliant but not very mainstream film, so I think the Oscar buzz will attract a big audience to this movie who may find it a struggle to really enjoy. Because it is bleak unremittingly bleak, in terms of the landscape, the weather and the motives of the characters. It is also extremely violent but, unlike ""The Hateful Eight"" (another film I saw this week that was unremittingly bleak) the violence is much more gritty, realistic and visceral making the drama a lot more compelling.<br/><br/>http://www.dua786.com/dua-to-make-someone-love-you/"

","Good movie. The (Canadian?) backdrop was both authentic and spectacular.<br/><br/>Lennie the Goat hammed it up as usual - I can never seem to take him seriously - but fair play to him for freezing for his art. Tom Hardy was mumbingly miscast as the bad guy trapper and went way down in my estimation. No one else took the eye - probably because they were all trying to keep warm. <br/><br/>But this is to miss the point - this movie was about the story and the wilderness setting, not the acting. Much has been said about the violence and gore. There were horse-guts loads of both and a lot of effort was put into making us all look away from the screen at certain moments. Most of the horrifying bits made me laugh out loud because they were over - contrived. The famed bear scene, although reasonably well done, was a hoot.<br/><br/>All in all, worth going to see unless you're squeamish about not-real blood and guts."

The story is great and the overall acting of Leo is great as well but the movie is a bit boring. I believe the movie needed to have a faster pace.

Just watching a man get the hell beat out of him at ever turn is surprisingly tiring to watch. The message of this movie is quite simple: The power of vengeance to fuel a man's will to survive. By the time you leave the theater, you just want to sit by a fire and sip some hot cocoa. <br/><br/>The visuals are stunning.

","The Revenant is a really well made film. Almost every shot is flawless, the acting is brilliant, the dialogue is great - you have to start nitpicking to find things to critique. Yes, you can see that they have used CGI a couple of times, but it still works really well. The movie is a bit long, but I never lost interest in it.<br/><br/>The story is at its surface a classical western, almost. Revenge, kinship, man versus nature, and so on. To me, the most interesting part about the movie was how it explored man as animals. You see the settlers looking at the natives as savages, and you also see the settlers acting like savages in front of the natives. If anything, this movie shows how cruel life can be, and how bad circumstances can bring out the worst in people. On the surface, there is a ""good"" and an ""evil"" side of this story, and the villain of the story is at times cruel. But at the heart of the conflict is the will to survive, at any cost. Humans are animals. The natives know this, and thus are more in peace with the horrible conditions. The settlers struggle with this, and thus turn into savages."

","Leonardo Dicaprio in yet another Oscar-nominated leading role. This time he embodies the most physical role of his career. Muttering minimal dialogue (sometimes not even English) all the while going thru hardship after hardship. He plays a man with nothing left to lose but a riveting will to prosper. <br/><br/>But yet again as we've seen in the past, Leo doesn't steal the show. The ensemble cast is terrific. Domnhall Gleeson is understated and professional, Will Poulter is the most relatable, being naive and trusting in a world full of selfishness he's a character we feel for. Tom Hardy as his leery self is as grumbly and mumbly as ever, he plays a despicable man terrifically. That being said his character is complex, not just another cardboard cut out embodiment of evil, instead he's a man of his time, ruthless and degenerate while all the while still admired albeit in a nasty way.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of this film are terrific but may come off as pretentious to some. Iñárritu and lubezki push the boundaries of modern film yet again, a period piece shot like a documentary sounds arty and shite on paper but on the big screen it is completely immersive.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect... Heavy handed in it's message and literally Gladiator in early America.

"brianberta","8","0","1","7 February 2016"," Iñárritu has impressed me a second time
","When Alejandro González Iñárritu directed Birdman last year, he showed to moviegoers that he was a very talented filmmaker. That movie had so much art in it and it was quite a mind-blowing masterpiece. When I heard that he was directing this movie, it made me wonder: What is he going to do to impress us this time? The trailer for this movie looked amazing so I was very excited to see this movie. My anticipation definitely paid off for this movie and I loved every bit of it.<br/><br/>A frontiersman named Hugh Glass is on a fur-trapping expedition deep in the forests of a territory of the Louisiana Purchase. After he is mauled by a bear, he is left for dead. He barely survives the attack and he sets out on a path of vengeance for the man who left him for dead.<br/><br/>Emmanuel Lubezki is my favorite movie cinematographer. He has shot so many amazing movies and he puts a ton of effort into all of his work. The cinematography in this movie is also very great. The outdoor landscapes are beautiful and majestic to look at. The scenes in the forest and the snowy landscapes are breathtaking as well. Like ""Tree of Life"", all of the scenes in this film were only shot in natural light. I could definitely see this movie winning an Oscar for Best Cinematography.<br/><br/>Hugh Glass goes through a lot in this movie. He narrowly avoids getting killed by Indians, he is mauled by a bear and suffers from the damages days afterwards, he is forced to watch as someone (I'm not going to spoil and say who) dies while he is unable to help him, he falls off a waterfall in a desperate attempt to escape Indians, a horse he is riding falls off a cliff with him on it in an attempt to escape enemies, and so much more. His character is really beaten up throughout the movie and he has to do a lot of intense things to stay alive. As the viewer, you cannot help but feel sorry for him for all that he went through. This is one of the few movies which doesn't need to provide character development as it is able to provide something which distracts you from it.<br/><br/>The action in this movie is actually pretty impressive. Its use of long takes, expertise cuts and camera angles, and great visuals makes each of them stand out. When I first watched the movie, I was a little worried that it wasn't going to live up to my expectations, but I no longer felt that after the first 15 minutes of the movie. The fighting scene near the beginning was definitely the best one in this film. It did a great job at getting me into the movie. It was very impressive because it used many different camera techniques to make it always feel original from beginning to end. It was a great way to start the film. Also, all of the other action scenes are pretty good as well.<br/><br/>Another big accomplishment in this film was that it depicted the characters, not as villains, but as another species trying to do whatever it takes to survive in the harsh environment. Their decisions and actions in the film aren't really guided on hatred and insecurity as much as they are guided on fearing what will happen to them if they don't do what they do. The final fight in the film gives us another viewpoint on the movie and it makes us speculate if Glass fighting Fitzgerald to the death is really worth it. Most of the violence from the movie comes as a result of self-defense. Even the character that comes closest to feeling like a villain (John Fitzgerald) is driven by fear rather than by hate. Also, the bear attack scene was the most realistic and intense animal attack I've ever seen in a movie and I don't think that it will be outdone for a very long time.<br/><br/>The acting is really great. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy do great jobs as the 2 main leads. There is actually very little dialogue spoken in the film. For most of the movie, the viewer becomes use to the environment and the viewer experiences what the characters are going through just by their facial expressions. Leonardo DiCaprio barely speaks anything in the entire middle section of the film. However, his performance is great just by his facial expressions. He shows to us how much pain his character is in and he is able to do it so great without saying much lines of dialogue. Hopefully, he finally gets an Oscar this year because that Oscar he has deserved for all of these years is long overdue. There is something about Tom Hardy's performance that I like so much, and I sometimes have a hard time explaining what it is. I feel that it has something to do with how his tone of voice. Every time when he opens his mouth, he always interests me and I become drawn to his performance. Both of them have a pretty good chance at winning an Oscar and I think that they both did the best this year by far.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is a visual masterpiece which has very interesting characters and intelligent action scenes. With all the praise I gave it in this review, it is not perfect because I feel that the middle of it could have had at least 15-20 minutes cut off of it, but that's my only complaint. Make sure you watch this film because you will definitely not be disappointed."
"cultfilmfan","9","0","2","7 February 2016"," The Revenant
","The Revenant, was a film that with it's style and the way it was done certainly reminded me of films and directors of past and present, but overall it was a film experience that I will probably remember for quite some time. The film is supposedly based on a true story which is not necessarily a bad thing at all, but when you watch this film and see all that the characters go through, I think you will also be absolutely amazed that people could have actually gone through and lived like this and even survived some of these circumstances and situations. The film is so life like with it's makeup and set locations to it's wonderfully real and yet beautiful and almost mystical cinematography that we believe everything that is going on before us and the film affects us that more deeply because of how realistic and life like everything is. The film with it's filmmaking style as others have said, reminded me a fair bit of the grand epics of Stanley Kubrick like 2001: A Space Odyssey, or even The Shining at times and then you have some dreamlike sequences and shots that really compliment nature and the outdoors and really make it an important part of this film and some of those shots and dreamlike scenes reminded me of the work of Terrence Malick, and how nature and just beauty even when found in tragic situations and circumstances is always there and how nature and the outdoors is really a huge part of us and some of those particular sequences are beautiful to watch and Malick always used the world's best cinematographers and here Emmanuel Lubezki does the wonderful and is sure to win an Oscar for the film and what is further interesting is that Lubezki has also worked with Malick, on such films as the upcoming Knight of Cups, To the Wonder and Tree of Life. The film also at times reminded me in style of Paul Thomas Anderson's grand epic, There Will Be Blood and again that was not surprising because the production design was by the great Jack Fisk, who worked on There Will Be Blood as well as working with Malick on Knight of Cups, To the Wonder, The Thin Red Line, Days of Heaven and Badlands (some of those films he was the production designer and others the art director), so I think you can see where and why I base these connections. The Revenant, is certainly an experience and an assault on your senses and I mean that in the best way possible. Everything from the visuals which include wonderful cinematography to the haunting and yet thrilling musical score to just being one in the barren wilderness all brings together a feast and visual stimulation for your eyes, ears and every part of your body. It certainly is a film to see and behold. The story to the film is a fascinating one and that does really make you want to see where and what it will do next. The film is longer in length and for the most part does a really good job of handling a longer running time. I also liked the whole aspect of man versus man, man versus nature and even man versus animals that was incorporated into this story and yet again transports us to the wilderness and how these men were living and shows that you don't need a modern setting, or technology to make a film truly interesting, thrilling, or action packed because in this period piece film everything it needs for such a thrilling film is all right on display at it's disposal and with the exception of one scene in particular, the special effects are kept at a low level and natural effects such as make up and real environments are used instead and I found that it looks and gives us a more genuine feel and overall experience with the film that makes it feel more real. Leonardo DiCaprio who plays the lead character here does go through the unthinkable and just how he has the determination and strength to keep pressing on and ultimately trying to right a grievous wrong is fascinating to watch. DiCaprio put his body through what must have been a really intense and gruelling film shoot that looks like it was probably the most difficult film he has ever acted in. The results are great however as he gives us one of last year's best performances and will be sure to win an Oscar for his performance. This is a film not only about survival, but also about what really drives us in life and what we set forth as our missions and goals in life and how we set out to seek them no matter how tough it may seem. How the film also incorporates the native people into this story and giving them interesting roles that were not just stereotypes was another interesting aspect I also liked about the film. This is certainly a film with it's beautiful and mystical look will amaze you yet with it's brutality and honest and realistic depiction of these circumstances and settings makes The Revenant a film you will not soon forget which is the best compliment I can give the film and I truly do mean it."

It felt like a homage to Dancing with the Wolves, Rambo, and pretty much any other wilderness/survival story that includes the moral dilemma of what to do if someone is injured and you are isolated in the middle of nowhere.<br/><br/>I found many parts of the film were unnecessary, and can't understand why the screen writers took such a large leap away from the Michael Punke novel (who also took some artistic licence with the original Hugh Glass story.) Hugh Glass never had a son or native America wife - this, for me, added nothing to the story but to give Leo the bitter motivation to hunt down Fitzgerald. I think they should have emphasised just how isolated and dangerous a world the fur trappers lived in, they were exploring the unknown wilderness of the eastern edge of the rockies, 300 miles from the nearest fort. He was attacked by a bear, and they did leave him for dead - as they were attacked by Indian's while waiting for him to die. This was another aspect of the story left out, just how dangerous the native Americans were. The filmmakers could have created a very tense atmosphere based on the prospect of Glass running into them at anytime (like he did.) They never emphasised how leaving him without his rifle, and most of his equipment was a death sentence in that environment. The book really shows the reader how the basic survival equipment and weapons each man carried were invaluable. This is what really annoyed glass, was he wasn't left with any of it. Making his survival all the more remarkable.<br/><br/>The french 'trappers' or soldiers were not needed in the story (they weren't in the original.) Neither were the roving band of natives looking for a stolen girl. They're were plenty of different native American tribes in that area, some friendly and most not. In the book, every time he meets a native American you have the nervous tension feeling wondering if they'll kill him or help him. Also, with the different band of characters quite regularly and often bumping into each other, you get the impression the journey spanned a relatively small area packed with people. In reality Glass travelled 300 miles alone south, while the trappers north. He then follows their footsteps, and faces many dangers along the way.<br/><br/>I watched the movie mesmerised by the cinematography and landscapes. But I never engaged with the characters. I didn't really feel much for glass, nor felt any emotions when he lost his son. The french were disliked, but so were the Indian's trying to find the missing daughter. I didn't really feel like vengeance was served when Fitzgerald meets glass. <br/><br/>Amazing cinematography but flawed story and unoriginal. w"

","I enjoyed this movie, even though at times it was slow (but not terribly slow). As most people here, I also expected more, but if you only expect an action movie, you will not be disappointed. Other than well directed action scenes and nice, occasionally beautiful scenery, the movie has nothing else to offer. Di Caprio is plain average, scenario doesn't always make much sense (Di Caprio laughing with old Indian only days after his son was killed), Tom Hardy played his part good, there is no climax to the story as it goes towards the end, there is no ""message"", no ""higher cause"", nothing of artistic value.<br/><br/>But still, as I said, if you think of Revenant only as of an action movie, you won't be disappointed (well, not too much)."

"Thanos_Karagioras","8","0","2","3 February 2016"," Fighting for survival...
","""The Revenant"" is an adventure movie which combines very well drama with suspense. In this movie we watch a man trying to survive after being attacked from a bear. His hunting team after trying to keep him with them they left him for dead. After this we watch him trying to survive by himself in the forest facing a lot of problems.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie due to its plot and for one more time because of the interpretation of Leonardo DiCaprio who played as Hugh Glass the person who is fighting for his survival. The direction which made by Alejandro González Iñárritu was simply outstanding with a lot of good action scenes which represented very well the feelings and the fight of this person for the survival. I also liked the interpretation of Tom Hardy who played as John Fitzgerald a member of Hugh Glass hunting team. Hardy played a different kind of role from the roles that he already has played and that was something very interesting to watch, the result of course was equally good.<br/><br/>Finally I believe that ""The Revenant"" is a very good movie to watch since it gives you the feeling that you are a part of the movie, feeling and understanding what obstacles has a person to go through in order to survive. In addition to this you can simply understand what a person can do and suffer if he has more important things to do than to care for his own life."
"doug_park2001","9","0","2","1 February 2016"," ""We are all savages""
","I was utterly entranced for the entire length of this long, sad, and starkly beautiful film and didn't want it to end. The action sequences—bear attack, attacks by hostile Indians, struggles with other natural elements—truly take the audience Right There with their ultra-realistic cinematography, costume design, and sound effects. Very good, often splendid acting by just about everyone, with special kudos going to Will Poulter as young Jim Bridger, and, of course, DiCaprio as protagonist Hugh Glass. Tom Hardy is also great as antagonist John Fitzgerald, a character who, no matter how much the bad guy he is, is still given a sprinkling of sympathetic qualities. The way that Glass and Fitzgerald resemble each other in both appearance and certain mannerisms is another interesting effect.<br/><br/>I've noticed some complaints about THE REVENANT's length, and I can see why many will find its 2.5 hours overwhelming and draggy in certain places. The main reason why I can't quite give it ten shiners is that its plot follows the same basic pattern of so many other western vengeance dramas, particularly in its rather predictable ending. Still, the unique details and twists keep this from really hurting the film. The sheer number of supporting characters makes it hard to place who's who; nevertheless, this was obviously hard to avoid and also leaves room for multiple viewings—I'm sure many will be as eager as I am to watch it again. Finally, some of the script/dialogue is rather flat and does not convincingly evoke the 1820s; e.g., ""Yep, the Indians are always stealing our s__t!"" <br/><br/>Some other notable things about THE REVENANT:<br/><br/>--Wonderful use of parallels in details such as the bear cubs left motherless, the lone buffalo abandoned by the herd as it's devoured by stalking wolves, and the old Indian left behind in the abandoned village.<br/><br/>--Amazing visuals of the Rocky Mountain setting and Glass's dream sequences.<br/><br/>--The fact that THE REVENANT is based upon a true story (taking many liberties, of course) and that most of its primary characters were actual people leaves room to read-up and dig a little deeper."

","The movie is filmed with very high quality. Also both Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy played they role great. Leonardo does deserve an Oscar here, it is definitely one of his best performances. <br/><br/>However, the plot felt very plain and boring to me. As if nothing really happens through the entire film. <br/><br/>Also, since I am familiar with the native American culture I found a lot of known stuff (tribe names and how they live), but I do feel that this information was not presented well to the public that is not aware of the native American people, their history and their culture.<br/><br/>I can add that some of the specific scenes were too unrealistic to be ""based on a true story"". You can say which scene is definitely NOT true, which I think spoiled the movie for some viewers.<br/><br/>In addition, there were too many slow scenes that present nothing specific to the viewer, they only made the two-and-a-half-hour experience a more unpleasant one.<br/><br/>To summarize, this is the best made movie that I'll never think of watching again."
"pokerten","9","0","2","30 January 2016"," The Revenant: The Return of the King
","Occasionally a cinema-goer views a film which acts as recompense for all of the others which fall flat and leave us disappointed. A film which offers an experience, and reminds us that a truly great picture must be seen in the cinema, on film. 'The Revenant' is one of these.<br/><br/>An American fur-trapping expedition in Montana in the early 19th century is cut short by an attack by Native Americans leaving the group of trappers stranded in hostile territory. Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), the groups tracker, is critically wounded and left behind at the behest of John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) who pleads that it is for the good of the group. The expedition leader Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) orders Fitzgerald and a contingent including Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) to bury the wounded Glass as soon as he succumbs to his wounds. The group ultimately leave Glass for dead, who then must make the journey home on his own - to exact revenge.<br/><br/>Director Alejandro G. Iñárritu executes another visionary project which raises the bar for modern cinema yet again. 'The Revenant' has a near unique aesthetic which was created with minimal CGI (a major coup) and an incredibly well organised team which shows us a very real world and allows us to focus on performance and character rather than one of the many things which could distract owing to poor quality.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this film is of apex quality - a certainty to secure a 3rd Oscar for cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, a master of his craft. A series of incredible set pieces remind us of why 'Birdman' won best picture. 'The Revenant' is easily one of the most beautiful and impressive pieces of filmmaking ever committed to the silver screen. In order to maximise the viewing pleasure, it is suggested that a viewer finds the largest screen in town.<br/><br/>Where the film falls down is when it is compared to the original film 'Man in the Wilderness' starring Richard Harris. In the original, our protagonist has a series of flashbacks of his life which inspire him to continue on his seemingly impossible journey. These flashbacks are critical in order to understand the resilience of the beset Glass. In the re-imagining, our hero has a far clearer and more tangible motivation - revenge. This renders these flashback relatively unimportant and contrived - and one cannot help but deem them a pale imitation of the imagined familial reunion in 'Gladiator'.<br/><br/>The film also seems to have a compulsive need to outdo itself constantly and continue to expand the action past the boundaries of plausibility, which is perhaps a requisite for a modern Hollywood picture. In the original, our hero merely makes the journey - an absurdity in itself. This is enabled by seemingly super-human healing abilities. In the newer version, our hero has recovery rates to rival Wolverine from X-Men. He also undertakes a series of breathtaking feats including extended hand to hand combat and a sequence where the character literally 'jumps the tree' - a set- piece which could make Michael Bay blush. The quality of the film earns it a wide margin of error on this part - but it is certainly tested.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a benchmark portrayal in the lead role. The performance does have an element of 'cut & paste' from previous roles. Extreme pain is an emulation of 'Cerebral palsy phase' from 'The Wolf of Wall Street' and steely determination is identical to aggressive denial in 'Inception'. I would not hold out for an Oscar from this film owing to the fact that very little is new in terms of testing his depth and/or scope, perhaps his next venture will gain him that elusive statue.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy steals the show with a brooding performance as the villainous Fitzgerald. A character who has a pragmatism which, for the more honest viewer, may be easier to identify with than one would like to admit. Hardy apparently lost out on being in 'Suicide Squad' owing to shooting delays - which I trust is a tiny price to pay when the final product was shown.<br/><br/>Special mention has to be made for the fresher faces in Domhnall Gleeson (Dredd, Star Wars: Episode VII) and Will Poulter (Son of Rambow, We're the Millers). One hopes these actors have laid a foundation upon which to build in the near future which may lead to more challenging roles and/or lead roles. This author has had a chance to observe first hand Gleeson giving a sterling performance on stage which dwarfs everything which he has delivered on screen - we wait with baited breath for him to gain the chance to exhibit his, as of yet, hidden talents.<br/><br/>One of the better films of 2015 and of the century. Not just a must watch film but a film which must be watched on the big screen."
"rubenm","6","0","1","30 January 2016"," Impressive or ridiculous?
","Watching this movie, I had a hard time deciding if it was impressive or ridiculous. But the moment Leonardo DiCaprio cut open a fresh horse corpse to crawl into it in order to protect himself from the cold, I knew it had to be the latter.<br/><br/>It was a pity really, because after two great scenes at the beginning of the movie, I inclined towards 'impressive'. The Indians attacking Leonardo DiCaprio's camp of fur traders is a wonderful scene. Not only because of its camera work and cinematography, but also because it shows the fur traders as a bunch of scared, clueless losers. The other great scene is the bear attack, which is a truly amazing piece of cinema that makes you wonder how it's done.<br/><br/>But after that, the exciting action scenes make way for endless landscape shots with trees reaching up to the skies, scenes of the wounded DiCaprio crawling through the snow and miraculously surviving in the harsh weather, and dreamlike flash backs of his Indian lover, accompanied by strange whispering sounds.<br/><br/>It became harder and harder to take this film seriously, after DiCaprio's character not only survives the bear attack, but also a fall in an ice cold river, an attack by violent Indians, a snow storm which makes him fall from his horse and collapse, and a jump down a ravine that kills his horse but not him. Also remarkable is that even in a fierce snow storm his companion is able to find dry twigs to make a fire, and that in this remote and sparsely populated territory, groups of people keep bumping into each other.<br/><br/>On the plus side: this is a beautifully filmed movie, with some very intense scenes and a unique view of the way the American wilderness was conquered. But did it have to be that long?"
"midas-jacobs","9","0","1","30 January 2016"," A beautiful shot, and well acted movie!
","The Revenant. In this movie, we meet Hugh Glass. He is a frontiersman. Together with a group, they are on a hide- hunt. But due to a series of events, Hugh gets attacked by a bear. After this attack he gets left behind for death by his crew members, and kill his son, now he is out for revenge for the one who left him behind and killed Hawk... (Hawk is the name of the son)<br/><br/>Let me start this part of my review of with saying that this was a goddamn beautiful movie.The director of ""The Revenant"" is Alejandro González Iñárritu. Last year, as I said in my ""Birdman""-review, he was a unknown man for me. He has this special style, and I really like it. There were a lot of spectacular scenes in the movie. (More on this later) The cinematography is so, so pretty. The landscape was brought into a beautiful picture. The editing was great to, which brings me back to the scenes. My favorite scene of the movie was the first attack scene. They made it look like it was one long take, without any cuts. Alejandro González Iñárritu did this to with ""Birdman"". But the brilliant aspect of this was, that there really are cuts, just hidden away, using CGI, or just skillful editing. Using this technique, they create a lot of tension. This scene also brings all the characters together. Due all of these reasons, this was my favorite scene. Throughout the movie, you can see more of these scenes (like the final scene, in the end, i'll talk some more about it). The costumes were well done. They looked worn out, and old. The make-up, looked fine. It wasn't easy to look at the wounds of DiCaprio, but the scars looked at moments not too good. The lighting was maybe one of the more impressive aspects of the movie. It was very good, but they only used real lighting! This includes fires, sunlight, etc. The music is the next topic i am going to discus. In ""Birdman"" there was a lot of very good music. So I went into this movie expecting the same, unfortunately I didn't get it. It was still well chosen music, but not as good as in ""Birdman"". The sound was good as well. The set design now. Well, there weren't really a lot of sets. It were almost all nature-sets. The set that was there, was the camp of the other frontiers. This looked very realistic to me.<br/><br/>The acting. This was amazing. Please, give Leonardo DiCaprio just an Oscar already! This guy was amazing as Hugh Glass. He keeps surprising me, with his acting talent. He didn't have a lot of lines, but his facial expressions, was already enough. The antagonist of this story is nature, but also Tom Hardy. Hardy played Fitzgerald. He was the person who killed the son of Hugh, and left Hugh for death. His character was the most interesting for me. He manipulates persons. Even right before he starts to fight with Glass. He starts trying to convince him, that he wasn't lying after all. He was good too, so he can get an Oscar too! :) No, I am just kidding, he was good, but I don't think that it was Oscar worthy. Another crew member was Bridger. Will Poulter played him. By his acting performance I was really surprised. Also by the screen time he had. I wasn't expecting that he would have such a big role in the story. His character was like ably. You felt sorry for him, when they beat him, because of something that he hasn't done. Like I have said I was surprised by his performance, because it was very good. Normally I am annoyed by his acting jobs, but this time I luckily wasn't. The leader of this crew is called Captain Andrew Henry, played by Domhnall Gleeson. Gleeson seems to appear in every movie I see. First ""Ex Machina"" then ""Star Wars"", and now here. But anyway, he was very good too. The supporting cast, was well. The one that stood out to me was the actor of Hawk, Glass' son. Forrest Goodluck played him.<br/><br/>The script was written by the director himself, and Mark L. Smith. The story was good, but not for everyone. There were some boring elements, and that's why I think a lot of people won't like the movie. The dialogue was good, even though there wasn't a lot. That was also a very impressive part. They managed to keep the story interesting, even with almost no one talking. This also kept me interesting, due to Leo's Fantastic acting. But now something more about the ending. This was also shot in almost one take, which made it very tensfull. The fighting was gritty, which fitted the theme of the movie. It was realistic as well. It was unpredictable, I wasn't really sure if Glass would win. Another 'bad' thing was the fact that they tried to put in the thoughts of Glass. I didn't really mind, but I can understand that some people will. I think that this was a thing to make us understand Glass better.<br/><br/>But overall this was a beautiful shot movie, with fantastic acting, and some good writing. It is not a movie for everyone, but I would still recommend watching this movie.<br/><br/>8,5/10"

","The main goof of film which was so annoying was the extraordinary self- healing system of Leo! It was so exaggerated and obviously no one in a real world could survive half of his adventures. Moreover, the concept of movie which is ""survival"" is an over-used genre and has been observed in many brilliant movies before like Cast Away. However, it is good to mention the movie conveyed a good sense about foundation of United States which was not unseemly from the director Alejandro González Iñárritu.

","Just saw this movie yesterday and it was great. It's about Hugh Glass who travels with a group of men through the mountains and is left behind for death after a bear attack. The power of the movie is the cast (DiCaprio, Hardy and Gleeson) and the way the movie is made. As a viewer I got the feeling I was there with them. It is very realistic and some times horrific. Most people, like me, did not get the end of the movie. It was very quiet when the movie ended and everyone left the cinema.<br/><br/>I left the cinema with the feeling that although this movie is wonderful to watch, when it will win some Oscars I think the movie (and the wonderful actors) will be overrated. I kept thinking about Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (2006) which was, in my point of view, a much better movie than this one. The Revenant was exciting and authentic, but from time to time boring. There is no doubt that the bear attack will become epic. But compared to previous results of other movies, like the one I mentioned, I think this one is slightly overrated."

"billygoat1071","Null","0","1","29 January 2016"," Surreal Cold Blood
","The Revenant tells the story of Hugh Glass in his survival after being mauled by a bear and betrayed by an arrogant fellow trapper. In this version, Glass has a son killed by Fitzgerald to turn this into a gritty revenge story. And it kind of works artistically, the movie paints the mood with absolute surrealism of grief and violence. Thematically, there was potential, but in the end it kind of shoehorns what could have been a painful realization. Either way, this is one of the most terrifically crafted films you may see in a while. The effort and ambition is shown at every imagery and that alone made The Revenant a pretty fascinating experience.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Hugh Glass brooding over a tragedy of losing his wife, which made him protective to his son for being a reminder of her. Then it cuts to an expedition of trappers who are hunting for pelts, then attacked by a Native tribe and escaped; Glass is with his son, though having prejudice by Fitzgerald for being a half-Native. Then you get the story; I think the added elements is for the sake of giving Glass a colder motivation of hunting down the men who abandon him in his dying condition. It is also made to bring this journey a grander theme of spirituality and morality towards the force of nature, but it's kind of a stretch at times and it never becomes subtle either. What hurts more is the final part where Glass ends up verbalizing the theme of what he learned in his suffering. There should be pain on that sacrifice he had chosen, then yet he manages to witness that reward he was seeking for. The final note already feels a little unearned, but the last part just made it feel like a betrayal.<br/><br/>Though what's perfect in this film is the filmmaking. There has been an interesting story behind the set where director Iñárritu pushes his craft, by even using natural light, and DiCaprio experiencing the dining struggle of the character. For the direction, it looks very magnificent, every shot of this film deserves to be seen in a big screen, it's just glorious to look at. But the most impacting are the images of death. The movie just pictures the coldness of the bodies like the loss of life is a big deal even in this image of fiction. This has been one of Leonardo DiCaprio's most committed performances, he had to actually eat a raw bison, if that's actually surprising to anyone, but the commitment is admirable and makes the performance compelling even with lesser words, we can see the sorrow and struggle in his eyes. The supporting are predictable great as well, Tom Hardy makes for an entertaining arrogant antagonist.<br/><br/>The Revenant is all spectacle, but really priceless spectacle that you rarely see in a film this mainstream. The ambition is too enormous that it somehow drops the ball at the very end, it would have been thematically powerful if it was more subtle at that final few minutes. But it's the experience that made it brilliant. I wish it was only about Glass struggling to rise back avenging his son, the added spiritual theme just doesn't work as it wanted to be when it starts verbalizing it. Just let the action speak whatever it wanted to say, because the movie is really terrific at visual storytelling. It's just a small misstep for a movie already this grand, so The Revenant is definitely going to be the cinematic ride of your life."

The story builds from the start and provides several climactic moments. At times there were a few points where the scenes were slow and did nothing to enhance the drama. The acting was captivating and Leonardo DiCaprio does an excellent job displaying the grit and vulnerability of his character. Some of the battle and survival scenes can be very gruesome and vivid, however it is carefully and intentionally done to make the piece more realistic. At times you will often catch yourself asking ""Is this really happening?"". This action/western drama could have looped-in the different story lines the plot alluded to. It would have helped to add a little more cohesiveness and understanding of Leonardo DiCaprio's character. <br/><br/>But overall it was a great time period flick that stressed survival, revenge, loyalty, honor, bigotry, and cultural partnerships.

"nclka1990","9","0","2","28 January 2016"," A beautiful and brutally overwhelming savagery
","Just a year after impressing film fans across the world with big-small scaled existential theater story of Birdman, award-winning director Alejandro G. Iñárritu returns to the big screen with 12-time Oscar nominee The Revenant. To say that The Revenant is something different would be an understatement. Here, the sometimes claustrophobic hallways of the New York Theatre is replaced by the wide open fields of nature in North America in the early 19th century. And with that, let me stop the comparisons and look at The Revenant as the unique piece of cinema history that it surely will become.<br/><br/>Storywise we are served a rather simple story about redemption, survival and savagery in the meeting of cultures with the meeting between white frontiersmen and North American native Indians. If you think this backdrop sounds familiar, then you are right. Despite it being told with Iñárritu's sense for detail and with fierce brutality, the story might very well be the film's weakest asset. The middle section drags on a bit too long and it is balancing on the edge of simply becoming an ""oh what can we expose Leo to now"" story. They are one more extreme situation away from crossing this line before a thrilling and extremely satisfying third half takes over the action!<br/><br/>What the film's story doesn't deliver, the cinematography sure does. Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki is surely the guy to follow right now; in 2013 he placed us in space with Sandra Bullock with Gravity, in 2014 he made us follow every step taken in Birdman, and now he takes us to the open plains, narrow forests and brutal struggles of Leonardo DiCaprio's Hugh Glass in The Revenant. His mix of picture perfect nature scopes and extreme close-ups of fights and heavy breaths combined with his almost arrogantly perfect use of natural lighting makes the film an absolute joy to behold! Quite simply one of the most beautifully filmed films I have ever seen. It will be difficult to look beyond Chivo for the third year in a row when the Oscar for best cinematography is awarded in a month from now. However, the constant use of blood, water and breath hitting the lens ended up as more of a distracting gimmick in my eyes reminding me of the fact (that you always forget) that all of this is carefully staged artistry and not the raw brutality of nature that you are witnessing. With that in mind, my hopes are still high for Roger Deakins' work in Sicario to be awarded. <br/><br/>As Hugh Glass, Leonardo DiCaprio groans, sweats, bleeds and yells his way towards his long-awaited Oscar for best actor. It is a tour de force performance displaying the sheer pain and unstoppable desire for redemption and survival in every single movement, sound or breath made by him during the full 150 minutes running time. Is it the best performance of his career? Perhaps not. Will he win the Oscar this year? Quite possibly yes! It simply seems to be his year with no other real standout performance of the year. In the supporting roles Tom Hardy and perhaps especially Domhnall Gleeson continues to establish themselves as some of the most exciting still-to-be-super-star-actors in Hollywood right now (if they hadn't done that already). Tom Hardy is an explosion of pent up anger, fear and brutality waiting to go off in a constantly imminent eruption and he steals the show every single time he is in the frame! Gleeson, as the his-father-bought-him-the-title-captain of the cavalry, is really growing into a forceful actor with a presence that jumps off the screen with surprising power and relevance.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, though, more than anything The Revenant is a showcase of what we are able to achieve technically today. From the mind-blowing, awe-inspiring cinematography to the frighteningly life-like animations of a certain bear, this feels like good friends Iñárritu and Lubezki letting us all know just how ground-breaking, hard-working and inspiringly devoted pioneers of the cinematic universe they are. Luckily for them they shoot with anything but blanks, and as such they succeed in having you captured and mesmerised despite a quite trivial story. Best film of the year? That I am not sure of. Most impressive production of the year? Without a doubt and probably of the last couple of years as well. A film that will serve as reference for our technological development for many, many years."

","Well, I am one of those guys that truly believe that Leo should have taken an Oscar for quite some time now. I am guessing he will get it for this one but this won't be his best work. Overall, the film was really really good. Breathtaking photography and realistic as hell in every aspect, from everyday life to the fighting scenes (especially the one with the bear).<br/><br/>I am still trying to wrap my head around the kind of quick recovery that Leo had, after being attacked by the bear, but it's OK. I mean, one of his fingers was stripped of its skin and then it was OK after I don't know, a month or something, which would be hard even for Wolverine! <br/><br/>Despite that, some of the scenes in the movie were really really clever and breathtaking, like the scene with the horse, the bear fight and a couple more.

With a similar plot, one of revenge, for the taking of love one's, the harsh and cruel reality that even the best morally intended man/woman does not guarantee a happy life.Redford wanting only to be a secluded mountain man, soon finds himself, with a somewhat family, the local Indian tribe after him and the discovery of a froze to death mountaineer of which Redford prides from his cold dead fingers, a 50/50 caliber Hawking rifle.

","<ul><li>RATING: 10/10 - The Revenant is about a group of hunters that have to run away after they were attack by the natives. One of the best hunters Hugh Glass is mauled by a bear, and the hunters captain commands Fitzgerald and Bridger to watch him. Fitzgerald leaves him behind because to end his suffering. Glass' son Hawk tries to convince Fitzgerald not to leave him behind but ends up getting killed. Glass is buried alive but comes back to get revenge on Fitzgerald. - This movie is brutal, and intense. I thought this movie had a really good plot, and it had really good acting from Lenardo Di Caprio and Tom Hard. The action scenes are brutal, bloody, and intense. And I gotta say that bear scene was so intense and you felt his suffering. Let's not forget the cinematography, my god it's beautiful. They don't use any spotlights, they use fire and the sun for its lighting which is pretty impressive. I liked that because it makes it feel like you're actually in the forest instead of a Hollywood movie set. Some people may say this movie is slow but I like it slow because it focuses more on glass' suffering and focused more on survival. - OVERALL: The Revenant is a really good survival movie. I recommend watching it if you can handle slow paced movies. I give the Revenant a 10/10 a masterpiece I would buy I blu Ray.</li></ul>"
"joelbrown137","8","0","2","24 January 2016"," My thoughts
","I watched this and the Hateful eight back-to-back, and I enjoyed this film much better. The directing is brilliant because the way that this film is shot the images are a piece of artwork in themselves. The director use a long shot duration and couple this with a good usage of sound the film is brilliant in it's directing style. The performances from the actors are also brilliant, Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic in this film because the performance that he gives as Hugh Glass is very good, even though he doesn't speak much but this reminds me of the character of Jason Bourne with the protagonist who hardly speaks. Tom Hardy is also fantastic, because both actors add a sense of realistic vibe to each character. However this is not a flawless film in my opinion because I have a hard time believing that Hugh Glass would have survived a bear attack of that scale if it was that brutal like film makes out. The other thing I have a problem with is the final fight although well shot, the fight would again have resulted in both characters being dead because Hugh wouldn't have had several knife wounds without a lot of blood. Other than that this is a perfect film and is with anyone's money to go and watch because this is brilliant."

","24 January 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza, Dorchester Tonight - The Revenant. I looked up the meaning of the word Revenant 'A person who has returned, especially supposedly from the dead' and that sums up this film exactly. I heard many differing opinions about this film before I went to see it so went with a very open mind. It's astonishing how a story told on screen with so little dialogue can capture your concentration and enchant your mind, Revenant did just that. Not for the squeamish, this film has lots of blood and gore, expertly displayed against the backdrop of winter, nothing makes its point more that the sight of red blood on pure white snow. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, a fur trader who is savagely mauled by a bear and left for dead by his companions, but as the title of the film suggests he does not die and we follow his desperate struggle to survive against the elements, the Indians and those who wish ill of him. A very capable supporting cast including Tom Hardy as Fitzgerald, a man looking out for only his own interests to the detriment of all around him. Some beautiful camera footage combined with a strong moody score and I think this film will probably secure one of two of the Oscars it's being nominated for."

With an enhanced aesthetic sense, Lubezki now presents us with scenes that will - for sure - in memory of all the spectators. The Director Alejandro González Iñárritu leads the show safely and to my surprise bet on a cast of mostly unknown actors like Forrest Goodluck who give us a masterful interpretation. Wild! ""We are all savages"" was written in a sign in the neck of an Indian hanged by French traders ... Could we answer this question: are we all savages if we are subjected to those extreme conditions: cold, hunger, thirst, death perspective at all the 24 hours a day ? As the main actor Leonardo Di Caprio: splendid performance! Incidentally, Di Caprio matures each film he performs and soon he will have his name engraved on the Hall of the Major Actors of All Time ... Nature: Who can will win it? Animals? Men?

","The Revenant is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It's an action packed, intense and very dramatic film that takes us in to a very overwhelming journey of Hugh Glass, a man who was left for dead and fights for survival. It depicts war in a very accurate, blunt light that will keep you at the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The film does tend to linger, a lot of scenes are dragged out, going on for far too long when the audience really just wants to keep the story moving. There were also a lot of dream sequences for Glass that were cheesy, to say the least, and I did not find them effective in being heartwarming or conveying the characters emotions. <br/><br/>The cast is outstanding, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers one of the most flawless performances of his career, playing a character more emotional, vulnerable than any other role he's done. The best scenes are the few between him and Tom Hardy, they both play of each other very well and their is a certain chemistry evident that made these parts very effective. <br/><br/>It did not hold back, which I really admired, the director was not holding back on violence, the cast did not hold back on their performances, everyone gave it their all. Though it has its flaws, Alejandro González brings us an incredibly unique and inspired film that was brought to life from his incredible vision, I would recommend the Revenant to anyone looking for a good drama or adventure. <br/><br/>After a member of his own team leaves him for dead, Hugh Glass fights for survival and hunts for revenge. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Leonardo DiCaprio"

I have to say this film is very brutal even when Leonardo DiCaprio's character Hugh Glass is violently mauled by a grizzly bear, gosh he ended up in a right state after that, realistically most people would not survive from a bear attack, even after this he would go into extreme lengths to survive. Other than this the film had a lot of parts where nothing was happening, this is what I mean by wishing the film had more improvements like DiCaprio going all Rambo or something but that's just me and my wishful thinking mind."
"nbiekert","9","0","4","22 January 2016"," Leo's Oscar?
","The Revenant hearkens back to many other classic ""ImdB top 250"" movies while maintaining an element of Innaritu's originality, as well as a narrative complexity which prevents it from straying entirely into tired cliché in most moments. Amazing visuals and performances coupled with intense action will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout it's entire 2 and a half hour run time.<br/><br/>For example, the opening battle sequence cliché hasn't been done this well or with such furor outside of may be Saving Private Ryan. The wonderful intermittent landscape shots (ruthless mother nature playing the role of antagonist just as vehemently as Tom Hardy's character, and is thusly afforded plenty of screen time) reminded me at times of similar shots in Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring, especially when the group of fur traders are trekking across snow-covered mountain tops. Innaritu even seemed to take inspiration from ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as the main character seeks refuge from a snowstorm by cutting open the carcass of a dead animal. Overall the movie reminded me the most of Gladiator throughout, a man seeking revenge on those who murdered his family and left him for dead. It's not a massive spoiler to say the movie even ends with a similar shot as Ridley Scott's movie, of the main character looking at a dream image of his deceased love.<br/><br/>Even though if you were harsh you might say Innarritu is recycling classic tropes, I think the Revenant matches up in terms of quality to most of the movies I have just mentioned, and Innaritu does manage to add his own original touch. Even though there aren't any 4th-wall-breaking elements as in Birdman, the spiritual elements in the dream/fantasy sequences gel nicely with the film's undertone of portraying nature as a godly and at times even supernatural force. A force that the Natives as well as Hugh Glass have learned to cope with. Glass's affinity towards nature and by extension the Natives is also represented by his relationship with his Pawnee son by a deceased Pawnee woman. This is juxtaposed with a scene where a French fur trader literally rapes a Native woman whom Glass ends up rescuing. Even though these two points quite obviously present an anti-colonialist narrative we have all seen before, the Native American subplot was presented with enough moral ambiguity throughout to keep me interested. The natives themselves were capable of immense cruelty at times, but at the end the only true villains were Tom Hardy's Fitzgerald...and the Bear.<br/><br/>If I have to justify docking a point it's because the movie did stretch my disbelief a bit on how many improbable events Hugh Glass actually managed to survive in a row, despite it being ""based on"" a true story and all that. I don't want to enter into excessive spoiler territory but the one situation that had me rolling my eyes a bit was when he rode his horse off a cliff at the exact spot he needed to in order to have a tree break his fall. All this in order to avoid being shot to death by angry Natives. Literally he found the only way to survive that situation through pure luck i.e. it will only happen in the movies. I think Innaritu may be could've come up with a better way to kill off the horse so that Leo could cut it open sleep in it Han Solo style?"
"rayarts","7","0","2","22 January 2016"," Insanely great directing and cinematography, but...
","When I went to see this movie, I did not expect anything, just wanting to see whether Leo should get finally an Oscar for this... The movie exceeded my expectations in some ways: The picture, cut, camera directing and cinematography altogether were absolutely amazing and very innovative. At least I had not seen anything close to this. It managed to give you a very intimate experience, especially of the fighting and suffering scenes of Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) - and there were MANY of both. On the other hand... there were some flaws in the plot/script. At the beginning, when the group has to split, the decision regarding this one person staying behind is just so illogical, that you can practically see the same moment the entire following plot. The Captain of the guys (Bill Weasley, mind you) surely is a greenhorn. And then, quite at the end, exactly the same Captain makes a totally stupid decision by going just with another man, instead like one day ago taking two dozens... Makes no sense, but serves the outcome. So this was some plot-bending for the greater good, I guess. And finally, there is the minor issue of Glass surviving his whole ordeal. I mean - really?? How much bad luck can a single guy have?! He survives about a dozen (you can count it) totally life- threatening situations, where each is like a chance 1:20 to survive. It becomes a bit fairy-tail for me at this point. Is it worth watching? Maybe. It depends on what you are looking for. The camera-work is ingenious, but the rest... oh well, it is just not a feeling-good-movie, I guess. Yeah. You should watch it. Unless you don't want seeing animals die. Gosh, that was the hardest, forget the hundred or so humans... :) Oh, and does Leo deserve the Oscar? He did great, but I don't think this should be the time he gets it. Even with all the suffering, bleeding, surviving, raw-fish-eating and sleeping in places you wouldn't dream of... No. Not this time. Sorry, Leo."

","What a movie! I give it 10 stars. I couldn't wait to go see it, so I went the day it started showing at my local theater. It was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The storyline was good, but that isn't what made it such an amazing cinematic experience.<br/><br/>The movie plot is loosely based on the life of a real life fur trapper named Hugh Glass, around 1820. Hugh Glass is played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He is seriously injured from being attacked by a large grizzly bear, while game hunting alone. The men he's with hear his cries for help , and take care of his wounds. John Fitzgerald, played by Tom Hardy is really great, but his mumbling is hard to understand at times. <br/><br/>Hugh Glass is abandoned, because he becomes a burden to carry in the frozen, remote wilderness, according to one of the men. Now it's a fight for survival in the unforgiving freezing wilderness. He is driven to survive to seek revenge for betrayal and the cold- blooded murder of a loved one. The freezing cold isn't his only obstacle.<br/><br/>It definitely isn't your run of the mill revenge and survival story. Alejandro Inarritu's awesome directing and Emmanuel Lubezki's beautiful cinematography are what makes the movie so awesome for me. Lubezki's cinematography of the beautiful freezing wilderness, and the dreamlike imagery drew me into the movie. Only natural light is used, which enhances the beautiful scenery even more. I was so drawn into the movie that I often felt cold. So realistic.Now that has to be good movie making if you have that kind of effect on your viewers.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio does deserve the Oscar and likewise for Alejandro Inarritu. Lubezki should receive an Oscar for his gorgeous cinematography.I recommend you to go see this movie at a movie theater. The bigger the screen the better. Also, there were some gory scenes, but I've seen worse. A very intense, gripping beautiful movie. Breathtaking in so many ways. If you're looking for a movie with a lot of profanity and like movies you've seen before, then you might not enjoy ""The Revenant."" Also, it's got some tear jerking scenes. Best movie of 2015 in my opinion."
"walion","10","0","4","22 January 2016"," Greatest Leonardo Di Caprio role that will last for decades.
","Leonardo Di Caprio as Hugh Glass (a frontiersman and the 19th century Bear Grylls) brings us his career peak performance, one that will be remembered for decades ahead as one of the most compelling and most ravishing in movie history, shoulder to shoulder with legends like Marlon Brando (Don Corleone) and Heath Ledger (The Joker).<br/><br/>Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu and produced by Markus Barmettler, ""The Revenant"" steals the show as one of the most wondrous adventure drama movies in the last few years, along with Emmanuel Lubezki's flawless cinematography (Birdman, Gravity) that can only be compared to Steven Spielberg's work and his marvelous long takes. All that is mingled with the masterpiece score by Carsten Nicolai and Ryuichi Sakamoto, music geniuses that offer us a soundtrack that seals in our memory and refuses go away for quite a while after watching ""The Revenant"". This amazing score compensates for the lack of dialogue and monologue in some of the scenes.<br/><br/>Set in the 19th century, ""The Revenant"" unfolds the story of the frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo Di Caprio),who is attacked by a grizzly bear and then left for dead by his fellows, among whom are his half-American half-Indian son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and 7 more men of his village, which had been previously attacked and scavenged by the American natives. After witnessing the murder of his son right before his eyes Hugh Glass has nothing to live for except the journey he's embarking on, ergo he's forced to experience the Man-vs-Wild story, which he's all by himself in, seeking revenge for his stabbed-to-death son. We can see elements from Bear Grylls and Killing Season during some of the scenes, especially the horse one, which recalls memories of Bear Grylls in the desert trying to fit in that dead camel. Amazing.<br/><br/>It's not only the cinematography and the astonishing directing that leave us dazzled, but also the breath-taking landscapes and the ""small"" detail that the movie is not shot in a studio, and that moment and every scene seems extremely genuine and real.<br/><br/>Utterly gripping adventure survival story that holds us on the edge of our seats with alluring performances by Di Caprio and Hardy, who entirely and perfectly fit their characters' demeanors, to give us that kind of astonishing performances worthy of being revered and loudly applauded."
"bdbsimonsen","8","0","1","22 January 2016"," How Much Pain Can DiCaprio Take?
","The Revenant (2015)<br/><br/>Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu The Revenant follows the true story of the frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) who was raped by a wild Grizzly Bear (no not really, just attacked, although in some shots it... never mind, lets just say he's hurt very badly) and left for dead in the wilderness in the 1820's.<br/><br/>From its opening, the film establishes a cold and brutal environment seen through beautiful long takes and stunning, vivid landscapes, which all work together to convey a tremendously unsettling unpredictability from start to finish. Inarritu clearly utilises the skills he picked up from Birdman and puts them to even better use here. This is a cinematic film in every sense of the word from its incredibly wide and immersive visuals which, at times, make you feel surrounded by action, to its loud, at some points, booming score and terrific performances.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, if this is the film that finally gets Leo that Oscar, I for one will be happy. He is perfect. His co-star Tom Hardy demonstrates an unusually cruel yet as usual hard to understand performance, I must admit the subtitles at my screening were for once a welcomed aide in deciphering the Hardy grumble. That being said, together with Domhnall Gleeson (who by the way has probably had the best year of his career already) who also does a great job in this movie, the cast all round was pretty spectacular.<br/><br/>Okay, now to some of the bad. First off, it's long... very long. At two hours and thirty-six minutes the movie does test the viewers patients, especially when every scene is colder and more painful than the one before. However if you enjoy watching Leonardo DiCaprio going from a bad situation to a worse for 156 minutes, this won't bother you. I will admit that the film slows down at a point where I felt it didn't need to and so begins to drag, but DiCaprio's performance was strong enough to keep me engaged through the entire run time, however I also have to acknowledge that this won't be the case for everyone.<br/><br/>Secondly, in at least two dialogue scenes, the person talking was clearly not the voice we were hearing, since the sound and the moving mouth were completely out of sync. I'm not quite sure if this was a stylistic choice, since the likelihood of it having accidental slipped through editing seems unimaginable, but In any event, it completely pulled my attention away from the film and made me wonder what the hell was going on.<br/><br/>In truth, this is a film unlike any that I've ever seen; the visuals alone are incredible to the point where I have no idea how they were able to capture them with a camera. (I mean the bear scene, how did they film that? No seriously... how? Watch it, tell me, I need an answer.) If that isn't impressive enough it is worth pointing out that the movie was made without the use of studio lighting, that means: the sun, the moon, live fires and that's it. Additionally you will never have the right to feel cold after watching this film, ever. However cold you think you could be, Hugh Glass was probably colder. It is abundantly clear that this movie was made for the big screen and demands to be viewed as such, so go watch it, go watch it big.<br/><br/>The Revenant: 8.4/10"

I have been aware of this movie for quite sometime and I was already curious when I saw the trailer, but now that it had a high rating, it had my attention (see what I did there?).<br/><br/>Forget about the plot synopsis, I'm just going to tell you my thoughts on the movie. It's pretty good. It obviously looks incredible and Emmanuel Lubezki is probably going to win his third Oscar in a row (after Gravity and Birdman). <br/><br/>What struck me the most about this ambitious film is how well it captures the feeling of being out in the cold, just trying to survive with the possibility that you might not make it home. With a running time of 156 minutes, the film feels like it's four hours long. The pacing is intentionally slow and really allows us to suffer alongside Dicaprio as he endures plenty of discomfort (saying it like that feels like an understatement). <br/><br/>However, there was very little about the story and characters that resonated with me. It's not bad, but I didn't feel like it was great either. It also doesn't help that you can't understand what they're saying part of the time. Tom Hardy does a lot of talking in one scene early on but all I understood were select words here and there. I get that they were probably trying to go for a sense of realism, but if a character is talking for a few minutes, what they have to say is most likely important and we should at the very least here most of it. But I didn't and think there are many others that are in the same boat. <br/><br/>So be sure to check out The Revenant, I didn't find it amazing, but you might and even if you don't, it is certainly a unique experience."

The Revenant is full of beautifully filmed camera angels and nature which make the world believable. Iñárritu is also good in being different, but got fully recognized for this just last year with the one camera movie Birdman. Of course to have a great movie you also need a great cast. Iñárritu worked and gave us mesmerizing roles from the likes of Brad Pitt, Naomi Wats, Michael Kiton, Edward Norton and now Tom Hardy and Leo D. Caprio. Both played their role perfectly and it would not be unfair to give them both Oscars. So where is the problem? Unfortunately in the story.

Then he made a cynical movie about theater simply for Oscar critics that was pretty good called Birdman, won the Oscar.<br/><br/>With that win, he finally has financial backing and self-esteem because this is his first great movie. Cinematography is beautiful and should win an award (aided by great fx).<br/><br/>It's solid, a fun trainwreck, pretty, has heart, interweaves beautiful dream sequences coherently that help tell the story. The acting is top notch.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the plot is generic. There's really one plot point, and it's the oldest in the book. And anything else, yeah we already know people love their family and sh-t. Great, but not best picture good. Mad Max deserves it."
"Andy-Pennsylvania","9","0","4","21 January 2016"," Beautiful cinematography with outstanding performances
","What is there to say about this film that hasn't already been said 100 times? It's shot beautifully with amazing landscapes and haunting imagery. Some of the action sequences, particularly some of the early moments of the film, are totally unforgettable and will leave you with that open-mouthed ""how did they do that"" look on your face. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy completely disappear into their roles. I think it's time to hand them both Oscars. <br/><br/>The only thing that stops me from giving it a perfect 10 is the story. In the end, it's more or less a pretty simple story of revenge and survival, which is great and very well executed, but I guess I was just hoping for a little more to it. Then again, I can't really come up with anything, so maybe this will iron itself out with a couple more viewings. I'd recommend this to just about any film fan, certainly those that enjoy the work of DiCaprio and Hardy, who probably have never been better."
"ArchonCinemaReviews","8","0","3","21 January 2016"," Fantastic, brutal, bloody and beautiful but not flawless
","Alejandro González Iñárritu cemented his place in the Hollywood film scene last year with his tremendous undertaking Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). After sweeping the 2015 Oscars he did not waste a moment and immediately dove into his next project, The Revenant, which has garnered him an equal amount of love this awards season.<br/><br/>The simplest way to describe the film without spoiling any aspect of the plot would be to say The Revenant is about one man's physical, spiritual and emotional journey to survive against the unlikeliest of circumstances. Set in the blisteringly cold woodlands in the 1820s, a frontiersman named Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) lead an American expedition for animal pelts led by Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). When they come under attack by Native Americans, their mission is abruptly cut short as they flee for the sake of saving their own lives. Barely far enough to rest, their significantly smaller group suffers a painful blow and Glass is viciously attacked by a tremendous bear. What follows are several difficult decisions of will and morality at a time when the savagery of men was a commonality.<br/><br/>The Revenant is reminiscent of an unveiled western, removing the shiny artificial nostalgia that clouds the truth of the time. Mark Smith and Iñárritu's narrative is one you will recognize if you are a fan of films of that era, the difference between the two is The Revenant does not attempt to mislead audiences into believing in the blindly naïve good guy versus bad guy dichotomy when it was inevitably a grey-er time. So how can such a simple story stand apart so easily as the prestigious front runner of the Academy Awards? The answer is equally as simple, with amazing cinematography and superior techniques in direction.<br/><br/>Ask anyone what they thought of the film and their first comment will be how beautiful the film is, this is true of someone who is 27 and also of someone who is 95 (trust us on this one, we did the research). They speak the truth; the landscape and cinematography are beautiful in the purest form of the word. Have you ever been some place so breath taking that you refused to take a picture because it wouldn't do it justice? The Revenant captures that awe inspiring beauty that eludes so many of us. Emmanuel Lubezki truly out did himself with this piece and solidifies his position as one of the best cinematographers of the age.<br/><br/>The direction is also impressive but not nearly as flawless, though it is in its technique. Iñárritu's use of movement and his fluidity for transitions and cuts is revolutionary, especially in the beginning of the film. Alejandro has a vision through the camera lens and uses it as a point of view for the on looker and as a complement to the character's line of sight, yielding a complex and multidimensional direction. And yet, despite these achievements, the film felt lacking at its completion. We're aware of the secondary component of symbolism, still, the film did not feel whole. Fantastic, wonderful, but missing that intangible spark that forces a film to resonate with you and leaves you blissfully satisfied. Further, while beautiful to watch, the film was unnecessarily two and a half hours long when it truly did not have to be.<br/><br/>Watching the film, it is impossible to be so engaged in the film that you forget you are watching a story played by actors, partially due to the brutal natural conditions. The environment these actors endured are some of the most extreme any artist could encounter, especially for DiCaprio, but does that alone warrant the level of commendation the film has been receiving? The actors do a fine job but their characters are not unique and their performances not mind blowing, though Tom Hardy's performance is certainly the stand out of the film. Yes, their trust and faith in their director and to the material is admirable, as is their commitment to braving these conditions for the sake of art but where is the line drawn?<br/><br/>Hopefully this criticism is not mistaken for disdain because the film is a powerhouse, but it has very tangible weaknesses that detract from the overall experience. Bloody and beautiful but an unremarkable narrative except in its brutality.<br/><br/>Please check out the Archon Cinema Reviews website for full reviews of all the 2016 Oscar nominees."

","This is a terrific film but I do agree with the reviewer who said it's one of the best films they will never see twice. It's an epic: a remarkably compelling film as we follow Leo through his battle for survival to ultimate revenge. It's the sort of film they don't really make any more. But they just did.<br/><br/>There are some amusingly gory scenes. The bear attack is brilliantly done but the scene which out-ranked it for disgust was when he climbed inside the horse. Well, if it was life or death you would, wouldn't you?<br/><br/>The cinematography is just astonishing. Simple as that. It's stunning.<br/><br/>My only real criticism is that it's so hard to hear a lot of the words. The mumbling is on a level never before encountered. <br/><br/>There are two stand-out performances.

"davidgee","7","0","3","21 January 2016"," Not the Last of the Mohicans
","There's a big Oscar buzz about this movie, which may have as much to do with it having been a gruelling location shoot as to do with the performances. Yes, DiCaprio is in terrific form, but so is Tom Hardy as the nastiest of the trappers, all of whom communicate mostly in grunts and mumbles. This film has the least intelligible dialogue since BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. <br/><br/>The real stars are the director and cinematographer. The landscape plays the kind of dominating role that it always did in a David Lean movie. Alejandro Inarritu is perhaps Lean's true heir. And the film is beautifully scored. Soaring music and lingering snowscapes: pure David Lean. Glass's visions of his murdered native American wife (and son) provide poignant moments and provide a welcome contrast to the violent scenes which have the full-on shock of a body-horror flick.<br/><br/>For me the story is told a little (maybe a lot) too slowly, making this a beautiful, yes, but, oh dear, a very long movie (2 hours 36). There have been quite a few 'Survival' pictures over the years (DELIVERANCE, CAST AWAY, etc. etc.) and now we see Survival documentaries on TV all the time. The movie I found myself comparing this to was THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, which had many of the same elements - frontiersmen, 'friendly' as well as hostile Indians, battles against the French - together with an epic love-story, great music and great photography. What THE REVENANT crucially lacks is pace (and clear diction)."
"pyrocitor","7","0","1","14 January 2016"," Those who live in Glass houses
","The Bear Necessities. The Passion of the Leo. Or, (my personal favourite), Quaaludes: The Movie. I knew something was amiss when I caught myself drumming up doofus monikers for Alejandro González Iñárritu's gruelling frontier follow-up to his Oscar-winning Birdman, rather than being immersed in its sweeping, blistering journey. On paper, everything was in place for a rugged masterpiece. So, watching The Revenant, why was my disrespectful mind still fumbling for pic-in-ic basket puns instead of being mesmerized by poor ""Heyyyyy Lee-o""? <br/><br/>Arguably, in the face of the unrepentant agony on screen, my mind overcompensated with silliness. It's a decent point. Sadly, 'point' is another word that consistently elbowed its way into my brain - as in, ""what's the?"". Like Werner Herzog's similarly Sissyphissean Fitzcarraldo, Iñárritu subjects his cast and crew to comparable suffering to the story's characters to feel the weight of real adversity. But Fitzcarraldo was governed by a gleaming beacon of a core idea meditating on the sacrifices warranted for art. The Revenant anchors itself on wilful doubt. And, like its craggy, icy terrain, it's hard to find solid footing therein. <br/><br/>The Revenant is not a poor film. In fact, it teeters so close to masterpiece that its slew of creative decisions standing in the way make it all the more frustrating for having opened the the conversation of grandeur, rather than simply settling for pulpy survival epic. As a sensorial experience, Iñárritu's work here is astonishing, almost unprecedented. Indeed, there's an argument to be made for Canada being the most worthwhile 'Best Actor' candidate here, as, on several levels, it's nature that's really the star of the show. Superstar-cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's famous use of only natural lighting is astonishingly evocative. A sumptuous barrage of whirling snow squalls and rivers serenely dribbling amidst sprawling tree trunks, Lubezki delivers - hyperbole-free - some of the most exquisitely expressive wildlife panoramas ever captured on film here. Pair the stunning visuals with Ryûichi Sakamoto and Alva Noto's sparse, agonizingly moving musical score, and we're reminded that 'take your breath away' is more than an expression. <br/><br/>But Iñárritu loves his dichotomies, and with such beauty inevitably comes suffering. And here's where the 'but' comes in. Iñárritu strives for rugged verisimilitude at all costs - dialogue is naturalistic, muddy, and almost nonexistent; performances are beleaguered yet unshowy, each actor ground down to the nub, exposing the shards of truth therein. However, the execution is uneasily disjunctive with Iñárritu's natural flamboyance as a filmmaker. Fishing for connective tissue, Iñárritu sprinkles in inane, surrealistic dream sequences/flashbacks of Glass' ethereal First Nations wife. This sort of preening pretentiousness fit the smarmy absurdity of Birdman perfectly, but it's cloying and distracting here, and the pacing lurches as consequence. <br/><br/>As such, many of the film's livelier sequences - a visually jaw-dropping assault on the frontiersmen by a First Nations tribe, fraught with kinetically swooshing bloodshed, is the most memorable - juxtapose their grit and hyper-violence with balletic cameras and concussive sound editing. This tension lends the scene a curiously detached, almost adolescent playfulness, which sabotages its visceral integrity. Several scenes of Glass' ruthless survival tactics play for unintended laughs - I dare you to watch him disembowel a horse and sleep in its carcass without the word 'Tauntaun' gallivanting through your mind. The same goes for the film's definitive setpiece: Glass' grisly mauling by bear. The duelling tensions of ferocious realism and ostentatious showiness never quite click, leaving the viewer in sensory overload between DiCaprio's squeals of pain and the noxiously claustrophobic camera-work and (thankfully) CGI bear. I should have felt ill from the scene's graphic intimacy. Instead, my brain incessantly chanted ""BEAR FIGHT"", a-la Anchorman, as I waited for the noise to end. <br/><br/>This brings us to DiCaprio. He's a stupendous actor, investing 300% in agonizing, method torment here. In fact, the shoot is so tangibly harsh, it's hard to distinguish DiCaprio's acting from simply reacting to the abominable circumstances he is thrust into. Sadly, Iñárritu's insistence on broad characterization - Glass as a force of nature - does DiCaprio no favours. We are given no character backstory, almost no dialogue, no character arc, and virtually no means of personal connection to Glass apart from his affective suffering, and DiCaprio's star appeal. While The Martian continually fought to build character and connection throughout solitude, DiCaprio's work increasingly feels less like a performance and more an episode of Man vs. Wild (and even Grylls peppers humour and humanity throughout) - an entirely physical journey of abject asking audiences to spend two and a half hours with a man they know virtually nothing of apart from his grunts and winces. It's a tragic waste.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson do their best to amend this opacity. They're superbly, furiously emotive, both tenaciously craving moral order amidst the madness of the woods. It's a shame Iñárritu doesn't focus more on their relationship than Glass. It's more of a shame that marble-mouthed Hardy's speech (a SPEECH! So many words! I missed them so!) - ""God is a squirrel, and I ate that motherf*cking squirrel""?! - is so indecipherable; the film could ravenously use more of its delicious deliriousness. <br/><br/>Most disappointing is, stirring visual poetry aside, how thematically empty The Revenant's antiquated, macho parable of survival and vengeance feels. Flourishes fish for mythology- subverting subtext - a far more interesting subplot involving a First Nations band searching for an abducted girl, and the slippery politics of bartering with French Canadian trappers - but are unceremoniously jettisoned for more long takes of Glass groaning. Gorgeous or not, it's hard not to call Iñárritu's bluff, and assume he set out in the woods to find meaning in the suffering of Hugh Glass, only to conclude, panting in the snow, as robbed of closure as his hero. But, like Glass, Iñárritu finds as much beauty in his journey as irresolution in his destination. And that is comforting in itself.<br/><br/>-7/10"

However, there is much more looming within the incredibly imagery and filmmaking of the Revenant than one might assume.<br/><br/>The depth of the shots is overwhelming; the mountains and the snow in the film are amazing to look at. Unfortunately, the plot and characters don't live up to the look of ""The Revenant."" The film is vacuous and lacks substance.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio may win the Oscar for the best actor."
"flickernatic","8","0","2","21 January 2016"," Revenge and survival in a savage world: gory but gripping!
","The story of The Revenant is pretty straightforward. A frontiersman, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), who is acting as guide to a group of fur-trappers, is attacked and seriously injured by a bear. The group's leader, Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), decides to leave Glass to either recover or die while the rest of the party continue their journey to a distant outpost.<br/><br/>Glass is left in the care of a cynical trapper, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), an inexperienced youngster, Jim, and Glass's own half-breed son, Hawk. After the main party's departure, Fitzgerald decides to finish Glass off but Hawk tries to stop him. In the ensuing struggle Hawk is killed. Fitzgerald then persuades Jim that Glass is dying and that they must abandon him for fear of Indian attack. They leave and eventually reach the outpost where they are reunited with Henry, telling him - untruthfully - they left after Glass had died.<br/><br/>Unbeknown to them, Glass gradually recovers from his terrible wounds and embarks on his quest for revenge on those who murdered his son and left Glass himself to die. Glass has become the 'revenant', one who 'returns from the dead.' <br/><br/>Set in the early 19th century amid the rivers and mountains of a wintry Montana, this tale of wrongs and revenge is fairly straightforward. But it is as much a story of survival in a brutal world in which violent death is a familiar prospect for human and animal alike. Hence we witness several graphically depicted scenes of bloody violence, the bear attack being one of the most gruesome and terrifyingly convincing. Here nature is 'red in tooth and claw', the spectre of Jack London (The Call of the Wild, To Build a Fire, etc.) hanging over the entire proceedings.<br/><br/>What lifts this movie out of the ordinary is Emmanuel Lubezki's superb cinematography which draws us into every scene. The mountain landscape in all its bleak wintry majesty resonates perfectly with the kill-or-die ethos of the living creatures that struggle to live there. Yet the story is laced with moments of spirituality and hints of transcendence; Glass has visions of his dead wife and lingering skyward shots of silent towering trees point us to whatever - if anything - that lies above and beyond.<br/><br/>If you look too closely at this tale you see that Glass is an improbably durable man, surviving what in reality would be impossible circumstances. But so spell-binding is the combined effects of the visuals, the music and the acting that we willingly suspend our disbelief, at least until we emerge from the movie theatre and return to the reality of daily life.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is little short of magnificent as Glass, ably supported by Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson. Both DiCaprio and the director, Alejandro Inarritu, look well-deserving of awards for this stunningly atmospheric movie. Recommended - but be prepared for blood and guts! <br/><br/>Viewed at HOME (successor to The Cornerhouse), Manchester, UK, 17th January 2016."
"darioilg","8","0","3","21 January 2016"," ""Birdman"" was just the beginning.
","Alejandro González Iñárritu's career in Hollywood is going pretty well nowadays: only at the 2015 Academy Awards he won three Oscars for directing, producing and writing ""Birdman"", and as if that wasn't enough, he's back one year later with another incredible piece of cinema, longing to take home a few more statuettes and to make history as the first director winning twice in a row the biggest award in cinema. Watching his new work, ""The Revenant"", there's little to argue about his deserving the price: every scene is studied in the most impacting way possible, and sometimes you get to wonder how did he manage to shoot a piece in a certain way that appears to break the laws of physics. Sure thing, his camera work is supported by the unparalleled cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (who already worked for Iñárritu in ""Birdman"" and for fellow Mexican director Alfonso Cuaròn in ""Gravity""), whose use of light makes this movie not only an engaging survival adventure, but one that can also be enjoyed for its views and landscapes only. The story may be considered the weak part of the project, as it isn't particularly inventive (at least until the last few sequences) and maybe exceeds sometimes in giving some sort of invincibility to the protagonist, but it works perfectly with the other components and it's hard to imagine how else it should have been unraveled once the film is finished. Speaking of the protagonist, Leonardo DiCaprio may have found the role that will finally let him enter the Oscars family: his turn is incredibly real, brutal and painful, his voice is raspy and hardly recognizable and his physicality has changed a lot for the role since ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". He definitely deserves the gold, even only to make amends for the previous snubs. At his side are two of the busiest actors of our time, Tom Hardy as the baddie (or is he?), and Domhnall Gleeson as the captain of the expedition. Both of them did a great job, but especially Hardy with his hypnotizing, rough way of speaking and his complex personality which makes him a very hard character to define. All considered, this movie is well deserving of his Best Picture nod and the probable winner.<br/><br/>May not be as stellar as ""Birdman"", but it's a very close second. 9/10"

Apparently filmed in Argentina and Alberta, the climate within which the protagonists rage is as cold as the tale they inhabit. Frozen wastes never looked so beautiful. Icy waterfalls never so magical. The cinematography (Emmanuel Lubezki) astounds with almost every scene full of beauty and wonder. <br/><br/>In some ways, it's like a Malick movie. Nature is given a canvas on which to paint it's own image and the effect is outstanding. However, it also has a compelling narrative, suspending our disbelief in the telling. It's only afterwards you start to wonder why a fish would be eaten raw when there is a fire just feet away? How did he fire his pistol without reloading it? There are further flaws, but suspend our disbelief it does. The sheer majesty of the film over-rides such quibbles as you become immersed in it's scale and wonder.<br/><br/>The performances are raw and compelling. This is nature by tooth and claw. Leonardo DiCaprio throws himself into every scene with savage gusto, convincing us of his pain and suffering. Yet his commitment is matched by those around him. Tom Hardy impresses as John Fitzgerald, giving his character a humanity lesser actors would never have found, and Domhnall Gleeson is excellent as Captain Andrew Henry. The rest of the support cast are exemplary too.<br/><br/>Flawed it may be, but it's a cinematic experience to be savoured. Don't miss it. Enjoy it and immerse yourself in it's drama.

"leeannalazenby","9","0","3","19 January 2016"," Great film
","Just watched The Revenant<br/><br/>I won't spoil the plot but will mention a few things... <br/><br/>First off, Leonardo DiCaprio did an outstanding job in regards to acting abilities. He was convincing, looked like death and needs an award for his skills in this film. <br/><br/>Secondly, the camera work was extremely impressive. The panoramic shots show breathtaking scenery and were particularly well done. I was inspired by the numerous times that they used cameras to circle around Leonardo crawling across the snow thus creating an effect whereby you could sense him (and his pain/suffering) at every angle. <br/><br/>Noticeably, the sound effects were very chilling. The deep breathing and groans filled with fear were realistic in every essence. The clothing, hair and appearance of Leonardo were fantastically authentic. All in all, the way that this film was put together cannot be flawed. 10/10 for all of the above.<br/><br/>However, the gruesomeness of it made me close my eyes at least one hundred times. (No exaggeration) For instance, there is a scene where Leonardo is attacked by a bear which is incredibly graphic. He eats raw fish straight from the river, vomits whilst chewing on carcass innards, people get brutally murdered (hung/stabbed/shot) throughout and the entire film is spewed with 'blood and guts'. The most intense scene is arguably when his horse gets killed and due to the freezing weather conditions, he carves out the guts, pulls them out with his bare hands and sleeps inside the remains of the horse. <br/><br/>As much as it was a well put together and wonderfully constructed film, I genuinely found the graphic content to be a bit too grotesque. If you are thinking of seeing this, make sure that you have a strong stomach. Otherwise, thumbs up to Leonardo DiCaprio for a spectacular performance. BUT be warned, you will be put off your popcorn!"
"colersin","9","0","3","19 January 2016"," One of the most brutal films I have seen
","There is nothing clean or pretty about The Revenant. Although it is filled with gorgeous cinematography and seamless special effects, this is a movie that makes you feel uncomfortable watching it. I don't think I've ever seen such a realistic and riveting depiction of the pure savagery of nature and what it can mentally, and physically do to man. While much of the violence in this film is truly disturbing and definitely got under my skin, at no point does it ever become over-the-top or hard to believe. The violence in this film is different than the violence in most, because it is shown in a very realistic and natural way. The dialogue flows almost perfectly, which is part of what contributed to the films overall realism. In some scenes there were shaky camera shots, and mud and debris splashing the lens, which almost made me feel like I was watching a found footage film. It was during these moments when I felt like I was a part of the action, and that I was in just as much danger of a bear attack or Indians arrows as the characters on the screen. Part of what contributed to this high level of realism, was an absolutely stunning performance by Dicaprio, perhaps the best of his that I've seen. Somehow, while playing a role that has so little dialogue, he was able to convey so much emotion and pain just by using body language and facial expressions in what I can only imagine was one of the toughest roles of his career. Tom Hardy also did a great job of playing a character that was filled with so much hatred and evil, but that also had a few moments of near redemption, short lived as they may be. No film that I have seen this year has been as gritty or as immersive as the Revenant, and very few films that I've seen have ever been able to depict nature in such a savage, yet realistic way. Finally, if Dicaprio doesn't get the Oscar for this, I don't think he ever will."

","An exciting trailer made 'The Revenant' a must-see film. The title required a search to understand it's meaning. Neither is required though before seeing this film. In fact viewers are best advised to avoid both. The trailer does in fact show too much, thus diminishing the level of suspense.<br/><br/>The film opens with the familiar icon and music of 20th Century Fox. The film itself is a Western, who's opening scenes shows a very wet and heavily-forested landscape that seems primeval and virtually unpopulated. White trappers are attacked by American Natives (formerly known as Red Indians, though that is geographically incorrect), and in attempting to escape, take a decision, that has momentous consequences. There follows a struggle to survive in the harsh and grim environment, which centres on one of the trappers.<br/><br/>The star of the film is Leonardo DiCaprio who plays the role of Hugh Glass. He is not just a trapper, but also appears to be a guide and hunter too. He is accompanied by his son, Hawk, played by Native American Forrest Goodluck, in a good debut performance. The son of white man Glass and a Red Indian mother, his character is thus a half- caste, and as such, viewed as alien by others. This harsh racist view of 'the savage' is shown well throughout the film, but American Natives themselves play several important roles within the film itself. One in particular, plays a role that will be easily recognized by those familiar with classic Westerns.<br/><br/>Some clever use of dreams and memories give some back-story, but not enough. Interjected, like scenes from the Sopranos, they are surreal and thus take you out of the picture somewhat. More sadly, they never give the back-story as to the circumstances of Hugh Glass meeting an Indian woman and them then having a child. Trapper Glass has a story of wanting to escape civilization and enjoy the silence of the wilderness. Sadly we do not experience it, because the other flaw in the film is the constant insertion of background music. Some, seems to fit in with the time-period appropriately, but there is far too much of lots of other music. More silence, as people trudged through the snow or trees split in the cold, and thus those sounds being caught, would have been better. <br/><br/>However, these two drawbacks, should not detract from what is a masterful piece of film-making by Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. From the earliest scenes we have innovative camera shots that pull us into the movie. The camera is used to present some great POV for us in some early fighting scenes, that really give us the effect of being there during the fight. This also continues in later parts of the film. Likewise, we can have the camera turning to show a character isolated in the wilderness, though never blurring as happens in so many other films, nor making us giddy either. There are also some very long tracking scenes, as well as some innovative filming from ground-level too. All-in-all, Director Alejandro Inarritu gives us a master-class in filming.<br/><br/>It should be said that the cast and crew of the movie were filming in very inhospitable locations for months. Conditions must have been very harsh, and all concerned should be very proud of the commitment and dedication required to do this. Leonardo DiCaprio, in particular should be applauded. He is in virtually every scene, thus his workload, and suffering, must have been more than that of the other thespians.<br/><br/>Playing opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, after he persuaded him to read the screenplay, is British actor Tom Hardy. Fresh from showing his acting talents playing both of the Kray Twins in 'Legend' (2015), here in 'The Revenant', he plays a rough tough experienced trapper. His 2012 outing as a hillbilly moonshiner in 'Lawless' showed his ability to authentically convince as an American, which he does again here in this film. <br/><br/>Captain Henry, the nominal leader of the trappers, is played by Domhnall Gleeson. His accent was good and he convinced in his role. In 2015 he had another serious role in 'Ex Machina', much different from his role in the rom-com 'About Time' made in 2013. British actor Will Poulter also did a comedy in 2013, 'We're the Millers', here in 'The Revenant' he too plays his part with distinction. A supporting-part that is a spot bigger and meatier than Domhnall Gleeson's, though both are good.<br/><br/>There is a clear intent to portray Native Americans authentically as well as sympathetically, thus we have use of subtitles for Pawnee as well as French, although the majority of the film is in English. <br/><br/>We are perhaps now seeing a revival of the 'Western' genre, after a long gap. 2014 saw a good and also gritty cowboy film called 'The Salvation'. 'The Revenant' is interesting because it shows an era, the era of the fur-trapper, that is an earlier era, and one that is rarely dealt with in the Western genre.<br/><br/>'The Revenant' has to be considered one of the finest pieces of film- making yet, both for cast and crew. The dedication required for filming in the harsh conditions, as well as the resultant piece of work, make it unrivaled. 8/10."

","I guess this film is OK if you like 2.5 hours of un-narrated Bear Grylls with some landscape shots to act as filler content. Leonardo DeCaprio and Tom Hardy deliver brilliant acting, but they can't save a boring plot in a film that should have been at least an hour shorter. Its a big production with great costumes, great acting and great visuals... the problem is that nothing happens. Its not an art film like e.. Valhalla Rising where you can enjoy the slow pace since the producer is trying to do something different. Here you just fall asleep and the only thing keeping you awake is the expectation that the star cast will somehow save it in the end. Too bad they don't"
"paulmcuomo","10","0","5","19 January 2016"," A beautiful, brutal, violent, intense Western that I just love!
","Following Birdman, although Alejandro G. Inarritu had been developing this project long before that film, this film is a step back in joking and light-heartedness and a step up in white-knuckle fury.<br/><br/>I do love this movie, but given the movie does have some very minor problems, I'll just quickly cover them all.<br/><br/>1. The script, whilst it isn't god-awful and the crew do amazing things with the film despite it, it is easily the weakest part of the film. Unlike Birdman, where whatever got shot got ended up in the movie, this movie is shot a bit more conventionally with edits and the like, so the script just isn't as tight. 2. Tom Hardy's accent, even by his standards, takes a lot of effort to understand. He's got the diction and the enunciation of a heavy Texan down to a tee but he rushes it sometimes and it is a little distracting. 3. Hugh Glass's dreams can get very weird and often pretentious. Personally, I like a little bit of pretentiousness, but you possibly won't. Just a friendly warning than an outright flaw.<br/><br/>Alright, now I've done this, time to gush about the film: The direction is amazing - the angles we see are insane, and when the movie does eventually mix with CGI for the animals, notably the bear attack, I'm amazed with how real it actually looks. The Cinematography is f---ing AMAZING! I remember making a film in Abbey Wood, and struggling to get a good shot in decent weather, and so how they got a lot of these beautifully framed shots I'll never know. Every new shot of the film, I just kept asking ""how did they do that?"", and even the scenes of unbelievable violence like the bear attack or the fights with the Indians look so gorgeous. The acting of the four main players is great - the four main players are Will Mellor playing the young Jim Bridger, Domhall Gleeson as Captain Andrew Henry, Tom Hardy playing the antagonistic John Fitzgerald and obviously Leonardo DiCaprio playing the fiercely resistant and resourceful Hugh Glass. Will Mellor and Domhall Gleeson, in spite of being more supporting players, do get affective moments when they are operating in moments of emotional and physical discomfort and totally selling it. And whilst I criticised his voice, Tom Hardy's first Oscar-nomination for his acting is well deserved - his body language and intent with the eyes is totally spot-on. Fitzgerald is a character who has to be sold as real because moments of deeper reason and nuance are sold off over the course of the movie, but Hardy creates those moments of flipping it around - we see him, after the initial attack by the Indians berating Glass and his half-Indian son and saying incredibly vicious things and you begin to hate him, then he pulls back his cap and reveals a big bald patch, from where Indians had scalped him and pulls a look of total anger. Immediately perception is flipped.<br/><br/>In fact, Hardy and DiCaprio are playing really different to the kind of characters they usually do; DiCaprio tends to fly best when he's playing very dialogue heavy parts like Jordan Belfort, and Hardy is very, VERY much a physical, body language type of performance. Here's it's flipped, and Tom Hardy is given a majority of the dialogue and Leo gets to work with very little and give a performance that is so visceral and tortured that it's something almost beautiful; you are totally behind him as he makes his long as hell journey back home. This will be his Oscar winning performance, I'm sure of it: a performance that is genuinely brilliant and not at all bait to boot.<br/><br/>This movie is brilliant, but it is brutal, especially with that bear attack scene: it's a continuous 5 minute shot of a man getting the hell beaten out of him, and this bear is not holding back. This bear does pretty much everything conceivable to him, and it's a groundbreaking piece of Acting, Animation, Direction, Cinematography and Sound Design that needs to be seen in Theatres. Right now; go see it!"
"H_Mahran","7","0","4","18 January 2016"," Leo definitely deserves it this time
","Leonardo DiCaprio probably made this film for the sole purpose of securing his first Oscar's, the man did the impossible this time, he fought with a wild bear, slept inside the corpse of a dead horse, he achieved a great job of performance this time so there's no excuse for not giving him the trophy. The movie itself is of course awesome, perfection and neatness clearly appear in every frame, every shot and every detail, in music, editing, costumes, makeup, in every tiny detail you can feel the hard work, however, and though its runtime is relatively long, I think the movie lacks a strong backbone of a story, it didn't focus enough on the romantic relationship between Leo and the native American girl, we didn't know how they met or what brought her in his way, it could dedicate a few minutes to the kidnapped tribal girl and how she was rescued, there's not even a female protagonist! I'd give Leo 9/10, the movie making 8/10 and the movie story 5/10."

"hooinblueville","9","0","3","18 January 2016"," Visually stunning film is also brutally realistic
","Based, more or less, on the true (legendary) exploits of mountain man Hugo Glass, this film is location filming at its best. The cinematography is gorgeous and should be a strong candidate for an Oscar in that category. Likewise, Leonardo DiCaprio should be a leader for the award as well. However, I believe Leonardo's nomination came from the absolutely physical nature of the film and what he had to go through to get the character to the screen.<br/><br/>The story of Glass was told in another motion picture some years ago (1971), in 'Man in the Wilderness' staring Richard Harris in the feature role. Both films depict Glass as a guide, trapper and westerner in the early Northwestern U.S. Glass is attacked by a bear, found by his comrades and left for dead because his wounds were so severe. That's my plot spoiler, sorry.<br/><br/>Both films are rugged, frank and brutal and Revenant is even more so than its predecessor. The violence depicted follows the recent trend of stark realism in films. Director Alejandro G. Iñárritu pulls no punches and delivers the action to the point of putting you in the picture. Be prepared. I don't think children should see this film but it is very, very good. It will run a tight race for best picture of 2015."

","Despite previous efforts in 'The Wolf of Wall Street', 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape', 'The Departed' and 'Titanic', just to name a few, Leonardo DiCaprio is still awaiting his first academy award. BUT, after watching 'The Revenant', you will realise that the wait is finally over! After getting mauled by a bear and eventually rising from the dead, poor Leo embarks on a conquest across the freezing landscape in a story governed by the idea of revenge. The film also explores, rather cleverly, many different themes including the wind, the trees and their deep roots. Asides the brilliant acting performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and also Tom Hardy who definitely deserves his nomination for best Supporting Actor, the visuals in this film are top class, with the snowy mountains providing a fierce backdrop for the film itself. However, I do not believe this film is as good as the acting. The story itself, and the dialogue (of which there is very little) was not Oscar-worthy. The cinematography on the other hand is as good as it gets with the bear-attack being as real and unbearable as possibly imaginable. The struggles of life for Hugh Glass (Leo) are very well portrayed as his survival skills are put to the absolute limit. Overall, a decent-good film with lots of realistic violence and two superb acting performances. However, if you came to the cinema to escape the January cold, you'd be very, very wrong.7.0/10"

","This is a well thought out and produced movie. It has some great scenic vistas and the surround sound matches the scenery. Think of Jack London's Call of the Wild here, though this film is so much more.<br/><br/>The cast does great in this film, though I honestly think because of the way the script is structured and the outdoor scenes are so well done, the actors are really not as important here. The drama and the script are, and it is all superb.<br/><br/>The story line is followed well and the action sequences are all really well done. Particularly the bear mauling the main character is amazingly portrayed. I do wonder how faithful to the book it is as I have not read this one yet. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is superb, his best role yet. The film is set in French Canadian Northern Territory, though the time of it might actually be during the French and Indian war. The exact time is not important as is really not made clear, as a great drama is not about when but is about the action.<br/><br/>There is some French spoken which makes for subtitles and some sub- titles for the Native American spoken by the Native Americans as well. The main speaking in English in the film is done by the guy who would be classified as the bad guy in this. There is only one woman, a Native American, in the main cast and she is superb as well.<br/><br/>This film is getting deserved nominations and wins in the Awards Categories, and at least there is a minority in this film. The scenic vistas and sound should win some awards too. Very enjoyable dramatic effort by everyone involved. There is some R Rated materials and some depictions of life in the wild that are pretty raw as a warning for viewers who do not like that. That material is not the central theme here. Very good film, indeed."
"SquigglyCrunch","9","0","2","18 January 2016"," Very Intense and Gorgeous to Look at
","I went into this movie a bit skeptical. The story sounded pretty dumb, and I hoped that there would be more to it. Luckily, there was, and I was very impressed. <br/><br/>The Revenant had a plot that sounded like it could be awesome, but when I thought about it it sounded dumb. A man, Hugh Glass, is mauled by a bear and left for dead by his hunting party, then wakes up to seek revenge on them. Thankfully, that wasn't the only thing. I won't say anymore to avoid spoilers, but there's a lot more to it than that. You never really know what Glass is trying to accomplish though until the very end, which is actually kind of interesting. He's alone for the majority of the movie, so he has no reason to state his plans to anyone, including himself. He just has his thoughts, which we never hear. <br/><br/>The characters are pretty good too. Despite DiCaprio not having too many lines his acting was quite good, and you actually kind of feel for his character at the end. You want him to succeed, which I feel a little bad about (wanting him to kill someone). Tom Hardy's character, Fitzgerald, was great too. Having more actual lines, I felt like he was better developed. I barely recognized him either, his costume and accent were fantastic. In short, the characters and acting were great. <br/><br/>There are a few things that make this movie stand out particularly, one of those being the cinematography. The sights are absolutely stunning, and it's really amazing that most of the movie was practical effects. It wasn't just a bunch of dudes running around a green screen, they were running around in the freezing cold. The movie is always incredibly beautiful to look at. It also features a handful of long shots without cuts, which is really impressive. Entire battle scenes were sometimes made up of a single shot. <br/><br/>The movie is very solid for the first 2 hours, but the last 40 minutes are astounding. Considering how the movie had gone thus far and its based off true events, I wasn't actually sure what the outcome would be, and I was on the edge of my seat for the entire thing. Thankfully, the ending was not disappointing, it was easily one of the best climaxes I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Overall The Revenant is stunning. With a solid plot, great characters, great acting, fantastic cinematography, and a fantastic climax, it's easily one of the the best movies of 2015. Unfortunately the movie took a little while to get going, but maybe that was just because I was tired when I started it. I'm certainly looking forward to seeing this again, and I would highly recommend anyone to check this out."
"llewelynmoss80","7","0","3","17 January 2016"," Great filming, but under-developed character, relationships and theme
","To put it simply: I just wasn't that moved by this movie. Didn't really buy into Glass's relationships with his son or his wife, or what made him such a good guy. Didn't understand his motivations basically. Fitzgerald also wasn't as clear-cut a bad guy. This made later events in the movie somewhat anticlimactic. The survival and loneliness and determination were kind of one dimensional and boring.<br/><br/>Revenant has impressive cinematography and depiction of survival but without a compelling story underneath it kind of falls flat. Other survival(ish) type movies (Cast Away, Cold Mountain, Last of the Mohicans, even Lonesome Dove) have done better jobs of developing the characters and relationships before throwing the main character out alone into the lonely survival scenario. This way the audience can understand and share the emotional impact of the main character's suffering and what is behind his will to survive. <br/><br/>When Tom Hanks lives off fish for 4 years with only a volleyball to talk to, or W.P. Inman fends off the aftermath and both sides of the Civil War to hike 400 miles through the back country, or Woodrow Call drags a man's corpse 1500 mi back to Texas for burial, despite how incredible it all is it is all the more moving because it makes sense and we have an understanding of the relationships that exist as the motivational sources. This makes the outcomes climactic and effective as well.<br/><br/>That is what Revenant lacks... It tries to establish a backstory for characters and relationships via flashbacks and dreams while the survival is unfolding. It just doesn't work. The father-son bond is fairly well done but not the ones with the wife or the villain. Glass is willing to freeze and claw through dirt and eat bugs and survive, we get it, but don't really see why. For returning home and getting revenge? As Fitzgerald states himself that alone won't ""bring his boy back,"" so all the suffering is kind of hard to identify with. This problem extends to the theme/message- or lack thereof- for the film as well."

"semery56","7","0","3","17 January 2016"," 19th Century Frame for 21st Century Mysticism
","The Revenant, Alejandro Inarritu's epic story of survival and revenge based somewhat loosely on the story of early 19th Century trappers in the American West, brings the awe- inspiring beauty and spirit-crushing physical hardship of that elemental time and place to the screen with visceral power and visual grace. By using the outline of real events surrounding trapper Hugh Glass and demanding the most of himself and his production crew - as well as by sparing no expense (creating controlled avalanches, for instance) - Inarritu has forcefully stamped the daunting and morally complex reality of 19th Century frontier existence onto the minds of 21st Century viewers. These motivations and their creative expressions are effective and mostly honorable, if sometimes overwrought and in a practical sense, unbelievable.<br/><br/>The problems with this film, however, are significant, and they mostly have to do with Inarritu's inability to get out of his own way. He constantly imposes his vision of a lost human oneness with nature, and with the superior moral and spiritual sensibilities of native or indigenous peoples of times and places that are not tainted by Western European and American capitalistic greed and depravity - and he does this while still trying to keep the the spark of the survivalist and revenge-oriented narrative fresh. It does not, in the end, all quite work. <br/><br/>The message of mammon's corruption of the raw, pristine, and yes, virtuous is not a new one, much as it is countered by Inarritu's own budget busting to provide such an impression and by the natural instinct to improve upon the challenging conditions faced by the trappers and natives that the film conveys. Moreover, the effort taken in this lengthy visual endurance contest to maintain the mystical and anti-Enlightenment vision while supporting the desire to ever-so-tangibly enforce the difficulty of survival and the driving energy of revenge becomes, sadly, dull and somewhat contrived. Inarritu is also striving to use all the techniques of cinema he has gathered from Herzog, Malick, Ozu, Ford and Eastwood (among perhaps many others) to convey his point, with endless landscape cuts, shots of swaying trees (whose trunks are strong...), beautiful low-light and even night-time images (in what is a ridiculous scene near the end), and agonizing close-ups that often result in the breath of the subject on the lens of the camera (I have Leo's face memorized). But Inarritu does not stop there: to further impose the native spirituality and perspective that we are to believe that Hugh Glass has embraced, we see images of bones piled high, back-lit scenes from the halcyon days of Glass's companionship with a Native American wife and times of restful bonding with his son. It is all just too much for the narrative to carry, beautiful as the images are, taut as the concept of survival is presented. The movie loses momentum and impact about halfway through. I found myself waiting for the plot-driven denouement, understanding pretty fully by then the theme Inarritu was trying to convey.<br/><br/>Another aspect of this film is disturbing, and is related to Inarritu's heavy-handed nature. He creates at least one character within the central plot to further his thematic point and to increase the force of the revenge motif. He is not true to the actual outcome of the story, for which he can be forgiven since he never actually states that he is providing a film based on fact. And he moves the settings from their true location of the Glass saga, in sections of what is now northwestern and central South Dakota in the US, to Canada, and even Argentina. The flat and visually static great plains was apparently not a good enough place to increase the survivalist drama for Inarritu, nor to allow for endless upward shots of the swaying trees. However, shooting in such a location might have given a brief economic benefit to that poor area of the United States, perhaps providing a few temporary jobs to Native Americans from local tribes. And working in the true location might also have added some authenticity to the nature of the survivalist struggle and paid a respectful tribute to the the specific indigenous peoples that populate the story (Pawnee and Arikara) and inspired the mystical ethics and spirituality to which Inarritu wants us to believe he finds affinity."
"markgorman","7","0","3","17 January 2016"," A great movie tarnished by Tom Hardy.
","In Iñárritu's sixth full length outing (his fourth English language movie) he makes a change in direction, although much of his interest in the human spirit and particularly the afterlife, fuelled presumably by his Catholic upbringing in Mexico, remains in place. <br/><br/>He describes The Revenant as a 'Grizzly thriller"" and that's a fair summation, although the pace is often really quite slow.<br/><br/>What Iñárritu excels at is creating a mood of intimacy and foreboding that characterises this epic journey from start to finish. In one sense it's an unashamed star vehicle for Leonardo Di Caprio who must surely sway the Academy judges to finally reward him with his long sought best actor statue, for this is a truly remarkable and physical performance from an actor that has deserved the formal acknowledgement of his peers for several years.<br/><br/>The photography, unaided by anything other than nature itself, is both oppressive (often downright gloomy in the Albertan and British Columbian winter) and intense. More than once Di Caprio's breath unapologetically fogs the lens, so close is the filming. But it can also be beautiful in its naturalistic capture of the rivers, and particularly the forests, of its locations.<br/><br/>The music by Ryuichi Sakamoto quite often dominates scenes with its full orchestral chords booming across the barren and forlorn landscapes that are doing their best to destroy Di Caprio's character, Hugh Glass.<br/><br/>It's a tale of revenge, but more importantly of determination and faith ( in both the human spirit and in God). Iñárritu draws on religious iconography, as he often does, to represent the afterlife because, through much of the movie, death is either a sudden outcome for many of the cast or is imminent for Glass. Recurring themes are the angelic dream-state vision of his dead Native Indian wife floating in mid air and an image of a foreboding hill of skulls (representing Golgotha, AKA Calvary). These dream states sit alongside a number of set pieces (the Grizzly fight in particular) in which special effects are put to quite remarkable effect, but these are short episodes in what is essentially a tortuous journey from near death.<br/><br/>The story goes like this. <br/><br/>A gang of 44 fur hunters/traders are attacked by a posse of Native Indians seeking the daughter of the chief who has been taken by another group of traders.<br/><br/>These guys are in no mood for taking prisoners and lay waste to the fur traders' settlement. We then follow a small band of trapper brothers who escape (including Hugh Glass) but it quickly becomes apparent that they are no harmonious group and one in particular, Fitzgerald, played woefully in my opinion by Tom Hardy (really, his backwoodsman dialect is unintelligible and this ruins nearly all of the narrative scenes in the film), has money and self interest at heart. When Glass is attacked and nearly killed by a Grizzly Bear Fitzgerald is left to look after him, for a bounty, while the remaining group head back to the traders' fortified settlement on the other side of the Rockies.<br/><br/>Rather than looking after Glass, Fitzgerald abandons him, killing his half-cast son and sets off to reclaim his bounty. What follows is a long and tortuous adventure as Glass seeks refuge back at camp. It's a Bear Grylls expedition of monumental proportions with plenty of adventure, much misery and very little in the way of food.<br/><br/>This isn't Iñárritu's best movie (despite all the awards). There are serious flaws in the believability of Glass' survival techniques and Tom Hardy knocks a full point off my rating for his irritating and wilfully obscure, frankly preposterous, dialect. <br/><br/>But put that to one side and you have an adventure epic that bears little comparison. It hangs onto Iñárritu's art-house sensitivities and it serves up a number of fantastic scenes that will stick long in the viewer's mind.<br/><br/>I give it a 7/10. Sorry Tom. You blew it."

"kieranbattams","9","0","2","16 January 2016"," A spectacle to behold and an amazing story..
","Leonardo Dicaprio.. wow, he has literally no competition this year, the Oscar is practically in his hands and it is very well deserved. The fact that this film is based on a true story truly amazes me. Once again a reminder of why Dicaprio is my favourite actor of all time.<br/><br/>He stars as Hugh Glass, a man who loses everything and is left for dead by his own men after being mauled by a bear. The film played out very differently to how i was expecting, for example scenes with Glass aren't very dialogue based at all, but i really liked this. It gave a better sense of emotion and let us relate to him in an almost eerie way. We go on this journey with him and we feel isolated with him which makes the film so compelling and reminds us that this is man who has suffered through everything on the way. Tom Hardy also gives a really good performance. We have seen him in a lot and each time he is very different, this film is no exception. I really hated his character, which made the performance so great. Even when he played villains such as Bane i didn't feel such a villainous nature to the character, but here he is such a horrible person that you cant help but get sucked in to the performance he gives.<br/><br/>Making this film itself must have been a huge challenge. I heard a lot of crew left the project and i can see why. Also, the film is very gritty and realistic meaning there are scenes that are flat out hard to watch. The initial scene with the bear that i mentioned is so intense and it doesn't stop there. The film is slow, but not in a boring way. It is slow because its a character study on Glass' part and the amazing performance we get makes it the compelling type of slow. But when there is an intense scene, all notches are turned up 100% and we do not know where things are going to be heading. I never actually read up on the story itself, but that meant i was on the edge rooting for his survival the whole time and not knowing how things would end. The way things do end though are so clever and satisfying that it was worth the wait to see.<br/><br/>As the Oscars approach i have to say, i see this film getting a huge number of them. Dicaprio's long overdue Oscar is in the bag and between Tom Hardy and Sylvester Stallone there is a heated competition. A heartbreaking at times, heartpounding at times type of film that is one of the best in a long time. The hard work put into this film was well worth it in the end."
"iqualityp","9","0","2","16 January 2016"," Great story and scenery, as long as you do not mind the gore of blood and guts.
","A simpler review!!! I am a picky movie goer these days. I only see movies that review great by the majority. Went and saw this movie last night. Theater was filled. I loved this movie. Great scenery and story line. The movie was long, but kept me at the edge of the seat and the time went by fast. If you like westerns, adventure and survival movies/show, you should love this movie. Some people compared this movie to Jeremiah Johnson = not exactly. It has a little comparison to Jeremiah Johnson, a little Dances with Wolves and a lot of Revenants in survival type situation. If you do not like gore, than you most likely will not like this movie. Most (if not all) bad reviews, start off with saying the gore did it for them. Most of the gore has to do with animal blood and guts. If you are an animal lover, the gore and cruelty will probably turn you off and the movie will then seem long and drawn out. If you do not like space movies, are you going to like Star Wars!?! If you are a vegan, are you going to like survivalist meat eating movies!?! If you like love stories only, are you going to like Face Off or the Die Hard movie!?! Get the picture, lol! I felt the $12 I spent, was well worth seeing this in the theater. P.S. I have not seen the new Star Wars yet (I liked the old Star Wars, but hated the last 3 new one's)and might not see it in the theater, as reviews are comparing it to the last 3 (actually #4), so for me, why waste $12 and not like it."

",". . . as Robert Redford never had to crawl a thousand miles with a broken leg as the title character of that Western that set the standard for gutty realism and wintertime survival in the 1900s. Apparently, Oscar-nominated REVENANT director A.G. Inarritu has decided that his best chance for back-to-back wins (after last year's over-rated BIRDMAN, which stole the golden statuette from WHIPLASH) is to take a page out of Alfonso Cuaron's Oscar-winning Playbook for GRAVITY, as he recycles pretty much the same plot in an attempt to give Hispanic ""Magic Realism"" (known as ""Fantasy"" to those who speak American) a clean sweep of top awards during the past three popularity contests. Sure, GRAVITY takes place this century in Outer Space and THE REVENANT is set in the 1800s down here on Earth. But these are just superficial differences, when you consider the core of each plot. Both Sandra Bullock and Leo DiCaprio keep seeing Dead People, a hallmark of Magic Realism. They both face a personal survival challenge, though not much is on the line for either one of them beyond their own life. Bullock and DiCaprio's characters both get help from unexpected foreign sources, as implausible serendipity substitutes for adult logic in Magic Realism. But Hispanic Fantasy is trendy with the Hollywood ""Elites"" currently, and anything that smacks of Real Life and has something important to say about today's world (think THE HATEFUL EIGHT and TRUMBO) gets the Stink Eye from Tinseltown."
"iamneruda","8","0","2","16 January 2016"," A fantastic thriller that makes the best out of simplicity.
","Alejandro González Iñárritu is a special kind of director. As a fan of Birdman, I expected the direction of this film visually would also be brilliant. My expectations were beyond met. As far as technicalities go, The Revenant is pretty much a masterpiece. The choice for natural lighting and nice blend of CGI and practical special effects make for an entertaining watch. Additionally, the close-up cinematography gets into the action most often for constant tension. The score variation is small and subtle, but tense whenever used. And to top it off, Iñárritu's obsession with nature shots make you enjoy staring at running water and cloudy skies.<br/><br/>As far as the plot goes, it's simple. A man left for dead has to hunt down the man who betrayed him. You'll see Glass get beat up by man and nature endlessly, redefining gritty in terms of modern cinema. Aside from Hardy's hard-but-audible mumble speech throughout the film, the acting is spot on and realistic. I'm sure half the dialogue is breathing honestly, but Revenant doesn't fall short in speech either. To be honest, my only pet peeve with this film is the drawn-out length and additional shots that could have easily been left out the film. It all looks so beautiful, but I'm sure at least 20 minutes or more could've been cut without changing the story or ruining pace. All in all, the length doesn't pose a huge issue considering Revenant succeeding on all other aspects.<br/><br/>The concept is so damn simple, yet the end product itself justifies its budget. The Revenant is no masterpiece or life-changing film but it's worth the watch."
"power-34201","8","0","3","16 January 2016"," A great remake !
","I don't want to spoil this for anyone out there but this great movie with an Oscar worthy performance by Leonardo DiCaprio is a remake and I find it a bit odd that I am perhaps the first one to bring this up. Richard Harris played the lead role in the 1971 picture ""Man in the Wilderness"" which I saw many years ago. When The Revenant came out, my first thought was...Oh boy, yet another Hollywood remake. The story in the original version also takes place in the early 1800's and unfolds basically the same way. The one thing that stuck to me in the older version was the similar yet still frightening bear attack on the fur trapper guide. Whatever...this is still a very good movie REMAKE."
"swilliky","8","0","3","16 January 2016"," An epic adventure and amazing survival tale!
","The powerful story of Hugh Glass's survival in the wilderness based on Michale Punke's book of the same name was depicted beautifully by the genius director Alejandro Inarritu and the cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki. Leonardo Dicaprio does a convincing job as the tracker who fell in love with a native woman and struggles to survive. Tom Hardy does exceptionally well as the villain of this picture topping off a great year of performances. Domhall Gleeson and other supporting actors also do a great job.<br/><br/>The shots are so beautiful with plenty of panoramic images of the dazzling white wilderness. This movie drives home the idea that the natural world is harsh and unforgiving. Any moment when a character achieves sympathy from the viewer, they are immediately faced with dangerous circumstances and often don't get it out alive. Dicaprio's character Glass goes through an especially harsh time with a brutal attack from a bear that continues on even after the uncomfortable level has passed. The director did a great job showing Glass's recovery while still escaping from a war party of Native Americans.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

","I have always been a fan of Korean revenge genre and nothing thus far in Hollywood had come close to some of the offerings by Park Chan- Wook. Until The Revenant! Interestingly, PCW was supposed to be first choice to direct this movie. However, I believe Innaritu has outdone him with this movie, and believe me its tough to out-do the master when it comes to revenge. A lot will be and has been written about the cinematography, the locations and Di Caprio's intense performance. However, for me the real winner was the camera-work particularly in the action scenes. It was some of the most innovative work I have seen in a while, and none of the shaky camera stuff which seemed to be the holy grail of out-of-the-box thinking thus far. Every scene seemed so visceral and real, was like having a 4D effect in a 2D movie. Might seem like an exaggeration, but its not. Revenge, nature and the human spirit are the basic ingredients of the plot and really that's all you need to know about that. Just go with a strong stomach and revel in what will be a riveting 2 and a half hours."
"danielwood-29528","9","0","2","16 January 2016"," Incredible movie, breathtaking shots and stellar performances.
","The Revenant is one of those movies that you simply must watch at the cinema. If Leonardo doesn't win an Oscar for his awe-inspiring performance, I really don't know what will win him one.<br/><br/>First, I want to give Alejandro González Iñárritu props for pulling off some of the best shots I've ever seen. Almost every shot was carefully thought about and looked absolutely stunning, and Alejandro managed to picture the look of early 19th century America perfectly, and the nature of the film allowed for so many shots which were more than pleasing to the eye. I highly doubt anyone would have done a better job at directing such an ambitious film than Alejandro, so I say he did incredible work.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio did a phenomenal job at portraying a vengeful man with nothing but survival and revenge at mind, who was savagely mauled to the brink of death by a grizzly. In Hollywood there aren't many actors I would say rival Leonardo when it comes to putting heart and soul into movies, and Leonardo managed to hold his position as one of the best actors in history. The Revenant starts off with Leonardo being a bad ass hunter and skilled tracker, and after the incident with the bear, it transforms into more of a survival film with Leonardo's character 'Hugh Glass' going above and beyond to get revenge on Tom Hardy's character 'John Fitzgerald'. Tom played a character who's sole purpose is to survive and lead a prosperous life perfectly. Fitzgerald wasn't much of a team player and more often than not prioritised his life over others, leading to him being portrayed as the big bad of this movie. However, he pulls it off superbly. The final character I want to mention is Domhnall Gleeson's 'Captain Andrew Henry'. Although he wasn't the most fleshed out and interesting individual, he did a great job at being the good cop of the film. Without his friendliness and sense of companionship, I feel the movie wouldn't have been as riveting. <br/><br/>Since most of this film revolves around action sequences, tension and characters, as well as incredible shots, the pace was a tiny bit off. The first 20 minutes or so consists of tension and action and then it drops off up until the bear attack. From that point on the pacing seemed to slow down and at some times I wasn't as engaged in the story as I had hoped. However keeping viewers constantly engaged would have been near impossible to accomplish since the movie was a whopping 156 minutes long. Nevertheless, the movie was outstanding and managed to do a good job of keeping viewers interested.<br/><br/>Overall, 'The Revenant' is a must see in the cinema, with absolutely jaw dropping shots, landscape and environment, as well as incredible acting my Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy. Go and watch it as soon as you can."

","The Oscar nominations for 2016 have just been announced and whilst there has been what is almost the expected controversy about the lack of diversity amongst the nominees, one thing has not been grumbled about is that this low-down and gritty western from the director of last year's big winner Birdman has come out on top with 12 nominations including, Best Picture and Director.<br/><br/>It might win them again, if the otherwise dull but pretty Carol doesn't scoop them (unaccountably, this is the film of the year for almost all critics. Am I missing something? Did anything transpire in it?!).<br/><br/>In terms of the depiction of suffering and hardship DiCaprio's fur trapper undergoes and Iñárritu's masterful handling of camera and pacing, this is as awesome as the unyielding American and Canadian landscapes it is set in.<br/><br/>DiCaprio himself may win too, as he is up for Best Actor for his 'grey teeth and spittle' performance. ""I ain't afraid to die anymore. I done that already"" he intones, perfectly matching his grizzled character, from greasy hair down to his crippled feet.<br/><br/>Also nominated is Hardy as his murderous colleague.

"al_wilson2","7","0","2","16 January 2016"," A slow movie, but good
","Honestly, the movie is probably over-hyped. It's basically a story about loss, survival, and revenge. The survival part, the middle of the movie, is very long and slow moving. I was interested the entire time, but still found myself almost dozing off. It was not boring, just slow. The acting was good; I could understand how some may join the bandwagon and think the acting was great. However, I don't think the acting was even close to last years performance by Bradley Cooper in American Sniper. There is also no great idea, concept, or emotion to be taken from the movie either, as it is simply a revenge movie. My thoughts upon leaving the theater is how brutal, and yet beautiful, frontier live in the Dakotas was. If you have a desire to see this movie, then the movie theater is definitely the way to go. Don't wait for DVD. The movie is visually stunning on the big screen, and it should easily win an Oscar for cinematography, costume design, and visual effects. Hunters or outdoors-men may enjoy the movie just for the magnificent scenery. Women might not enjoy the movie due to the honest brutality of the movie. Leave the kids at home; they will be bored stiff in the middle of the movie. I don't know if this is a movie that I would watch again. By the end of the movie, the viewer just does not experience a whole range of emotions. Anguish, survival, and revenge are about the extent of the emotions, and they're all similar. That's the whole range of emotions experienced. Is the movie an action, a drama, or a western? I don't think that can be answered either. Compare this to my favorite drama in the past couple of years, The Judge. I knew it was a drama, and I experienced pain, love, loss, laughter, kinship, justice, and understanding; all in one great flick."
"cbak223","9","0","3","15 January 2016"," A story worth telling
","The Revenant, let me start off by saying if you search The Revenant here on IMDb you get 3 different films in 6 years, crazy huh? I filmed one with David Anders and I had a fantastic, fun time doing so it was my first hands on production job that I will never forget. This Revenant is a whole different kinda badass, The story of the Ashley Fur Co. On an American expedition of sorts to find pelts, trust me if you walk into the theater hot, this film should cool you off real quick. The story of Hugh Glass I guess is one of intrigue and mystery, the part of the story that is etched in history is that Hugh Glass a frontiersman that is great at hunting, and tracking for exploration purposes gets caught up alone and suffers a bear attack, he take the bear down with him but is torn to pieces and literally hanging on to life by a thread. The Revenant Stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass, yes this review is written just after the Golden Globes and he won Best Actor, yes, the man deserves it without a shadow of a doubt. The performance that he gave was absolutely superb from beginning to end, this why he has awards and lots of money, and well I don't. I usually sometimes agree that many a actor could have been cast and still done a great job in the film, but in this case I have to say casting was, perfect. Tom Hardy cast as Fitzgerald, the man responsible for taking care of him after the bear attack and well, he has his own agenda and things for him take a dark turn when he murders Hugh Glasses son right in front of him, call it yes it was an accident of sorts, but he wanted to look out for himself and didn't care what happened to Hugh, or Hawk, his son played by Forrest Goodluck. The vision came from Writer/Director Alejandro G. Inarritu, it was filmed in Canada I'm guessing surely in the winter, the visuals that he gives you are superb, this film makes you feel the cold, feel the death around you with the despair in the 1820's. When it's cold, it's hard to get warm, especially when you have, NOTHING. This film shows that a bearskin, having small fires and very little to eat was how it worked back then, unless your in luck and the families rich. The film was great to me that hopefully this new generation gets to see and feel what it's like to not have, oh I don't no, everything they have today they take for granted, damn just take the wifi away from a teen for a few hours and watch the despair set in, let alone a roof, food, and warmth during the winter months. Domhnall Gleeson gives a good performance as the Captain, and what can be said of Tom Hardy, superb performances all around giving this film exactly what it needed, the perfect blend of a great story, great acting, and superb set and film work. Alejandro has done it again, Babel and Birdman were exceptional films, this director is the hot ticket now, I just hope he continues and doesn't have a massive bomb in the next few years. It would be a pleasure to work with him, it would have been an honor to work on this The Revenant, I'm sure top to bottom are pleased with they're work. If your looking for a great story, great directing and superb acting, look no further then The Revenant."

","Firstly a criticism - it's just a bit too long and realistically you have to suspend belief at DiCaprio's survival in such extreme conditions.<br/><br/>But despite that, this is a very good movie and really does benefit from seeing it on the big screen. The locations and cinematography are just absolutely stunning! Good solid story - although quite simple. The acting is top quality. I have no doubt DiCaprio will get the Oscar for his starring role. Don't think the movie will get Best Picture - it's up against stiff competition. I'm in awe of just how this movie was filmed in such conditions!!! The scenes with the bear will leave you breathless and open-mouthed! Undoubtedly one of the best movies of 2015 and deserves your time. If your attention wanes at times, just admire the scenery and locations - that's what I did! <br/><br/>I have no hesitation in recommending this movie. It has appeal for all ages and tastes."
"LaxFan94","7","0","2","15 January 2016"," A modern day version of 'Jeremiah Johnson'...
","I liked this film because LDC stated afterwards that ""it's about time that Indigenous People get the fair treatment they deserve"" .. or something along those lines.<br/><br/>I made reference to when Robert Redford starred in Jeremiah Johnson because Redford also played the role of the mountain man just like LDC did in this film except that this film had more realistic looking scenes. But personally I don't think LDC should have starred in this film at all because he just doesn't have that historical mountain man look. In fact, I think someone like Kevin Costner should have been given the role of Hugh Glass because of his previous role in 'Dances with Wolves'. Costner's role in the 1990 film would have been synonymous with the role of Hugh Glass. This was NOT the kind of film where LDC would be in. I mean this isn't his kind of role: the outdoorsy kind of actor where you would normally see him. Some actors fit in perfectly with their roles but with LDC should NOT have been contacted by the other film crew to play the part. Some will agree with that one. <br/><br/>I found this film to be about survival ... how we all have to survive throughout life. It was a perfect way to convey the message through this film in a historical setting based on the factual account on Hugh Glass's struggle to survive in such harsh natural environments. I've always been a huge fan of films based on historical accounts where Native Indigenous People are involved.<br/><br/>Anyways... I gave this one a 7 out of 10."

I should admit in the middle you get bored and are seeking to persuade yourself how in the world he is still alive despite all the horrible things happen to him. Cinematography was amazing. They really did a great job in shooting the scenes with details. They show blood, sun, trees, sky, wild life, pain all in one shot. That helps you to feel the paradox of life as you see the movie. You have a clear vision of the surrounding. The scene in which the bear mauled Leo was outstanding, very vivid. Editing was also great. Overall it worth your time and money. Well done Revent crew."

","Good but not superior. Spectacular mountainous scenery was a great asset as was the realism. Di Caprio's performance was impressive considering he had so few lines and a number of those were unintelligible. What troubled me, and I am sure very few others, is that the Pawnees lived in non-mountainous Nebraska far, far away from those towering peaks and tall firs. If the Indians were Blackfeet of Montana or Canada, it would have been reasonable. I should think such an item should have been researched. This film would rate high as far as violence and suffering go. Di Caprio was mauled, shot, stabbed, and practically drowned and frozen. The faces of the actors were so obscured by hair that it was sometimes difficult to tell who was who. The ending was not definitive, but fit in with the course of the movie. An off beat, but enjoyable picture."
"marliesbajanssens","7","0","4","14 January 2016"," One of the most anticipated releases of 2016 is definitely The Revenant by the Mexican director Alejandro G. Iñárritu starring Leonardo DiCaprio in its leading role.
","The story is mainly one about fellowship, revenge, love and most of all survival. You can easily put The Revenant in the same line as the biographical dramas Into The Wild (Sean Penn, 2007) or 127 Hours (Danny Boyle, 2010).<br/><br/>Next to DiCaprio the film also stars Tom Hardy (Mad Max: Fury Road) as the treacherous FitzimagesJJSAYF8Ygerald, who is an opportunist liar and the Irish Domhnall Gleeson (Harry Potter & the Deathly Hollows Part II) as the reliable captain of the team. Fresh young talent is Forrest Goodluck, who plays Glass's half-blood Indian son Hawk. The Revenant is Goodluck's first feature film, in which he proves his ability to show authentic emotions and speak several languages (English and Caddoan). Rumours had it that part of the cast suffered from hypothermia during the shooting. In fact, the back to the roots atmosphere of the film shows us what it is to be cold and indirectly makes us shiver as we watch. I could almost feel the ice-cold wind on my back.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (Gravity, Sleepy Hollow) shows us the beauty of nature and in the same time its power to destroy. The film is shot partly in Canada and Argentina, to assure snowy landscapes. Lubezki catches every glaring sunbeam in the most aesthetic way. A viewer cannot be anything but moved by the peacefulness these images show in contrast to the roughness and pain these men experience.<br/><br/>Although The Revenant is about survival-of-the-fittest in the most primitive way, some scenes may be disturbing, due to the violence and explicit skinning and eating of animals. None of them really got spared, so when you are a fundamental vegetarian or vegan, please don't watch the 156 minutes long The Revenant, because some shots might be repelling. Iñárritu opted for the most naturalist way of representing reality. DiCaprio goes full-on in his performance, grunting, groaning, killing and guts-eating, and therefore won his award at the Golden Globes. Once again he proves himself to be an multi-talented actor on his way to an Oscar (-pretty please!)"

","I Recently watched The Revenant directed by Alejandro Gonzalez and my mind was blown away. The movie stared Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy. Terrific film from beginning to end and kept me sitting on the edge of my seat the whole entire time. This movie is purely about Survival and Endurance, and Leo performed beautifully in this flick. Tom Hardy also blew my mind with his acting skills and he has made his way up to my list of actors to pay attention to from here on out. Also If you've seen any of Alejandro Gonzalez's films then you understand that he is very keen on shots and angles. Not to mention that Emmanuel Lubezki is a genius with using natural light for this movie. Straight up the last scene of this movie sent chills down my spine, and out of all the glorious shots, it was my favorite. The only complaint that I would have about the movie is that it had a small pacing problem. And there were two scenes in particular where I felt that some characters made incredibly dumb and unrealistic decisions for the sake of plot convenience. All in all though solid 9/10. Definitely going to be in my top for 2016. I'm already calling it. This movie was the most beautiful movie i've seen since Blade Runner."
"brendandevere","10","0","4","13 January 2016"," The Perfect Epic.
","'The Revenant' is a rare, perfect feature epic that is a must see for all those film buffs that yearn for a movie where the experience becomes an event. Films such as this are just not made, simply put in the 'too hard' basket because of the dedication that is required to pull off such a cinematic production. Only the very best in their chosen field can give such a story any justice and for once, Hollywood have got it right. So right in fact, that when I entered the theatre, I wasn't sure if I really wanted to be there. I was afraid that such a production wouldn't live up to my expectations but after the violent and intense opening scenes, my anxiety was quickly put to rest. I knew this was going to be an epic event and judging by the resounding silence by the audience, they knew it as well. Everyone had forgotten that they were cradling popcorn or holding their coke. All eyes were riveted to the screen and that is where they stayed for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a modern day genius. His sublime vision as a Director could only have resulted in this masterpiece that will long be remembered as one of the great visceral narratives of all time. The commitment, the detail, the patience and the confronting realism that it took to bring 'The Revenant' to life is a minor miracle in itself. What Inarritu keeps doing as a Director is his obvious ability to take mammoth risks not for his own glory but to genuinely give the audience a film that they will remember. His use of natural light compliments the vastness of the environment that he places this story in, so much so, that 'The Revenant's' spectacular backdrop is undoubtedly an extra cast member. The whole spectacle of Inarritu's film is breathless.<br/><br/>Partly based on Michael Punke's book, the audience is immediately thrust into nineteenth century America, where the frontier is wild and dangerous to say the least. Legendary Explorer, Hugh Glass (Leonardo Di Caprio), leads a party of fur trappers into the unknown so they can go about their business of stripping the hides off the local wildlife. It isn't long before they are all set upon by native Pawnee Indians and a brutal and bloody clash ensues. With an intense and hasty retreat, the expedition finds themselves at the mercy of the harsh frontier environment. With the Pawnee closing in on their trail, the men must walk out of the wilderness on foot. Glass is ferociously attacked by a bear that leaves him within a half breath of his life. To make matters worse, the men desert him, leaving just his half breed son, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), a young trapper named Bridger (Will Poulter) and the dangerous and conniving John Fitzgerald to look after him. Fitzgerald takes matters into his own hands and leaves Glass for dead, disposing of his son before fleeing with Bridger in toe. What results is an incredible tale of survival and revenge against insurmountable odds and a journey into the very depths of one man's soul as he fights his way out of the shadows and into the very personal realm of vengeance.<br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio is mesmerising as he fabricates one of the greatest performances ever seen on film. His involvement in the bear attack is worth the price of admission on its own. The reality of this murderous attack is extremely confronting but lays the platform for this extraordinary man's quest to live at all costs. Di Caprio has been at the top of his game for a while now but his complete transformation as Hugh Glass will long go down in cinematic history. The man is on another level and if he is not recognised by the Academy for this performance then it will be a travesty. Tom Hardy is the perfect adversary to Di Caprio's Glass. Fitzgerald is a sinister character where money is his only motive and Hardy plays him to perfection with his mumbling delivery of the dialogue only adding to the suspense. Tom is not afraid to explore his dark side and there is no doubt that he does this so well.<br/><br/>'The Revenant' is a must see film. Such a movie comes along once in a generation and it will be some time before we see anything remotely like this production. It is violent in parts and the reality of the story is confronting for the audience as we watch Glass fight and struggle to survive. But it is worth it."

","This film is about Hugh Glass played brilliantly by Leonardo DiCaprio. He plays a frontiersman who after a bear attack gets buried alive and left for dead. He then goes a survival quest in search of revenge. Firstly the look of this movie is so amazing. The cinematography is some of the most beautiful to look at I've ever seen. The acting is really solid. Leo is incredible what he has to go through to survive in the wilderness is something to behold. He shows a lot of emotional depth and you can really feel his fight for survival. Tom Hardy is also great as the man who Hugh seeks revenge on. The score in this film is also really beautiful. The direction is amazing also from the director of Birdman. Its amazing to follow up a masterpiece with another one. This film is really interesting and has a lot of great stuff going for it. Again the cinematography is top notch, the acting is first class and the music is really well used. This is one of the best films of the year. It could easily win best picture at the Oscars.

","Alexander Gonzales Iñaritu is one of the best film directors of the last past years. I always knew that the Birdman director will one day make a masterpiece, that will go down in film history as one of the finest movies ever made. It seems like this day has come.<br/><br/>The Revenant is approximately two and a half hours long, yet no single second is boring. The plot is about a group of trappers, led by Andrew Henry (played by Domhnall Gleeson), hunting for fur. On one day, famous trapper Hugh Glass (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is attacked and almost killed by a Bear. One of the hunters, John Fitzgerald (played by Tom Hardy), betrays and him buries him alive. However, Glass survives. I don't want to spoil more about the plot.<br/><br/>The acting in the Revenant is incredible. Leonardo DiCaprio just has to win an Oscar for this. His commitment to this film goes so far, that, for example, he even ate real raw buffalo liver, among other extreme actions he did for his role. Tom Hardy always was an OK actor, in my opinion. He is neither one of the best nor worst, just a normal good actor. But in this movie is performance was absolutely brilliant. Definitely his best performance to date. I like Domhnall Gleeson since I saw Ex Machina, last year. His performance in the Revenant was also very good.<br/><br/>But the best part of the Revenant aren't the actors, but the visuals. Emmanuel Lubeski is the mastermind behind the amazing camera in this film. Sometimes the movie shows breathtaking scenery, other times shocking brutality. The shots are sometimes two minutes long (or maybe even longer) without a single cut. The soundtrack is very fitting, but not memorable outside the film.<br/><br/>To sum it up, the Revenant is an epic masterpiece with great acting, fitting music, and one of the best visuals I have even seen in movie history. It should at least win the Oscars for Best Actor in a lead role, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and maybe even Best Actor in a supporting role and Best Picture. 10/10"

The true art movie is not dead. That is what comes to my mind after seeing this movie. Journey through a mans heart, strive to survive, revenge, regret, sorrow - everything is here, not to mention spectacular work of camera man (it was a true joy to my eyes to see these beautiful scenes). Philosophy of mankind, brutality that has no excuses - so much to think of and of course - Leonardo playing the role of this carrier.

","Have you ever been so mad at someone you wanted to crawl 80-200 miles to kill them? The Revenant Stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy and is directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu who directed Birdman one of my favourite movies from 2014. Dicaprio plays Hugh Glass, a frontiersman who is mauled by a bear and left for dead by his hunting team. Based on a true story The Revenant is set in Montana/South Dakota in 1823. This movie is absolutely gorgeous! Nearly every shot is a thing of beauty. I loved the story and the dedication of DiCaprio in the freezing cold temperatures (he actually ate a raw bison liver to better understand the character). My main issue with the film is in the 2nd act where he is enroute to get his revenge on the people who left him behind. With little to no dialogue and minimal major scenes this portion seemed to drag on a bit making the 2hr 36min runtime feel even longer. That is my only concern with the film it is stunningly beautiful and a very great story based on truth. That is why I give The Revenant an A- (8/10) #TheRevenant #LeonardoDicaprio #TomHardy #RevengeMovie https://www.facebook.com/reasonablefilmbuff Instagram @reasonablefilmbuff"

","Beautiful. Captivating. Awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>I could fill the page with adjectives, but unfortunately none can characterize The Revenant's underlying ethos. Instead, I put forth my best effort to string together the most fitting collection of words I can find.<br/><br/>Set in North America during the mid 1800s, you are immediately taken back by the gorgeous shots of an immense wilderness. One particular pan starts at the forest floor and slowly meanders up, passing through multiple vantage points. The progression grasps our attention and, spellbound, we gasp in wonder, lost in the scenery, until an arrow whizzes across our view and strikes the tree next to us. Ambush. Indians. Our momentary shock transforms to adrenaline: we are not watching a film; we are in the film. It is perception with pathos, instinctual prowess, an experience intensely personal, that the camera shots from The Revenant capture. Whether we join DiCaprio helplessly lying on his back mauled by a bear, a member of his company, young and afraid, listening to the antagonist justify his actions, or the vast, indifferent omniscience of Nature constantly dwarfing its inhabitants, the cinematography employs a novel, awe-inspiring use of first-person perspective. And director Alejandro González Iñárritu refuses to let us go until we see the deepest, most primal part of ourselves.<br/><br/>As with all great works of art, it ends accusingly, accosting us with the hard hitting questions we prefer to ignore most of our life. Why am I here? Who am I? What do I live for? At the end of the film, we realize that The Revenant perhaps does not refer to Hugh Glass, the protagonist and fur trader on the cusp of obscurity, but rather each individual in the audience, renewed with a catharsis that beckons introspection. Questions old as humanity resurface as we follow the pioneer whose quest for vengeance disguises, albeit poorly, the greater narrative of survival in a hostile, primeval Continent. Some decry the film's apathetic treatment of the protagonist's quest. Indeed, ego would have that the individual be the center of attention, especially in a fantastic tall tale of an American folk hero using self-willed determination to achieve his ends. But that's not what speaks here. A gigantic female bear decidedly mounts our mighty, masculine hero, clambers to the edge of the camera shot, then decides she wants seconds and climbs back on top of our broken, emasculated adventurer. Later, a Bison herd peppers the screen as a glistening sunrise floods the horizon. Nowhere in sight is that supposedly larger-than-life hero. Certainly, this is an affront to the nation whose ideology prides itself upon self-efficacy, where one's individual efforts correlate with success. Where the American dream is, at its essence, an ego-centric one. How dare this foreign director bastardize a classic American fable with anachronistic inklings of modernism. Perhaps it is this stark apathy towards the protagonist and his story that strikes a discordant chord in those who decry the surface level narrative. Your ego leaves the theater starved, not satiated. However, if you can forego the importance of plot, particularly one that depends upon a definitive, predictable, and moral resolution, as well as a fixation on character, given Glass's archetypal, primitive presentation (decidedly more pessimistic critics use the term ""flat""), you will leave the film noticeably jarred, not because it offers explicit philosophical intricacy, but rather by bringing out the internal, primordial conflicts that threaten our psyche.<br/><br/>It accomplishes this by mirroring our own instinctual tendencies. Spirituality manifests itself through underlying trauma. Narrative manifests itself through underlying absurdity. This particular history of an insignificant retributive mountain-man is categorically irrelevant, no different from any other organism willed to survive. As the first-person camera shots travel indiscriminately across perspectives, it becomes clear that nature treats all beings with equal disinterest, regarding neither nation, color, or species. It fills the vast wilderness with fantastic works of conception, all the while indifferent to the particular particles of mortal sentience that, for a brief time, populate it. This revelation that occurs during or after the film causes us to revisit the fundamental reasons we give ourselves for living. The Revenant, at its core, touches our soul. It is an exercise in existentialism, an intriguing infusion of modernism into American folk lore, and a captivating tribute to those that sacrificed everything so we could watch their struggles in high definition whilst sitting safely on plushy, cushioned chairs, munching on excessively buttered popcorn, and gulping down artificial concoctions of sugar-infused carbonation. It is, in short, the best film in recent memory: one that transcends the flimsy, banal metrics of the era, whether manifested as a fickle, five-star meter on IMDb, a self-gratifying awards show, or a snobby film critic. Don't let these red herrings fool you, The Revenant is a wonderful work of art. And, as they tend to do, you will find yourself more appreciative, perhaps more aware too, of the life you've been given, the others that are in it, and the world that conceived it. But only if you choose to put the ego away for a brief few hours, engaging honestly with and immersing yourself in another's beautiful, grandiose vision. The Revenant serves us, to quote Fitzgerald's closing lines of Gatsby, ""a transitory enchanted momentan aesthetic contemplationneither understood nor desiredsomething commensurate to"" our ""capacity for wonder""."
"Troy_Campbell","9","0","5","12 January 2016"," Poignant, evocative and deeply rewarding.
","Backing up from last year's Oscar winning Birdman was always going to be challenging for director Alejandro González Iñárritu, but he's unleashed an almighty wallop of a film that surpasses his previous effort in every way. Tracking 1820's frontiersman Hugh Glass as he endeavours to survive against inhospitable natural elements, merciless Indians and treacherous allies, this intense saga explores how strong the human spirit can be, even in the face of certain death. It's not an easy viewing experience, with Iñárritu displaying Glass' compounding problems in lengthy, uncomfortable sequences that prioritise grim reality – in all its brutal detail – over a more palatable form of entertainment. It's a bold choice, but one that ultimately pays off; the meticulous visual presentation and stunning cinematography combining with the immersive sound design to create a raw adventure that is both horrific and beautiful. Iñárritu's persistence with long, unbroken tracking shots continues on from Birdman, however he has taken it up a notch here, capturing whole sequences – including a vicious bear attack and the heart-pounding opening battle – with jaw-dropping ingenuity. Portrayed with poignancy by Leonardo DiCaprio, Glass is a stoic survivor who pushes through his physical struggles and emotional turmoil with gritty determination and powerful inner strength. Golden Globe down, Oscar to go. For those willing to spend two and a half hours in the harsh wilderness on a ferocious journey, both physically and mentally, The Revenant is a deeply evocative and rewarding experience."

","Thought to be a burden an injured man, Huge Glass, is left for dead. After his son is murderer he then begins a journey of recovery and revenge.<br/><br/>Set in 1823, like the comparable Outlaw of Josey Wales, the characters feel real and are motivated, they all have shades of grey. However, director Alejandro G. Iñárritu excels the aforementioned in scope thanks to Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography, natural lighting and advancements in film making. The Revenant is beautifully shot and really captures the cold outdoors authentically. It's realistic, harsh and uncompromising, showing the best and the worst of man. It captures the bitter coldness that survival films, the likes of Alive, The Edge and Deadly Pursuit a.k.a Shoot to Kill only touched on. The relentless breathtaking bear attack is as intense as Leonardo DiCaprio's committed performance as he fights to survive and avenge his son's death. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald cements the absorbing drama, his character like the natives and French offer justified, cold, punishing brute force from each others perspectives in contrast to the silence and beauty of nature. Thanks to the excellent performances, props, costumes and locations it's easy to buy into the story.<br/><br/>The Revenant is a tour de force ultimate endurance tale and has heart and soul. The sober moments and relationship scenes with the indigenous characters are interesting, the history feels well researched. Gleeson as with Star Wars Force Awakens is average but engaging, DiCaprio and Hardy are outstanding along with the supporting cast. Will Poulter's involvement is particularly notable.<br/><br/>It's very serious and justly is void of humour, but has irony woven throughout. From a horse falling from cliff, to wolves attacking bison, eating raw meat, avalanches and waterfalls, log cabins, outposts and tepees. It's a great frontier revenge survival thriller with multi layers. Recommend."
"SivakumarBalachandran","8","0","4","12 January 2016"," Its all about Man vs Nature (both real nature and human nature)
","The Revenant (2016) Review: One of the anticipated releases of this year ""The Revenant"" by the famous Oscar winning director with a tuff to pronounce name Alejandro Inarritu marks its entry initially as a survival genre or a thriller flick. But I felt there are lots of revelations in the story which is ""based on true events"" (one tagline of Hollywood now a day which is more sellable). So I felt the movie was trying to be close to reality but given an insight says it has cinematic elements added to it. Story is about a hunting group for pelts who are attacked by local tribes. A man who guides them through their journey along with their captain. Situations gets worse when they split due to worse wounded guide cannot carry on with the team. Then the story transforms from a survival phase to a grief built revenge thriller which dwells into man versus nature type (both real nature and human nature). Let's see what is on the plus or positive side of the movie: Not just one but so many facets about the movie strongly holds up to the expectations. 1. Captivating story line. 2. Intense screenplay which keeps us connected to the story. 3. Spectacular cinematography that brings us the wilderness of the untamed mountains and nature. 4. Laudable performances by the leads both the protagonist Glass essayed by Di caprio and the antagonist Fitzgerald essayed by Tom Hardy. Leonardo Di Caprio has already been a strong candidate in the Oscars and he makes sure his entry this time as well but as far as winning we should wait for the academy to decide. 5. Commendable grizzly Bear attack sequence which makes the hero barely survive. What is on the minus side of the movie: 1. I am not convinced 100% with the reality factor that a man surviving after witnessing an attack by nearly a ton heavy bear where he is teared apart ripped off and punctured several times mercilessly. 2. The story happens in the 18th century but the seasons or rightly weather changes upside down from the starting scene from a rainy forest which hardly snows to a thick snowing mountains though we are not given any reference on the time. 3. Length of the movie which is 156 mins.<br/><br/>Verdict : A movie to feel the cinematic experience on big screens. Rating 7.5/10"
"MattBrady099","10","0","6","11 January 2016"," The Revenant - Movie Review
","""My heart bleeds. But revenge is in the creator's hands"".<br/><br/>The Revenant is set in the 1820s, in the uncharted wilderness of America, Hugh Glass set out with a hunting party on an expedition. Glass was mauled by a bear and left for dead but through sheer will and to get back to his family, Glass survived - but that wasn't the only thing on his mind as he set out to payback the men who left him behind.<br/><br/>I remember last year around January time when I saw the two images for The Revenant, with Leo holding a Kentucky Flintlock Rifle looking like he's not playing around. Just by those two images caught my interest. I then found out it was directed by the magnificent Alejandro González Iñárritu who did the Oscar wining ""Birdman"" (A movie that I personal loved). The Revenant quickly became my most anticipated movie of 2015, as I was looking forward to this movie more than Star Wars, and yes I said it. And after finally seeing the movie myself, I can safely say that I was not disappointed. The Revenant is one of the most stunning, brutal, intense, grizzly movie experience I've ever had. The movie isn't for everyone, but I loved it.<br/><br/>Alejandro González Iñárritu is starting to become my 3rd favorite director working today, because he's such an old school director when it comes to storytelling by the use of art. There's been a lot of drama happening behind the scenes of this movie, with the weather stopping the production or if someone made a mistake while filming, the crew must stop for the day and wait until tomorrow, because one mistake could lose a lot of day light for a scene (It was shot in natural lighting). One of the studios suggested that the movie should be shot using computer generated to make things much easier, but luckily Iñárritu said no to the idea by stating, ""If we ended up in green screen with coffee and everybody having a good time, everybody will be happy, but most likely the film would be a piece of sh*t."" And after seeing the movie I gotta say that it was the perfect decision, because it's very rare for a director today to take that risk and avoid what the studio says. Yes there are some CGI scenes, but the way that the animated effect's blended together with the practical effect's is handled incredibly well. This is one of the best directed I've seen in 2015 and I know Iñárritu already won an Oscar already, but I hope he wins another one for this, because never before have I seen a revenge tale presented so unique and utterly magnificent.<br/><br/>I respect Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor, but in this movie, he sleeps inside of a dead horse naked and eats raw food from animals, now if this doesn't get him an Oscar, nothing will. He's performance in this movie is what a call ''a silent performance'', because Leo barley has that much lines in the movie and the only time he dose get to talk is in a different language (Which Leo has said it was tricky to learn the language). DiCaprio has proved time and time again that he's more than the pretty face actor, but in this movie I only saw Hugh Glass, not DiCaprio. That's my biggest praise I have to give to Leo as he had to deliver all the emotions, the pain, the tortured soul that Hugh Glass was and it's all through his face and eyes, and trust me when I say this but it's not easy as you think. We are so use to seeing Leo as the angry, pretty boy billionaire in every movie he's in, but in this movie I thought he was fantastic, as he played the man who lost everything and the tortured soul that Hugh was as a person was. With very little lines he had, he still manages to make a powerful performance that's so far his best. I really hope Leo gets an Oscar for this.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy also gave an Oscar worthy performance in this movie. I've heard that some people had trouble understanding him in this movie (Or just in everything that he's in really). Sometimes I didn't understand what he said but most of the time I did. But all that a side, I still think he was fantastic in the movie. He really added a lot to his character, because sometimes you understand the things that he dose in movie and yes the things he dose in the movie are wrong, but in a rough environment that these people are in, you would likely do the same. I'm not sure if he would get in for best supporting actor, but I hope he dose.<br/><br/>I'm running out of things to say about Emmanuel Lubezki breathtaking cinematography. The camera work and how he makes the camera feel like a character of it's own is seriously impressive. Lubezki captures nature on film, that shows it's beauty and it's unpredictable surprises. The people running the Oscars should just give Lubezki his third Oscar right now, because he's going to take that third trophy home.<br/><br/>Now for the flaws and there's not that many for me: Some of the character logic towards the end of the movie didn't make that much senses to me, and that's really it.<br/><br/>Overall The Revenant is one of most intense, stunning, brutal movies I've seen in 2015. The score is haunting, the editing was top notch and that bear attack scene was just terrifying, I mean how the hell did they do that?. I don't know about you, but I honestly can't stop thinking about this movie. It's one of those movies that sticks with you after it's over and it isn't going away anytime soon."

","When I heard the plot synopsis, it sure sounded familiar. Then it came to me. This is a remake of Richard Harris' 1971 movie, ""Man in the Wilderness"". This is a quote from the IMDb entry for ""Man in the Wilderness"", In the early 1800's, a group of fur trappers and Indian traders are returning with their goods to civilization and are making a desperate attempt to beat the oncoming winter. When guide Zachary Bass is injured in a bear attack, they decide he's a goner and leave him behind to die. When he recovers instead, he swears revenge on them and tracks them and their paranoiac expedition leader down. So, pretty much all of the basic story structure is the same. Wilderness, bear, abandonment, survival, quest for revenge, etc etc. The earlier movie was a pretty good movie, cold and gritty, so I guess I will go see how well Leo did in the role."
"Dragonsouls","7","0","4","11 January 2016"," The Revenant is a great experience, but not exactly the perfect film.
","Inarritu's directorial style, including the patented long single takes, the lack of music during action sequences, and of course, his choice of camera work, allows for viewers to feel like as if they had just witnessed something real. I came out of the theater feeling like I had just witnessed a video recording of a real massacre, or a real bear mauling and of course, a real journey of a man on a mission--a mission to survive and get revenge on a man who left him for dead. The Revenant is a fantastic experience and felt extremely realistic, but unfortunately, the film fell short in several categories.<br/><br/>For a revenge tale, I found it to be a bit melodramatic, and I just didn't have that same emotional attachment to the story like I had with movies such as Gladiator or Dances With Wolves. Don't get me wrong, I loved Tom Hardy's performance, he stole every scene, but a lot of his role was entirely improvised on his part and I heard that he didn't even read the script for this film. As good as he was, I much would've preferred a more complex villain, with a deeper back-story and a deeper personal dynamic with the protagonist. <br/><br/>Speaking of the protagonist, I thought DiCaprio was superb, and if he ever wins an Oscar, I'd clap for him because he deserves it not only for his expressive but silent acting, but for his stunts too. Supposedly, Leonardo DiCaprio was actually forced to endure an immersion into an ice-cold freezing river, a real blizzard and he even ate raw meat. He'll be nominated for this role and the film will have garnered many nominations come next month, but I'm not sure it will rack up any wins in the screenplay department. I loved the beautiful Indian proverbs sprinkled throughout the story but it was lacking in character development. <br/><br/>All in all, a visceral, cringe-worthy experience, and a movie that I would surely watch again despite being a bit longer in run-time than necessary. I also thought that there was a lot more CGI in the film than I expected, especially when it came to the wild-life. I was hoping to see dozens of horses on the screen at once, a real herd of buffalo, or a real pack of wolves, but there wasn't any. However, despite that minor gripe, I thought the set design, art direction, make-up, props, and the cinematography was absolutely gorgeous. Do yourself a favor and watch this film in the theater for the best effect. I give the Revenant an 8 out of 10, two points short of a masterpiece!"

It is worth every award it will garner and I wouldn't be surprised if Leonardo DiCaprio won an Oscar for his portrayal of the tormented trapper, Hugh Glass. DiCaprio continues to impress as a serious actor who improves with each picture he makes, and is on the threshhold of becoming Hollywood's best actor.<br/><br/>By now the film has been summarized endlessly, but I just wanted to add one complaint, and that is that the picture is too long by about 40 minutes. This did not detract from my enjoyment, however, as I appreciate solid movie-making over lowest-common-denominator tripe prevalent on modern movie screens."

","It's not very often that you see an actor engaged in a gory struggle with a CGI bear (or any other animal for that matter) in a film and manage to make it utterly convincing and disturbing. DiCaprio does exactly that and in the process makes you wonder if it's actually a real bear. This scene takes place in the first 20 minutes and is the ""major event"" in the film that results in our protagonist being nearly dead with gashes in several places which includes one in the throat that would let out all the water if he drinks it, and a broken leg. There were multiple occasions where I gasped in horror and made me wonder how they pulled off those sequences. DiCaprio's performance is so frightfully realistic and dominating that I hope they finally give him the elusive Best Actor trophy that he badly deserves.<br/><br/>In one of my cinema discussions sometime ago with a friend of mine, we talked about how the most good-looking male actors in Hollywood might have a hard time trying to get someone to seriously consider their hidden acting skills as well and that they are not just a bunch of pretty faces trying to sell a film to mainstream audiences. Would they excel in meaty and dark roles? The names that came up, naturally, were Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and DiCaprio's. We both came to the conclusion that this generalization doesn't apply to DiCaprio as he is one of these ""pretty boys"" who can rise above that definition and has the ability to dismantle the so-called ""playboy"" image accorded to him by many and exceed our expectations in the acting department. He has been doing that for a while and is noticeably getting better with every film.<br/><br/>My full review can be read at:<br/><br/>https://projectedperspectives.wordpress.com/"

The film itself is loosely based on that story, but DiCaprio does an amazing job portraying him. I could feel the suffering this man went through along his journey, and having been lost in the woods before, I certainly could empathize with the character. The actors are phenomenal and portray their motivations very well. Iñárritu, using what he has learned in previous films, does well in bringing this story to life. I was certainly impressed with his ability to blend his infamous 'Long Take' style in a few action packed scenes, and balance them into the visual story line. But it was the overall storytelling that I enjoyed.<br/><br/>There were a few things I noticed that didn't really add up, but I try to suspend any disbelief in the errors that were made in the plot. I don't want to ruin the film for those who haven't seen it, but there is a hole or two that can't go unnoticed. However the overall story, stark landscapes, and the portrayal of the actors in this film are all phenomenal.<br/><br/>Personally I think people hold Iñárritu to a higher standard of film making because of his previous Oscar wins, and therefore rated it less than Birdman, but I enjoyed this movie so much more.<br/><br/>8/10"

It was just mindblowing! The bear attack scene was in one long take! How amazing is that? Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic, giving a grueling physical performance. This whole movie is grueling, it's intense. This is easily one of the most brutal films I've ever seen. I never thought a movie from 2015 could get more intense than Sicario, and I was wrong. This may be the most intense movies I've seen in a long time. I can't talk about this film without mentioning Tom Hardy, who even steals the movie from Leo, with a fantastic turn as the villain. I couldn't understand half of what he was saying, but he was great! But this movie doesn't come without flaws. The plot is very simple, which I don't mind, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table. Hugh Glass is also a one note character. However, the character is saved by the dedication of DiCaprio, who just brings his all to the performance. This movie isn't for everyone, but I feel like it's something everyone should see at least once.<br/><br/>Alejandro González Iñárritu has made 2 films in a row that have completely blown me away. I seriously can't wait to see what he'll do next. I can see him becoming one of the greatest directors of our time.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","Review: The Revenant Film Viewed Date: 01.08.15 Review Date: 01.11.15<br/><br/>To be honest I had mixed feelings walking in to this film. This is a heavily hyped, publicized film in the man versus nature / survival genre; a genre that takes a bit more determination to view, at least for me. <br/><br/>This film is living art celebrating the vastness and power of nature. Nature is established as a rhythm from the start and continues throughout the entire film, Nature provides a palpable heart beat in every scene and if you concentrate, and consciously seek it out, it is always there.<br/><br/>Every scene change shows nature in a way that rarely witnessed by most: blizzards, waterfalls, sparks dancing against a starry black canvas captivates the audience over and over again. A heightened sense of nature sets the stage to showcase a man pursuing redemption, driving to fulfill is raison d'etre. <br/><br/>Foreshadowing through symbolism pervades many scenes. The most noteworthy for me was the dream sequence where DiCaprio's character wanders through the ruin of a church with the bell in the bell tower still intact swinging back and forth, ringing with a deafening silence because the donger in the bell is missing. For whom does the bell toll in this scene? Does the silence of the dongerless bell negate Donne's prophetic warning? Even in a more sophomoric sense, the lack of the bell donger portends the coming castration of a brutal Frenchman. In another scene we find DiCaprio being born of a horseflesh vagina and then tentatively stepping into the snowy path with a renewed purpose. Although he has experienced rebirth, the beating heart of the natural world continues unperturbed by the small affairs of people.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is an incarnation of the will to survive in order to find personal redemption as well as the respect of his slain wife. An outstanding portrayal and one that will be discussed 50 years from now. This performance just garnered a well deserved Golden Globe.<br/><br/>Hardy cements his place as the most talented actor of our time. From his trudging bow legged walk, to his vacant stares filled with the spirit of animal survival. Hardy brilliantly renders a character who is short on formal education, but long on primal instinct. He brilliantly plays the dark to DiCaprio's light. <br/><br/>Nature is beautiful and brutal. People are beautiful and savage. In man's search for meaning, the great answer swirls somewhere in these truths, but always hovering just out of reach. We can grasp for the meaning of it all, but a true understanding must always be earned through pain, blood and struggle as well as enduring love. This is not a film of revenge, it is a film that tries to shed light on the meaning of redemption and the reason we are all on this earth. It does not give you the answer, but if you close your eyes and suspend your thinking in the face of a strong north wind, you might just get a glimpse of it."

","From thequickflickcritic.blogspot.com/ <br/><br/>Academy Award winner Alejandro González Iñárritu (""Birdman"") directed, co-wrote and co-produced ""The Revenant"" with the indisputable intent of transporting his audience back to the primitive and animalistic conditions inherent to the brutal and untamed North American wilderness of the early 19th Century. Having experienced this masterpiece in modern filmmaking now myself, I feel qualified to deliver the following declaration in the most resounding manner possible...MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!! <br/><br/>With each stunning scene of grim grandeur Iñárritu passed before my eyes, I was unwaveringly riveted, hurtled headlong, swept into every successive moment, captivated in a whirling dervish of surging vitality.<br/><br/>From ultra-violent Native (and non-indigenous) American ambushes, to excruciatingly crude cleansing of heinous bodily wounds, to a Grizzly Bear mauling that for all the world appears to be ACTUALLY happening, I was rendered at once exhausted and exhilarated in the wake of a furiously unrelenting assault on my emotions.<br/><br/>Starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the role of his career as real-life frontier legend Hugh Glass, ""The Revenant"" is a ferociously ambitious epic, presented essentially in three distinct acts: Escape, Survival and Revenge. Tom Hardy's perfect performance as reprehensible antagonist and the reviled target of Glass's relentless scorn, John Fitzgerald, serves to further solidify the richly gifted actor, together with DiCaprio, among the genuine elite of their craft.<br/><br/>There is a deeply effecting, albeit brief, Epilogue to ""The Revenant"", as the nearly two and a half hours of full-force frenzy that has preceded it comes to a movingly quiet climax.<br/><br/>An unspeakably tortured soul has found peace.

","Another excellent film from Alejandro G. Inarritu with this one. Not really much of a surprise seeing as how this guy makes some of the best movies out there right now. I was introduced to this director with Biutiful and I've been a fan ever since. This film gives us more of the depressing scenes that Inarritu is known for but it's ultimately a hopeful tale. It's hard to believe that it's actually based off of a true story and that someone actually managed to survive some of what is portrayed in the movie. Just surviving the first twenty minutes would be an amazing feat for me. Let's talk about the plot.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the tracker and frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio). Glass and his son are helping a group of trappers in the wilderness when they are attacked by Indians and forced to flee into the woods. As if he wasn't already having a bad enough day he ends up being attacked by a grizzly bear and is horribly mauled and nearly dead. Glass is being taken care of when a man named Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) decides to go ahead and kill him so that he can get out of there and go home. Glass's son witnesses the event and is murdered by Fitzgerald and Glass is left alone in the woods to fend for himself. Somehow, Glass finds the strength to not only get up and start walking again, but sets out to find his way back to the fort where the trappers, and Fitzgerald, are staying.<br/><br/>All of the actors are at the top of their game in this one, which is to be expected in an Inarritu film. Leo does most of the movie by himself but his emotions come out perfectly in his face and movements and it's never difficult to know what he's thinking. It' s easy to see the pain in his face and it makes me wonder if the conditions were so crappy that it wasn't just acting. At least we know the shivering couldn't have been fake. Tom Hardy also does a fantastic job as amoral John Fitzgerald. There are times when Fitzgerald is willing to help others but it's really only when it benefits him in some way. He's actually a despicable human being and it's easy to hate the guy, which goes to show how well Hardy did in his portrayal of him. Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter also give some excellent portrayals but I'm afraid they'll be forgotten because of Leo and Hardy being the main focus and taking up a lot more screen time.<br/><br/>This film is absolutely gorgeous and it's easy to forget that places like this still exist in the world. There weren't any sets used in this movie. This is all natural and, if what I read is accurate, the movie was filmed in Canada and Argentina. It's beautiful but it's easy to see why the area is so dangerous. It's amazing to think that someone could actually survive in the wilderness after being mauled by a bear but Glass managed to do it. Just to add to the feeling of realism it seems that most of the film was made using natural light. It boggles my mind just how good this movie looks without using a lot of the camera tricks that Hollywood is known for.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved everything about this film but I know it won't be for everyone. For one thing, this movie is very long and there isn't much in the way of witty banter. Glass is mostly by himself and his journey home is harrowing but it takes its time getting there. Those of you with a short attention span might have a bit of trouble with one. Also, the movie has plenty of action but it is not romanticized in any way. This is just straight up brutality and the hero doesn't exactly escape with minimal injuries. No one does really.<br/><br/>Like I said before, the film is excellent but it's not for everyone. When I left the theater there was complete silence from everyone walking out. It's one of those types of movies that leaves you a bit stunned after watching it. I can't help but recommend it but make sure you're able to handle what the film will throw at you."
"Screen_Blitz","9","0","3","10 January 2016"," The Revenant grabs you and never lets go
","Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu who brought us the Academy Award winning picture 'Birdman' brings us a powerful film inspired by true events that took place in the l820s in snowy mountains of what is now Montana and North Dakota. The Revenant tells the story of Northern frontiersman Hugh Glass (played by Leonardo Dicaprio) and his tribe under the command of Andrew Henry (played by Domhall Gleeson) who escape their village after devastating attack by the Native American tribe leads to severe casualties. On their expedition towards the east, Glass is viciously attacked by a grizzly bear, and is severely wounded. With his party struggling to aid, the ruthless John Fitzgerald (played by Tom Hardy) and Jim Bridger (played by Will Poulter), under Fitzgerald's orders, rob him and leave him for dead, while Fitzgerald merciless murders his son in fear. Buried alive, Glass awakens from his critical state and embarks on a journey cross-country on a search to hunt down the men who betrayed him. <br/><br/>Alejando Gonzalez Inarritu has some of the most lively styles of filmmaking in recent years, and it really took audiences everywhere by storm with his previous works. This film, sparkling with stunning cinematography, stellar performances, and a fascinating direction; stands a prime example of a director pushing for pure realism. The film opens with the main character and his tribe as their village is suddenly attacked by the Native American militia, and we watch as a number of people are brutally injured and killed. This entire is bloody and quite intense to watch. Nonetheless, what makes these opening ten minutes compelling is the amazing camera-work by Emmanuel Lubezki. It is done in such a fascinating way to where it pulls us right into the action, and the heat of the bloodshed battle can be felt. The biggest attention-grabber however, may the bear attack sequence which is probably the most intense scene in the entire film. Complete with sound editing, this scene consisting of Leonardo Dicaprio viciously fighting off the bear as brutally claws and bites him, is shot in a way to make it painful and cringe-inducing to watch. But the authenticity of the scene is the real gem. Then the film ventures through the main character's journey across the nation which I think is the biggest weakspot of the story due to its slow pacing.<br/><br/>This film stops at nothing to portray pure realism with such solid camera-work, use of natural lighting and the captivating performances by Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy. Dicaprio who's character has a short amount of dialogue throughout the runtime, embraces a strong performance through his facial expressions rather than stellar dialogue. Then Tom Hardy is who plays John Fitzgerald who turns against the main character is very mesmerizing in his role. From the beginning the film, he immediately disappears into his character and gives a performance that shines like gold. The performances are what redeems the film from its slow pacing. There is little doubt that the film struggles to sustain its 156 runtime with the its pacing, and at times, can get a little tedious. Nevertheless, the realism of the action and the story can be enough to grab your attention and hold on to it for its entirety. <br/><br/>The Revenant is definitely one of the best films of the year, and demonstrates some of the best performances of this year as well. Leonardo Dicaprio is great what maybe the performance of his career, and just might finally land him his long awaited Oscar. The film is very gripping, very realistic, and something everyone should look into."
"SmokinTacos","9","0","3","10 January 2016"," Definitely Worth Seeing in Theaters
","The intensity of The Revenant can be tortuous at times, watching what that poor man went through (the character AND the actor). DiCaprio deserves Oscar consideration alone just for dedication to the hell he endured to play the part. The cinematography was astounding as well. Hauntingly beautiful, tragic, cruel...when a film can capture your imagination, steal your soul, and take you on a powerful, provocative journey, it deserves to be seen and recognized. Stories from the American frontier are often romanticized, but this is no Dances With Wolves... I recall thinking to myself, how did anyone ever survive in those conditions? After I came home, I did a little research and discovered that Hugh Glass was a real person who actually accomplished some of what is described in the film, which was stunning. I wasn't sure what to expect, and I would ask people to understand this film is about imagery and emotion, not dialogue or music. There are many layers, some of them subtle, all of them poignant. I was surprised by the sound editing and effects, the music was used minimally in many places, but effectively. I also particularly enjoyed the use of language and breathing as a counterpoint to scenes as opposed to music...we heard the sounds of life in that particular wilderness... stark, bleak. Like the film. Thumbs way, way up. If you have any inclination to see this film, it deserves to be viewed on the big screen. Sit close, and prepare to be taken back in time to a place where all you can rely on is whatever skills you have and survival instincts you may posses."
"steven98664","8","0","4","10 January 2016"," Good Remake
","Ever since I saw the previews, I have been trying to place this plot, story with one of the more shocking films I saw as a kid. Man in the Wilderness. This is kind of a remake of that film and for me it impacts my impression of this film. I can still remember Richard Harris' performance which left an impression with me. I think it still impacts how I feel about being out in the woods. John Huston's performance also comes back right away. <br/><br/>Well after plugging this old version, now to this film. It is very good. It all appears believable when you are watching it, but it is so much a crazy miracle for that to have happened. I remember the change of seasons in the old one......this one not so much. So the distance and the period of time in the Revenant is different than for Man in the Wilderness. He doesn't appear to have been as far away from the fort as portrayed. I read about the actors putting up with difficult conditions making the film. I can believe that. The attack is very believable. The persistence of his comrades to help him surprises me in this film. I thought life was cheap back then and the others in the party questioning their potential demise would have been enough to abandon this man.<br/><br/>If you have spent any time in the woods, in the winter, you'd know that the conditions are deadly. We hunt in freezing conditions in November and without all of my supplies, water, food and warming up each day that'd do me in in a day or two. Really, getting wet and being in that cold one time would probably do a person in and it happens to this fellow numerous times. I kept thinking he'd lose a foot fingers, etc, but he didn't.<br/><br/>So, after a long, boring rambling review, I'd say I like this film, but too much unbelievable things in it for me."
"dlabarge-33974","10","0","5","10 January 2016"," Magnificent Visual Thriller
","The Revenant is exactly what the title of this review says it is. Without a doubt this film is magnificent. First let me begin by saying this film has become far more innovative cinematography wise. The shots and lighting was brilliant. The opening shot was truly awesome in my mind. This really ups the ante for cinematography in dramatic thriller films. I haven't seen anything that may be able to top this. Besides the cinematography of the film, the sound is incredible. The score and the sound effects were amazing. I would go to iTunes right now and purchase the score just to feel like I'm up in Canada fishing by a raging river in the middle of the woods. I can only describe as incredible. The acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy is truly great work, especially Tom Hardy. Domnhall Gleeson is also great in this film. I firmly believe this film will get nominated for a large number of Oscars and give Leo his first. The story was easy to follow with its multiple sub-plots. It's amazing how it all unravels in the end. Following the story of Hugh Glass, it seems crazy to believe that someone can endure so much and still live to fight. If you are reading this and you have some open time in your schedule go see The Revenant. I'll probably see it a few more times."
"characters-132-663775","9","0","3","10 January 2016"," Breathtaking cinematography, well developed characters.
","I have been looking forward to this film for some time and I was not disappointed! When I learned the movie was almost 2 hours and 40 minutes in length, I was concerned that the pace might be too slow. Not the case! Certainly with the development of mostly the central character, adequate time will need to be spent doing so, but the majestic scenery and the thrilling sound score made the slow pace not only tolerable, but enjoyable. DiCaprio continues to impress me with the range of characters he is able to play. He is believably tough but sensitive in many spots, too. The film gives respectful homage to Native American culture, but does so in a guilt-free style that truthfully depicts the early 1800's interactions between them and Europeans. The film contains just enough CG to deliver parts of the story line that could only be achieved using special effects, keeping the ASPCA and animal lovers happy. Tom Hardy is someone you will love to hate very quickly and he will be up for awards, too. I predict Leo has finally earned his Oscar...well done."
"christinapichler","9","0","3","10 January 2016"," Artful yet suspenseful!
","Being one of the apparently very rare people that are not a huge fan of Alejandro González Iñárritu's ""Birdman"", I at first considered not watching his latest installment, but gladly I did! <br/><br/>""The Revenant"" is a suspenseful movie from its first second until its last even though it might not have typical and expected action sequences. The whole film is more of an alternative project and deviates greatly from mediocre film making. The camera work is fantastic and unique! It is especially impressive if you consider that the whole movie was shot using only natural lightning! Especially the images of the landscapes are tremendously beautiful! Furthermore, the performances were outstanding! Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Hugh Glass, was really good and convincing. As a viewer you cannot help but feel pity but also admiration for Glass! It is so unbelievable that those events really transpired! But to me, the real scene stealer was Tom Hardy, whose character is closely linked to Glass'suffering! Concerning the plot it takes some time until it is clear what kind of movie it really is and it may leave some people disappointed because in the end there is not that much substance to it and some scenes just felt a little bit unnecessary. But that really is nitpicking and does not annoy during watching just when reflecting afterwards! This movie was also surprisingly gory which I did not expect going into it! The trailer already gives hints to that but there really is a lot of blood and gore in this film though it really adds to the tone of the movie and as a special make up enthusiast I have to say it is very well done and impressed me greatly! In general, there is some stuff in this film I really would like to know how they achieved it (specially a certain bear scene). Additionally the score is beautifully fitting! Most of the time it is very calm but the typical drum sounds (similar to Birdman) are also present. <br/><br/>In total, this movie really surprised me and I hope that it gets the recognition it deserves and I cannot wait to read the book about the story of Hugh Glass!"
"anfalarshad","9","0","2","10 January 2016"," A feast to the eyes- that's both difficult to watch and Impssible from which to turn away
","Even if its story might leave some viewers literally cold, The Revenant is a sensational technical achievement so meticulous it could only have been crafted by a cinematic mad scientist.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a thoroughly committed performance as Hugh Glass, a resilient and resourceful trader in the 19th century Rockies who is loyal to both the native Pawnee tribe — as reflected in his marriage and young son — and to a collection of hunters trying to navigate the rugged terrain.<br/><br/>You almost wonder how Inarritu was able to pull this off, not only logistically but physically, employing consistently long takes and natural light within his remote locations.The film's visual beauty provides a striking contrast to the relentless brutal violence. It's an epic portrait of man versus nature that makes Bear Grylls seem like Mr. Rogers.DiCaprio wonderfully balances strength and vulnerability in a portrayal that requires him to rely primarily on body language and facial expressions. The ensemble cast uses obscure accents that resonate with authenticity (and they're difficult to comprehend at times), along with the requisite bushy beards.<br/><br/>While hinting at deeper subtext, it stretches credibility and indulges in heavy-handed symbolism along the way, but The Revenant is a feast for the senses that's both difficult to watch and impossible from which to turn away."

","I read some reviews on here and they are pretty mixed, i however loved this movie. I didn't miss a second of it. I guess i am getting tired of the Hollywood action movies with a teenage romance aspect filled with tons of jokes made by men with no touch of reality, like the new Star Wars movie that was utterly butchered.<br/><br/>Di caprio and Hardy's acting alone is awesome but so is Domnhall Gleeson. I want more movies of this kind, i am tired of the light action love comedy movies that Hollywood spew out thousands of each year. I don't get why the kids don't grow tired of seeing the same thing, wheter it takes place in space or in school or at a police station.<br/><br/>This movie was totally my taste and i couldn't get enough, had no problem whatsoever with the lenght of it either."
"LloydBayer","8","0","3","7 January 2016"," The Revenant is a visceral engagement of the senses and an exhaustive experience throughout.
","Evidently, director Alejandro González Iñárritu is not one to rest on his laurels. Having won last year's Best Picture and Best Director for Birdman, I can't even imagine what sort of pressure Iñárritu underwent to remain consistent but it shows. Painstakingly crafted and expertly told, The Revenant is a visceral engagement of the senses unlike anything we have seen from the director. <br/><br/>Co-scripted by Iñárritu, this partly based true story tells of frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) and a group of fur trappers set in the icy wilderness of 1820s South Dakota. In a breathtaking opening montage, Glass and his hunting party are ambushed by Native-American Arikara Indians. Outnumbered and chased by the Arikara, the group decides to return to base with Glass being the navigator. Expedition member John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) disagrees with the plan and an instant enmity is born. Between increasing hostility on their way back, Glass is attacked by a grizzly bear in what has to be one of the most brutal, terrifying and uncut scenes in a film. Having barely survived the attack, and certain that Glass won't make it back alive, Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) orders Fitzgerald to lead the expedition back. Glass's half Native-American son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) and another young man Bridger (Will Poulter) are tasked with staying behind and ensuring a proper burial. But when Fitzgerald volunteers to stay behind too, it's obvious to the viewer that no good deed can from this. Thus begins a traumatic tale of survival but also revenge when Glass learns of Fitzgerald's heinous intentions. <br/><br/>At little over 150 minutes, this is a long film and not for everyone. From cauterizing his wounds to what Glass must do to survive, Iñárritu's remarkable achievement in this film is his relentless method of conveying the unthinkable. Between extreme cold conditions and eating raw meat, this is DiCaprio in his most challenging delivery. And although he doesn't say much, his role is physically demanding to such an extent, they might as well hand him an Oscar for exhibiting a genuine impetus to do just about anything. But DiCaprio is just one component in an overall strikingly beautiful film.<br/><br/>While the sheer audio-visual experience is consistently mind-blowing, it comes down to Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography as the single most significant aspect of this film. From tracking shots of landscapes to a character's widening pupils by a camp fire, the soul of this film is undeniably in its visual appeal. Such is the astounding nature of his shots that the only other way to describe it is as if the lens is omnipresent. After consecutive Academy Awards for Gravity and Birdman, it won't be surprising if Lubezki is in for hat-trick. <br/><br/>As Iñárritu's most ambitious film, The Revenant doesn't disappoint and even with its somber tone and length, there isn't a single dull moment. If anything, the entire film is an exhaustive experience but positively riveting, terrifying, and haunting – like something that has returned from the dead and won't go back."

","Excellent acting, as expected by Leonardo and Tom Hardy and the crew. This is a movie to be watched on the Big Screen. The scenes, the camera work; all marvelous stuff. At no point the viewer gets any Boredom bells for sure. Coming to the title ""The Revenant"" meaning coming back from dead, I couldn't think of anything more suitable than this. A beautiful show of how Glass comes back from being almost dead. It's the will power and love for his son whose death he has to avenge, that makes him able to stand back on his feet. The viewer cant help but smile at display of such a strong bond. The way Leonardo does it, his every move every expression; it's just WOW! At first I took it to be a Horror Movie (of which I am no fan) since I hadn't seen the trailer. But as the story unfolds, the thriller gets you fixed to the screen. Also need not mention, but I'll mention again it's a simple but a beautiful story. There is a villain and a hero. But one thing I despised the most was the death of the Captain at the end. Come on! he didn't need to die! Other than his death it's the Happy Ending! And we all love happy endings, don't we? But the ending of this movie leaves you thinking whether to be happy or not. The revenge is taken,Glass survives but he's alone, his son and wife have died; what now? (This you realize in the last dialogues of Tom Hardy.) But well Glass will have his Inner Peace at least. So go and watch!"

Otherwise enjoy the last 30 minutes of entertainment, but just don't forget about the first 2 hours. It teaches you, what keeps our souls moving, when there's nothing left to move our bodies."
"theredhairedcrow","9","0","4","6 January 2016"," An Excellent Film
","With its portrayal of life spend in nature, the shifts between intense action and often tedious but necessary patient waiting and work, ""The Revenant"" was rumored to be an unforgettable film centered on Leonard DiCaprio's performance and it delivered. ""The Revenant"" is directed by Mexico-born Alejandro González Iñárritu, an award-winning writer, director and producer born, an artist known for works highlighting the complexity of human motivations and needs. Self-described as music more often influencing for his work than other films, one easily discerned this in his latest offering for it was like watching a movie equivalent of a symphony: slow movements, a rising crescendo, and at last a finalé and resolution.<br/><br/>There have been survival dramas in the past, and the closest equivalent I can think of is ""Jeremiah Johnson"" (1972), whose titular character was played by Robert Redford. A similar theme of vengeance against those who wronged and murdered his adopted native family is central, as well as the poignant ending. DiCaprio's character Hugh Glass was left to die after a bear attack, though mostly because his former comrades rationalize this eventuality is best to save themselves from threatening natives. Thomas Hardy's character, John Fitzgerald, is most outspoken to abandon Glass along with a half native son, whose people and all natives John deeply hates. However, he volunteers to stay behind to witness Glass' passing, but as soon as the others leave his rancor is made evident to both Glass and his son.<br/><br/>Unlike most movies in the past, whether it was entirely absent or confusingly presented, ""The Revenant"" includes a European character who identifies with or lived in the ""native"" world, and Glass' visions of his deceased native wife strengthens his resolve to find his murderous betrayer despite life-threatening injuries. That special connection keeps him going, but it also keeps him from losing himself in mindless hatred and ultimately useless revenge. This quest is the central theme, and his journey through beautiful but treacherous for the unwise and unskilled landscapes provide some of the most ""catch your breath"" scenes in recent film.<br/><br/>I felt the material, pacing and progression was seamless for the type of story although some critics and viewers have remarked negatively, confused and distracted by Glass' ""flashbacks"" or ""mystic reveries"" of the past. Without need for dialogue or description, key details and events showcase the ugly truths of European invasion and colonization of North America and the brutalization of its peoples whose negative after-effects continue to this very day.<br/><br/>Although DiCaprio is far and away the central star with a powerful performance in which viewers can immerse themselves, Hardy's supporting performance is so strong you utterly believe him as the despicable coward and cold-blooded killer John Fitzgerald. Domhnall Gleeson is also entirely believable as young Captain Henry, the pragmatic leader of the original fur gathering expedition, who later tries to bring Fitzgerald to justice.<br/><br/>The title, ""The Revenant"" is apt, suggestively setting the mood and demonstrating the story by description: ""a person who returns, especially and supposedly from the dead"" yet that doesn't describe just DiCaprio's character alone. What seems a simple, direct story based on true events has been given multi-layers of meaning for those willing to look beyond the surface or pay open-minded attention throughout its near three hour runtime. 9/10"

","It has been many years since such a beautiful movie came out. One that you remember years after watching it, and want to see it again with every occasion.<br/><br/>The Revenant is majestic in all aspects. The directing and cinematography are simply breathtaking, with dynamic takes that last 2- 3 minutes, it is like nothing I have seen before. Cast and acting is world class, seeing DiCaprio and Hardy so closely together in raw conflict is truly impressive - these two are the next titans of the big screen.<br/><br/>I would put this masterpiece of a movie on everyone's must watch list."
"themadmovieman","9","0","4","4 January 2016"," Wow.
","If you're thinking about watching this movie, be prepared. No seriously, be really prepared, because it's one of the most intense and unrelenting cinematic experiences of recent years. With stunning cinematography and directing and a mesmerising performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, coupled with intense gore and violence, The Revenant is an amazingly engrossing film that, at times, left me jaw-dropped.<br/><br/>Having said that, I wasn't immediately sold on The Revenant. Such is the intensity and chaos of its action and cinematography, I began the film thinking everything was a bit of a joke, and wasn't immediately grabbed by the alleged intensity of the story. Even the already infamous bear attack scene wasn't so astonishing, and for the first half an hour or so, I was struggling to really get to grips with the film, a feeling worsened by the fact that it seemed to all be moving pretty slowly.<br/><br/>However, everything changed at the focal point where Glass is left for dead. From that moment on, I was absolutely astonished by the emotional intensity of The Revenant, coupled with the extreme power of its gritty visuals and action that ultimately lit the spark of what is an absolutely enthralling film.<br/><br/>Throughout, despite a lot of slow-moving long takes either establishing the setting or Glass' gradual road to revenge, the film manages to do the impossible, by making a slow-paced movie seem really fast. At times, yes, The Revenant did drag, but for the most part, this didn't feel at all like a two and a half hour long movie.<br/><br/>That's largely down to the mind-blowing central performance given by Leonardo DiCaprio. It's an extremely physical performance, given that he has very little dialogue (most of which is in another language), but what he manages to do so well is convey the emotional trauma through just face expressions. Spending half the movie dragging himself across the snowy forest floor, this is acting stripped down to its barest bones, but in the end, it's a massively impressive and pretty unique turn that definitely deserves some serious awards recognition.<br/><br/>The other most outstanding aspect of the film is the astonishing directing by Alejandro González Iñárritu. With the assistance of master cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, it seems that Iñárritu has built on his astonishing filmmaking techniques firmly established in Birdman, and then some. The long takes, the natural lighting, the extreme silence and the breathtaking landscape shots all come together to make a visually spectacular movie that really grabs you right from the off. Even if you're not so invested in the story, which can happen at brief moments, the visuals will easily get you right back into this intoxicating film.<br/><br/>Overall, The Revenant is a fantastically gritty and intense thriller, with stunning emotional resonance captured expertly by DiCaprio in the lead role, and then firmly cemented by the incredible directing and cinematography."
"vissini95","8","0","4","4 January 2016"," Excellent film, brilliant Di Caprio
","Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu swept the most prestigious awards in 2014 with ""Birdman"". He came back in 2015 with a totally different film, which may (and should) give Leonardo Di Caprio a well-deserved Oscar for Best Actor.<br/><br/>The film's direction, cinematography and entire mise-en-scène are absolutely magnificent and absorbing. It's a film depicting a frightening scenery in Upper Midwestern United States (although it was shot mainly in Canada) with the elements of nature (snow, wind, waterfalls) playing a major part. And amidst this fascinating background, an injured man left for dead (Di Caprio) fights nature, his wounds, a tribe of Indians and many other obstacles to find the man who killed his son and left him for dead (Tom Hardy) and take his revenge.<br/><br/>It reminded me of many epic films of the past, especially ones when a character left for dead seeks retribution, such as ""Gladiator"". The film is an epic itself, and Di Caprio's performance is captivating, especially if you take into account how much demanding such a part was. Tom Hardy is also great as the cruel, sadistic, self-serving villain. Some scenes, including the climactic final one, are full of suspense and thrills.<br/><br/>The film should be a contender for the Oscars, especially in the Best Actor, Director, Cinematography and Sound categories. It was a film difficult and expensive to shot, demanding for both the cast and the crew. The only drawback is that it's a bit too long (150 mins), but in the end it's all worth it.<br/><br/>8-8,5/10"
"asfand000","8","0","4","4 January 2016"," A gorgeously visceral exercise in brutality...
","The Revenant from the trailers and promos seemed like DiCaprio's turn in a beating-the-odds-survival story but that is not what this movie is about. Rather, this is a very unique, gorgeously visceral exercise in brutality. <br/><br/>As usual DiCaprio gives another Oscar worthy performance (this might finally be his year) and last year's Oscar winning director A. G. Iñárritu is a solid director. The real winner in the movie is the cinematography; which is absolutely fantastic. Tom Hardy along with the rest of the cast also keep the intensity to the maximum. The only thing that falls short is the thin plot and story line, with not much substance there to work with and a slight lack of emotional depth (sometimes the brutality seems like the means and the end with no point to be found).<br/><br/>Despite its shortcomings it is a must watch and one of the best movies of the year."
"MattyAndAnnika","10","0","7","3 January 2016"," one of the best films
","The Revenant (2015) is a very beautifully crafted film featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, and Will Poulter; this is quite possibly one of the top films created in 2015. Christmas 2015 we at WoodBangers Entertainment got the honor of checking out The Revenant (2015) and it was well worth the opportunity. The Revenant (2015) releases January 7th and 8th in the U.S. and I'm sure everyone who sees it will not be let down. This film has an amazing cast, a great story-line, cinematics which will blow your socks off; it's a perfect film.<br/><br/>So starting out 2016 with The Revenant, I'd say is a hope for a better year in film, check out The Revenant (2015) the moment you have the chance."

","Would like to write a lot about this movie but I wanna keep it short , since we already have long reviews.<br/><br/>Just gonna say that this movie is a masterpiece of directing and acting , A.G.Inarritu delivers as usual with his unique and original style of directing.<br/><br/>Besides that , DiCaprio's performance/acting was top notch(HE MIGHT FINALLY WIN THE Oscar WITH THIS) , same goes for Tom Hardy(I'm happy he took the role after reading the script) and the other minor actors.<br/><br/>Really good and intense film which keeps you tied to the seat for a good 2 hours and 30 minutes~ , for me and many others as I seen here in the comments , it's one of the best movies of 2015/2016 , if not one of the best in the last decade.<br/><br/>Enjoyed a lot , 9/10."
"CoffeeLatteWriter","8","0","3","2 January 2016"," Simple But Captivating
","I personally found the film, like it says in the summary, simple. Anyone who's seen the trailer or read the plot of the film will get exactly just that -- a film about survival. It's survival to its core, and I've personally never seen a film that captures this more realistically. It's real, it's brutal, and in some cases, just downright frightening. The use of natural lighting does not disappoint, and it really is a beautifully shot film. I found myself captivated by every scene, and the actors (especially Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy) did a wonderful job of portraying their characters.<br/><br/>But besides all that, the film really is simple, all terms aside. There really isn't much of another story going besides the one mentioned in the plot, and the side story that is there isn't as interesting as the main conflict of the film. The scenes that lead up to the main character's quest for survival is emotional and interesting in itself, and although there were bits and pieces of it mentioned throughout the rest of the film, I personally found that it didn't play much of a part as the essence of the film or main character's motivation as it could (or should) have.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates the art of cinematography as I do, but anyone who's looking for an incredibly complex film with layers of stories such as Inception (also starring Leonardo DiCaprio), you might find yourself disappointed."
"bogdan-713-248957","10","0","7","2 January 2016"," Another Masterpiece after The Aviator
","One of the best movies I've seen in the last 10 years. Since The Aviator I haven't seen DiCaprio so intense. Close to perfection. This is something new for him. The filming conditions, the cast, the stunts. Everything is so detailed.<br/><br/>The story is sad, but everyone can become Glass at one moment. At some moment we all have nothing to lose.<br/><br/>The glory of the story relays on the ambition and determination of every human being.<br/><br/>Personally I vote and hope for him to get an Oscar. He fully deserves it."
