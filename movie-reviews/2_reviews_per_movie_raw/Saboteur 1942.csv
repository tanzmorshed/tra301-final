"JAMessick","8","91","101","19 September 2004"," His American ""39 Steps""
","Hitchcock made at least 11 films about the ordinary man, wrongly accused, on the run (sometimes really running, sometimes not) to prove his innocence in a situation beyond his control, the first one being ""The 39 Steps"", which really made him popular in Great Britain. It really is his signature theme.<br/><br/>Others include ""Young and Innocent"", ""Saboteur"", ""Spellbound"", ""Stage Fright"", ""Strangers on a Train"", ""I Confess"", ""To Catch a Thief"", ""The Wrong Man"", ""North by Northwest"", and finally ""Frenzy"". ""Saboteur"" starts Robert Cummings as Barry Kane, a wartime aircraft plant worker during wartime accused of murdering his co-worker and best friend during an act of sabotage on the plant. He meets up with model Patricia Martin, played by actress Priscilla Lane, during his run from the law, and later, of course, the various Nazi/Fascist sympathizers along the way.<br/><br/>""Saboteur"" is mainly like ""The 39 Steps"", even including similar plot devices such as handcuffs, the blonde who doesn't trust the main character in the beginning, a race across the country (in one case London to Scotland, and in the other California to New York), and meeting the ""colorful"" locals along the way. And so, just like ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", I believe this is an American remake of one of Hitchcock's earlier works.<br/><br/>I think Robert Cummings was chosen because he comes across as a very ordinary American, sort of an ""everyman"" with whom the audience can identify. I like Priscilla Lane because her character is a more involved in the action than Madeline Carroll in ""The 39 Steps"" and Ruth Roman in ""Strangers on a Train"". As mentioned elsewhere, though, Otto Kruger steals the show as the villain. I also liked Vaughan Glaser's performance as the blind uncle; his lines are great. There are some funny touches all along the way for some comic relief, such as road signs featuring Priscilla Lane's character on them, and circus sideshow performers, and the truck driver, Murray Alper. Contrary to other opinions here, there aren't too many characters who believe Barry Kane's innocence immediately.<br/><br/>There are some slow parts, mainly when the action first moves to New York, but it picks up quickly when the last planned act of the fifth columnists gets underway.<br/><br/>It's one of my favorite films from Hitchcock (I put it in my top 5), especially in these days of the new war on terrorism. I think it hits home.<br/><br/>It makes you think, ""Could my coworker be involved in something evil?"" In fact, one of the movie posters for ""Saboteur"" proclaimed ""Watch Out for the Man behind your back!"" Imagine how that played in the mind of adults during the Second World War."

","NO SPOILERS!!<br/><br/>After Hitchcock's successful first American film, Rebecca based upon Daphne DuMarier's lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue, he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early British period - mistaken identity and espionage.    As the U.S. settled into World War II and the large scale 'war effort' of civilians building planes, weaponry and other necessary militia, the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes.   These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good, law abiding citizens.   Knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre, producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption, war-time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven Dorothy Parker (during her brief stint in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in NYC) who co-authored the script were a perfect match for Hitchcock's sensibilities.<br/><br/>This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) who, while at work at a Los Angeles Airplane Factory, meets new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) and moments later is framed for committing sabotage.   Fleeing the authorities who don't believe his far-fetched story he meets several characters on his way to Soda City Utah and finally New York City.  These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful 'freaks' and a popular billboard model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) who, during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security, he falls madly in love with!   Of course in the land of Hitchcock, Patricia, kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry, falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix.<br/><br/>
In good form for this outing, Hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies, average Joes, and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals, pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving.  It's a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited, culminates in one of Hitchcock's more memorable finales. Look for incredibly life like NYC tourist attractions (all of which were recreated by art directors in Hollywood due to the war-time 'shooting ban' on public attractions).   While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock's most well known films, it's a popular b-movie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual - terrific Hitchcock villains.   Remember to look for Hitchcock's cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film.   Hitchcock's original cameo idea that was shot (him fighting in sign language with his 'deaf' wife) was axed by the Bureau of Standards and Practices who were afraid of offending the deaf!"

","Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur is not one of his best-regarded films; made between two vastly more popular and critically praised pictures, Suspicion and Shadow Of a Doubt, it's generally regarded as a lesser effort. I agree that the later film is groundbreaking, drawing Hitchcock wholly into the American mainstream for the first time, but Saboteur is in its way at least as lively as Suspicion; its chief flaw being its less than charismatic star players, Bob Cummings and Priscilla Lane.<br/><br/>In Saboteur we find Hitchcock feeling his way around America, literally, as its lead character travels from California to New York in search of an arsonist for whose crime he was accused. Cummings is very youthful here, and quite engaging. His boyishness (but not immaturity) perfectly suits the character he is portraying, and seems appropriate, as the director, though middle-aged, was in the process of reinventing himself, and an older, more established star might have thrown things off. Priscilla Lane's spunky heroine, which not a typical type for the director, was very much a common type in American films at the time; and she and Cummings provide an openness and a youth the director needed both in his life and work at this time. I cannot imagine older, more solid types,--Cooper and Stanwyck for instance--doing any better, as they would have, between them, carried, well, too much baggage.<br/><br/>As is the norm in Hitchcock's films, nothing is as it appears. Where Saboteur differs from his better known films is that the audience is let in on the game early. Though Cummings is an accused arsonist, we know that he is innocent. The villains become apparent fairly soon; and the movie hinges more on its plot than its ironies. What pleasures there are are incidental, and here the Master does not disappoint. There is an interesting, Tod Browningish interlude with some circus freaks, who help Cummings elude capture. In another scene, reminiscent of James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein, Cummings spends some time in the cottage of a blind man, who, as it turns out, is Lane's uncle. Was the director perhaps studying key American films of the previous decade? Whatever the case, these and other offbeat and discursive aspects of the movie give it a playfulness and variety, which, when one adds the factor of quite youthful leads, makes the picture seem like the work of a younger man, still learning his craft.<br/><br/>
The film's later scenes, in New York, are more suspenseful and typical of the director, as the picture gradually becomes more Hitchockian as it moves along. In the end I find it a satisfying work; and as neither Cummings nor Lane has a dark side as an actor, neither does the movie have one. It is deliberately lightweight, and I suspect semi-experimental; an attempt by Hitchcock to see if he could pull off, in an American setting, the sort of story he had done so well in England. He succeeded admirably. The next logical step: Shadow Of a Doubt, a film in which the main character travels east to west, and with a wholly different set of values and plans."
"ccthemovieman-1","7","18","20","25 January 2010"," Tons Of Holes, But Entertaining
","Overall, this is entertaining and odd film. Don't try to make sense of it. There are more holes in the story than a computer could keep up with, but Robert Cummings and a cast of minor characters are mostly fun to watch in this ""Fugitive""-like story.<br/><br/>Unlike the popular TV show and then 1993 movie, this fugitive isn't looking for a one-armed man, but a two-armed Nazi saboteur by the the name of ""Frank Fry."" Cummings (""Barry Kane"") gets blamed when a defense plant blows up in Los Angeles and goes on the lam looking for the man who did it (Fry) to clear his name.<br/><br/>The first 40 minutes or so are very tense and interesting. Then Priscilla Lane (""Pat Martin"") enters the story, and it starts to bog down a bit with some sappy dialog. Director Alfred Hitchcock often did that with his female characters, to the point I wonder if he had a clue how woman talked. Lane's character here was a little lame.<br/><br/>Actually, the villains played by Otto Kruger (""Charles Tobin"") and Norman Lloyd (""Frank Fry"") were the best, in my opinion......just fascinating. Kruger's acting and dialog was especially good.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film but saw Hitchcock's well-known ""North By Northwest,"" you'll chuckle at the ending and really enjoy it. Instead of a climactic scene at Mount Rushmore, here we have a memorable last 10 minutes at the State Of Liberty. As usual, Hitchcock camera angles are great and fun to view."
"Infofreak","Null","29","34","17 August 2003"," It may not be top shelf Hitchcock but 'Saboteur' is still a very entertaining thriller.
","'Saboteur' isn't one of Hitchcock's best known movies but it shouldn't be completely dismissed for that reason. It's a very entertaining ""innocent man on the run"" thriller, a theme he had previously used to great success in 'The 39 Steps', and would later recycle in one of his most popular movies 'North By Northwest' (and one which still gets used time and time again by Hollywood - see 'The Fugitive', 'Enemy Of The State', 'Minority Report' and countless others).  Some people slam Robert Cummings (who later appeared in Hitchcock's 'Dial M For Murder') as being a bit lightweight, but I think he's actually pretty good as a leading man, and Priscilla Lane ('Arsenic And Old Lace') is also not bad, and the two do show some on screen chemistry. Of course with more charismatic leads 'Saboteur' would have been greatly improved, but as it is it's good enough. One actor in the cast I think is really terrific is Otto Kruger ('Murder, My Sweet') who plays Tobin, one of Hitchcock's best ever villains. 'Saboteur' is action packed and keeps things interesting. There's a good sequence with a traveling circus, memorable bit parts from a truck driver and a blind man, and the climax is great stuff and vintage Hitch. If you are new to Hitchcock I could name at least a dozen of his movies to watch before this one, but if you've seen his ""greatest hits"" try 'Saboteur', it's lots of fun."

","The story is spelled out elsewhere -- Cummings being mistaken for a saboteur and getting mixed up with a real gang -- so I'll pretty much skip it and just add a few comments.<br/><br/>First, it's identifiably Hitchcock, but is an example of his lighthearted thrillers not his more ambitious dramas. Think of it as being in the same class as, say, ""The Lady Vanishes"" or ""North by Northwest."" Aside from a speech Robert Cummings makes to the Nazis at the mansion -- about ""you and your kind"" -- none of this is meant to be taken very seriously. <br/><br/>This is also the first use Hitchcock makes of an American landmark or even an identifiable American landscape in his films. It isn't his first use of landmarks as setting for a chase, since he earlier used the British Museum. He does better here with his mockup of the Statue of Liberty, which also carries a (rather heavy) symbolic weight.<br/><br/>The score is kind of sweet and musically a little tricky, but there is no music at all while Cummings is holding the villain Norman Loyd by the sleeve at the top of the statue. The scene cries out for explosive dramatic suspenseful collossal stupendous orchestration -- and Hitchcock keeps it silent except for a few whispered words from Loyd. <br/><br/>The plot has more holes than a slice of Swiss cheese but it doesn't matter much. ""The FBI arrived at my ranch,"" says the suave Otto Krueger. ""Luckily I was just leaving."" The mother of the victim at the beginning seems to believe that Cummings, the victim's best friend, may have deliberately murdered him. A hole has been drilled in the wall of a deserted shack so that Cummings can find a telescope and look through the hole and see what appears to be Boulder Dam and cotton to what's going on. Oh, well.<br/><br/>The makeup department should have been penalized (or drafted). In some scenes Cummings is so plastered with makeup that he resembles a silent screen hero like Valentino. And sometimes the delectably cream-fed Priscilla Lane looks almost ordinary.<br/><br/>The best performances are from Otto Krueger, who switched from music to acting, fortunately, and from Alan Baxter as the soft spoken and not entirely unsympathetic heavy. We first see Baxter as he enters the abandoned shack at Soda City with Clem Bevins, brushing the dust fussily from the sleeve of his dark jacket. And he has a truly amazing conversation with Cummings in the back seat of a car while they are being driven to New York. It's a complete non sequitur dealing with Baxter's two young sons. He describes them lovingly and then talks about how much he wanted a girl. He asks Cummings if it would be acceptable to raise a boy nowadays with long hair, adding that when he himself was a child he had beautiful long golden curls. ""You might do the kid a favor if you got him a haircut,"" advises Cummings! It's sometimes easy to make fun of Hitchcock and call him nothing more than a successful commercial hack, but it's almost impossible to imagine scenes like these appearing in another director's work, not with such consistency. <br/><br/>As far as that goes, few other directors would have the imagination to roll the credits against a blank wall and, afterwards, have an ominous black shadow of smoke unfurl itself against that background. But that's only visual flair. Not that it should be dismissed, but that conversation between Cummings and Baxter I think tells us much more about what exercised Hitchcock's interest aside from patterns on a silver screen."

","You can't help but marvel at Hitchcock's early work. ""Saboteur,"" for example, is so slick and quick that it's hard to believe he made this film over 60 years ago. There's some propaganda elements but they're woven into the mystery so well that the thing plays beautifully years later. You also get some previews of stuff that Hitchcock would do later--like using a national landmark as a backdrop. This time it's the Statue of Liberty. In ""North by Northwest,"" of course, it's Mt. Rushmore. You'll also recognize things that pop up later in ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"" in ""Saboteur"" but let's not give away the show. Robert Cummings is excellent as is the oh-so-charming Otto Kruger. Look for Hitchcock's mini-western in this one. It happens quickly so don't blink."

Robert Cummings was a good actor but he's totally miscast in this role; Priscilla Lane is pretty but was never a good actress; the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense (and rambles on longer than needed); it wears its patriotism a bit much (but this WAS made while WWII was in full swing) and there's no ending. It shouldn't work but it does.<br/><br/>It's full of bizarre lines and characters that certainly hold your interest.<br/><br/>For example: Lane says to Cummings (while they're falling in love), ""I wish I could have met you a hundred years ago"" (????!!!!); Lane PAYS a villain for getting her lunch and Cummings and Lane join a circus troupe briefly while on the run.

","This is one of the classic Hitchcock films. It's not really a great film but its classic Hitchcock all the same. It's got the cross- country chase, the interesting characters and situation along the way, the innocent hero and the blonde, the oily villain and his crazed henchman, the big ending, (North by Northeast?). <br/><br/>I think it's a little weak that every nice person- save for the girl, instinctively knows Bob Cummings is innocent the moment they meet him. If you ran into a guy who is accused of torching a defense plant and his best friend with it, who you immediately decide that he's not so bad? Also the horrendous nature of the accusation would make the `It Happened One Night' type scenes that draw the hero and heroine together rather unlikely. The wartime patriotic speech at the end can certainly be forgiven. What movies in 1942 didn't have a speech like that?<br/><br/>The big thing, of course is the ending. Sweet old Norman Lloyd in his younger days finds, as Ben Hecht said, that `he needs a new tailor.' It's a model for many similar scenes later. One wonders why there was no denouement. Lloyd tells Cummings that he will clear him and then dies. Is Cummings on his way to jail at the end? An earlier scene suggests that the police already on his side. Wouldn't it be better to make that unclear and then have a scene afterwards where we find out he's off the hook?"
"Red-Barracuda","8","7","8","1 March 2012"," Not classic Hitchcock but it has some excellent moments
","Saboteur is a fairly routine Alfred Hitchcock film. It is in many ways an update on the director's first big hit The 39 Steps, with its story of a wronged man on the run. Although it also was a forerunner for the later North by Northwest, which also shared this idea as well as a finale set on a famous monument that represented America. Although Saboteur is not amongst the director's best, it still is a movie with several great sequences. The opening fire is filmed in a very stylish manner with black smoke slowly engulfing the screen; the set-piece with the circus troupe is quirky with memorable characters such as a fascistic dwarf, a highly creepy bearded lady and a human skeleton who is at best slightly thin; there's also a great sequence in a cinema where the characters act out action that is mirrored on the big screen backdrop; but best of all is the final set-piece atop the Statue of Liberty, it's exciting stuff with excellent set design too.<br/><br/>The story itself is fairly derivative. It's about a group of rich 5th columnists who organise activities to sabotage the war effort. An innocent man is accused and is forced to try and clear his name.<br/><br/>It's not the most involving story but decent enough. Main man Robert Cummings is okay but not overly charismatic. There is a typical Hitchcock romantic sub-plot where our hero hooks up with an at-first reluctant ice blonde woman. This girl is introduced by way of a scene where the man on the run is taken in by a kindly blind man who seems to be the only one who doesn't see him as a criminal. It's very similar indeed to the famous sequence in the Bride of Frankenstein where the monster's only friend in an unjudgemental blind hermit.<br/><br/>This is not classic Hitchcock but a stylish thriller none-the-less. Worth a look if you appreciate the older flicks."
"tieman64","Null","12","17","24 March 2007"," The 39 Steps
","Better than its reputation, but not one of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces, ""Saboteur"" is a light-hearted romp in the vein of the master's earlier picture, ""The 39 Steps"". <br/><br/>The plot? Robert Cummings plays Barry Kane, a man who finds himself trapped in another of Hitchcock's ""wrong man"" plots. Wrongly accused of being both a spy and a murderer, Kane must run from the authorities whilst also pursuing the film's real villain. Sounds familiar? Maybe, but Hitchcock practically invented the ""running man"" genre, and this film, along with earlier Hitchcock pictures like it, continue to influence modern thrillers to this day.<br/><br/>As a chase movie, ""Saboteur"" works well. The film jumps from sequence to sequence, until it concludes with a typically grand, Hitchcockian climax. Critics accuse the film of being trite - the plot exists only to lay the foundation for thrills - but Hitch knows this. He cater's lovingly to an audience whose needs are both base and very human; sex, violence, romance, thrills and a little comedy.<br/><br/>Released in 1942, ""Saboteur"" was one in a long line of subtle propaganda pictures by Hitchcock. Here our hero - typically Hitchcockian, the poor guy is a bundle of paranoia and anxiety - uncovers a Nazi spy ring which he eventually defeats on the Statue of Liberty. This is silly - the Nazi's started off (and were fanned by) as a tool of wealthy westerners against communism and anti-monarchist movements - but the plot leads well to the film's ironic final act. Here Kane must literally become a saboteur to defend his country, lending Hitchcock's title a double meaning; a suspected saboteur and a real one.<br/><br/>8/10 - Worth two viewings."

","For all its gloss and signature moments, this is surely among the dopiest of Hitchcock's American films. The fault lies not with the production design (slick, often striking) or the actors (the usually marzipan Robert Cummings is surprisingly credible), but with a script so preachy and unmoored that it sounds like it was written by the Minister of Propaganda during a helium overdose.<br/><br/>Even the editing-usually one of the glories of a Hitchcock film-is surprisingly sloppy. Example: The Cummings character is locked in a pantry of a Manhattan mansion. He cleverly melts a sprinkler head (his captors apparently having thought nothing of leaving him with matches and other mischief-making devices) and sets off the house's alarm system. There follows much scurrying among the servants, and the next thing we know, Cummings is out on the street in the crowd observing the `fire'. We can guess how he got there, but it's still as if he were teleported, and it's a cheat.<br/><br/>Some of the setpieces (the meeting with the handsome, refined `model citizen' who turns out to be Corruption itself, for example) are themes Hitchcock explored again and again, usually to better effect. And one encounter-with a kindly, effusive blind man in a remote cabin-is straight out of Bride of Frankenstein. Now that is one strange antecedent.<br/><br/>Still, there are rewards, chief among them the black-comedy shootout in Radio City Music Hall and, of course, the dazzling confrontation at the Statue of Liberty. And then there's Norman Lloyd's saboteur, surely one of the grandest creeps Hitchcock ever conjured."

","There are a handful of sublimely 'Hitchcockian' moments in this 'picaresque' American version of The 39 Steps. A truly sinister moment is the beginning of the aircraft plant fire with jet black smoke coiling and expanding across the back drop of the vast metal doors of the aircraft plant. It is quite beautiful. The shoot out in Radio City Music Hall is a classic set piece, one of Hitch's best. The Nazi agent reminiscing about his beautiful blond curls as a boy is a touch worthy of Bunuel! <br/><br/>Hitch always said it should have been the hero dangling from the Statue of Liberty but I disagree. At that moment of vertiginous terror we are forced to identify with the ferret-faced, fragile, pathetic little monster, Fry whose death is caused by his own cheap suit. Morally it is more complex and satisfying than the reversed role (as in North By Northwest). Norman Lloyd's fall from the statue was one of the truly great special effects of classic cinema and is unforgettable.<br/><br/>Both Bob Cummings and Priscilla Lane are not 'A-list' but they give all they have for Hitch and he appreciated it.

Saboteur follows the ""innocent man on the run"" template which the director had been tackling since The 39 Steps and which will peak decades later with North by Northwest. <br/><br/>Leads Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane are lightweight but likable; the story of a young man wrongly accused of sabotage who must escape the police and find the real culprit is entertaining, although Hitchcock's own assessment (in one of his insightful interviews with Truffaut) that the script lacks discipline and is cluttered with too many ideas seems accurate.<br/><br/>7/10"

Why does Patricia pay her captors for the milk shake they got her? In regards to the first 3 points, these may be conspiracy plots that are part of a much bigger plan that is never really mentioned. But why not? I do hate exposition in movies but even a couple of suggestions here and there about the full story would have made a more satisfying film.<br/><br/>It is one of Hitchcock's many man on the lam/mistaking identity/wrong guy films and works rather well in that regard.

","Saboteur is the second of three wartime propaganda thrillers that Hitchcock directed. Espionage adventures like this had made up the bulk of his mid-to-late 30s work in Britain, and Saboteur provides some good examples of the very precise method he had by now developed.<br/><br/>Important to these thrillers was the idea that this could happen to anyone, and it was not enough simply to create an honest John Doe character - he had to show the hero's ordinariness, that he was a random victim. This was before Hitch began using the device of panning over a city before homing in on one window, but he achieves a similar effect here with protagonist Robert Cummings emerging as a face in the crowd of factory workers. For different reasons, it was also important to establish the villain as an apparently non-threatening family man - the last person anyone would suspect. Hence we first see Otto Kruger playing with his granddaughter.<br/><br/>Once he has established that his hero is an average Joe, Hitchcock's aim is to keep us with the character and draw us into his experiences. We of course have plenty of point-of-view shots so we see what he sees, and these are not only used to show us information, but also to reveal his paranoid state - for example with those ironic billboard slogans. A subtler but equally effective trick is to cut to a close reaction shot while another character is talking. This is done for example in the scene where he gets a lift from a truck driver. As the driver prattles away, we see them both framed together, but whenever he says something worth listening to, we cut to a closeup of Cummings. This not only draws your attention to crucial information, it also really focuses you on the character's thoughts.<br/><br/>Finally, to keep us watching Hitchcock needed to keep the action balanced and varied. Each of Cummings' escapes is played for a different effect. When he gives little Suzi a piggy-back to prevent his getting shot at, we are impressed by his cunning. The scene in the river is pure nail-biting action, whereas cutting through the handcuffs is an exercise in race-against-time tension. The episode with the blind man is a neat little reference to Bride of Frankenstein, drawing the parallel between the outcast monster and the innocent fugitive. This sequence also contains some of the picture's few decent gags, and is marred only by the appalling acting of Vaughan Glaser.<br/><br/>Speaking of acting, this is unfortunately one of the blandest casts Hitchcock ever worked with, Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane being ironically very average leads. None of the supporting players really stands out, with one exception: Otto Kruger, who brilliantly manages to capture that blend of decency and villainy. Add to this dull cast a lifeless screenplay, full of patriotic rhetoric - understandable in the circumstances, but still rather clunky and clichéd - and short on wit and sparkle. The score is by Frank Skinner, one in a long line of composers who failed to get Hitchcock's style.<br/><br/>For all the meticulous construction of Hitchcock's Hollywood pictures, he had already made his best espionage adventures in England in the 30s. I think films like The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes were more effective simply because they were successful at merging comedy and action, with a lively cast that made them fun and breezy. Saboteur has plenty of strong set pieces, but is otherwise fairly flat. Conversely though, Hitch's mastery of his method was beginning to pay dividends in his domestic crime thrillers, as can be seen in his next feature, Shadow of Doubt."

","As I post this comment, IMDb currently rates Alfred Hitchcock's subpar Saboteur a 7.3/10. Personally, I rated it less than half that. Honestly, I can't tell how a movie this bad could've come from what is probably the most consistently good director I know of. I've seen about 10 other Hitch movies from the 30's-60's. Vertigo is thus far my hands down favorite while Saboteur is easily the worst. It's hard to believe that 7 years earlier Hitch used the very same formula in The 39 Steps far more competently. My recommendation would be to see that instead and avoid this like the plague. It's the only Hitchcock movie that I turned off before before the end and have no desire to go back and see the rest. If you must watch it, then rent or borrow. Don't make the mistake I did and buy the DVD on good faith earned through Notorious, Rebecca, Vertigo, Rear Window, etc. Even a master screws up sometimes, I guess.<br/><br/>EDIT: Maybe I was a bit harder on this film than I should've been. It's certainly nowhere near Ed Wood or Manos or anything like that, but there's three reasons I feel I must rate it so low:<br/><br/>1) The name ""Hitchcock"" brings with it certain expectations of quality. This film delivers on a few of them, but they're way overshadowed by the darn near non-sensical plotting.<br/><br/>2) I want to compensate a bit for all the 8+ ratings this film is getting. Hitchcock is like the John Coltrane of directors. True fans will find reasons to consider anything by him a work of art, but the high rating on IMDb gives more casual movie enthusiasts like myself the impression that this movie is far better than it actually is. <br/><br/>3) I spent $18 on this. Maybe if it'd cost me $5 or even $10 I'd probably be a bit less bitter. ;)"

","This is one of those films I've always wanted to see but didn't get around to it for years. After buying the DVD on sale and sitting through it, I was hugely disappointed. It's just not good, Hitch fans, when it's not outright bizarre and terrible. Plot holes and absurdities and on the nose dialogue abound. Sure, the Statue of Liberty sequence shows a bit of the director's early genius, as well as a few other signature touches, but for the most part this film is a badly acted, badly structured, and badly written mess.<br/><br/>Nothing in this story unfolds with any believability or credibility, it almost plays like a bad Twilight Zone episode where the hapless protagonist keeps making impossible escapes via doors held open for him by some invisible guardian angel. It's outrageous to watch Robert Cummings get let off the hook time and again on simple faith that he's a noble American defense worker innocent beyond question of sabotage. A real piece of WW2 propagandist pap.<br/><br/>The only other bright spots are a deliciously despicable turn by Otto Kruger as the main villain, and Norman Lloyd, who successfully looks and acts the part of a slimy agent of evil (though he's hardly involved in the plot long enough to be a 3 dimensional character).<br/><br/>As Barry Kane, our righteous hero on the run, Robert Cummings turns in one of the worst leading man performances in the history of Hollywood's golden age. He's even more shrill and wooden than Lew Ayres and Robert Taylor in their worst moments. The only decent speech he delivers is when he confronts Kruger near the end, a speech which resonates particularly well in this era of George W. Bush (Kruger could be playing Dick Cheney). The rest of the time he's overbearingly skittish and meek when he's not chewing the scenery with histrionics.<br/><br/>The interplay between Cummings and Priscilla Lane is completely lifeless and devoid of any romance and humor. This film needed Howard Hawks to oversee that aspect of the film and Hitchcock to handle the suspense.<br/><br/>Not nearly one of Hitchcock's best. A ratings travesty at 7.3"

","The plot of this sub-standard Hitchcock movie is strongly influenced by ""The 39 Steps"" but it's not in the same class. Robert Cummings was too light weight for the part of the young hero who goes on the run to prove his innocence after the aircraft factory in which he was working is sabotaged and his best friend killed. The heroine is spunky Priscilla Lane, (a better actress than she was ever given credit for), who is a mite too quick to overcome her reluctance to believe in his innocence, and the plot traverses the country from Los Angeles to New York, (the justly famous climax takes place on top of the Statue of Liberty). In terms of set pieces this is as good as it gets, although there is an excellent sequence at a society gathering that just about redeems the film. Otherwise it is all very jingoistic, made at the height of the war effort and directed, on this occasion, on auto pilot."

","Hitch made worse films than Saboteur, but never one more annoying. As the master once joked about another of his lesser films, ""we must never let plausibility rear it's ugly head."" The basic set up seems hard to swallow...would NOBODY else at the plant notice the real bad guy?<br/><br/>I think Robert Cummings would have been acceptable in the role but he simply has to play a lot of second or third rate material. Other performances are more questionable, the studio sets are very obvious; but the real problem is that the film's constant stabs at wit (sorry Miss Parker) consistently play as pure Corn.<br/><br/>The film seems both a bad rehash of things Hitch had done better and an unsure preview of stuff he would do better. Often a Hitchcock film is compelling in the moment the uneasy levity ends and the story becomes deadly serious. The wan humor here gives the film no place to go. <br/><br/>Finally, there seems to be a repeated them that the virtuous will also be able to identify each other and therefore win out in the end. Such a corny notion would have no place in the great films of Hitchcock, and that's part of what makes him an artist."

","Saboteur was one of the few Hitchcocks I had yet to discover and I was less than half-overwhelmed. The French title ""La Cinquième colonne"" (i.e. The Fifth Column, a very evocative phrase for underground spying and sabotage organizations) set my expectations quite high as did the images of the finale on top of the Statue of Liberty.<br/><br/>Basically Saboteur is as much light-hearted as were The 39 steps (note this is another evocative phrase, even McGuffin as a title) but it lacks most of the humor (so the characters are rather down to earth) and it's definitely not as fast paced. As a chase movie across the USA from LA to NY Saboteur drags its feet from sequence to sequence. The sequence at the villain's lovely ranch? Lovely ranch, lovely villain but pretty tame on the whole, it doesn't really add up to nothing. The meeting with the blind man, the mixing with Circus people, the Soda City sequence, the NY ball sequence? They fall flat, bringing in more characters with very little added suspense value.<br/><br/>One big problem I can point out is the relationship between the leads Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane which is not building up as with Robert Donat and Madeleine Caroll in The 39 steps. Hence the whole narrative structure is floating, depending on the addition of new scenes. And new scenes only bring us nearer the end since it's not clear if the hook is the hero's escape from the police, from the villains or his action to stop the plotted sabotages. In The 39 steps it was clearly scripted as 1/escaping from the police (so you know the hero can't just go to the police) then 2/running for his life and after the villains to prove his innocence.<br/><br/>If you want a better Hitchcock from the 40s wartime propaganda I would advise you to chose Foreign Correspondant over Saboteur. They are both chase movies with a catchy finale, well really a gripping one and not just sightseeing in Foreign Correspondant as well as beautifully efficient scenes (the umbrella crowd, the tulip fields, the strange mills...)."

","Rarely will anyone deny that Hitchcock remains one of the most creative, inventive and prolific directors of all time, because he is arguably all of these things. It takes true genius to scare generations of film goers out of taking showers and wearing neck ties. Saboteur, however, is not creative or prolific at all. Rather, Hitchcock set out with the soul intention of creating a film to muster ""American Pride,"" a certain call-to-arms, support-our-troops title which was a popular theme of the time. With that in mind, Hitchcock severely underplayed other important aspects of the film, including but not limited to a logical plot, characterization, believable dialog, and a fluent, running storyline. <br/><br/>Typically Hitchcock does great with espionage films, only a few years earlier achieving cinematic greatness with The Foreign Corespondant and The 39 Steps, but seemingly lost his stride in creating Saboteur and merely recycled the same once-thrilling story lines both his previous excursions readily provided. Without going into any great depth here is a list of a few of this films major problems: <br/><br/>1. Despite having his face plastered on every newspaper across America, the only person who recognizes Kane is blind.<br/><br/>2. At the dinner party, Kane and Patricia don't want to run for the door because the bad guys might grab them and tell the party they were ""gate crashers."" Logically, what prevents the spies from grabbing them and saying this at any point during the evening? Besides, does anyone need to be reminded Kane is a wanted terrorist?<br/><br/>3. Since when can a fan belt cut through handcuffs? <br/><br/>4. Nobody recognizes him...his face is on EVERY NEWSPAPER!!! <br/><br/>5. The spies catch up with Kane in the ghost town and assume he's the man Freeman sent to work with them...shouldn't't he have some sort of credentials? I know spies don't run around with name tags and photo IDs but a secret handshake maybe? <br/><br/>6. Cop picks up Kane escaping from Freeman's house, still seems no one recognizes this guy.<br/><br/>7. How exactly does the FBI come to believe Kane with no evidence? They don't even show Kane talking to the FBI, the scene simply fades in and we are forced to assume everything is now kosher.<br/><br/>8. When the cops search the Carnival Caravan how do they know Kane is now with a woman? The blind man believed Kane's story thus logically would not have reported his daughter missing, kidnapped, or even more importantly running with Kane. Why does this movie not employ logic?<br/><br/>This is a running list. The movie is not exciting, the plot makes no sense, and the world is full of people who willingly take wanted terrorists into their homes and cars everyday because its no big thing. Hitchcock fails miserably on this one."

","In 1938 Orson Welles' Mercury Theater Group put on a classic stage production of Shakespeare's JULIUS CAESAR, in which Welles reset the story from the Roman Empire of 44 - 43 B.C. to 1938 Europe. Caesar was now a typical fascist dictator, and Brutus and his fellow conspirators were trying to free their country. The performances were well recalled, in particular two: George Coulouris as Mark Antony (played as a typical Fascist rabble rouser, as only Coulouris could do), and Norman Lloyd as a mediocre poet named Cinna. Cinna is a minor part in the play (it is not even seen in the classic film version of JULIUS CAESAR by Joseph Mankiewicz with Louis Calhern, Marlon Brando, John Guilgud, and James Mason). He is walking home shortly after the ""Friends, Romans, Countrymen"" speech, and the Roman citizenry is in a mindless anger at the conspirators. One of the conspirators is also named Cinna. When they confront the poet Cinna they jump to a fatally wrong conclusion. The way that Welles directed the scene, a nervous and frightened Lloyd is trying to get out of the confrontation...and quickly. As he has described it on television a year or so ago, the stage became deadly silent for a timed pause, and then the mob jumped him and frightened the audience by the stunning violence of it all. <br/><br/>It helped make the career of this multi-talented performer - he has been producer, director, and actor. He is best known to recent audiences as ""Dr. Daniel Auschlander"" on ST. ELSEWHERE on television. But his first movie role did not pop up until 1942. He played Frank Fry, the real saboteur in Alfred Hitchcock's SABOTEUR. <br/><br/>Hitchcock wanted to do SABOTEUR as a sequel (of sorts) to FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, where he used Herbert Marshall as representative of suspect English pacifists (possibly ""Cliveden"" Set types) who were actually agents of Nazism. Being Hitchcock, he made sure that Marshall's character was actually dignified, proud of his real patriotism (even if misguided) to Germany, and eventually heroic to redeem himself for his daughter's sake. In his original plan for SABOTEUR he planned to make Harry Carey the villain - and a type of ""American First"" leader, like Charles Lindberg (see KEEPER OF THE FLAME). It was a smaller version of the debacle of trying to make Cary Grant a murderer and villain in SUSPICION the previous year: Hitch could not buck RKO and Grant's agent on that one, even though Grant was willing to try it, because of Grant's image. Here it was Carey's following as a popular, father-like, character actor and western star. So Hitch could not do what he really wanted to do.<br/><br/>Robert Cummings gave a decent performance but no more as the suspected saboteur who blew up a factory in the film. He criss-crosses the country trying to find the real saboteur (Lloyd), and running into many interesting ""fifth columnist"" types (like Clem Bevans, playing a particularly bitter old man who is helping the Axis). The head of the sabotage ring is wealthy Otto Kreuger, who gives a nice performance as a sophisticated villain. His first comment on meeting up with Cummings in his townhouse is to say it reminds him of the title of a novel. He pulls out of a bookcase THE DEATH OF A NOBODY by Jules Romain. Apparently he likes 20th Century French literature. <br/><br/>Cummings is hampered (at first) by Priscilla Lane, but she becomes an ally of his when she slowly realizes he was framed. Together they try to prove his innocence. They are fleeing the police and the enemy agents at the same time (with mixed results). We have seen this situation before. Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll had gone through the same thing chasing Godfrey Tearle in THE THIRTY-NINE STEPS, set in Great Britain. Unfortunately Donat and Carroll were better performers, and their script was better too.<br/><br/>But Lloyd is properly sinister. And he was to have as memorable a conclusion here as he had on stage in JULIUS CAESAR. <br/><br/>SPOILER COMING UP:<br/><br/>The conclusion of SABOTEUR was one of the best known in the films of Alfred Hitchcock. The Statue of Liberty is the setting when Cummings confronts Lloyd in the torch of the statue. Lloyd falls over the side, and Cummings tries to pull him up or hold until help comes. But the coat Lloyd wears starts ripping, and he falls shortly after clearing Cummings in the hearing of the police. It was a good sequence to conclude the film with. And it was a wonderful way for Lloyd to be introduced into movies."

","This film is bogged down by some mediocre acting (Robert Cummings in the lead, Priscilla Lane as the love interest) and some below-average writing. Hitchcock does play with some camera work that will pop up later in better pictures -- most notably people dangling perilously from national landmarks and a man pictured falling from a great height. Unfortunately, the story gets downright silly in places, with people inexplicably popping up in and out of captivity. Curiously, we are told at one point that Frank Fry's hiding place in Soda City is ""up north"" (i.e., Northern California), but when we and Cummings find Soda City, it's situated with a fine view of Hoover Dam, on the Arizona-Nevada border. The police allow a bit too much activity by Cummings and Lane in the climactic scenes of the film, when the authorities and presumably trying to round up the saboteurs, to be plausible. Still, there are enough deft Hitchcock touches to prevent the film from being a total disaster. This one may not even be in Hitchcock's top 50, but it's not a bad little diversion."

","Because Robert Cummings isn't as well known as say Cary Grant it is easier in this instance to be drawn into his plight. Priscilla Lane feels right in her part since her all American beauty was the model standard at the time as well as being the cool blonde you look for with Hitchcock, the supporting cast is filled with wonderful characters either eminently likable or hissable as need be.<br/><br/>This is a good showcase for the unjustly semi forgotten Priscilla Lane. Perhaps not the greatest actress of her age she was always a warm presence in her films. Even though she was second choice for this film when Barbara Stanwyck proved unavailable, and almost at the end of her film career opting for marriage and children, she is at the height of her loveliness and gives a very good, enjoyable performance. If nothing else she is ensured a little piece of immortality as a Hitchcock blonde."

","Barry Kane works at an aircraft factory at the height of World War II and as such security is high. When a fire breaks out in the factory Kane, his friend and a man called Fry run to put it out but when the fire extinguisher Fry provides turned out to be filled with gasoline, Kane's friend dies a horrible death. The factory destroyed, the investigations begins and an emotional Kane tells his story. However with no evidence of any ""Fry"" or anyone else who knows him, the authorities suspect that the fire was the work of Kane himself. Unable to convince them otherwise, Kane goes on the run to follow up the few clues he has  knowing that he must get to the Nazi saboteurs before the police get to him.<br/><br/>With a wrongly accused innocent man on the run looking to find the real perpetrators in order to clear his own name, this film plays a bit like a remake of 39 Steps crossed with a dry run for North By Northwest. Although the basic plot device is very familiar now the film is still quite a bit of fun. At times the plot is a bit baggy and does have sections that could have been cut back in order to keep the film moving at a quicker pace but generally everything is engaging and enjoyable. As this is a Hitchcock film we have some solid sequences and set pieces such as the party that is impossible to leave and the memorable conclusion on an American landmark (both basically replayed in North by Northwest). These are enough to move it along even though. The script seems to have lots of people trusting Kane, which I didn't totally buy and felt it was a bit simplistic to only have saboteurs on one side and ""good"" people on the other.<br/><br/>Hitchcock directs with his usual style and uses shadows well to build tension. He has a nice awareness of the comic even in a tense scene and the humour works well at times as a contrast to the building tension. Some reviewers have claimed that Cummings was a dull leading man; I'll give you that he is no Cary Grant in terms of screen presence but he does a good enough job given that all the script requires is a believable ""everyman"". He doesn't have as much chemistry as he could have done with Lane but then, I didn't think she was that good herself. The baddies are not that flamboyant but they are a welcome presence in the film and I enjoyed the turns from Kruger, Baxter and Wolfe to name a few.<br/><br/>Overall this is a solidly enjoyable film. Not as pacey and fun as North By Northwest but fans of that film specifically or Hitchcock generally find it worth watching. The cast are not that impressive but they do the job  just don't expect them to stand up to stars in some of Hitchcock's later films. His touch is evident though and the film looks great, being unmistakably his work and all the better for it."
"MartinHafer","6","4","6","11 September 2013"," I liked this much better the first time I saw this.
","The film begins at an aircraft plant in America during WWII. Unexpectedly, there's an explosion and the place is destroyed--thanks to deliberate sabotage. Not only did someone start the film but they filled the fire extinguishers with gasoline!! Oddly, the police automatically assume that Barry (Bob Cummings) is guilty since he handed one of the extinguishers to a friend following the initial explosion. But Barry knows that a mysterious man, Mr. Fry, is responsible and he escapes and seeks out this character on a wild cross-country trek.<br/><br/>The very first time I saw ""Saboteur"", I really, really liked it--but that was almost 30 years ago. Today when I saw it again, I enjoyed it but also now realize that the film really isn't at all original. In many ways, it's a lot like two earlier Alfred Hitchcock films and one later one--""The 39 Steps"", ""The Girl Was Young"" and ""North By Northwest"". All three have a man on the run from the law who is innocent and all three team up with a girl who is unwillingly pulled into the affair and all three have the woman come to believe in the man's innocence. Because of this, the film automatically loses a couple of points since it just isn't very original. Plus, while the sabotage angle was great for propaganda purposes back in 1942, today it makes the film seem a bit dated. Now don't get me wrong--it IS a good film.<br/><br/>An additional problem with ""Saboteur"" is that the film relies on a HUGE cliché--strangers who INSTANTLY assume the leading man is an innocent man and who help him escape the police. In real life, this would almost never happen--yet in this film it happens repeatedly.<br/><br/>Because of these serious weaknesses, the film is very uneven. While it is well-crafted by Hitchcock and the acting is nice, the story really is sub-par and poorly written at times. It's hard to score a derivative and clichéd film highly, even if it is well made. Watchable and interesting but flawed...seriously flawed."

","In the course of the unlikely events that unfold in Alfred Hitchcock's 1942 adventure, SABOTEUR, the prototypical Wrongly Accused Man (along with the obligatory Cool Blonde) ends up on a circus train where Hitchcock and his writers serve up an impromptu social studies lesson on the basics of American democracy. The fate of the fugitive lovers comes down to a vote of a microcosm of our political system as defined by a carload of circus performers. Those voting include Siamese twins, bound together by nature and separated by an innate need to disagree (Republicans and Democrats?); a ""fascist"" dwarf (the reactionary far right?); The Fat Lady, whose sympathy for both sides of the arguments render her neutral and noncommittal (the pacifist and indecisive far left?) and The Thin Man, a bony old codger who knows the right thing to do, but feels compelled to bend to the will of the majority (Uncle Sam?). The final vote falls to The Bearded Lady, an androgynous old woman who lets her emotions rule over her common sense (the average American voter, perhaps?).<br/><br/>It is a mildly satirical scene that may or may not carry any real, great meaning, but its absurdity suggests what SABOTEUR could have been. Couple it with the film's famed finale, the tense, yet utterly ridiculous tussle atop the Statue of Liberty, and you can see the possibilities. SABOTEUR is to some degree an example of wartime patriotic propaganda, yet there is a subversive undercurrent to the tale: The villains are disguised as family men and do-gooder socialites; the American populous is defined as sideshow freaks; and the Cool Blonde is a model, a pretty and shallow tool of capitalism. And the hapless wrongly accused hero on the run is, on the one hand, the epitome of strong, resourceful American individualism, as well as being the stereotypical loner who is betrayed by the system.<br/><br/>Even so, SABOTEUR is not so much satirical as just silly. Though Hitchcock plays it all more or less straight, adding but a few darkly whimsical touches here and there, the blend of humor and thrill don't quite gel. Though the story seems to be a trial run for similar themes he would recycle in NORTH BY NORTHWEST, one gets the feeling that it would all have been better as a straightforward comedy, such as Bob Hope starring in MY FAVORITE SABOTEUR.<br/><br/>The story involves Robert Cummings as Barry Kane, a worker at a wartime munitions factory which is a target for sabotage. Though Kane should be a key witness in identifying the actual saboteur, his information is casually disregarded by the none-too-bright police and he becomes the prime player in a cross country chase, which ironically goes North by Northeast, as Kane heads form Los Angeles to Washington D.C. This is not top-drawer Hitchcock, as evidenced by the B-list cast of actors. The film is not helped much by the rather bland performance by Cummings, still a decade or so from the sitcom fame that would allow him to develop a genuine comedic charm.<br/><br/>And Hitchcock runs into what is a standard problem in many of his films, the question of ""Why doesn't he just go to the police?"" The prototypical Hitchcock adventure finds an innocent man who is forced to solve a crime and track down the villains (usually with the help of the blonde love interest), because he can't trust the authorities. Such plots, if you examine them too closely, are often ludicrous and contrive extreme complications to keep the hero running from the cops and toward the bad guys. It is the primary weakness of SABOTEUR that so much hinges on so little: there is just no logical reason for Kane not to go to the police and not even much reason for the police to be after him in the first place. It is to the director's credit that he gets the action moving along so nicely with such little motivation. I suspect that the man on the run plot premise was already so ingrained into the fabric of film storytelling even in 1942, that moviegoers just didn't bother to question the logic."

He takes off to find the real culprits, running into Priscilla Lane along the way and reenacting some scenes that felt stolen directly from Hitchcock's own ""The 39 Steps.""

And the film ends so abruptly that you're not even sure what happens to the main character, but in a way that doesn't feel intentional.<br/><br/>I've yet to see a Hitchcock film that isn't at least entertaining, and this one is that, but it's certainly not among his classics.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

","On my VHS box of Saboteur the film was noted as Alfred Hitchcock's first with an all American cast. Thinking about it you can make that claim for it considering the foreign locations of both Rebecca and Foreign Correspondent.<br/><br/>Saboteur involves Robert Cummings as both the pursuer and the pursued. The police think he's a Saboteur who bombed a Los Angeles aircraft factory where he worked. Cummings knows it was Norman Lloyd who did it, a mysterious man named Fry. So Cummings is both evading the cops and looking for the real Saboteur who can clear him.<br/><br/>The chase and pursue theme is one that Hitchcock uses over and over again from The Thirty Nine Steps to North By Northwest. In both of those films it was much better done.<br/><br/>Hitchcock did not pick his leading players in this film. Priscilla Lane had left Warner Brothers and was looking to broaden her appeal. She'd signed with Universal and Hitchcock had to take her. She's good, but she's hardly in the image of classic sophisticated Hitchcock blonds like Grace Kelly, Madeleine Carroll, or Eva Marie Saint. She's just to perky to compete with those ladies.<br/><br/>Bob Cummintgs was a second choice, Hitchcock wanted and couldn't get Joel McCrea. That proved to be a fortunate accident. Cummings is froth with youthful idealism in his performance, he holds his own in confrontational scenes with master fifth columnist Otto Kruger.<br/><br/>In fact the villains here are the most interesting characters. Whether they are from the isolationist mid-west like Otto Kruger or society matrons like Alma Kruger or some nobodies like Clem Bevans, Alan Baxter, or Norman Lloyd, they've drunken in the philosophy of a master race and find it heady stuff indeed. Listen to Otto Kruger's explanation for his treason, his contempt for the easily manipulated voters, his drive for power as well as money. The most frightening part of the film.<br/><br/>More even than that climax at the Statue of Liberty. For years the torch on the statue has been closed so Cummings and Lloyd at the top is maybe even more thrilling for today's audience than at the time the film was released. But Hitchcock himself said he made a mistake, when he did the chase in North By Northwest, better to have the hero than the villain do the dangling.<br/><br/>It's not one of Hitchcock's best films, but Saboteur holds up well for today's audience and in an age of global terror, very relevant."

Unfortunately, the story line seems to have been concocted by a committee of three, with predictably unfocused results. Worst of all, the bad guys are totally unrealistic. They can always be counted on to behave in such a manner as to advance the plot, no matter if it serves their own heinous purposes or not. The movie also descends into preachiness at times, which I suppose can be attributed to the 1942 provenance and the uncertainty of the war's outcome.

","I really enjoy this film. It is a look back in time when this nation was truly at risk from nations who either attacked or delared war on us,i.e., the Japanese and Germans. Robert Cummings and Pricilla Lane were excellent in the lead roles. The supporting cast... Otto Kruger, Alan Baxter, Clem Bevins, and Norman Lloyd were also outstanding. The direction, pace, and finale held and continue to hold my interest. So much so, that I bought my own copy. Thank goodness for Turner Classic Movies, they show so many of the truly classic films, including this one.<br/><br/>Robert Cummings was certainly no light weight as an actor and although I am a great fan of Gary Cooper and Joel McCrea, two of my favorite actors, who were first offered the lead role, I don't see what they would have brought to the role that would have surpassed Bob Cummings' performance.<br/><br/>This is a film that I enjoy watching repeatingly and urge others to view."

","The scene is World War II, and a man at an aircraft factory is mistakenly accused of killing his buddy in an act of sabotage.  He must find the man who framed him in order to prove his innocence.  This is the story behind one of Alfred Hitchcock's lesser known films, and certainly one of his better suspense thrillers.  The story is really nothing unique to Hitchcock as it is the basic premise behind films like The Man Who Knew Too Much, North By Northwest, The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes, etc...  It is, however, as with most of Hitch's film, the execution of the plot that makes the film so good.  The acting is first-rate, and Bob Cummings probably gives his best performance.  Norman Lloyd excels as the villain Frye, and Otto Krueger is magnificent as an evil traitor bent on ruining the framework of America so as to allow a Fascist regime to take over.  Yes, the movie is very patriotic, and it does have some very sentimental dialogue, etc....but this film must be looked at in the context with which it was made.  Beside having some very thrilling and climactic scenes, the best revolve around the good of people and the spirit of man to help his fellow man, as with the encounter with the blind man and with the traveling circus. Enjoy!"

"romanorum1","8","2","3","23 September 2013"," Appearances are Deceiving
","After moving to the USA in 1939, Alfred Hitchcock, the Master of Suspense, had made such good psychological dramas like ""Rebecca"" (1940) and ""Notorious"" (1941). After the USA entered World War II in late 1941, it was obvious that Hollywood movie themes would focus on such subjects as espionage, the home front, national defense, and action in the field. Meanwhile Hitchcock's excellent ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (1943) drew Hitchcock fully into ""Americana,"" the American culture. <br/><br/>Before ""Shadow of a Doubt"" Hitchcock was already centered on war time America. In ""Saboteur,"" Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is falsely accused of (Nazi) sabotage at a California airplane plant during the dark days of World War II. During a fire of suspicious origin, Frank Fry (Norman Lloyd), a supposed factory worker, had handed Kane a fire extinguisher that he passed onto his friend, Ken Mason. Mason perished in the flames. It turned out that the fire extinguisher was filled with gasoline. As there was no worker named Fry, suspicion fell on Kane, who fled. During his truck ride, he remembered that he had noticed Fry's address on an envelope that read Deep Springs Ranch, Springville, California. At the ranch he meets boss Tobin (Otto Kruger), a ""gentleman-villain"" who is onto Kane. Soon rounded up by ranch hands, he escapes the law when he dives from a bridge into a deep river (duplicated notably in 1993's ""The Fugitive""). Still handcuffed, he dries out rather quickly at the house of blind man Phillip Martin (NOT Miller, played compassionately by Vaughan Glaser). Suspense is created when Kane drops a knife in front of Martin's niece Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) and hesitates to pick it up because of his handcuffs. We are surprised when the blind man says to his niece that he recognized the sound of the handcuffs early on. Unlike her uncle, Miss Martin does not believe in Kane, and tells him so while they are in her car. So when she later tries to summon roadside help, he uses the time to cut the handcuffs in half using the auto engine fan blade. Tension is created because of Hitchcock's use of multiple cuts between Kane and Lane: We wonder, ""Will Kane win the race and free himself?"" Anyway, eventually Miss Martin begins to believe in the man's innocence, especially after the two wind up in Soda City (probably Nevada, even though filmed in California, as it is near the Boulder, or Hoover, Dam). Kane calls it ""The heart of the bicarbonate belt."" In the ghost town (since 1923) there is a most unusual coincidence when Pat and Barry inadvertently discover that Hoover Dam may have been targeted. <br/><br/>After more than an hour into the movie the setting swiftly shifts to the East. Our hero gets a ride from Nevada without any in-between stops being shown. Continuity suffers: No Fort Larned, no Abe Lincoln Home, no Valley Forge! In NY, the villains are still well-disguised: Mrs. Sutton conducts a wonderful charity event, and the upper crust bad guys seem so polite. So whom do you trust? Anyway the target is a new ship being launched at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. There is a thrilling theater shootout before an anticlimax at the torch of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. We do not know what happens to the rest of the Nazi sympathizers, but perhaps the director wanted to remind us that enemy agents were still at large at the time and that Americans should be alert to their nefarious activities. <br/><br/>Appearances are deceiving in this film, and we cite several examples. According to Miss Martin, Kane looks like a saboteur even though he is innocent. Mr. Martin is blind but seems aware of everything going on around him. Tobin and Sutton appear clean although they are anything but unblemished. Although Soda City is a dead town, unscrupulous activities occur there. Conversely, note that Pat Martin's billboard advertisements are interesting for describing the actions that follow:<br/><br/> ""You're Being Followed"" (warning to Kane) <br/><br/> ""She'll Never Let You Down"" (Miss Martin's later change of heart) <br/><br/> ""Beautiful Funeral"" (death in NY)<br/><br/>""Saboteur"" features many positives. The opening credits feature a nice introductory music score. Set designs are excellent throughout, and the film is well-paced. We see some attractive USA monuments: Hoover Dam, Red Rock Canyon State Park, Radio City Music Hall, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty National Monument. There is an amazing assortment of distinct characters: The circus troupe is right out of ""Freaks"" (1932). Priscilla Lane is top billed, along with Robert Cummings. Vaughan Glaser (Glazer) is particularly likable. Unconscionably, he is incorrectly identified in the closing credits as Mr. Miller even though he tells Kane that his name is Phillip Martin. ""Saboteur"" may not be ""Vertigo,"" ""North by Northwest"" or ""Psycho"" but it is enjoyable and has a thrilling ending. In time the Master of Suspense would feature other USA landmarks, like Mt. Rushmore National Memorial (""North by Northwest""), the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (""Vertigo""), and the Blue Ridge Mountains (""Marnie"")."
"pixrox1","8","2","3","24 August 2013"," ""They're getting a rope . . . ""
",""" . . . hang on, Fry!"", shouts Robert Cummings' character, Barry Kane, to actor Norman Lloyd, playing the title role, as the latter dangles by his sleeve (which Kane is grasping) from the torch of America's Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. After Fry has turned Kane's best friend at the war plane plant into a crispy critter and transformed Kane into his personal patsy\Public Enemy #1, pursued by multiple police agencies as he himself pursues the real killer in a way O.J. never did, it would be more appropriate if the last words Fry ever hears are ""They're getting a rope; hang him high!"" Of course, in real life, U-boats dropped off multiple Nazis on America's East Coast during WWII with instructions to become saboteurs, but G-men tracked them down and our hanging president, FDR, strung them up. Apparently, when SABOTEUR director Alfred Hitchcock moved from London to Hollywood during the Battle of Britain to escape German bombers during WWII, he caught the bleeding heart disease endemic there, then and now.

","While SABOTEUR may be just another Hitchcock 'wronged man' thriller, don't let that put you off – this turns out to be one of his strongest films from the 1940s (along with FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT). The formula for success is as simple as a decent story, well told by a master filmmaker who wrings every ounce of suspense and tension from his fast-paced narrative.<br/><br/>Robert Cummings plays a working class hero – a surprise, as I'm more used to seeing Jimmy Stewart/Cary Grant playing well suited gents – who finds himself framed for an act of sabotage at an aircraft factory that saw a close friend die. From there on in, he's pursued cross-country by the police and soon finds himself in the midst of a sinister conspiracy by a gang of fifth columnists. There are enough twists and turns to keep even the most jaded mystery fan watching, and the narrative never flags for a second.<br/><br/>Cummings is a delight as the hero, an ordinary Joe type guy you can really get behind. Priscilla Lane is the typically feisty heroine, and the two share a genuine chemistry that enhances the film's appeal. The villains, too, are fast from the ordinary typecast bad guys: Otto Kruger is urbane, well-heeled and supremely confident, Norman Lloyd delightfully sinister.<br/><br/>The film moves from one set-piece to the next. Some of them are visually impressive, such as a scene set on the Statue of Liberty (stylistically foreshadowing the ending of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, which went one better) and the bit where the hero and heroine find themselves at a charity ball, trapped like pieces on a chess board. However, it's the dialogue scenes that really zing – particularly an early encounter with a blind man and a later confrontation in the villains' study. Hitchcock even takes time out for an intense interlude involving a travelling wagon of circus freaks, which I wasn't expecting one bit. Despite the familiar premise, SABOTEUR is one of the master's freshest and most exciting films and a real delight for this viewer."

","A man is wrongfully accused of killing his friend in an aircraft plant fire, and must travel cross-country to avoid the police and discover the true sinister nature of the situation at hand. A plot line that was later used to fuel Hitchcock's classic North by Northwest, Saboteur benefits from some very good performances as well as some masterful suspense sequences from the Master himself.<br/><br/>For any Hitchcock fan, the plot is a bit too familiar, but he was always able to infuse the story with its own memorable supporting characters and charades. Here, the likable and charming Robert Cummings is the lead and soon finds himself visiting many strange and quirky characters, not withstanding a troupe of circus performers, a rich businessman with hidden motives, and a blind loner who shows him the best way to judge someone.<br/><br/>In terms of sheer originality and quality, this does lack in some areas, particularly the motive of the antagonists. However, there is some nice chemistry between Cummings and his lead lady, the much under-appreciated Priscilla Lane as well as a truly moving performance as the blind man by Vaughn Glaser. The best part is the final sequence, which perfectly mirrors what Hitchcock would use later in North by Northwest, only this time the climax is atop a statue in New York. Certainly not his best, but the Master of Suspense gives us some great moments to wait for."
"JohnWelles","8","2","3","1 May 2009"," Flawed, but Entertaining.
","Alfred Hitchcock's ""Saboteur"" (1942) (not to be confused with another Hitchcock film, ""Sabotage"" made in 1936 which has a completely different plot) is not the Master of Suspense greatest film. It dose not have the depth of ""Vertigo"" (1958) nor the brooding atmosphere of ""Rebbeca"" (1940) and it certainly dose not have the emotional impact and acting talent that can be found in ""Notorious"" (1946), but what it dose have is thrills, adventure and a nail biting climax. The two leads, admittedly, are quite weak. It is easy to understand why Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper for the Robert Cummings role and Barbara Stanwyck for the role that was taken by Priscilla Lane. Also, the patriotic speeches that Cuumming says (that were written by Dorothy Parker) have dated badly, and the encounter with circus troupe is poorly done (the beard on the bearded lady is clearly false). However, the last half hour is edge-of-your-seat viewing, the climax atop the Stature of Liberty is very well done, and the film is a clear predecessor of ""North By Northwest"" (1959). The two villains, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very good and the beginning fire at the Aircraft Factory is a superb sequence. This not the best film Hitch made, but it is surly one of his most entertaining."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","2","3","28 January 2009"," How many steps up to the torch of the Statue of Liberty?
","The subject is banal, even in 1942. It is war propaganda. The fascists are among us and they are doing all they can to sabotage the war effort and to prepare their victory and their seizure of power then and their establishing an effective totalitarian state. But Hitchcock has to make it a real thriller. So he invents a first sabotage that succeeds but one of the victims, the friend of the one who dies in it, becomes the prime suspect and run-away for the sabotage. That enables him to so-to-say visit the country and discover the tricky organization of the local Nazis who have acquaintances and support in the top benevolent society and use the small little dissatisfied whites to do the dirty work. The chase after the real saboteur takes our young false suspect from Los Angeles to New York and to the top of the organization. He meets a blind pianist who believes his senses to know the chap is not guilty, his niece who is a star of the advertising billboard but also a frenetic and fanatic patriot who only thinks of going to the police. Then the rich rancher and his nest of plotters. Then, on the road some sympathetic and friendly truck driver, and the long caravan of a circus going around and their dwarf, bearded woman, Siamese sisters, and a few other grotesques of that type. And he discovers the target in a Soda City, an electric dam that provides Los Angeles and its war industry with the energy they need. He takes part as a gravel in the organization in the sabotage of a USS Alaska military ship when it is launched. And finally with some inventiveness, creativity and elbow grease he and the pianist's niece manage to get the whole lot cleaned up, most of them arrested and the first saboteur, a certain Fry, falls down from the torch of the Statue of Liberty. That one won't fry on the old electric sparking chair. But Hitchcock is not yet in his habit of having a personal cameo appearance in his own films, so don't look for him. It's well built and well performed, but it is only a propaganda film with an extra style.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

","Hitchcock once gave an interview where he said he like to direct screenplays that had an ordinary person minding their own business, who's accidentally caught up in an awful chain of events that they can't get out of until the dastardly plot that's behind their troubles is resolved. That way, the audience can feel more sympathy for the hero. We certainly do in this fine film. Barry Kane is only trying to help his fellow-man out by performing acts of kindness and consideration, like helping Fry pick up the letters he dropped at the factory. Barry even returns a lost $100 bill to Fry later on...that was BIG money in 1943!! It's Barry's acts of Christian kindness that get him into trouble and soon, he's wrongly accused of sabotage and murder and will likely hang if he can't clear himself. Similar to The 39 Steps in plot, the hero travels cross-country where he discovers plans for further acts of terrorism by fascisistic cells, an arch-villain who nobody could believe to be a closet-Nazi, and a beautiful blonde, Patricia Martin, who first suspects and hates then eventually falls in love with Barry Kane. Hitch's trademark touches of humor are here, too. Patricia is a billboard model who's various roadside ads are a help and comfort to Barry as he hitches a ride with the bad guys, all the way from Las Vegas to NYC. We meet a trucker who's a one-man comedy act ""Someone convinced my wife it was stylish to eat three meals a day."" Field employees of the fascist spy ring grouse about being forgotten or ignored by the ""suits"" just as if they were working for some legit enterprise. During a chase scene into a cinema, audience members laugh at the action of a schlocky comedy/gangster flick as the saboteur cell shoots it out for real with the good guys and accidentially kills a guffawing movie-patron. Awful for the dead old man, but funny! Hitch liked to use famous monuments in his movies and this is the best instance, with the Statue of Liberty as backdrop and ironic icon! It works even better than the Mt Rushmore scene in NBNW."

I didn't enjoy this one as much as Rope but that's not saying this is a bad film, it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more.<br/><br/>It seems like a film Hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones. As a thriller, I feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the States. The climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension. The sound design is almost non existent. You can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them, but the important things are missing, the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve, the need of music to amp of the tension, all missing. Intentional no doubt, yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene. Then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside.<br/><br/>The film doesn't feel like it should either, they are almost globe trotting from place to place, yet it feels more confined. The script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving.<br/><br/>The performances are there, but nothing amazing. Everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page. The relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work. The one stand out is Otto Kruger, who has that rich, ego, evil persona down pat.<br/><br/>In the end, I wanted more from this one.

ROBERT CUMMINGS, affable and pleasant as always, has to carry the film as a man on the lam fleeing the authorities because he's suspected of having blown up a munitions factory. He's a basically lightweight actor at his element in light romantic comedies--not in espionage films--and seems a strange choice for this role. Where is Joel McCrea or Gary Cooper when you need him?<br/><br/>Likewise, Priscilla Lane, with her bubbly girl next door personality is not quite the type of blonde Hitchcock picked for his leading lady roles--and frankly, she's rather bland here and merely decorative.<br/><br/>But the supporting cast is a good one--especially Otto Kruger as a blind man--and once the plot gets going, they all come in for closer inspection. The villain of the piece--played expertly by Norman Lloyd--is given scant screen time but he manages to make an impression nevertheless, especially in the famous Statue of Liberty finale.<br/><br/>The story comes to a rather abrupt ending after a slow start and there are some moments in the middle that seem to drag. The pace is slower than usual for a Hitchcock film and today's audiences are more apt to expect the kind of thrills Hitch offered for his other more famous ""man on the lam"" story--NORTH BY NORTHWEST.<br/><br/>SABOTEUR has its fair share of gripping moments so it's still worth a watch--but don't expect too much.

After watching, one remembers Murray Alper as the jovial truck driver, Vaughan Glaser's touching turn as a blind ""patriot"", the unforgettable traveling Freak Show and of course Otto Kruger as the suave and sophisticated villain, all of whom completely overshadow Bob Cummings as the rather wooden fugitive (compare that bridge jump to Harrison Ford's similar stunt in Andrew Davis' ""The Fugitive"") and Priscilla Lane whose change of heart and subsequent love towards Cummings is never quite believable.<br/><br/>The other major support player is, of course, Hitchcock himself who bookends the film with 2 extraordinary stunts.  Many people criticise the older films for their lack of realistic special effects.  My feelings are that with lack of technology, to even attempt and convey what the director wants to show is an amazing achievement.<br/><br/>Obviously this film carries an anti-fascist message, made at the time of the Second World War, but being a Hitchcock it is never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on the action.  Well worth checking out, especially for the support roles."
"Snow Leopard","Null","1","1","22 June 2001"," Works Very Well As Light Entertainment
","This film's wartime message may not be as convincing now as it was to its original audience, but ""Saboteur"" still works very well as light entertainment.  Hitchcock used a lot of imaginative ideas that produce a fast-paced movie filled with good scenes, and whose entertainment value outweighs the rather stereotyped characters and what now comes across as a somewhat clumsy message.<br/><br/>Robert Cummings stars as an aircraft factory worker framed for a fatal fire caused by Nazi-sympathizing saboteurs.  He spends most of the film trying to evade the police while trying to locate the saboteurs, using only a couple of small clues.  Along the way, he runs into a great variety of mostly interesting characters, some who help him and others who try to turn him in. It's quite similar to, although not as good as, ""The 39 Steps"" or ""North By Northwest"".  There is not much to most of the main characters or to the dialogue, but there are several pretty good action and suspense sequences.<br/><br/>You shouldn't expect the depth from ""Saboteur"" that you usually find in Hitchcock's thrillers, but there should be enough entertainment value here to satisfy most of his fans."
"laika-lives","6","3","7","23 June 2007"," Citizen Kane, or 'the surest test of the American heart.'
","Conventional critical thinking holds that 'Shadow of a Doubt' was Hitchcock's first truly American film. After all, his first few projects in Hollywood consisted of two English Gothic mysteries with all-British casts, a romp through Europe with a token Joel McCrea, and an obscure screwball comedy that he did as a favour to a friend. How conveniently they pass over 'Saboteur', a rather clumsy piece of wartime propaganda with none of the critical standing of Hitchcock's subsequent masterpiece. The small town setting of 'Shadow of a Doubt' is warmly welcomed as authentic, if subversive, Americana. On the other hand 'Saboteur', the argument goes, is just a reworking of British classic 'The 39 Steps', with Hitchcock displaying a tourist's eye for landmarks like Radio City Music Hall and the Statue of Liberty.<br/><br/>Nuts to that.<br/><br/>'Saboteur' is as authentically American as anything Hitchcock would later achieve; if critics failed to recognise the United States he showed them, it may say more about their preconceptions of a meritocratic New World than any failure on his part. After all, this is an America where an honest working man, doing his part for the war effort, can find his life falling apart through the machinations of the rich and idle; where the overworked (the lorry driver), the disabled (Pat's uncle), and the outcast (the circus folk) know that they must help their fellow victims in the face of what seems like routine police harassment; and where the wealthy can make troublesome proles who gatecrash their charity benefits 'disappear'. The use of Romain's 'The Death of a Nobody' seems highly pointed. Soda City, meanwhile, is a ghost town haunted by the worst times American workers had known - the great depression (contemporary viewers could not have missed the significance of it having been abandoned at the end of the 1920's).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the requisite patriotism for Hollywood films of this period is neatly pricked by Hitchcock and his writers. Whilst everyone insists on bleating on about the great American virtues, Pat's uncle and the circus folk quietly assert an alternative paradigm of American life. Pat herself - 'little Miss Liberty, carrying her torch' - only becomes the heroine once she learns to put aside her zealous urge to be a good citizen. In this context, the symbolism of the Statue of Liberty - as hope for the dispossessed, rather than an icon of patriotism - seems sharper than critics would allow.<br/><br/>The casting of Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane as the leads, as opposed to the bigger names Hitchcock was growing accustomed to, seems rather apt in a film about little people caught up in the grinding wheels of war and espionage. Cummings' Barry Kane will never be anybody's favourite Hitchcock hero, and when the director brought him back for 'Dial M for Murder', there was a merciless irony imposed on the character. Lane is better, particularly as the film progresses, but she's solid rather than interesting; her character is just too nice. The villains are, however, fantastic, particularly Otto Kruger as the charmer who scarpers the country. His delight in both his granddaughter and his treachery are a joy to behold. There's a savage irony in that, of all the villains, it's only hired lackey Fry (the small variety, one presumes) who gets his comeuppance at the climax. As usual, the rich get clean away.<br/><br/>All the critical contortion to overlook this film is, perhaps, understandable. The writing is highly inconsistent, with exposition ladled all over the place and the propaganda elements laid on with a cement mixer, to the point that it suffocates some of the finer scenes, such as the encounter with the circus folk (compare with the relatively elegant 'Foreign Correspondent', or the dramatically tighter 'Lifeboat'). The set pieces at Tobin's ranch, Mrs Sutton's party, the Radio City Music Hall (with the uncannily inappropriate laughter of the audience at the violent on screen murder) and the Statue of Liberty (a reminder of the days when the French were seen as forerunners of American ideology, rather than cheese-eating surrender monkeys) are master classes, but a lot of the rest of the film seems poorly paced and indifferently acted.<br/><br/>But, oh, what a title sequence."

","Allegedly, director John Ford was once asked by a reporter why the Apaches chasing the eponymous stagecoach in 1939's ""Stagecoach"" didn't just shoot the stage's horses to stop it. Ford's reply: ""Well, that would have ended the movie."" <br/><br/>I kept thinking of that Ford response while watching Alfred Hitchcock's 1942 film ""Saboteur."" <br/><br/>The plot: Ordinary, average Joe American, ""Barry Kane"" (Bob Cummings), works in a Los Angeles aircraft plant where a fire breaks-out. Kane and a co-worker friend rush to put out the flames during which they're handed a fire extinguisher by someone whom they think is a fellow co-worker named ""Frank Fry"" (Norman Lloyd). The extinguisher, though, contains gasoline which accelerates the flames and kills Kane's friend. In the ensuing investigation, suspicion turns on Kane because there was no record of a Frank Fry working in that plant. Thus, Kane is accused of deliberate sabotage and causing the death of his friend. Rather than face the charges, Kane decides that only he can track down the mysterious Fry and clear his name. So, he flees with the authorities hot on his trail. Along the way, he inexplicably picks-up a beautiful blonde model, Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane), who is initially convinced of his guilt, but then starts to believes him. (And also falls in love with him.) Pat's conversion towards Kane's point of view is helped when they stumble upon a whole ring of saboteurs bent on aiding the fascist cause. To the shock of Kane and Pat, these saboteurs are led by a smooth-talking, sophisticated western rancher, ""Charles Tobin"" (Otto Kruger) and a grand dame of NYC society, ""Mrs. Sutton"" (Alma Kruger). Kane and Pat experience a host of captures and narrow escapes while trying stop the ring's next plot to destroy a battleship upon its christening launch in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. It all culminates in a chase on the top of Statue of Liberty.<br/><br/>As others have noted, ""Saboteur"" comes across as an American version of Hitchcock's 1935 ""The 39 Steps"" and a precursor to 1959's ""North by Northwest."" It features many plot elements that were used in both those films. However, ""Saboteur"" is not considered a Hitchcock classic like ""The 39 Steps"" and ""North by Northwest."" Why ""Saboteur"" does not get the accolades of those other films is usually based on its cast being inferior due to having lightweight Bob Cummings and pretty singer-turned-actress Priscilla Lane as its leads. However, I think its script is just not as smart or clever.<br/><br/>In fact, I thought ""Saboteur"" was pretty stupid mainly because the supposedly ruthless and sophisticated sabotage ring was so incredibly stupid. They repeatedly capture Kane and Pat. Yet, instead of putting bullets in their brains and then burying them, the ring keeps them alive and puts them unrestrained and unobserved in rooms by themselves from which they quickly escape. As much as I wanted Kane and Pat to succeed, I still found myself saying: ""Shoot them!"" whenever the sabotage ring had them in their clutches. There was NO REASON whatsoever for the ring to keep these two alive. Yet, the ring kept doing it.<br/><br/>I wonder if anyone ever asked Hitchcock why the saboteurs didn't just kill Barry Kane and Pat Martin and if he replied: ""Well, that would have ended the movie."""

","Solid if not stolid Hitchcock war-time movie, it contains some imaginative scenes of typical Hitchcockian panache, but sags in the middle, is peopled with too many characters and while it picks up again for its justly famous climax atop the Statue of Liberty, is lacking somewhat in dramatic impact.<br/><br/>Of course it's fun to see past and future Hitchcock motifs get aired, for instance, there's an innocent man in handcuffs befriended by an initially suspicious attractive girl, then there are the various pointers to ""North By North-West"", both climaxing atop a national monument, the innocent hero encountering peril in the middle of nowhere and the hero's ingenuity in causing confusion at a party scene to effect an escape. The older wiser Hitch knew how to increase the potency of the high jeopardy scene the second time around, c.f. Cary Grant's rescue of Eva Marie Saint on Mt Rushmore, a character whom the audience cared about, rather than the plunge to his death of the Nazi sympathiser,spectacular as it is. That scene above Lady Liberty is a triumph of imagination and vision, but is by no means the only effective one here, take for instance the ""slot-machine"" reaction shots to the bomb at the ship's launch or the comic insertions of Priscilla Lane's advertising billboards which provide an ironic commentary on the action. There's also the fleeing couple's meet-up with the travelling circus, an obvious but still cleverly written microcosm for the different standpoints on the War (one suspects Dorothy Parker's hand at the wheel for this scene).<br/><br/>Truth to tell, there's probably a little too much speechifying which slows the action down. Also, it's pretty obvious that this is B-list casting when Hitchcock invariably worked better with marquee-names. Robert Cummings is pleasant and amiable enough, but has a slightly mincing gait and doesn't act anger too well. Lane is a touch better, sassy but lacking a little on warmth and glamour but the main kudos go to Otto Kruger as the sinister Tobin, the traitor hiding behind the veneer of respectability, like so many of Hitchcock's ""smiling villains"".<br/><br/>I enjoyed it as I invariably enjoy almost every Hitchcock feature, especially from his Hollywood years, but this particular outing seems more like a stop on the road rather than a destination in itself."

","Rating: *** out of 4.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock was not on the top of his game in SABOTEUR, an Americanized version of his own 39 STEPS, littered with propaganda elements; like his superb thriller THE FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, this Hitchcock thriller was used to promote awareness of ""the enemy"". But even if SABOTEUR won't be remembered as his best work, and one that certainly won't be outdo its own prototype, it's still a fine crackling good yarn that occasionally lulls but mostly interests.<br/><br/>Robert Cummings (who later would work again for Hitch in the arguably better DIAL M FOR MURDER) plays Barry Kane, an aircraft factory worker who is framed for setting the factory on fire, resulting the death of one of his own friends. Sadly, his friend and another fellow named Fry (Norman Lloyd), are the only witnesses, and one is dead and the other is on the run. Now, as any Hitchcock character would do, Kane runs out to find the true saboteur and along the way he picks up a blonde companion named Pat Martin (Pricilla Lane) who has no use but to trust him despite her doubts.<br/><br/>There are a number of bizarrely humorous moments in the film, particularly in a scene where Kane and Pat hitches a ride with a couple of circus freaks (!). This probably has a lot to do with the fact that author Dorothy Parker is a collaborator. A number of memorable set-pieces give the film edge and excitement; there's a second attempt at sabotage on a ship setting sale, a shootout in a theater (that mirrors the film itself), and the finale on top of the Statue of Liberty (a fight for liberty, perhaps?).<br/><br/>Overall, a pretty flawed but nonetheless engaging film."
"jem132","8","2","4","4 June 2007"," A Worthy Hitchcock Film With Some Terrific Suspense Sequences
","This plot-driven early American Hitchcock film bears more than a few similarities to the director's earlier British offering, THE 39 STEPS (1935). Both films involved an innocent man accused of a crime he did not commit (a common theme in Hitchcock films), who is forced to go on a cross-country chase to clear his name. It's a neat warm-up for NORTHY BY NORTHWEST (1959) and seems to be a ""feeler"" film for Hitchcock (if there is such a term)- he is feeling his way across the American continent in SABOTEUR (1942), investigating a cross-section of the American way of life and it's many famous landmarks.<br/><br/>Robert Cummings (very young here) and Priscilla Lane (in a rare leading-lady role) are the male and female leads who are drawn together when Cummings is accused of sabotage in a factory explosion (his best friend is also killed in the blast)and finds himself a wanted criminal. Lane is the woman who is initially mistrustful, yet later warms to him, falls in love with him and vows to help him.<br/><br/>As SABOTEUR( 1942)is plot-driven, unlike other Hitchcock films there is little deep assessment of character. Cummings and Lane are likable as the two leads (Lane bearing a striking resemblance to a young Barbara Stanwyck here)yet don't really hit any new acting heights (though I much prefer Cummings in this film to his bland role in DIAL M FOR MURDER). However, the romance between the two lead characters is well handled by the actors and is quite touching.<br/><br/>The film is built around set pieces and an intriguing bunch of supporting characters. Most memorable are the slick villain and the blind man who Cummings lands upon when on the run. The script is generally good, although a few overly-patriotic, distracting speeches (though this was made in the middle of WW2) accompanied by an intrusive, jarring score hamper the production.<br/><br/>The set pieces and suspense sequences make SABOTEUR (1942) a worthy entry in the Hitchcock cannon. This is the film where a man hangs off the Statue Of Liberty (no doubt a studio model)with his jacket thrillingly tearing at the seams. This oft-imitated shot is one of Hitchcock's most memorable moments of suspense.<br/><br/>Hitchcock also recognizes the irony and fallacies of the American lifestyle in SABOTEUR (1942). It is deeply ironic that Montgomery is shown the most help and sympathy by a blind man, an ordinary truck driver and members of a traveling freak show, whilst the rich, outwardly decent and honest ranch owner is really a part of the Anti-American establishment.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Hitchcock practically lifted one key scene of SABOTEUR (1942) straight into his later work NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959). The early scene which has Montgomery going to a luxurious property and finding himself in mortal danger foreshadows Cary Grant and James Mason's first meeting in NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959). Like the Grant film, the whole set-up of the ranch is a complete fake- a maid even pulls a gun on Montgomery! Hitchcock also borrows from THE 39 STEPS (1935) a scene involving Montgomery, handcuffed in a police car, being stopped by a mob of sheep. It is fascinating to see how SABOTEUR (1942) interrelates with other key Hitchcock works.<br/><br/>All in all, SABOTEUR (1942) is a worthy Hitchcock films that serves a viewing. This plot-driven vehicle is full of memorable suspense moments and deals with many emerging Hitchcockian themes and concerns in it's action-packed running time."
"dr_clarke_2","8","0","0","27 June 2020"," A solid, fast-paced Hitchcock thriller, albeit with few surprises
","Alfred Hitchcock's 1942 film Saboteur is notable for being his first to feature and all-American cast. Based on an idea by Hitchcock, the screenplay by Peter Viertel, Joan Harrison and Dorothy Parker is one of several of the director's films about an innocent man forced to go on the run in order to clear his name, and it owes something of a debt to his earlier British film The 39 Steps.
Saboteur sees Robert Cummings' Barry Kane being accused of committing sabotage a US airbase when he is handed a fire extinguisher filled with gasoline to use on a deliberately-started fire. Resolving to prove his innocence and bring the real saboteur to justice, Kane promptly sets off across the United States on the trail of a man named Fry. The parallels with The 39 Steps immediately become obvious, with Kane encountering various villains and eccentrics, constantly having to keep one step ahead of the police, having drag to along with him a reluctant young woman who initially distrusts him, and eventually thwarting a secret criminal organisation (Hitchcock fans will note that the film thus also acts as a template for North by North-West).
Nevertheless, Saboteur is not a remake of Hitchcock's earlier film and it stands up well on its own merits. In contrast to the brave and intelligent but slightly hapless and out of his depth Richard Hannay, Barry Kane is written as a determined man of action, who can ride a horse, fire a gun, and handle himself in a fight. He is motivated not just by self-preservation, but also by a desire to stop Fry and his organisation causing any more deaths and he passionately condemns totalitarian regimes when talking to the villainous Charles Tobin, although his sense of morality also prompts him to try and save Fry's life during the film's climax. Cummings fills the role well, and makes a likeable leading man, and he works well with Priscilla Lane, who plays love interest Patricia.
There is much decent characterisation, such as Vaughan Glaser's Uncle Phillip, a perceptive old blind man who instinctively believes that Kane is innocent, and the circus troupe members on whose land train Barry and Pat stow away on. Billy Curtis' anti-democratic Major is especially entertaining. Freeman, one of the spies, discusses his parenting dilemmas with Barry, whilst Otto Kruger's Tobin makes a debonair villain.
Hitchcock's decision to make extensive use of location filming - which cinematographer Joseph A. Valentine makes good use - pays off. The sets generally mesh well with the location filming, especially the impressive river set. The scenes in New York are really well shot, with great use made of various camera techniques including long-shots and aerial shots. The cinema scene is masterful, with the action on screen reflecting Fry's actions in the theatre, and the climax inside the Statue of Liberty is impressively realised, involving a mock-up of part of the statue and some trick photography to show Fry falling to his death. Frank Skinner's occasionally melodramatic score provides an almost continuous accompaniment to the film and works rather well.
Saboteur is perhaps one of Hitchcock's less well known films, and it lacks the twists and surprises of his finest work, but it serves as a solid example of how polished and accomplished even his less celebrated movies are."
"maurice_yacowar","10","0","0","25 May 2020"," Surprisingly current summary of war over American values in 1942
","Hitchcock's opening image embodies the central theme of the film. A shadow of a mysterious male figure appears against a massive wall of white corrugated metal. That introduces the attack on the factory that triggers the plot.
The image also anticipates a very dramatic scene later, when villain Fry shoots real bullets from behind the cinema screen, fulfilling the threat from the inner movie's irate husband. Taken together these two shots embody the functional discontinuity between image and reality.
Specifically at issue is the image of American democracy. The villains are wealthy American traitors undermining the nation's 1942 defence against a foreign totalitarianism. As Tobin explains, these exceptionally wealthy - and respectable! -people hunger for unmediated power. They would profit from the overthrow of democracy.
They disdain of the sentimentality and idealism that hero Barry Kane (a more ideal, humane Citizen than Welles's of 1941) represents. The elite that has prospered from democratic capitalism here abandons the outcast, the underprivileged.
The circus freaks are a broadening miniature of American society. Their instinctive responses to the troubled couple set the spectrum of humanitarianism. The mean dwarf Major bitterly argues for their betrayal. As the essential human, The Human Skeleton instinctively defends them: ""The normal are abnormally hard-hearted."" As the Siamese twins are of course divided on every issue, it falls to the bearded lady to intuit the couple's emotional connection. She has the romantic instinct to save them.
The film teems with instances of deceptive appearance. Twice the feuding Patricia and Barry are taken to be passionately in love, as others foresee their harmony. Patricia's father is in the tradition of the extra sensitive, extra perceptive blind seer. Conversely, the very respectable Tobin and society matron Mrs Sutton prove to be the vile traitors, undermining America's defence against her enemies. Setting the climax on the Statue of Liberty confirms the film's political core. Here life and freedom literally hang by a thread. America has to defend its values against internal subverters as well as their foreign enemy.
Especially chilling is Tobin's cynical description of Kane: ""He's noble and fine and pure... So he pays the penalty that the noble and the fine and the pure must pay in this world: he's misjudged by everyone.""
Barry establishes an immediate connection with trucker Mac, an example of Tobin's ""moron millions"" who lack his ambition for a ""more profitable type of government."" For Mack having three meals a day is a sufficient dream. Like the freaks later, Mac helps Barry escape the forces of law and order that have been suborned by Tobin's false image of citizenship and respectability. Dishearteningly, this debate over America's soul is as current today as it was in 1942. That battle was won but the war persists.
Still, despite that sombre theme this is a hugely enjoyable film. There are several delightful set pieces, especially Hitchcock's venture into the Western chase scene, Barry's scenes with the blindman and with the freaks, his extemporizing in the Sutton lair, the surreal cinema scene, his careful deployment of little Suzie and, of course, the climax on Lady Liberty."

Priscilla Lane plays Pat--the woman who becomes involved in his intrigue. Otto Kruger plays Tobin--the villain who menaces with a smile on his face. It's a solid cast, but Hitchcock himself was disappointed that he could not procure the services of the actors he preferred.<br/><br/>This film is very much a product of its time, being released soon after the U.S. entered WWII. With the citizenry of the nation on alert and still in shock after the Pearl Harbor attack, the story of ""Saboteur"" would seem to be on the mark, but it was a box office failure. Compare that to the performance of ""The Major and the Minor"", a Billy Wilder comedy starring Ginger Rogers, which was also released in 1942. It was a hit, perhaps because it offered escapism to its audiences.<br/><br/>The film is a vehicle for wartime pontificating, including speeches about democracy versus totalitarianism--speeches that were stiff like the slogans on patriotic posters. Hitchcock makes the best of it, but the film lacks the charm of ""North by Northwest"", which also features the charms of Cary Grant.<br/><br/>Hitchcock is masterful in using the element of suspense, particularly the passage of time.

"vincentlynch-moonoi","8","0","0","14 June 2015"," Terribly underrated film; one of Hitchcock's better early efforts (once in America)
","This film seems to be considered one of Hitchcock's lesser efforts, although I'm not sure about that. It's actually quite an entertaining film, although it doesn't have the A list cast of many of Hitchcock's other films. But, perhaps that's even part of its charm. In reality, this film was made near the beginning of what I consider to be Hitchcock's finest period, beginning with ""Rebecca"" in 1940 through ""North By Northwest"" in 1959. And while this may not be at the top of that list, there are a number of Hitchcock films which are much less entertaining.<br/><br/>Upon watching this film again last evening, it occurred to me that there are at least two segments of the film that ask the audience to suspend belief too much...and yet they work. The first is during Cummings' escape when, during a driving rainstorm, he comes upon a nice cabin belonging to a wonderfully kind man who takes him in and doesn't even notice the handcuffs...because he's blind. It's not reasonable...but it works. Even less reasonable is later when Cummings and Priscilla Lane are taken in by freak show characters in a small circus -- a fat lady, a bearded lady, Siamese twins, etc. Again, that so illogical...yet it works. And, these turn out to be really nice touches that are unique to Hitchcock films.<br/><br/>What isn't unique to Hitchcock films is the climactic scene on the torch of the Empire State Building. So like one scene in ""North By Northwest"".<br/><br/>No, Robert Cummings wasn't an A list actor, but he was darned good and terribly underrated and mostly forgotten. Of course, he's somewhat forgotten because he strayed early on to television and a couple of popular -- though terribly light -- situation comedies. Cummings is great here, as he was in two other films of the same era -- the comedy ""The Devil And Miss Jones"" and the drama ""Kings Row"". He really was quite versatile. He's very good here because he seems innocent, and this is another of those Hitchcock ""innocent man in the wrong situation"" films.<br/><br/>Priscilla Lane, who actually gets top billing but is only in the last half of the film, is also quite good, but it's Cummings that carries the film.<br/><br/>There are fine supporting performances here, especially a fantastic performance by Otto Kruger, although I wonder how much he enjoyed being a member of the Fifth Column. and an interesting performance by Vaughan Glaser, as well as others.<br/><br/>The story was very timely for the war years -- a worker in an aircraft factory is falsely accused of sabotage and murder. He escapes in an effort to clear his innocence. And an odd journey it is, There's not much to complain about here.<br/><br/>So for my money, this is one of the most underrated of Hitchcock's films, and I give it very high marks! Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film, highlighted in the segment at the charity ball, is the sense of chess players competing. Will the pawns win? Of course. But it's the twists and turns of the journey that make this film so great."

","The credits begin; a silhouette approaches closer to the forefront as the music heightens in intensity. Is it a red herring or something more? We are given this conundrum whilst thrust into a world of suspense and paranoia where things are not as they seem. This is where Saboteur begins to weave a web of suspicion to play with its audience. <br/><br/>Protagonist Barry's journey of suspense and paranoia begins when his colleague is killed as a result of a fire extinguisher filled with gasoline is used as a form of sabotage planned by disguised Nazis. Suspicion falls on Barry forcing him on the run to seek out the truth, becoming America's most wanted man while attempting to gain the trust of others. Saboteur makes clever use of micro techniques in which keeps the audience edgy as the experience of paranoia and fears of the characters are conveyed. A rattling fire extinguisher evoking painful memories for Barry, who stares bleakly into the camera to gain the attention of the audience and the motif of the billboards which contain coincidental messages such as 'You're Being Followed'. This all helps fuel Barry's paranoia which in turn manipulates on the mind of the audience. <br/><br/>The further Barry entangles himself in his quest for the truth the more intensifying the atmosphere gets. Unconvinced of his innocence Patricia holds Barry hostage till she can report him to the authorities. She stops by the roadside to seek help; Barry takes this opportunity to break free from his handcuffs. Using the fan belt within the engine, the dramatic score begins to heighten in volume and the editing works its magic with multiple jump cuts between Patricia in the distance, Barry anxiously looking on and the close up of the handcuffs slowly breaking apart. The fast pace of this scene is the perfection of suspense in Saboteur creating a great dramatic scene with suspenseful touches. <br/><br/>Although the suspense and paranoia is constant throughout Saboteur, the public consciousness concerning WWII is ever evident. This is personified through the attitude of Patricia, who at first refuses to believe Barry's innocence. She acts suspicious of his every move and even tells Barry he has the look of a saboteur. It all sounds ridiculous to today's audience knowing Barry's plight yet Patricia's notions show the hatred and distrust the American public had of anyone associated with enemy activity. This may even be a critique of such attitudes by Hitchcock as it is left to a group of misfits to remind the audience, more importantly the then American public about what they were all fighting for. <br/><br/>Gaining a ride with a travelling circus Barry and Patricia are made to feel welcome except for one who the group differ with. Once they hear police sirens Barry confesses he is the person they are after. Instead of becoming hostile they decide wherever to hand him over by a vote based fairness, which one member states is the democracy the Allied forces are fighting for. The vote keeps Barry safe and in turn makes Patricia reflect on her mistrust for him. ""They made me so ashamed"", she exclaims emotionally which may now come across as sentimental but at the time of Saboteur's release would have been a powerful reminder of what the public felt their troops were fighting for. <br/><br/>It is not only in patriotic showings like this where America was reminded of the situation they faced; it was also through the seemingly innocent appearances of the villains which would have made for a more terrifying realisation. The villains in Saboteur disguise themselves within society. Charles Tobin is a respected ranch owner who spends his time relaxing in his pool playing with his granddaughter and Mrs Sutton, a wealthy woman who host charity galas at her home. They did not appear to be stereotypical villains making this aspect of Saboteur more frightening. Who can you trust? It was a dark and chilling reminder of the masquerading which took place during wartime. <br/><br/>Saboteur works on two levels. Historically it highlights to those unfamiliar with the time the fear contained in the psyche of the general public concerning the enemy. While Saboteur today may not complete with the more sophisticated contemporary films on a technique level, it still has a style of its own both in micro and macro aspects which can be appreciated."
"Igenlode Wordsmith","6","2","5","22 March 2007"," The interest lies with the villains
","During this film I found myself suffering from what I can only call 'Hollywood thriller syndrome'. This is an all-too-common complaint in which the protagonist comes across as bland, tedious and somewhat annoying, whereas his sinister opponents -- typically characterised as European and/or effete against his all-American working-class worth, facially striking and/or highly intelligent against his dogged brawn, verbally dexterous and/or ironic against his inarticulate honesty -- are, frankly, the ones who instinctively attract my sympathies. The result of which is that I spend most of the film subconsciously rejoicing when things go wrong for the hero, while knowing that I am bound to be frustrated in the end as the entire plot is inevitably rigged in his favour! At the end of ""Saboteur"", as in ""North by Northwest"", it wasn't the name of the male lead I was looking up; as so often, it was more a question of 'Who was that actor with the wonderful face who played the villain?' <br/><br/>From this inverted point of view the film does, of course, have quite a lot to offer. The beautiful blonde not only fails to believe the hero's story; she behaves intelligently for once, allowing him to think that she is on his side while driving him off to the police station and then tricking and physically overpowering him. She feigns frailty in order not to get left behind in the desert, then informs him once on the bus that she has every intention of handing him in after all. Admittedly she then goes on, predictably but not very explicably, to fall in love with him -- but as she is at pains to point out, it's a free country: which means one can't have everything.<br/><br/>The hero's attempts at amateur sleuthing, a flamboyant getaway, and undercover infiltration are also gratifyingly frustrated; in fact, this is one of the least heroic characters in the genre. Attempting while on the run to track down the true criminal, only to get arrested yourself, is perhaps par for the course in the wronged-man scenario -- but it makes a change to see the hero vault onto a horse, leap a fence and gallop off, only to be roped by the bad guys and dragged ignominiously to earth within minutes! And I found it very satisfying when Charles Tobin, surely the most charismatic of criminals, not only unmasked Barry's masquerade but revealed that he already had the girl in custody. The final revealing straw came when I caught a glimpse of the battleship lying sidelong across the ways like a great beached whale, and experienced a distinct unexpected lifting of the heart: apparently the hero's oh-so-predictable eleventh-hour rush to foil the plot had failed after all...<br/><br/>In total and in consequence, when the film is considered as a piece of propaganda -- which is its fairly unsubtle intent -- I can only say that where I was concerned it appears to have backfired badly. But then, of course, it wasn't aimed at me. It was aimed at the 'Average Joe' in 1940s America, and if it is formulaic and ultimately frustrating, it was as the result of a calculated effort to appeal.<br/><br/>Oddly enough I did like the blind-man sequence, with its echoes of a similar scenario for Frankenstein's monster; it could have struck me as cheap and corny, but it didn't. Perhaps it is because in this case, the 'good' character is shown as refined of speech and quick-thinking -- note that the hero is still ultimately wrong-footed by the revelation that his host, for all his blindness, was not fooled for a minute! The cinema sequence at the end came across as very contrived, however: Hitchcock clearly simply fancied the idea of having real gunfire in the auditorium mistaken for on-screen shots, although it's not at all clear why the audience reaction is to roll with laughter.<br/><br/>It's only fair to admit that I'm looking at this film across a vast cultural gulf, and that somehow or other I managed to conceive a dislike for the main protagonist from the start, which inevitably coloured my entire reaction to the picture. Unlike other viewers, I don't think it was actually Robert Cummings' fault that I found the character less than charismatic; I do get the impression that this production was basically a case of Hitchcock sticking pet concepts together by-the-numbers to produce an uneven and sometimes illogical result.<br/><br/>I don't hate the film, and in fact I'd give it a mild recommendation. But no more than mild. It irks me too much."

","Considered a lesser effort by many critics as it's probably not of the same magnitude of his other films; ""Saboteur"" is another chance for practicing his favorite storyline: a regular guy is falsely accused of a crime.<br/><br/>What he started with ""39 Steps"" and ""Young and Innocent"" is improved here and is a step forward on the road that will lead him to the masterpiece ""North by Northwest"". With the ghost of the war haunting the country, ""Saboteur"" is a film that reflects it's time and the ideology of the American society of those years.<br/><br/>The script is not perfect, but even with the obvious plot holes it carries, we have a good development of the characters; and awesome scenes that while apparently do nothing for the story, are very important. The scene of the truck driver and the scene with the circus troupe are very significant, not only because of the witty dialog, but also because they set the tone of the movie, breaking the suspense for a while and giving the audience a chance to laugh at Hitchcock brilliant dark humor.<br/><br/>The acting is for the most part OK. The bond between the main characters, Barry Kane(Robbert Cummings) and Pat Martin(beautiful Priscilla Lane), is carefully created and they have good chemistry. While Cummings certainly is not in the same league as the well-known Hitchcock's leads like Jimmy Stewart, he has a natural charm that helps him even when his acting is kind of wooden at times.<br/><br/>The villains, played by Otto Kruger, Alex Baxter and Norman Loyd, are all superb in their respective roles, and one wonders why they receive very few screen time.<br/><br/>One important thing is that the villains are never presented as evil. They are all charming men who have respectable lives, they are even funny & nice. Their only difference is that they use unorthodox methods to get what they want. This idea must had been haunting for the audience of the 40s, in the middle of the paranoia because of the war. As the marketing of the movie stated: anyone could be a ""Saboteur"".<br/><br/>While it is probably one of the lesser efforts of Hitchcock, this movie paved the way for the classics that would come in the 50's. It will give you moments of pure joy and unforgettable scenes.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Saboteur is another of Hitchcock's movies about an innocent man, wrongfully accused, on the run. What sets this movie apart from the others is its finale on the Statue of Liberty. Nevertheless, this film suffers from some issues with editing, where some scenes run too long, and other scenes are cut too short or not included at all. It's a good movie, but it feels like it was rushed to production."
"BA_Harrison","6","1","2","30 March 2017"," Hitchcock does propaganda.
","A wartime propaganda thriller, Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur is designed to evoke a strong sense of patriotism and righteousness in its viewers; as such, it is about as subtle as a brick, but not totally without its merits, delivering a couple of reasonably executed suspense scenes and a fun finale atop the Statue of Liberty.<br/><br/>Robert Cummings stars as airplane factory worker Barry Kane, who becomes a fugitive after he is wrongly accused of sabotage. Going on the run in an attempt to clear his name, Barry teams up with beautiful blonde model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) and uncovers a group of ruthless fifth columnists who are plotting a series of terrorist attacks.<br/><br/>Hitchcock handles the action well enough, but even his deft direction cannot overcome the silly nature of a script that sees Kane repeatedly escape capture due to the trusting nature of complete strangers (where, in reality, he would be turned over to the authorities tout suite) and which relies rather heavily on chance (the taxi cab drivers seeing Pat flicking the light switch on and off in a room at the top of a skyscraper is beyond dumb).<br/><br/>Also not helping matters much is the occasionally poor editing: a shootout in a movie theatre proves hard to follow, whilst Kane's escape from a locked storeroom, where he has activated the sprinkler system, is nothing short of a miracle—one second he is trapped, the next he is out on the street.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the giddying finale at the pinnacle of America's proud symbol of freedom rounds off the film in style, with Hitch using lots of inventive camera angles (and some dodgy matte work) to raise the tension."

","When sabotage strikes a wartime aircraft factory, employee Barry Kane (Bob Cummings) falls under suspicion. Kane knows a man named Fry (Norman Lloyd) is the real saboteur but police say Fry doesn't exist. So Kane takes it on the run to search for the mystery man and clear his name. Along the way he is joined, reluctantly at first, by a pretty young woman named Pat Martin (Priscilla Lane). The two wind up tangling with a group of fascists who plot to commit more sabotage on American targets.<br/><br/>One of my favorite ""lesser"" Hitchcock films. I say lesser because it's never been one of his more celebrated works. Yeah, it's not Hitch's most unique or complex film. It's also similar in some ways to an earlier classic, The 39 Steps. I get that. But it is a very entertaining and exciting wartime espionage picture with a quick pace and some great set pieces. The bridge jump, the movie theater, and the Statue of Liberty climax are all highlights. Love the scenes with the circus caravan and the blind man. Pretty hokey but I liked it. It's also a beautiful film to look at with some of the best black & white photography of any Hitchcock movie. Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane are both likable heroes. Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd make for appropriately slimy villains. Not one of Hitch's best but very good and underrated."
"dougdoepke","Null","1","2","13 September 2013"," Gearing Up for the Big One
","No need to recap the plot nor echo consensus points.<br/><br/>The movie reminds me a lot of North By Northwest (1959), right down to the cliff-hanger ending. Except this chase drama was made early in WWII, which means the dialogue is salted with understandably patriotic preachments. After all, it's going to take a committed country to win the war, and in 1942, things weren't going well in either Asia or Europe. Note how Barry (Cummings), a stranger in most instances, is trustingly supported by the common man types. This underscores the popular effort that will be needed to win the war. Then too, there's a reference to Brooklyn, often heard during this period, since the New York borough was shorthand for America's melting pot. Note also, the beautifully staged ballroom sequence populated by upper-class types. Here's where the treacherous, aristocrat Tobin (Kruger) hangs out, reinforcing by contrast the common man as the loyal backbone of the nation.<br/><br/>This thread remains a key theme of the film, but unfortunately, it also dates the events in ways that North By Northwest, for example, does not. Nonetheless, Saboteur's expertly staged narrative can be enjoyed on its own, and for its many tension-filled moments. Can't help also noting how apt Robert Cummings is for his role. He brings a freshness and unexpected grit to the part that seems just right for an idealized version of an 'everyman' rising to the occasion when called upon.<br/><br/>The movie may not be front-rank Hitchcock, but it does remain a masterful example of staging and picaresque story-telling."
"JRamos3","Null","1","2","26 October 2011"," First Hitchcock Film
","So, like my title states, this was my first foray in the often macabre world of Alfred Hitchcock. I had previously seen bits and pieces of films like psycho, or the birds, but had never actually sat down and watched a Hitchcock film start to finish. If I only knew what I was missing. Everything about this film was great, the story, the misc-en-scene, the wealth of creative and interesting characters, as well as the subtle undertones of patriotism, or lack thereof. First is the story. Hitchcock wastes no time throwing the viewer right into the meat of the story, as the film's inciting incident, the death at the airplane factory, happens in the first five or so minutes of the film. From there, things only get better for the viewer, albeit much worse for the film's lead character. For me, two of the more enjoyable aspects of the film's plot came during the scene when Pat and Barry encounter the traveling circus. This scene is not only memorable for its obviously distinct characters, but also for the lessons that they impart on Pat and Barry. For instance, learning not to judge people, and giving everyone, regardless of their situation, a fair chance. Secondly, the scene with the blind man was also excellent because of the use of well placed lighting, music, as well as the twist at the end of the scene when the blind man reveals that he was aware of Barry's handcuff's all along. Just superb. From there, the film only gets better. Though the film is essentially designed as a mystery/ suspense film, there were several parts that were genuinely funny. While Hitchcock might not have meant this to be the case, I thought the scene during Mrs. Sutton's ball was funny as well as vital to the plot. Additonally, the film touches on notions of patriotism and what people will do to meet their own ends. That aspect of the film, that is to say, the anti-patriotic parts, are what really struck a chord with me seeing as how this film was released shortly after America's entry into World War II. Finally, the overall look and feel of the film is great. I was taken aback but the scene early on in which the smoke from the factory fire begins to slowly billow in. I was floored by how visually arresting Hitchcock manages to make something as simple as smoke look stunning in the greater sense of the film. Overall, I would definitely recommend this film to anyone."

"jzappa","9","1","2","30 December 2010"," Nationalistic American Re-Tooling of The 39 Steps is Still a Non-Stop Adrenaline Rush
","I think, despite the wide speared respect and admiration for the Master of Suspense, for self-explanatory reasons, we often forget the rush his work can give us. What do we think of at the mention of his name and how good he was at creating suspense? The sudden opening of a shower curtain, a succession of close-ups with dramatic orchestral music, a spiral staircase, stuff like that, right? Let's not forget what he could do with blind man and a truckload of circus performers complete with a bearded lady, Siamese twins and a dwarf. Being so mesmerized by his later work, we can easily forget that his ability make a Speed or Duel or French Connection kind of non-stop adrenaline rush may still be unparalleled.<br/><br/>His version of that paring-down of the thriller genre to its bare elements is not gritty by any means, or even realistic. It's actually quite silly. What are the odds of encountering the aforementioned characters in a span of a few days, especially in as big a hurry as Kane, the plane factory worker falsely accused of sabotage in a desperate scramble for his life? But Saboteur is pure escape, catching us up in movie land.<br/><br/>In essence, it's an American reworking of The 39 Steps, which is a superior film, perhaps solely on the grounds that this 1942 retooling is somewhat deluded by its forceful injection of wartime nationalistic propaganda. Thereis virtually nonstop talk of how Americans have backbone that will always make them the victors against scum like Otto Kruger, Norman Lloyd and Alan Baxter, who are particularly excellent as three smart, stylish and menacing men Kane must overcome. But altogether, The Master very seldom allows the pounding engine of his plot to in effect stop in its tracks for a soapbox diatribe, and is more often apt to work the propaganda Americana into situations wherein it works sardonically, such as when the circus act decides whether or not to alert the authorities to Kane by putting it to a vote and antagonizing the snarling dwarf who still protests despite the will of the majority. Fritz Lang submitted to WWII propaganda with his very clever Man Hunt, and like though perhaps more so than that 1941 actioner, Saboteur is a relentlessly thrilling picture that runs the risk of taking a modern audience out of the world of the story with blatant jingoistic contrivance, but maybe that is in itself a plus for modern-day movie buffs like myself, who as screen junkies are hyper-aware of the dangers of propaganda but simultaneously are fascinated by its nostalgic effect, that which causes our imaginations to enhance the feeling of escape with the fantasy of being in the old movie house with the cheering, guileless crowd, the celluloid whirring and flickering overhead and projecting magic on that screen.<br/><br/>Indeed, one can imagine the enormous rush of excitement seeing this film at the time of its release, being engulfed by The Master's virtuosic technique like a roller-coaster ride, and what it must've been like at the onset of his American career and how it must've taken cinemas by storm. Although not one of the great film craftsman from Leytonstone's more charismatic leading men, Cummings is capable as the likable Kane. Lane is also good as the stronger-than-usual Hitchcock leading lady. But let's be honest, how much do performances matter in his films? A champion of the Russian montage, even when we're not enthralled by the performance itself as we are by Perkins in Psycho and Stewart or Day in The Man Who Knew Too Much, it's the craftsmanship of the editing and the rhythm that create the illusion of emoting in the faces of his actors. Such is the self-assured skill at work in a film like Saboteur."

","The plot of this movie is definitely one of the best I've seen. The directing on Alfred Hitchcock's part is spectacular. The acting of Prisilla Lane and Robert Cummings was another great part of the movie that made the story of the movie believable. Although some scenes were hard to believe could be real, for example the ending scene when the real criminal falls off of the Statue of Libery, I believe that it fit the realism of the movie, but not necessarily in real life.<br/><br/>Although it seemed that Barry Kane, the wrongfully accused protagonist of the movie, never got a break from anyone, he did get a few people to help him. For example, the blind man knew that he was running from the law, but he believed him to be a good man until proved innocent. Also, the circus people believed him to be a good man, except for the little person of the group, on a decision based on democracy.<br/><br/>The movie did get a bit confusing when the part of who really committed the crime at the plane factory came about. Trying to understand everyones role in the plot was a little hard to follow, but I got the idea of it. Overall, the movie's plot, actors, and director all together made a good movie."
"barnabyrudge","6","1","2","8 August 2010"," A lesser work for this director, but still an engaging enough wartime chase thriller.
","Saddled with actors he didn't want and a script full of improbable characters, Alfred Hitchcock still manages to shape Saboteur into an absorbing enough thriller. In some ways, the film can be viewed as a precursor to the later (and better) North By Northwest. A falsely accused hero undertaking a cross country odyssey to clear his name, pursued by the law and the bad guys, with a climax atop a famous landmarkthe similarities between the two films are clear to see.<br/><br/>Aircraft mechanic Barry Kane (Robert Cummnings) is wrongly accused of sabotaging the factory at which he works during WWII. As the police close in on him, Kane realises he is going to have to clear his name alone. He goes on the run, hoping to track down the real saboteur, Frank Fry (Norman Lloyd). Kane's journey quickly becomes an epic cross-country chase, made all the more dangerous when he discovers that Fry is working for a large spy network with enemy agents all over the country. One of the only people Kane can trust is Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane), a headstrong young woman he befriends along the way. Together Kane and Patricia make it all the way to New York City, where they find themselves in the house of a seemingly sweet old rich lady, Mrs Van Sutton (Alma Kruger), who is, in fact, another link in the spy chain. Finally, they corner the saboteur Fry on the statue of Liberty, where a struggle to the death ensues on the high torched arm of the famous Lady Liberty.<br/><br/>Saboteur is not really one of the better Hitchcock movies, but it still has its moments. There is a dryly amusing scene in a travelling circus van populated by circus freaks; a clever shootout at the Radio City Music Hall; and, of course the famous finale on the Statue of Liberty. Too much of the dialogue is uncommonly stilted for a Hitchcock movie, and the performances are merely competent without standing out in any way. Sometimes the narrative seems to jump to the next incident or set piece in a rather jerky, jumbled manner (again uncommon for Hitch) but happily it just about manages to pull its various loose ends together by the end. Overall, Saboteur is a perfectly watchable and entertaining film, albeit dated and not quite in the very best tier of the director's work."

","I am a massive Hitchcock fan, ever since seeing ""Rear Window"" on television. ""Saboteur"" is not Hitchcock's best for me though, it is very good but not a masterpiece. It does have its faults, some parts are rather slow moving and as a consequence of it being written off in a hurry the script felt rather incomplete. But Hitchcock's direction is superb, and the performances weren't that bad. While Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane both do a good enough job, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd come very close to stealing the show. The story is good, about a wronged man on the run, very similar themes used in ""39 Steps"" and ""North By Northwest"", and cleverly provides some much needed escapism. The music score was absolutely outstanding; the music in the opening title sequence was phenomenal, almost like a distorted march, and I liked the digs at Tchaikovsky's 1st Piano Concerto and Beethoven's 5th Symphony. The cinematography is also crisp and smooth, the scenery and landscapes almost dazzling and there are also a number of very effective scenes. Namely the Statue of Liberty climax, but the circus troupe encounter and the Radio Music City Hall shoot-out is also on the money.

"Terrell-4","6","1","2","30 June 2008"," Not bad, but let's play make believe: James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan and Claude Raines
","Saboteur might be less than prime Hitchcock, but it has its moments; in fact, quite a few of them, in my opinion. Where it falls apart, however, is in an essential part of any movie...the leads, including the villain. Hitchcock usually was able to come up with interesting villains. Just think of James Mason, Robert Walker, Joseph Cotton, the never seen Rebecca, Paul Lukas, Ray Milland, Herbert Marshall or Claude Raines. In his best films, if he didn't have a charismatic villain he had such charismatic leads - Grant, Olivier, Donat, Bergman, Stewart, for example, that it didn't make much difference <br/><br/>With Saboteur, we have as the male lead Robert Cummings, a pleasant actor, a fine light comedian but, in drama, just earnest, bland and conscientious. His partner here is Priscilla Lane, long forgotten but reasonably popular back then. She's a nice young woman, an adequate actor and not very interesting. Neither of them has any spark of self-irony and there's not bit of measurable sexual voltage. As a villain we have the always reliable Otto Kruger, mister smoothie himself. I've always enjoyed watching Kruger. He was predictable but completely professional. Put the three of them together and we have a film where we really don't care what happens to anybody. It's the set-ups and some of the set pieces that had better hold our interest. In other words, we have Saboteur. Try to imagine an alternate universe where Saboteur, with the same script (maybe without the talky and corny bits) and same scenes, now starred James Stewart or Robert Donat, Margaret Sullavan or Madeleine Carroll (Hitchcock evidently wanted Sullavan) and Claude Raines or Godfrey Tearle. Now that might be one of Hitchcock's classics, or at least something on the charming, dangerous level as Foreign Correspondent. But back to reality. <br/><br/>Barry Kane (Cummings), just a guy from Glendale, California, gets involved in a horrendous fire at the aircraft factory where he works, a fire caused by a traitor and where his best friend is killed. It looks to the police that Barry is responsible. He takes off to save himself and find out what really is going on. All he has to go on is the address on a letter he saw at work when he handed it back to a man he thought was another plant worker, a man named Frank Fry (Norman Lloyd). In short order Barry is on the road to Springville, California, and the home of the rich and gracious Charles Tobin (Otto Kruger), then, after a perilous escape while wearing handcuffs, to a house in the woods. There he meets Pat Martin (Lane), who doesn't believe his story, and her blind uncle, who does. Then it's off to desolate Soda City (with Pat; she changed her mind), then to New York City and to a grand ball filled with traitors mixed in with the rich and patriotic. Finally we arrive at the high point of the movie... a tense ship launching, a shootout in a crowded movie house (with Veda Ann Borg on the screen) and a dangerous, high tension scramble up the Statue of Liberty, a tearing coat and a backward, face up, fall. <br/><br/>Even with the weaknesses of the leads, Hitchcock gives us some entertaining moments...a leap off a high bridge and a struggle in a river torrent, a nighttime meeting with circus folks of all shapes, sizes, weights and degrees of hairiness, the desolate ghost town that's Soda City, Alma Kruger and her white tie society ball and, of course, the Statue of Liberty. Stewart, Sullavan and Raines would have been terrific. So would be watching again The 39 Steps."
"gezl","7","1","2","22 June 2008"," No bad but oh! the leads
","I've seen this movie a number of times and each time enjoyed it more. The opening is brilliant, the tension builds adequately until the Bride of Frankenstein scene in the blind man's cabin. With the introduction of the obnoxiously perky Priscilla Lane, things start to slow down. One gets the impression that the casting of the two leading characters was taken out of Hitchcock's hands, perhaps due to wartime exigencies. The circus train rekindles one's interest, but the Soda City scene is wretched and the film grinds to a halt, with Lane appearing as if she is following a set of footprints pasted on the floor. The scenes that follow are superb: the car journey, the NY society party and its hostess-- followed by Otto Kruger framed on the sofa, Mephistopheles at his most sinister and brilliant. Unfortunately more Priscilla Lane follows, and things limp along until the stunning ending. Cummings is a little too stolid: he lacks the intelligent spark of Hitchcock's other wrongly accused heroes. The movie is a little choppy, flagging in parts, and it lacks the sure touch of the Master at his best. That aside, all of the supporting characters are very fine, and parts of the film hold up very well. Despite its flaws, if this movie was made by another director it would probably have gained greater acclaim."

","The principal theme of the wrong-man, hunted by police and in search of the criminals that framed him - all the while attempting to prove his own innocence - was always a key-concern of Hitchcock's work; one that is here given a further element of heightened paranoia as a result of the subtle allusions to government conspiracies, abuse and the early appearance of fascist ideologies, all tying into the political concerns of the era, and that vague foreshadowing of events that would transpire following the attack on Pearl Harbour. Although this film never makes any explicit reference of these events, or indeed, any obvious effort to pin the drama to more recognisable or topical concerns, there are still definite elements that suggest these themes in a way that both enriches and adds context to the drama, without ever turning it into a work of agitprop or political polemic. Instead, the themes are used merely to enrich the story and give a sub textual sense of scope and urgency to the plight of our central character, as he attempts, against all odds, to solve the mystery and clear his name.<br/><br/>As you can imagine, the film offers a number of scenes of clearly wrought tension and a continually twisting narrative that throws a number of last minute surprises without ever losing sight of the central themes or the plight of the central character. Hitchcock's direction is as fine as you would expect, with the film filled with the usual dark and iconic images, and those wild, over-the-top set pieces; the most famous of which takes place on a giant recreation of the Stature of Liberty and is devoid of any over-score. Although the pace may be considered a little slow for some tastes, the film, for me, is pure entertainment, and certainly rewards repeated viewings with its enthralling plot, likable characters and bold strokes of direction.<br/><br/>Although you could probably argue that it lacks the finesse of the previous Rebecca (1940) or the subsequent Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Saboteur (1942) remains one of Hitchcock's most entertaining thrillers; a deft blending of serial adventure and pure pulp fiction, and a definite early precursor to the more successful likes of North by Northwest (1959)."

","Ah, Hitchcock! It's hard to find a bad Hitchcock movie until he lost it after THE BIRDS (1963) and SABOTEUR proves the point. Having admired most of this director's work for many years, I had managed to skip this one, perhaps from lack of interest in Priscilla Lane and Robert Cummings as lead actors. I was of course familiar with the Statue of Liberty climax from having seen it repeatedly in film retrospectives but I wrongly assumed the story leading up to it might not hold my interest. Was I wrong! The suspenseful plot gets cooking right off the bat through a chance encounter between the Bad Guy Saboteur and the Good Guy Wrongly Accused protagonist and continues zooming along through a series of further chance encounters and narrow escapes. Familiar Hitchcockian elements are all there: the innocent person wrongly accused of a crime; people not being what they seem to be; dramatic or unlikely locations that intensify the suspenseful scene being played out within them (an airplane hangar, a ranch, a bridge from which the handcuffed hero hurls himself to escape the police, a sumptuous charity ball in a palatial mansion, an upper floor of a skyscraper, and finally the torch of the Statue of Liberty).<br/><br/>Throughout is humor provided by supporting players, generous dollops of early WW2- vintage social comment, moments of human warmth where suffering people find it within themselves to lend a hand to help a fellow human, getting nothing in return – in short, there was always a basic humanity at the core of Hitchcock, however grisly the trappings - a sensational cast of supporting players, chiefly Otto Kruger as the slickest villain this side of George Sanders (his Broadway credits include the male lead in Noel Coward's PRIVATE LIVES – and that says it all) and weaselly Norman Lloyd as the titular saboteur, not to mention Alma Kruger – no relation to Otto – as a prominent society dowager involved in fifth column intrigue (her character foreshadows that of Claude Rains's mother in NOTORIOUS). Priscilla Lane does a fine job with a difficult role. For most of her early scenes we can't tell whether she believes the hero to be innocent or guilty and she seems constantly to shift her opinion, not coming over to his side fully until late in the proceedings. One cannot ascertain whether her acting is at fault or whether we are meant to be kept in a state of uncertainty, but the plot developments are so swift, fun and clever that we really don't care what she thinks.<br/><br/>Then there are the peculiar Hitchcock touches that have nothing to do with the plot. Twice the Lane character pauses to get change for a quarter – once to reimburse her kidnappers for an ice cream soda and again to make a call from a phone booth. Why these scenes were inserted are anybody's guess, perhaps to make the film seem more realistic and thus heighten the believability and suspense? Or perhaps to give the audience a moment to catch its breath? Some of the characters are over the top – the garrulous truck driver, the impossibly kind and trusting blind man living alone in a spotlessly maintained forest cabin, the political-philosophy-spouting ""human skeleton"" and other members of the circus caravan who hide the protagonists from their pursuers."

As it was in the World War II era, the villains were never a match for our way of thinking. Nowadays, we have a much heavier political influence on everything. Then, it was pretty much cut and dried that we were going to eliminate the enemy. Alfred Hitchcock had a way of engineering the characters on film to make you really get inside of the story.

","I remember seeing this classic film directed by the Master of Suspense, Sir Alfred Hitchcock once before, but it was only the ending I could recall from the last time seeing it, so it was a good idea I watched it again. Basically, set in World War II, a fire is started at a Los Angeles military aircraft factory, and Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is wrongly accused of the sabotage, and he is convinced the real culprit is Frank Fry (Norman Lloyd), who he met before the incident occurred. But no-one named Fry is found on the plant workers' list, so Kane is arrest as the saboteur, but he manages to escape and is on the run as a fugitive to catch the man who actually started the fire. He finds an address for Fry on an envelope and travels to Central Valley where he finds a ranch occupied by well respected citizen Charles Tobin (Otto Kruger), but of course he is part of the sabotage and has Kane captured, but he escapes once again. He finds refuge in a shack where a blind man shows him hospitality, but the man's billboard model niece Patricia 'Pat' Martin (Priscilla Lane) spots his handcuffs, and instead of taking him to the blacksmith's like the man wanted she attempts taking him to the police. Kane manages to stop her though, using a car generator's fan belt to cut his cuffs apart, and he kidnaps her to go along with him and prove his innocence, heading for Salt City. When there he finds the saboteurs, who are planning to blow up Boulder Dam, and he convinces them he is the saboteur like the newspapers are reporting, and he foils their plans to destroy the dam. Kane joins the saboteurs as they travel to New York City where they plan to attack a new US Navy ship, USS Alaska, being launched at Brooklyn shipyard. Martin was going to again go to he police, but she is swayed by a corrupt chief, and when she finds Kane again, and after trapped in a room dancing in a crowd they are locked by the bad guys separately at the Rockfeller Center. Martin manages to drop out a message for help to the FBI from the office window, while Kane sets off the fire alarm, he rushes to the shipyard and spots Fry in a fake news van controlling a bomb that will detonate when the champagne flute is broken. Martin realises the situation as well, and she manages to see Fry as well and follows him all the way to the top of the Statue of Liberty, and she stalls them while the FBI, who believes Kane now, and he make their way towards them. When they arrive Fry dashes to the top of the Statue lantern, and Kane follows him where there is no escape, and the villain loses his balance, he hangs on for dear life and Kane climbs down, grabbing his sleeve to try and help him back up, but the sleeve tears and Fry falls to his death, but Kane and Martin hug each other in the end. Also starring Alan Baxter as Freeman, Clem Bevans as Neilson, Alma Kruger as Henrietta Sutton and Vaughan Glaser as Phillip Martin, and Hitchcock's cameo is the man standing in front of Cut Rate Drugs as the saboteur's car stops. The performances by Cummings and Lane are suitably tense, and the actors playing villains get their time as well, the best moments are the chase sequences and of course the Statue of Liberty sequence, but there are some other surprises along the way, such as Kane and Martin being picked up by a freak circus, and temporarily joining the bad guys, it is a fine film that I can see is a must see, a great classic spy thriller. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!"

","Cummings is falsely accused of sabotage and goes on the lam, looking for the real culprit. The familiar Hitchcock theme of a man wrongly accused of a crime is nicely played out in this entertaining fare that has elements of ""The Thirty Nine Steps"" and ""North by Northwest,"" although it is not as good as either of those classics. There are some impressive set pieces, including the finale on the Statue of Liberty. The plot is implausible and unconvincing and, after a terrific start, it seems to run out of steam.

","Hitchcock, the transplanted Englishman, uses a basic expository technique in ""Saboteur"" (1942), one we all learned in school: Contrast and compare.<br/><br/>We are not deeply impressed with the American (Bob Cummings) he shows us, until he shows us what the American is not. The saboteur, creepily portrayed by Norman Lloyd, is not really intelligent -- he is merely cunning. The collaborator, sneeringly played by Otto Kruger, is not really confidently optimistic -- he only parrots an arrogant ideological dogma. Their associates, while bragging about their ""practicality,"" are shown to be merely greedy for power. Finally, Hitchcock shows us some important, powerful people whose selfish pretentiousness allows them to be easily used by their country's enemies; these folk have become ""cultured"" at the expense of their own American virtues.<br/><br/>Hitchcock, and Cummings' disarmingly simple performance, make it clear that what invigorates the American character is genuine generosity and a healthy sense of fun, even in time of war.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kevin Cisneros"

"JamesHitchcock","5","1","3","13 January 2016"," Hitchcock Takes the Gloves Off
","""Saboteur"" was Alfred Hitchcock's first film made after America's entry into World War II. He had dealt with the war before in ""Foreign Correspondent"", but because America was still neutral at the time he was forced to do so a roundabout way. That film does indeed feature a European war, a war which has many similarities with the one actually being waged- London, for example is being bombed- but Hitchcock was not allowed to name the Nazis as the aggressors. <br/><br/>Well, after Pearl Harbor Hollywood finally allowed Hitchcock to take the gloves off. ""Saboteur"" is an unashamed propaganda piece warning Americans to be on their guard against fifth columnists and enemy agents. Hitchcock uses one of his favourite plot devices, one he had already used in the likes of ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Young and Innocent"", that of a man wrongly accused of a crime. When an aircraft factory in California is destroyed by fire and a man is killed, Barry Kane, a young worker at the plant, becomes the chief suspect. Kane is forced to go on run to clear his name and expose the real culprits. In the course of a journey which takes him all the way across America to New York he meets a cross-section of Americans, including a garrulous truck driver, a rancher, a blind musician and his model niece, a circus full of freaks and a society hostess. Some of these believe in his innocence and try to help him, others try to hand him over to the police while others turn out to be working for the real saboteurs, a sinister organisation of fifth columnists. <br/><br/>The film works well until about halfway through. There is a tense scene at Tobin's ranch, some striking photography of the Western landscapes and a good cameo from Vaughan Glaser as the kindly musician Phillip Martin. After that, however, things start to go downhill. I have always felt that the point at which it jumps the shark is when Kane and Pat meet the circus freaks, most of whom are horribly unconvincing. (The ""human skeleton"", for example, is not even particularly thin, and the ""bearded lady's"" beard is obviously false). There is little real tension in the second half of the film. The scene in Mrs Sutton's mansion is overlong and the one where Kane foils an attempt to destroy a new Navy battleship in Brooklyn Navy Yard is confusing. The sight of a ship lying on its side shortly afterwards might seem to suggest, wrongly, that the saboteurs have in fact succeeded in their efforts. (The stricken ship is in fact the SS Normandie, destroyed by fire in February 1942, but even in 1942 audiences from outside New York might have missed this point). <br/><br/>Hitchcock loved setting cliff-hanging sequences in or on iconic buildings or structures; during his British period in the thirties the Albert Hall, Westminster Cathedral and the Forth Bridge had all been pressed into service for this purpose. He tries to create another one here using the Statue of Liberty, that iconic symbol of American democracy, but the effect of this is lessened by the fact that the person in the greatest danger is not the hero Kane but one of the villains whom the audience would love to see plunge to his death. <br/><br/>Hitchcock originally wanted Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck for the leading roles, but Cooper was uninterested and Stanwyck unavailable. (Cooper seems later to have regretted not working with Hitch; he signed on to star in ""The Wreck of the Mary Deare"" in the belief that the great man would be directing it, only for Hitchcock to pull out). In the event the roles were taken by Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane; Cummings makes a decent hero, but Lane must be among the least memorable of Hitchcock's trademark blondes. The relationship between Cummings and Lane recalls that between Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll in ""The 39 Steps""; she initially distrusts him but is persuaded to believe in him and the couple eventually fall in love. <br/><br/>In 1942 Hitchcock was under contract to David O. Selznick, but Selznick rejected the script for this film, one of a number of factors which led to the growth of ill-feeling between director and producer. The film was eventually made by Universal, but it is easy to understand Selznick's reservations. ""Saboteur"" may have succeeded as a piece of propaganda, but as a piece of film-making it is a relative failure. Hitchcock was capable of much better work than this. 5/10"

","Saboteur (1942) is a somewhat forgotten Hitchcock suspense thriller. It stars Robert Cummings, Priscilla Lane, Otto Kruger, Alan Baxter, and Norman Lloyd. One thing about this movie is that it has some striking similarities to The 39 Steps (1935) and North By Northwest (1959). A man who is falsely accused of something is chased across the country with a climax that takes place on a national monument. This movie has some humor in it, but overall it is darker than North By Northwest. It can be classified as a World War II propaganda movie and clocks in at 1 hour, 49 minutes. Hitchcock recycled a lot of his movie themes and plots over the years, and basically I see this movie as a trailblazer for the superior North By Northwest, although Saboteur is a good movie, no doubt. I really like this movie's black and white cinematography and overall atmosphere, particularly the scenes at night. You never know what you'll encounter when you're traveling across the country at night. Watch to find out what's encountered.<br/><br/>The acting overall is pretty good. The musical score by Frank Skinner is run-of-the-mill. It does the job, but it's nothing that's very distinctive. The movie has a good dose of classic Hitchcock suspense.

","Soboteur was a good action packed film, but not one that I could really get in to. There's no doubt that Hitchcock is a great director, but this film just didn't have all the qualities that a movie like Psycho did. There were some great aspects of cinematography, but the acting and script were a little weak. There were some bad lines that discredited the film. Visually the film is appealing, with probably the most famous shot of the Statue of Liberty's arm. It's a great aerial view of the monument. The exciting visual elements are what keep the film together, and keep the viewers attention. Maybe if I was more of a Hitchcock fan, I would appreciate the film more."
"secondtake","7","1","3","7 August 2010"," Hitchcock has so much fun chasing such attractively evil fellows, you will, too
","Saboteur (1942)<br/><br/>Sometimes a mix of humor and crisis can be especially moving, both more funny and more sad. I don't mean tragicomedy, exactly, the Shakespeare stuff, but just a movie about something big and yet the characters are a little silly. We can identify with them as they go to save the world.<br/><br/>I think that's the idea in ""Foreign Correspondent,"" the closest Hitchcock movie to this one in flavor, and made two years before this one as WWII was breaking out. It was a call to arms, and ""Saboteur"" is a perfect continuation, firmly on American soil, of the fight to win the war by some very ordinary people. But for me, ""Saboteur"" doesn't quite get past some of the slightly goofy or awkward moments, though I'll bet Hitchcock noticed and left things the way they were quite on purpose. He rarely wanted high levels of realism, at least not unbroken, and our leads here, mainly Robert Cummings as Barry Kane, factory worker, get away with little cinematic things, like hiding behind a rock and not being seen by someone standing right there. <br/><br/>This is something to get used to in almost every Hitchcock movie. It's a little like someone is sitting and telling the story and you are picturing it, so you get the basic idea right but not all the logistics. Another early example is falling down and seeing the letters on the floor. No one acts with physical realism, but we get the information we need to continue. The astonishing last scenes (I won't say where or what) are more artifice as theater as cinema. It's great, but it's beautifully artificial.<br/><br/>Kane, the character, is a disarmingly nice fellow, and he's the innocent man accused to wrong, a perennial theme for the director. He is both fleeing and chasing. He meets unreasonably helpful good people and surprisingly incompetent bad ones. But he represents our wanting to be helping and running and succeeding, too, in the war effort, which was becoming all consuming for the nation. It's all done with reserve and a touch of humor, but underneath it is a deadly seriousness. Hitch knew his audience wanted to be rallied, so he rallied them.<br/><br/>The thing that made ""Foreign Correspondent"" a bit better at this style is a better cast, and some funnier lines. But ""Saboteur"" is no slouch--it's well made with precision as it careens through incident after incident, and it has two scenes near the end that are legendary (the one in the movie theater especially artful). <br/><br/>We know more or less how this story might end, but we do with Jane Austen, too, and no one bothers about that. It's all about getting there. And saving the day. And falling in love."

","Barry Kane is an aircraft-factory worker during wartime, who is falsely accused of arson by a man called Fry, the real saboteur. Fleeing the authorities, Barry is befriended by Patricia, who comes to believe in his innocence. Together, they try to find the mysterious Fry; the search leads into a dizzying world of high-society spies and fifth-columnists, culminating in a fight atop the Statue of Liberty ...<br/><br/>This is a big sweep of a film, employing Hitchcock's beloved double-hunt structure - the hero hunts the killer while the cops hunt him (see The 39 Steps, North By Northwest, many others) - to particularly good effect. In an era of mistrust and finger-pointing, the story charms us with kindly, down-to-earth people who believe Barry's story (a friendly truck-driver, a blind pianist, a troupe of circus freaks) and terrifies us with a wealthy social-set whose disdain for freedom and the common good is as tawdry as their opulent lifestyles. Whilst less well-known than many of his other films, almost all of Hitch's trademarks are here; the handcuffed hero, the ice-cool blonde, the dead-eyed cops, the wacky sense of humour, nail-biting suspense scenes (a bomb at a shipyard, a note for help thrown out of a skyscraper window, a shootout in a cinema), even the climax at a public landmark. Perhaps its only weakness is the cast; Cummings is okay in the lead (he also starred in Hitch's later Dial M For Murder) but he lacks charisma and humour, chief villain Kruger is a little too smugly self-satisfied and Lane starts off as a feisty ingenue but sort-of gets forgotten about. There are some nice supporting bits though by Glaser as Barry's Delius-loving savant and Lloyd (an old pal of Orson Welles and John Houseman) as the enigmatic Mr Fry. Its strength however is in the superb direction and the fantastic script by no less than three great writers; Peter Viertel (who wrote White Hunter Black Heart), Joan Harrison (who wrote Hitch's three previous films) and the inimitable New Yorker critic and scribe, Dorothy Parker. Whilst this is not Hitchcock's best film by a long shot, it's still pretty unmissable and plants the seeds for many of the great movies he was to make in the fifties. Check it out, if only to see a film that is both a time-capsule of American wartime propaganda and a highly-entertaining spy story."

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","1","4","19 July 2005"," Clearly not meant to be taken seriously, but still a fun ride delivered by Hitchcock
","When a film is made while the country is involved in a World War, it's hard for it to come out entirely unbiased... though I suppose this film also reveals quite a lot about Hitchcock's own sensibilities. The whole film has a tone of democracy and 'united we stand', but it's fairly nicely buried in the interesting plot and the entertaining action. The film is obviously not meant to be taken seriously - with the exception of one very intense monologue by the lead - but it is thoroughly very entertaining. As soon as you accept that Alfred made this for fun, you'll love just about every second of it. The heroes are incredibly lucky at times, getting out of situations in the most unrealistic ways, by the most unlikely means. The high pace and energy of the film is kept through many sudden, unexpected occurrences. Just about every time you think everything is fine, that the lead is safe, something happens. In best Hitchcock fashion, several of the occurrences are very suspenseful. The plot is fairly well-written, and it evolves throughout the whole film, never standing still. The pacing is very good, something is constantly happening. The characters are well-written and credible. Many of them very likable, too. Particularly an elderly blind man encountered early in the film. The acting is top-notch. The dialog is quite well-written and equally well-delivered. All in all, a very entertaining and early Hitchcock piece, though the propaganda-like undertones of pro-democracy can be a bit of a pain to sit through. I recommend this to any fan of Hitchcock. 7/10"

","When reviewing a film like ""Saboteur"", there are a lot of ""perhaps""-es that come to my mind. Perhaps the movie was better for its time? Perhaps it needs to be seen as a propaganda piece and nothing more? Perhaps it represents a different age of cinema? Even considering those factors, however, I cannot endorse this as an engaging Hitchcock flick because it just doesn't bring anything unique to the table of film-making.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Saboteur"" focuses on Barry Cane (Robert Cummings), a man on the run from the law after being wrongfully accused of setting fire to an airplane factory. While pursuing the true baddie Tobin (Otto Kruger), Barry finds a tag-along love interest in Pat (Priscilla Lane).<br/><br/>This movie has all the elements of a traditional Hitchcock movie: the MacGuffin plot device, the ""wrong man"" scenario, the espionage plot, and the strong, independent female lead. Some of the camera-work is vintage Hitch, while the locales are distinctly ""American"" in nature in keeping with the wartime nature of the film.<br/><br/>Sadly, though, the overall plot is about as stale as they come. It is a scenario that is almost ""too easy"" for the genre and provides no true suspense or meaningful character development. I suspect that a film like ""Saboteur"" was made with a strong eye towards propaganda instead of overall quality.<br/><br/>Thus, I can't recommend ""Saboteur"" to anyone but die-hard Hitch fans or those who can sit through generic war/spy tales. You really just won't be getting anything new here."

","Like ""Lifeboat"" and ""Foreign Correspondent,"" this contribution to the war effort may preach too much and wave the flag in spots, but its heart is pure Hitch.  Reworking his irresistible ""wrong man"" theme, Hitch's use of all-American Bob Cummings is ideal.  Too many viewers confuse Cummings' white bread persona as a failing of the film.  In fact, Hitch uses his lead's lightness to show how even a ""guy-next-door"" like Cummings could be tagged as an evildoer.  Hitch then uses Cummings' charm to tap our sympathy. As for Hitch's stylish set-pieces (the Statue of Liberty climax, the shoot-out at Radio City, and the wonderful stop aboard the circus train), all I can say is: superb."

","Peter Viertel and Dorothy Parker are not two writers I would automatically team up although individually both are excellent, so much so that they were the selling point on this piece of cheese. I have a life-long aversion to Hitchcock, not because he is inept - he knows, for example, that one removes the lens cap before exposing any film, and which direction to point the camera in order to capture the actors going about their business. But probably ninety-nine per cent of the members of the Directors Guild know this much and they don't have critics genuflecting to them. In short, Hitch is a competent director, end of story, to mention his name in the same sentence as Orson Welles, Howard Hawks, Frank Capra, George Stevens, et al is a joke.<br/><br/>So, here we have Robert Cummins, just off Kings Row and acting like he's never even seen a film set. Talk about everyman, this guy, so far as we know, has neither mother, father, brother, sister, nor any kith or kin whatsoever and NO ONE FINDS THIS STRANGE. This is the one where lil' ol' Mr Innocent, just going about his business, gets implicated in an 'incident' and finds himself on the run. Same thing happened to Cary Grant in North By North West and darned if he didn't wind up on one of the Great Stone Faces in Dakota. Here, in the prototype, Cummins winds up in the Statue of Liberty. Originality anyone?"

","This is another American film integrated in the effort to moralize and mobilize the public, in the context of World War II. The whole action revolves around an attempted sabotage in a military aircraft factory, with an unjustly accused worker fleeing the authorities to try to discover the truth, clear his name and avenge his best friend, who dies in the incident.<br/><br/>The plot has obvious weaknesses. Never would the police, in their right mind, assume that the workers who try to put out a fire are the same ones who filled with gasoline the only extinguishers available to do so. Likewise, a stranger would never trust and help someone he has just met, knowing in advance that he can be a wanted and highly dangerous terrorist. This is enough to take all the logic out of the story.<br/><br/>As a film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, it is not surprising that the technical aspects of filming, editing and post production have been meticulously carried out. The actors are good and do their job on a regular basis, but there is nothing really remarkable here. Robert Cummings is the protagonist and does a good job, but largely inferior to the performance he would do in ""Dial M For Murder"", for example.<br/><br/>This is a film that has aged badly and will probably end up in a certain forgetfulness, which will not be complete due to the fact that it was directed by one of the greatest filmmakers ever."

It is tempting to list the top half dozen, but I'll only mention Henry Ford and Ezra Pound. In the film characters such as those are represented by the wealthy and witty Mr Tobin, and the even wealthier charitable Mrs Sutton. One reviewer mentions the strange reluctance of the bad guys to terminate the hero, Barry Kane, a good citizen and non-saboteur, when he's in their power.

","If one could accuse Alfred Hitchcock of having a formula, it might be the one where a person who is innocent stumbles into a situation where he/she (usually he) is blamed for something he/she didn't do. The cards are stacked against them and it is up to them to prove their innocence. It often involves extensive travel with a companion who distrusts them at first (prototype ""The Thirty-Nine Steps). In this one, a saboteur in a plant gets himself killed and the protagonist, Robert Cummings, gets blamed for what happens. He is pursued by the law, captured, handcuffed, but manages to free himself. He pursues the evildoer to New York City where we have one of the most famous scenes in all of cinema, involving the Empire State Building. Of course, King Kong played that venue earlier.

"ElMaruecan82","8","0","1","4 September 2016"," A fix of pure Hitch stuff...
","Indeed, after having ventured in the atmosphere of early Hitchcock's movies and an anachronistic oddity titled ""Under Capricorn"", ""Saboteur"" provided me the same satisfaction an explorer who trotted over the globe for months would feel when crossing the threshold of his home. I missed the good old Hitchcock format to the point of homesickness and when the spinning Earth of Universal Pictures introduced that opening credits with a weird linear background and the ominous shadow of the titular ""Saboteur"", I knew I was swimming in familiar water, I enjoyed every moment of the 1942 thriller, and forgave every flaw.<br/><br/>Yes, there were flaws, the plots was written by three persons and I suspect they never met to get all their ducks in a row, but the action is so fast-paced and Hitchcock's directing so insolently confident that you savor every bit of this Swiss-cheese-like plot. They say Hitchcock was a Master of Suspense, I think he was hiding a subtler talent under his sleeve: he knew how to make you not notice the flaws. The action sequences, , the uses of ellipses and smash cuts, everything were so efficient that noticing a few weaknesses in the script would make you look nit-picky (not that all his films could got away with it).<br/><br/>""Saboteur"" opens with a sabotage of spectacular effect, a hatched-face guy named Fry bumped into two aircraft workers, one of them is Barry, played by Robert Cummings (and not Dana Andrews). Barry has enough time to check the name on a postcard. A few minutes later, a fire starts and Fry gives him an extinguisher, Barry's friend wants to take part to the action, ignoring that the extinguisher is filled with gasoline. Hitchcock gratifies with the death of a man literally eaten up by flames and falling like a burnt match. Now, this is an opening. What follows is pure Hitch stuff, Barry is the suspect number one because he handed the fatal extinguisher and naturally, there's no worker named Fry.<br/><br/>Mistaken identities is one of Hitchcock's darling and it's handled quite efficiently in ""Saboteur"" as Barry's identity is often the cause of misleading tricks with both the right and wrong side of the law, and can even be looked at the whole theme of the movie, which is about the fifth columnist threatening the United States' interests during the War. Indeed, ""Saboteur"" can't be taken outside of its context, the decisive incident happens in the temple of the war effort after all. But the mistaken identity emphasizes the interesting contrast between the good guys and the villains, obviously. Those who trust Barry are all average Joes, down-on-their-luck, from the people, while the bad guys are very unlikely figures, a gentle grandfather played by Otto Kruger and a socialite played by Alma Kruger (no relation).<br/><br/>One would think the film has a point to make about American values, and he would be right. During his road trip, Barry meets many archetypes of American society and these are opportunities for some grandiloquent speeches about democracy. Some are pretty well-written and I must say I have drank like little milk the lines delivered by Vaughan Masser, the blind host. Some others, as well-intended as they were, were too preachy. When Barry and Pat (Prscilla Lane) ask the circus troop workers for help, the Skeleton Man proposes a vote, when the midget protests, he's called 'fascist', which was a pretty bold answer. But then again, if the man was so eager to save them, why didn't he just help them? Is it better to make a bad decision democratically than a noble one tyrannically? kind of makes you think.<br/><br/>I understand the context forced Hitchcock to inject some inspirational moments in his film, like he did in ""Loveboat"", but this aspect was almost contradicted by the way the real folks behaved, the agents of FBI, the navy yard guards, all so conveniently incompetent, enough not to spot the bad guys or to arrest the wrong one so much for democracy. One would rather accept Barry's punchy methods, after all, it's not like he trusted the justice of his country and handed himself to the Law. You're never really sure what Hitch's point is, and maybe this is the film's slight edge over ""Lifeboat"". The Master gives the villain many shining moments, they sing to Tchaikov' music in a car, the suave villain a speech of his own and talk about ""mass morons"", and even say bout totalitarian regimes that ""they get things done"", and ironically, this is what the hero does, getting things done with the villains' methods.<br/><br/>Despite these contradictions, the film lets itself being enjoyed, one scene after another, Hitchcock showcases his capability to provide memorable moments, a shootout in a Radio City theater with real shotguns heard in the movies, where the suspense lies on the moment the audience will realize what's going on, a paper with a message for help flying over the sky and last but not least, the Statue of Liberty's climax. What a fitting demise for the villain who sinned by fire to die at the altar of the Liberty torch. Yet even Hitchcock acknowledged a flaw: everyone wanted the villain to die. He wouldn't commit the same mistake in ""North by Northwest"", but what a satisfying ending.<br/><br/>As Fry, Norman Lloyd, without being the most memorable Hitchcok villain is the one whose face leaves the most vivid impact, and this is saying a lot in a film where they're a group of intimidating people. So we have memorable villains, a dark and handsome hero, mistaken for a killer, running afoul of the Law to prove his innocence and meeting in the process a beautiful blonde, car chases, last-minute escapes, bomb explosions, breath suspended as often as disbelief, and a climactic sequence taking place in the most unexpected and spectacular setting. I needed my fix of Hitchcock, and I got it with ""Saboteur""."

","Once the viewer gets past the feeling of familiarity--'say, haven't I seen this movie before?'--it's not a bad movie. Certainly not one of the greats. ""39 Steps"" is great because it was Hitchcock's early treatment of a man wrongfully accused on the run inadvertently chained to someone he can barely tolerate. And the chemistry in ""39 Steps"" between the actors combined with an excellent script made for film excellence. But while ""39 Steps"" had a believable cast, Robert Cummings simply cannot be seen in emotional distress. (Never mind, in real life, Cummings would succumb to meth addiction from Dr. Feelgood thus affecting both his physical health and his mental health. But that was way distant in his future.) Robert Cummings ends up being the weakest link in a weak movie. His blithe good looks served him well in ""Dial M for Murder"", not so much here where he is expected to demonstrate a range of emotional distress.<br/><br/>Simply put, Hitchcock went to the well too many times here. And part of the problem is by now the movie viewer has seen most of Hitchcock's movies, not necessarily in the sequence he made them; as he made the film they fall within an historical time-line that is not available to the viewer who sees them as a measure of their popularity. So there is a sense that this movie has been seen and the realization that the treatment of the topic is not as good as in that other film: ""Vertigo"", ""North by Northwest"", ""39 Steps"", etc.<br/><br/>But as suspense drama, the movie does hold up fairly well. The closing scene at the Statue of Liberty holds the viewer. Priscilla Lane holds on to Otto Kruger so he doesn't escape; and the suspense is taut to its conclusion.<br/><br/>It just doesn't seem to measure up to other films Hitchcock made surrounding similar themes with different actors."

","Saboteur was made in 1942 and thus is a propaganda film by Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>The subject is Nazi sympathizers in America working to sabotage key targets such as factories and military installations.<br/><br/>Robert Cummings plays Barry Kane an aircraft factory worker wrongfully accused of sabotage which killed his co-worker. He crossed the path of the real saboteur and now with few clues is on the hunt for him and clear his name.<br/><br/>The film owes a lot to a previous Hitchcock effort that he made in Britain, The 39 Steps. Both films have similar plot devices as the hero is in a cross country pursuit chased by law enforcement authorities and fascist sympathizers. On the way he meets some people who assist him such as a truck driver, or a travelling circus and more importantly Kane meets up with beautiful model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) who is wary of him and tries to turn him in at first.<br/><br/>The film very much feels like a remake of The 39 Steps but Cummings lacks the dash of Robert Donat and just looks like too much a solid stock actor. There is some black humour and effective visual touches as Kane goes from California to the skyscrapers of New York.<br/><br/>This is still a film that shows us a Hitchcock trying to feel is way round filming in America trying to find actors who will represent his vision. Here he is well served by the bad guys. The suave and wealthy Otto Kruger lusting after power in the new world order and Norman Lloyd the villain who gets his hands dirty.<br/><br/>What is effective is the climax at the Statue of Liberty.

"brchthethird","7","0","2","2 August 2015"," A solid wartime thriller
","Hitchcock is one of those directors that every film buff is aware of, but few will admit to having seen none of his films. Prior to this, I'd only seen THE BIRDS and PSYCHO (in that order), but that was a long time ago so I consider this to be my (re)introduction to him. Other than a lot of suspense, I wasn't really sure what to expect from SABOTEUR. It turned out to be quite good for an early Hitchcock film, although it betrays the time in which it was made a little too much. The story is about Barry Kane (Robert Cummings), who works at an airplane factory. One day a catastrophic fire kills one of his friends and he's pinned as the one responsible. This sets him on a journey to prove his innocence and find out just what is going on. Generally speaking, there wasn't a dull moment in this, although I do think it began to lose some narrative steam in the final half-hour as they struggle to find a way to keep the action going after the villain's endgame is (sort of) revealed. I do think it was well-acted and had interesting characters, although nearly everyone upstages Barry's ""Average Joe."" My two favorite characters are Philip Martin, the blind man he meets, and Tobin, someone who turns out to be very important. These two characters also happen to have a couple scenes which very eruditely give the thematic concerns we're supposed to take away from the film. Given that this produced during American involvement in WWII, anybody who didn't support the war effort would naturally have been looked on with suspicion. This is why the villains are saboteurs who aim to damage the US war effort. However, the blind man (in what might have been a compromise with the studio?) is made to say that even in times of war, our democratic principles still hold and a person is innocent until proved guilty. Without that counterpoint, I feel that the film would have verged on being jingoistic and meaninglessly patriotic. While I'm not too much enamored of the way the film reduces wartime politics to an ""us vs them"" binary, Hitchcock did make a solidly thrilling picture that is still quite relevant today."

This film bares a lot of similarities to North by Northwest and The 39 Steps both also by Hitchcock. This is a great film like all Hitchcock films.

"disinterested_spectator","6","0","2","10 April 2015"," What Does a Saboteur Look Like?
","""You look like a saboteur,"" Pat says to Barry accusatively.<br/><br/>What are we to make of this remark? First of all, there is reality. We all know as a general rule, saboteurs do not have a distinctive look. Now, inasmuch as World War II had just broken out, I suppose that if Barry had been Japanese or German, her remark would have been appropriate. Of course, today we would call that racial profiling, but since this movie was made in 1942, she could have gotten away with it. But Barry does not appear to be either.<br/><br/>Second, there is type casting. A movie producer might call up an agent, and say, ""We're making a spy movie. Do you have anyone who looks like a saboteur? If so, send him over for an interview."" And then the agent might send over someone like Norman Lloyd, the man who plays the saboteur named Fry in the movie. But the agent would not have sent over Robert Cummings.<br/><br/>Third, there is the reason why Pat said it. After she expresses her difficulty in believing that any American would be a saboteur, Barry responds, ""Well, you believe it about me!"" She replies that he is different, because he looks like a saboteur. And that is peculiar, because neither reality nor movie stereotyping would make anyone say that about someone who looks like Robert Cummings. Besides, she had a very good reason for thinking he was a saboteur, which has nothing to do with his looks. When she first met him, she saw that he was wearing handcuffs, and she realized that he was the fugitive the police were looking for.<br/><br/>Actually, it is precisely because Barry does not look like a saboteur that he is able to avoid the police. After he jumps out of the police car, he jumps from the bridge into the river below. The truck driver that had earlier given him a ride recognizes him, and he misdirects the police so that Barry can escape. Now, why would anyone do that? I would have helped the police by pointing out where Barry was hiding. All we can conclude is that the truck driver figured Barry did not look like a criminal, so he helped him escape.<br/><br/>Barry takes shelter in a blind man's house. When his niece Pat turns up, and she sees the handcuffs that her uncle Philip already knew about on account of his acute hearing, she says he should have turned him in to the police. Her uncle accuses her of being cruel. He assures her that Barry is not dangerous. And besides, he argues, a man is innocent until proved guilty. Now, because Philip is blind, he obviously cannot be coming to these incredible conclusions simply on account of Barry's looks. But Philip tells Pat that he can see intangible things, like innocence.<br/><br/>Pat pretends to go along with what her uncle wants, which is to take Barry to a blacksmith to get the handcuffs off, but she tries to take him to the police instead. That doesn't work, however, and after some complications, they find themselves in the company of some circus freaks. Some of them want to turn Barry over to the police, who are inspecting the circus trucks, but the deciding vote is the bearded lady who blathers about how fine it is that Pat has stuck with Barry through his difficulties, and therefore they must be good people. This makes about as much sense as when earlier a man and a woman saw Barry kidnap Pat, dragging her into the car against her will, and the woman said, ""My, they must be terribly in love.""<br/><br/>What these three instances—that of the truck driver, Uncle Philip, and the freaks—have in common is that appearances, in one form or another, make people decide to thwart the police and help the fugitive. Toward the end of the movie, Tobin, one of the villains, says of Barry that he is noble, fine, and pure, and that is why he is misjudged by everyone. But save for the police, Barry is not misjudged by others. The point of this line is to show just how much evil foreigners underestimate Americans. Americans, being basically noble, fine, and pure, can readily see the goodness in others, which is why they are willing to help a fugitive from justice escape from the police: they can just tell that Barry is noble, fine, and pure.<br/><br/>In some ways, this movie reminds us of ""The 39 Steps"" (1935), made several years earlier. In that movie, a man is also falsely suspected of being a spy and has to convince a woman that he is really a good guy. There is a pair of handcuffs in that movie too, except that the man and woman are handcuffed together in that one. However, ""Saboteur"" also made me think of ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (1943), which Hitchcock made just a year later, in which appearances, instead of being dependable, turn out to be deceptive. Perhaps the one was a reaction to the other."

This clue leads him to the ranch of Charles Tobin; he denies all knowledge of anybody called Fry but in a fortunate case of happenstance Tobin's young granddaughter takes some papers out of his jacket and Kane sees that one that confirms that he does know Fry; it mentions a place called Soda City. Tobin calls the police and Fry is arrested but soon manages to escape despite being in handcuffs. He makes his way to the house of a blind man who surprisingly believes his story and asks his niece Pat to take him to the blacksmiths to cut his cuffs off. She is less trusting and decides to take him to the police; he overpowers here though and eventually gets to Soda City with her in tow. Here they are separated when members of Fry's organisation turn up; Kane bluffs that he is the saboteur after all a they take him on to New York where there next act of sabotage is due to take place. Pat makes her way to the police but they are also working for Tobin and his group. Kane and Pat are reunited in New York where they learn that the saboteurs are part of a fascist group that includes some of the city's most noted citizens. They may now know where the attack is due to take place but before they can do anything about it they will have to escape from their captors! <br/><br/>This was a solid thriller despite not featuring a well known cast; in fact not casting a star in the role of Kane probably helped as it gave him the feel of an ordinary man caught up in events rather than that of a hero. There are a series of exciting moments from the opening fire till a dramatic final confrontation on the outside of the statue of liberty; a scene that would foreshadow the more famous scene on Mount Rushmore in 'North by Northwest'. This is a particularly tense scene that is sure to unnerve acrophobes! Being made at the height of the war it isn't surprising that there is some propaganda to be found here; there is a clear message that just because somebody is a pillar of the community it doesn't mean they can't be a danger; thankfully this isn't too heavy handed and doesn't feel particularly forced. This might not be one of Hitchcock's best known films but is certainly well worth watching."

","""Saboteur"" shows that in order for Alfred Hitchcock to make great films, he must first make films that are less than spectacular. I had high hopes for this film. It was shot beautifully (This IS a Hitchcock film, after all) and it's great to see Priscilla Lane's character actually DO something to help the main character and herself, which breaks away from that commonly irritable label about damsels in distress. However, the film seems to drop everything that we knew about the characters' personas and identities towards the end. I'm not sure why, but it appears that the characters instantly stop acting the way they have been throughout the entire film, and suddenly become someone different. Lane's very outspoken character begins to act very small around the center of the movie, and then snaps back to her usual self. The police change overtime as well, but it's probably because they cycle between different police departments in different cities. Aside from the bizarre character behaviors, I also felt the ending could use some more work. Without giving anything away, I'll just say this: If the ending to ""Sabotaur"" could be structured like the ending to another Hitchcock film, like perhaps ""Foreign Correspondent,"" then perhaps it would have been something reflective. Other than that, the film works, but not in the way you think it will."

","Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur is a delight to watch. It was one of his first few 'wrong man' pictures, in which the protagonist is accused of a crime he did not commit, and seeks personal vindication and justice. Interestingly, it's the first Hitchcock film to feature an all-American cast and is completely shot in America. Saboteur neither reaches the standards of Rear Window, Psycho, or Vertigo, nor is it made when Hitchcock was at the prime of his career, but it gives a glimpse of his talent in storytelling and the building of suspense.<br/><br/>As with most Hitchcock features, there are unforgettable images and signature set pieces that could have only been designed by him. In Psycho, there was the shocking shower scene. In North By Northwest, there was the thrilling crop-dusting scene. In Saboteur, the most striking image is that of the antagonist dangling in the air atop of the Statue of Liberty. Filmed in black-and-white, Saboteur is not necessarily an example of great cinematography. However, the color stock used is easy on the eye, and does not appear to affect the film's ability to engage viewers.<br/><br/>The performances of the cast are decent, but there's no real starring act here. If there's one thing I loved most about Saboteur, it would be the pacing of the film; Hitchcock establishes the story with little urgency, and while the film does not really shift into high gears even in suspense mode, the pacing of each scene is slow but steady, yet remarkably arresting at the same time. Saboteur may not be a Hitchcock masterpiece, but as with The Lady Vanishes (1938) it's certainly one of his most underrated.<br/><br/>SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"
"vip_ebriega","7","0","2","12 May 2010"," Typical Hitchcock, but in top form.
","SABOTEUR looks like a prototype of Alfred Hitchcock's later film NORTH BY NORTHWEST (it's also similar to his earlier classic THE 39 STEPS). Everything from the man framed for a crime he didn't commit, the lovely young woman who helps him out, and the climactic final confrontation in some famous landmark. Substitute Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill to Robert Cummings' Barry Kane, Eva Marie Saint's Eve Kendall to Priscilla Lane's Pat Martin and the finale take place atop the Statue of Liberty instead of Mt. Rushmore and you have SABOTEUR.<br/><br/>Still, although it isn't the best movie the Master of Suspense has created, it's nonetheless watchable and rather entertaining. The pace moves rather fast early on where factory worker Barry Kane (Cummings) is framed for setting the factory on fire. Kane knows who really did it and hopes to clear his name. As usual, he narrowly escapes the law and several occasions in hopes that he find the real saboteur before he strikes again. But since this is way before Hitchcock's bigger budget productions, SABOTEUR is a little tamer than his later works. The cast is OK at best, with Cummings coming of as a decent man-on-the-run but a rather wooden actor. Lane's performance fares a little better, but she's not the best of the later perennial blond heroines. Only Otto Kruger's and Norman Lloyd's suitable intriguing antagonists that remain the best.<br/><br/>The pace slows down midway (involving a scene inside a train with a bunch of circus freaks feels a bit out of place in a Hitchcock movie), but picks up later on, especially before the climax atop the Statue of Liberty (which, sad to say, is rather anti-climatic). Overall, not one of Hitchcock's best movies and far outdone by later attempts at the ""man-on-the-run"" formula, but a must-see for Hitchcock's fans.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."

"barryrd","8","0","1","18 September 2008"," Great Hitchcock entertainment from 1942
","Saboteur is a 1942 film, partly aimed at getting American support for the war against Nazi Germany. Propaganda or not, it's great entertainment. The leading actors are Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, although director Alfred Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper, and Barbara Stanwyck in the roles, which would have given the movie more stature. This is a good movie anyway with Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane bringing their own style to the characters. As in other Hitchcock movies, we see the director's disregard for the socially suave and the well-heeled. He often portrayed spies and foreign agents as nice upper-class folk who at the same time sneered at democratic values and concepts such as guilty until proved innocent. These upper crust traitors are the last the police pursue or even suspect. Hitchcock had a lifelong distrust of the police. He wanted to elevate the regular guy, the bungler and the fellow who doesn't take himself too seriously. One can see him wanting Gary Cooper as an icon in the Frank Capra mold. Nevertheless, Bob Cummings puts his own stamp on the boy-next-door and works well in the role. Priscilla Lane, as the spunky female lead, comes off as the all-American girl who can handle herself quite nicely when put to the test. Robert Cummings, as defence plant worker Barry Kane, is framed for a bombing that kills his best friend. This leads to a cross-country chase scene reminiscent of other Hitchcock heroes on the run. Hitchcock repeats some of the well-established formulas from previous films - the reluctant female who is drawn into the action, e.g. Madeleine Carroll in the 39 Steps, and risking his life to evade the authorities who are on his heels. We view scenes of America as Kane tries to find the real culprit in the bombing he stands accused of. We see rivers, bridges, backwoods cabins, truckers, the Hoover Dam and finally, New York City. New York is a fitting backdrop for the climax as we go from Rockefeller Center to the ocean liners (with a cut to the ship Normandy) and the grand finale on the Statue of Liberty. Great movie with uninterrupted action. Don't miss it."
"Quinoa1984","8","0","1","11 August 2008"," American quasi-remake of the 39 Steps with a few twists, not least of which the Statue of Liberty
","It goes without saying that Alfred Hitchcock repeats himself, and he wouldn't want it any other way. Like some great big old rock band that goes out on tour and lays the same songs with only minute variations in the set-list, Hitchcock's films carry so many similarities- not least of which the running ""Wrong Man"" theme, which was even a title of one film in the 50s- that it's easy to point out how much Saboteur resembles the 39 Steps for good chunks of time. Even more-so than North by Northwest, which I was sure was the next-generation knock-off of 39 Steps, Saboteur posits the everyman hero, played by Robert Cummings, being set-up to take the fall for a murder, and all authorities are on the alert for his presence. He somehow narrowly gets away from a car while in handcuffs and gets through a river, holds up very briefly in someone else's cabin out in rural area, hitches along with an unlikely blonde beauty (Priscilla Lane) who wants nothing better than to turn him in, and then finally the two become both the heroes.<br/><br/>Sound familiar? That's mostly the set-up for Saboteur, and it's sad to say that even with a bigger budget, Selznick and Universal studios backing, and some minor star power, the 39 Steps is still better overall in this variation on a solid Hitchcock tempo. In Saboteur, despite the changes made for war-time pride and the enemies being dangerous threats (i.e. tantamount to terrorists) and very well-acted threats by Otto Kruger and particularly Norman Lloyd, Hitchcock relies a lot on strange supporting turns to keep things interesting on the cross-country trip from Los Angeles to New York. Sometimes this is interesting like with the blind cabin owner, who's also Lane's father. Sometimes it's just ho-hum like with the truck driver (charicature at best). And while Cummings and Lane make a good, typically Hitchcockian couple, Cummings is no Robert Donat, and is only good in that conventional wrong-man hero kind of way (to be fair, it also wasn't Hitch's first choice). A couple of short monologues about war-time pride also feel a little dated, also sadly.<br/><br/>This all said, when Saboteur works, and it often does, it displays its director going to town on expressing his ""camera logic"", as Norman Lloyd quoted Hitchcock in an interview. Which is to say that everything makes so much sense with the style here, with how to tell the story, that it becomes a wonderful surprise to see how much Hitchcock does experiment, making things just a little more abstract like with the fire near the start of the picture (that shot of the black smoke rolling in on the background is just fantastic), or how he deals with Frank Frye reaching for and finally touching the button and setting off the explosion at the docks. But, without a doubt, it's the last fifteen minutes or so of the movie- from right after the explosion, through Radio City and the dueling gun battle on screen and in the theater, to the ferry to the Statue of Liberty, and then that wildly successful sequence up at the top and clinging on for dear life- that make it something close to a must-see for just cinema lovers in general.<br/><br/>Somehow, Hitchcock has a way with making quintessential sequences like the Liberty Statue, and it even found its way into North by Northwest being close to a collection of the hits. Saying Saboteur isn't one of Hitchcock's best films is taking into account the picture from start to finish as it does have a derivative story and characters, even for the Master. But this also goes without saying that it does contain some of the sharpest direction, and some of the most stunning even-for-21st-century ""how did they do that"" suspense, in the director's career. 8.5/10"
"slokes","6","0","3","8 January 2008"," Hitchcock's B-Movie
","Cheap sets, stiff actors, meandering plot - say, what kind of Alfred Hitchcock film is this?<br/><br/>Not his best, truth be told. Made just as Hollywood geared up for World War II, ""Saboteur"" is so dated you expect a lady selling war bonds to walk into your living room when the DVD's over. But there are enough hints of classic Hitchcock to be found in such things as the offbeat pacing and villain characterizations to keep you watching through to a satisfying if not strong ending.<br/><br/>Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is a California aircraft factory worker fingered for torching his workplace and killing his best friend. Only Kane knows the truth, that the culprit is a Vladimir Putin lookalike called Fry (Norman Lloyd) whom he traces to a desert ranch. Turns out Fry is working for a group of evil capitalists bent on selling out Uncle Sam to the Axis. Will Kane catch them before they make a battleship in Brooklyn their next trophy?<br/><br/>This was the first of three pictures Hitchcock would make in consecutive years with celebrated American writers, as Dorothy Parker lent a hand to this script. Unfortunately, Parker's clumsy injection of New Yorker left-wing ideology puts us in a movie that asks us to believe American capitalists are conspiring to overthrow their free-market society for a chance to make a few bucks off of slave labor. How this film slipped past McCarthy & Co. is a mystery.<br/><br/>""They bomb cities, sink ships, torture and murder so you and your friends can eat off of gold plate,"" says Kane to handsome head baddie Charles Tobin (Otto Kruger), who smirks a lot as he ridicules Kane's idealism.<br/><br/>Hitchcock doesn't seem to be at his best either, cribbing off his English works from the 1930s like a madman to lesser effect. Even more original scenes come with awkward exposition, like when Kane is befriended by a troupe of circus freaks, or a windy old blind man who sends Barry off with his niece, professional model Pat (Priscilla Lane).<br/><br/>""Go ahead, Barry, and do the things I wish I could do,"" says the old man. Maybe I'm reading too much into that, but I was creeped out.<br/><br/>But when the scenes work, they bear the Master's unmistakable stamp. Neither Lane nor Cummings are fresh on screen, but both have their moments, like when he discovers his friend's grieving mother blames him for the murder, or she tries to sucker Fry into hanging out with her on top of the Statue of Liberty.<br/><br/>The Statue of Liberty is the site of ""Saboteur's"" signature finale, but Hitchcock scores in small ways, too, like with Tobin's unfailing graciousness and his grandfatherly affection for a small tyke. Right next to the house where the grieving mother is sitting is another house from where ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"" plays.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Saboteur"" leaves too much on the table for it to be rated among Hitchcock's better films. But it is an early all-American example of Hitchcock's ability to ride a wooly plot line for maximum entertainment value. Even if it is one for the cheap seats, it's not without some pleasure to be had."

"JuguAbraham","8","0","1","30 March 2006"," Hitchcock's homage to film-making
","""Saboteur"" will be one of the few films in which the director refers to the film-making process and doffs his hat to cinema.<br/><br/>The first reference is during the conversation of how the saboteurs intend to blow up the inauguration of a warship with the aid of a camera and other devices. One of the characters states ""it is a pity that a good camera would be lost."" <br/><br/>The second reference is the sequence in a film screening, where the audience is strangely laughing at a grim scene. So enraptured is the audience that they do not realize that armed saboteurs are trying to escape the dragnet of the law until someone among the audience is shot in the process.<br/><br/>The two references indicate: 1. The importance he gave to the camera; 2.The ability of cinema to mesmerise audiences; and 3. The possibility that audiences could react in unusual ways to what was presented, depending on how it was presented.<br/><br/>Hitchcock relied on good scripts and this one has patches of brilliancethe blind man's hospitality to a stranger and a motley circus crew's reaction to giving a ride to couple on the road. The first sequence mentioned involving Vaughan Glaser is remarkable for the fine words of wisdom and delivery, the second for its humanism seen from the viewpoint of fringes of society. I guess Hitchcock must have seen the 1932 Hollywood film ""Freaks"" or, if not, the scriptwriters had seen it, because much of this latter sequence harks back to this film in good measure.<br/><br/>What is great about ""Saboteur"" that we do not see in other works of Hitchcock? The title sequence with the shadow of a person emerging from a corner of the screen and a few minutes later the dense smoke blacking out the screen are unforgettable in black and white. In color it might not have had the same effect.<br/><br/>Hitchcock loved to copy his own earlier work and but improve on them each timemuch of ""The 39 Steps"" gets repeated here, handcuffs, chase with a woman across the country, terrorists, etc. And of course what he presents here in ""Saboteur"" gets picked up later: Statue of Liberty gets replaced by Mount Rushmore and the impromptu auction in ""North by Northwest"" and the telescope of ""Saboteur"" is replaced by binoculars of ""Rear Window"" and so on.<br/><br/>Two major Hitchcock elementssex and humortake a back seat. Sex is inferred by the bearded lady's statements and dark humor is presented when one of the saboteurs refer to his childhood with golden curls. This work of Hitchcock stands out for lovers of the craft of good cinema more than those who look for a good story. The first few frames of the film had me hooked! Then came the script that was superlative in several sections of the uneven film. The film will stand the test of time for serious film viewers. I wish we could see the sections of the film that were deleted!"

The other major problem is the end, where the villain (Fry) is hanging on the Statue of Liberty. Kane, Robert Cummings's character, is holding Fry up by his sleeve. The sleeve rips, and Fry falls to his death.<br/><br/>This ending is abrupt, and seems like the writers were just looking for a way to finish the plot off and just decided to kill Fry.<br/><br/>Otherwise, besides those two problems, Saboteur is a good suspense movie. Good scenes include the bridge, and the scene at the ranch. Also, when Kane is riding with the trucker and the police pull up. Saboteur is not one of Hitchcock's best movies.

If you've already seen North by Northwest (and if not, what's wrong with ya?), you'll immediately notice the hole that's left without a strong, charismatic, attractive male lead (i.e., Mr. Leach) in a very similar story.<br/><br/>It was also odd that so many people, after hearing bits of Cummings' story, would immediately side with him.  Frankly, the blind guy's daughter is right, why automatically assume this guy isn't guilty just because you think he's kind of nice?  It would have helped if there was one cop or detective who was determined to bring this guy to justice and was always just a step or two behind, frankly there's not much suspense or sense that apprehension lurks around every corner.  Also as noted, that speech about the long blonde curls is kinda creepy and borderline homophobic.  Are Hitch and the gang trying to say that gays can't be trusted to be real Americans?<br/><br/>The patriotic speeches were obviously pasted in and can only be forgiven being overblown because of the situation at the time.  But Kreuger's long speech about why he's doing what he's doing almost struck me as being pro-Communist, all about how swell the average working Joe is and how evil the tuxedoed capitalist is and how bad power is.<br/><br/>I'm trying to work my way through the body of Hitch's work so now I can add this notch to my belt, but it wasn't 2 hours well spent."
