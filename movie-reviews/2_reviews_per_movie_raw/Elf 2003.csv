"patriciogl10","7","11","11","3 October 2019"," Classic Christmas spirit.
","This is the kind of Christmas movie you should be watching every 25th of December apart from your usuals. It's a wonderful story, with a strong Will Ferrell, playing an innocent, child-like, distracted elf who has no idea how the real world functions, as he is on the quest to search for his real family. He is willing to spread the Christmas spirit on a city which apparently hasn't got the spark in its eyes, so there is a hard task on his hands.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is wonderfully completed by Zooey Deschanel, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Daniel Tay, with Peter Dinklage and Bob Newhart in small roles. Ferrell definitely steals the movie; and his troubled relationship with his father (Caan) provides some funny and touching moments as well. Jon Favreau did quite a good job from the director's chair, turning this seemingly childish film into a marvelous choice for your Christmas movies of every year. Some even regard it as a classic, but well, I will let you be the judge of that."
"bob the moo","Null","71","88","16 November 2003"," A really nice, funny movie for Christmas despite a little bit of the inevitable smaltz
","Accidentally finding his way into Santa's bad once Christmas Eve, little baby orphan Buddy ends up in the north pole, where he is raised by the elves as one of their own.  As he gets ever bigger and less and less suited to the elf lifestyle he is told about his real father and decides to go to New York to find him.  However Buddy's natural smile and elfish enthusiasm doesn't really fit in with New York, not to mention a father who rejects him.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer for this film I laughed slightly but I also thought that it could easily be just awful.  Despite this fear I decided to go and see it on the basis of seeing Ferrell in the Reloaded MTV spoof on the DVD and being very funny.  I was glad that I did as the film was refreshingly funny very enjoyable despite the weaknesses inherent in a seasonable film of this nature.  The jokes are a mix of adult and children - but not separately, the humour is of a nature families can all enjoy rather than being of a `one for me and one for the kids' type.<br/><br/>The film does get a little sweet towards the end, but it manages to avoid this usual trap for the majority of the film and can't be expected to not be all Christmas cheer at some point!  The fish out of water stuff is pretty funny and Farrell makes his character funny without being annoying to the audience (as he feared he might be from the trailer).  Caan is good but has to work with the `scrooge' character of the film and thus gets fewer laughs. The support cast is good with fun turns from Newhart, Asner and Steenburger.<br/><br/>It does get a little sickly sweet towards the end and the fish out of water jokes do wear a little thin towards the end but mostly it is very funny and refreshingly fun to watch.  The film is made better by a performance from Farrell that is perfectly pitched without being annoying and full of spark and wit."

","This was my 4th viewing and now ready to review.<br/><br/>The story is insane. This film should not have worked. But almost as a tribute to the X-Mas miracles it tries to riff off, it is an astonishingly entertaining film.<br/><br/>Behind the camera Favreau, Mr Money Shot, who has quietly without fanfare turned into one of the hottest directors in Hollywood history. In front of the camera Farell who I usually don't care for but may just give the performance of his career here. A script to die for. Probably the best use of Zoey D's looks in her career to date.<br/><br/>Way under rated and unappreciated.<br/><br/>As in my other reviews, most ""recent"" X-Mas films (since about 2000) are Canadian B-movies shot on a budget which would barely cover a reno on THIS OLD HOUSE What an unexpected treat See it"
"della-10","10","120","157","24 June 2004"," This is a wonderful, original and perfectly portrayed film.
","This was one of my favorite movies in 2003. Will Ferrell is brilliant as the Elf. The supporting cast is great too, especially Bob Newhart as his elf ""dad"". The characters are well written and it is a refreshing film to get lost in. Will Ferrell plays the elf with such innocence, he is so funny! This is not just a Christmas film but when the DVD comes out I will be watching ""Elf"" in July. The story progresses nicely, there are many lessons to be learned as you watch this movie. It touched my heart in many ways. I highly recommend this movie for kids AND adults, you won't regret it. Treat yourself and watch this ""original"" movie. Hollywood needs to make more like this."
"pyrocitor","8","12","13","14 December 2015"," Reflexive Christmas cheer without the jeer
","At first glance, it's hard to imagine a less likely candidate for an unironic Christmas film than the director/star of the snappy, sardonic Swingers (and soon-to-be director of Iron Man, of all things). Yet, curiously enough, it's this particular background that makes Jon Favreau so well-suited (ha) for the job. Sharp enough not to tumble into the schmaltz too heavily but shrewd enough to recognize the value in playing it straight, Favreau's Elf hits the ideal balance between being fun for kids while clever and sweet enough to remain tolerable for adults without caving to becoming closeted-self-loathing. It's no wonder that such a comparatively recent film has already worked its way into vintage holiday movie canon. <br/><br/>Favreau is evidently nostalgic for the good ol' days of Christmas flicks (check out the distinctly Rudolf-esq stop motion Arctic creatures and Seussian snowflakes, some of the film's most delightful additions), but is clever enough to have a good beat on what makes them tick. Like all the best elating seasonal fare, Elf delivers a story of a fish-out-of-water outcast struggling with abandonment and an inability to fit in, but finds inspiration in his unflinching cheeriness in the face of his adversity, and its infectious effect on the community. Between corporate office culture, rampant consumerism and the bedraggled staff responsible for hocking it, there's a fair share of Scrooginess proliferating the film, but, bouncing along like a pointy hat-sporting George Bailey, Buddy the Elf(/human? Elf-man? Humelf...?) remains such a radiantly positive character that it's impossible not to be won over by him, as the film's other characters echo.<br/><br/>Though there are gleeful setpieces aplenty (the ""you're not Santa!"" toy store brawl is already iconic, but Buddy's proficiency in a snowball fight is just as wickedly fun), Elf works by never abandoning its core emotional story, weaving in touching beats throughout, as Buddy connects with his estranged ""naughty listed"" father and thug life brother, and clumsily wooes his jaded coworker (one of the film's few objectionable bits - while cute, it's a bit underdeveloped, not to mention eyebrow raise-worthy how quickly she acclimatizes to a romance with a man who, for all intents and purposes, has the mental facilities of a 12-year old...). Pacing-wise, the film ticks along at a satisfyingly jaunty rate, and it only helps that Favreau commits to the tone aesthetically, with popping, vibrant candy colours and soft-focus lighting that allows the film to almost literally sparkle. The climax, finding conflict in Santa's sleigh crashing in Central Park, beset by Nazgûl-like park rangers, would play as laughably shoehorned in if Favreau didn't deliver it with such a knowing wink, and, strained as it might feel, he pulls it off without distracting excessively. And aww shucks - who could begrudge to a finale that dives whole-hog into sentiment - a Christmas spirit-inducing sing-a-long, no less! - so confidently and unironically, that, unlike most such euphoric 'happy endings,' it actually works really well. Hell - if James Caan's humbug can sing along, you sure can too. <br/><br/>It's impossible to imagine the film to work without the stupendous work of Will Ferrell powering it. Like Favreau, Ferrell has mastered a delivery that plays to multiple audiences at once, allow him to sound wholeheartedly sincere yet uproariously stupid in the same breath, yet uniquely lovable either way. In between the inevitable more kid-friendly slapstick (and thankfully only one burp joke), Ferrell is never crass about Buddy's childlike approach to life, mining it for the utmost of wide-eyed truth, and he's all the funnier and more adorably charming for it. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast, thankfully, are game to echo Ferrell's spirit. James Caan is pitch-perfect as the curmudgeonly Scrooge too wrapped up in exploiting nuns and orphanages to pay attention to his giddy elf-son, while (a jarringly blonde) Zooey Deschanel showcases the luminescent, quirky charm that would shortly catapult her into stardom (she even sneaks in a couple of songs for good measure). Ed Astner's gruff warmth makes him the most definitive Santa Claus since Richard Attenborough, and the hangdog charm of Bob Newhart lends the film's narration a perfectly relaxed airiness. The ever-adorable Mary Steenbergen helps the film's emotional heart blossom as Caan's more amiable wife, while Daniel Tay avoids the curse of the obnoxious Christmas child star with an edgier and more sly precociousness. Favreau even sneaks in some parentally crowdpleasing cameos - hey there, Kyle Gass from Tenacious D and Andy Richter! - while Peter Dinklage just about walks off with the show with his sublimely preening rock star children's author. <br/><br/>Confidently festive and heartwarming with just the right underbelly of snarky eye-rolling, Elf is a true delight, and one of the most worthwhile additions to the Christmas pantheon. Although it's not as ambitious or infused with an emotional home run as other holiday classics, it's inevitable that the Christmas cheer level on the Clausometer will receive a hefty boost upon viewing or revisiting Elf. <br/><br/>I'm still not eating spaghetti with maple syrup, though. That's a step too far. <br/><br/>-8.5/10"
"moonspinner55","7","27","33","23 December 2007"," A star is born in this laugh-out-loud holiday comedy...
","Charming Christmas confection--about a boy raised by elves in the North Pole who grows up and journeys to N.Y.C. in search of his biological father--puts a clever spin on even the most familiar gags, successfully walking a fine line between absurdist comedy and holiday schmaltz. Will Ferrell looks like a string-bean in yellow tights and, with his mass of curly hair peeking out from underneath his elf's hat, he could easily be used as a walking punchline. Fortunately, director Jon Favreau's handling of ""Elf"" is incredibly nimble, treating Ferrell and his naive character Buddy with the utmost respect; you can laugh at all the silly pranks without ever feeling guilty. Favreau's work is smooth, and he's assembled an incredible supporting cast of character actors to back his star, though some may find the climactic moments (involving Edward Asner as Santa Claus) a bit too literal--and the movie is certainly funnier before we get to this point. Still, the special effects are kept to a minimum in order to let the people shine...and that's not only refreshing, it's heart-warming. *** from ****"
"Montezuma59","10","52","69","13 September 2006"," An Uplifiting and Cheerful Display of Raw Uninformed Innocence
","Will Ferrell does a great job here, and it's the perfect Christmas (Holiday) movie that can be enjoyed anytime of the year.<br/><br/>The contrast of almost unbalanced folly of Will's character with those that encompass him, lends a great degree of innocence and non-stop joy and plenty of laughter as he leaves the mundane world of the usual, boring, and often time intolerance of the world in his dust.<br/><br/>It's refreshing to see a story where others are encouraged to rise to the level of this main character instead of him being overwhelmed and dragged down by the majority of ""Cotten Headed Ninny Muggins"", a.k.a. the ""touch me not, speak to me not"" big city public psyche so familiar that many walk around with.<br/><br/>For those that represent the general public in the movie, as well as the audience, Ferrell's character dares us to believe again, even for a moment of the magic of Christmas and tears down decades of political correctness to connect us with the late 60s and 70s when so many annual Holiday shows brought us a seemingly sustained desire to entertain ourselves with the magic that waxes then wanes but for a few short weeks each year. Whether a work of animation or raw theater, this refreshing story brings vitality and rekindles childhood memories for the kid in all of us."

"dph570","10","90","129","3 December 2004"," Great, Clean Christmas movie!
","It was so nice to be able to sit down and watch a movie featuring an SNL actor without having to mute or fast forward any crude parts. Granted, this may not be Will Farrell's most amazing performance, but if you want a new Christmas movie to watch this season, I highly recommend Elf. I talked to a few people who thought the movie was stupid, but that was because they were expecting Will Farrell's character to be a duplicate of his SNL performances. So, to fully enjoy this movie, watch it without any expectations and remember that it's okay to have a childlike sense of humor--nobody's too cool for a great Christmas movie. I love most all the movies from Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Will Farrell, Jim Carrey, Chris Farley, Chevy Chase, and David Spade, but most of them aren't appropriate for viewers of all ages. Elf is a movie you can throw in the VCR and not have to worry about what the kids hear or see on it. Thanks, Will, for putting out a hilarious movie that the whole family can watch!"

","This is a good natured holiday comedy that definitely is in the same realm as ""The Santa Clause"" and (Dare I say?) ""Miracle on 34th Street"". Story is about a human that has been raised by Santa's elves at the North Pole and as he gets older he figures out that he's very different from the other elves. Years earlier Santa (Ed Asner) was delivering at an orphanage and a human baby accidentally crawled into his sack and was taken back to the North Pole where he was raised by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). He is called Buddy (Will Ferrell) and he grows to six foot three and one day he is told the truth about his situation and told by Santa who his real father is. Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and he heads to the Empire State Building where he works. He finds his father Walter (James Caan) who runs a publishing business and works all the time much to the chagrin of his family. Walter is unable to get away from Buddy and after a blood test proves he is his son he takes him home with him to stay with his family. He meets Walter's wife Emily (Mary Steenburgen) and their son and Walter thinks Buddy is just someone reverting to his childhood after a shock. Buddy starts to work in a department store and he meets a woman named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) and is smitten by her. Buddy tries to fit in with the others but finds it difficult although he becomes friends with Walter's son and starts dating Jovie.<br/><br/>This film is directed by Jon Favreau who has made his mark as a director of low budget films like ""Made"" and also as a character actor but this is his first effort at directing a mainstream Hollywood movie. He does a commendable job and as I watched this film I kept having the feeling that he purposely made the most commercial film that he could. Favreau as an actor has mostly appeared in small roles. As a director his small films are lucky to play at art house theaters and I seriously doubt he's getting rich hosting ""Dinner For 5"" on the Independent Film Channel. It looks as though he wanted to make a crowd pleasing film that will ultimately be playing on some cable channel for the rest of our lives. I'm not knocking this decision at all, it's a smart move and he's become a major Hollywood player with the success of this film. Even the script was carefully written to insure that WHEN this plays on television there will be nothing to edit out. The closest thing to a bad word is uttered by Caan when he says ""Hell"" once towards the end of the film. This is a fun film that does have undeniable charm and its heart is definitely in the right place. It's sentimental and corny but thats part of the appeal. The script doesn't try to hard and the energy and flow of the film keeps at a constant pace, it doesn't try to go over the top which is refreshing. Ferrell is a natural performer and his dopey wide eyed expressions never grow old. This film must be doing something right because tough guy James Caan is believable as a caring husband and father. Very old fashioned story that never raises itself above lightweight status is nonetheless funny and charming. Like I said earlier, this film will be playing on television every year for the rest of our lives!"

Will Ferrell is hot and cold when it comes to his film work. I've enjoyed maybe half of his movies, but the other half are unfunny duds. (Bewitched, Kicking and Screaming, and Semi-Pro come to mind.). Elf is probably his very best work ever- and also just happens to be his most innocent, childlike character.

","'Elf (2003)' is a sweet, 'Christmas spirit'-soaked experience that's got just the right amount of edge. It's lead by the somewhat 'restrained' (in that he isn't swearing or getting sexual) yet brazen and unembarrassed Will Ferrell in perhaps his most iconic role. It's also backed-up by pretty much the pitch-perfect 'straight-man' and screen legend that is James Caan. The film is genuinely funny on a surprising number of occasions, while just generally being enjoyable the rest of the time, to boot. Where it falters slightly is in its third-act, where the much more interesting father-son stuff is sidelined - to the point that the 'all is lost moment' and its aftermath (including its initial rectifying and, even, the flick's ultimate denouement) are rushed so much that they feel fairly disingenuous - in favour of a more traditional, typically 'Christmassy' 'saving Santa' story which honestly feels out of place here. It's a real shame that the crux of the narrative is glossed over for this finale, especially considering that the focal relationship and its themes are actually really juicy stuff - in terms of both comedy and character (indeed, pretty much every major player comes full circle in terms of their arc). It's an entertaining experience, nevertheless, and a pop-culture staple, too. 7/10"

As a human, Buddy is a lot bigger than your average elf and, finally realizing he's human, he sets out for New York City (with no knowledge of the world outside the North Pole) and sets out to find his father, who he's been told is Walter Hobbs (James Caan) - a big publishing executive working at the Empire State Building. Essentially, the story is about Buddy trying to fit into life in the real world, and to be honest, it's really quite enjoyable and sometimes even quite funny.<br/><br/>The cast all do quite well with their parts, although I thought that we didn't really need a love angle for Buddy, represented by Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) - who's adorably cute, but I'm not sure she was essential to the story. Every movie of this type, of course, needs a scrooge-type character to be reformed and filled with the Christmas spirit. Here, that was supposed to be Walter, but I honestly didn't find Walter to be scrooge-like enough. He seemed to be a basically nice guy who was himself just being overworked by an overbearing boss (in a limited role played by Michael Lerner.) I didn't get the jarring ""turnaround"" in Walter's attitude that you often get from this. He seemed to accept Buddy too easily - with a bit of encouragement from his wife (Mary Steenburgen.) Still, while some of the characters didn't hit home as powerfully as they could have, the performances were good and they added up to a fun story.<br/><br/>It was nice to see Ed Asner play a fairly important role as Santa in this, and the movie even managed to pay just a wee bit of homage to the TV special Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer, as Leon the Snowman who slid around at the North Pole looked basically like the sliding snowman who slid around and narrated Rudolf (although the narration for this movie, when necessary, was done by Papa Elf.) The animals in the woods at the North Pole also reminded me of the animals in Rudolf.<br/><br/>It's a cute story, good fun for the family in the Christmas season. (7/10)"

","Elf is another family film featuring Will Ferrell. Ferrell is Buddy, an elf raised by Santa's elves in the North Pole. Buddy lives with the elves thinking he is one of them until Papa Elf decides that he is old enough to know the truth. Buddy, after learning that his mother had died and his father did not know that he was alive, sets out for New York City to find his father.<br/><br/>Buddy's father is played by the legendary James Caan and he is perfect for his role. Buddy finds that his father, Walter, is not as jolly as he had hoped. In fact the man has made the naughty list from Santa. Family is second to Walter and Buddy is third. Buddy's innocence and carefree view towards life is the only way to loosen up Walter and let the family have its first enjoyable Christmas. <br/><br/>Will Ferrell goes along way from his adult comedy in Anchorman to a family film. He is carefree and at a few times you may thinks he's a complete idiot. But his jolliness defines how Christmas should be to family, a togetherness and unity during the holiday times. James Caan brings the same tough guy role to his father role, being the big man in a different way. He doesn't see the importance of family as much as money. His acting is fair with some great transitions around Ferrell, the scene when he convinces Buddy to go work in the basement with the criminals maybe his best acting in the film. <br/><br/>As for the story. It's your typical fish-out-of-water story with a happy ending that is always expected. The scenes in North Pole are fantastic, putting the sort of magic behind the time of Christmas. THis film is going to be one Christmas movie to remember. It brings out a sense of importance of family, unity, and brings back what it is like to be a kid.<br/><br/>Elf.

He's an actual human who as a baby was taken to the North Pole accidentally and was raised by elder elf Bob Newhart. After becoming the least prolific of workers at Santa's Workshop, he decides to go to New York to find his biological father who's played by James Caan. I'll stop there and just say this was quite funny and had also some touching scenes. Because this was a family film, there's no dirty language nor any adult situations.

"Robert_duder","8","9","13","8 August 2005"," Ferrell finally finds something to contain him
","I do love Christmas movies, always a sucker for them even if the style and story is not new or different. Elf does bring some new story to the typical Christmas movie but for the most part it's same old, same old which for someone who loves the Christmas movie is great!! Unfortunately I am not a fan of Will Ferrell, okay granted I thought Night At The Roxbury was pretty funny but everything else since then has been horrid. Nonetheless with Elf Ferrell finally finds something that suits his completely child like annoying behavior and his over acting actually suits the character.<br/><br/>Elf is the story of an orphan who accidentally makes his way into Santa's magical bag on Christmas Eve as a baby. When Santa discovers him he puts him in the care of the elves, in particular Papa Elf. The elves raise him as one of their own despite his size difference and a few other more human traits he is raised to believe he is just another Elf. Buddy as he is known has now reached the age that Papa Elf believes he should know the truth, especially considering that Buddy has a real father, alive and well who didn't even know he existed. Buddy is excited about making his way to New York City to meet his real father. He travels from the safe land of The North Pole where he knows and understands everything into the brutal modern world of New York City. Buddy sticks out like a sore thumb, and not just because of his green elf costume he insists on wearing but his politeness, his fascination with the simple annoyances of life, and his insistence that he is truly an elf from the North Pole. He finally tracks down his real father, Walter, a big time children's book publicist who spends more time working than with his wife and other son. Buddy tries to explain that he is Walter's son but Walter has him removed from the building. After being kicked out Buddy meets a friend in Jovie, a rather down on her luck Gimble's worker who plays an Elf for the Christmas season. Although first rather nervous about Buddy she begins to warm up to his childlike innocence. Buddy continues to do all he can to get back to see his Dad and eventually with a blood test Walter discovers this rather imbalanced man is indeed his son. Walter's wife Emily insists that Buddy stay with him. Buddy does everything he can to spread Christmas cheer and turn everything more ""Christmas-y"" wherever he goes. Unfortunately his ignorance to the real world infuriates Walter and he just wants Buddy to go away but both his wife and other son have become very attached to Buddy. Buddy tries his hand at working with Walter, which causes disaster, and eventually Buddy finds himself all alone until Santa has a bit of a disaster himself and crashes the sleigh into Central Park. The sleigh won't fly because their is no Christmas spirit left. Fortunately Buddy has touched enough people's lives for Jovie and Emily and Michael to bring Christmas spirit back for everyone including Walter who finally realizes what is important. Buddy will save Christmas for everyone!! <br/><br/>Buddy is a great Christmas character. His naivety and ignorance is funny but touching and cute. Ferrell actually does manage to pull that off thank goodness. Although I don't know if they make Buddy pure enough that it actually comes across that he is touching these people's lives. The real laughs are with the physical comedy in the film, mostly entirely done by Ferrell but it's very funny. James Caan is so out of place and yet so perfect for the role of Walter. He fits in but doesn't at all which is kind of strange. Bob Newhart as the narrator and Papa Elf is also a great little cameo. And the great Ed Asner as bit rough around the edges but very caring Santa is also great. Zooey Deschanel as Buddy's love interest Jovie is a good choice. Although at first she doesn't seem like the right pick they actually have decent chemistry and she plays her role with a lot of depth for the short time she gets. Director Jon Favreau does a good job of creating something I actually compared to the amazing classic Miracle on 34th Street. Much of this film reminded me of a more updated modern version of that film which is a great honor. While I don't think Elf has the staying power it's still a cute little Christmas film with a tolerable Will Ferrell and a good family film. Pick it up this Christmas or even if you just feel like being in the Christmas Spirit. 8.5/10"

","Elf (2003): Dir: Jon Favreau / Cast: Will Ferrell, James Caan, Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, Bob Newhart: The story of little people doing big things, or in this case big people doing even bigger things. Will Ferrell stars as Buddy who crawled into Santa's sack upon his visit to the orphanage. He is raised at the North Pole where cheer and good will are the norm. When he learns that he is human he treks to New York to reunite with his human family. His father works in publishing and sees Buddy as a lunatic. He eventually lands a job in a toy store where a young lady with a winning singing voice catches his heart. Neat concept and funny situations and a conclusion where Buddy obtains the best of both worlds. Directed by Jon Favreau who previously made a very different film called Swingers. This time he aims for a different audience. He is backed by Ferrell with outrageous bursts of enthusiasm in an overgrown elf costume that is appropriately out of place. James Caan makes a great foil as his father. Zooey Deschanel is pleasant but as a female shop worker she is a predictable romantic prop. The biggest disappointment is Mary Steenburgen who is limited as Caan's wife. Bob Newhart narrates the film as Buddy's parental elf, which adds that fable like affect to its presentation. Hilarious Christmas comedy taking the elf theme to new heights. Score: 9 ½ / 10"

","I feel torn. On one hand, this was an extremely well-done movie. Very entertaining. Funny. Cute. Captured all of the elements one might require in a Christmas movie. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I felt it was a little too cloying and saccharine. There were some very entertaining moments and good scenes, but it's obvious this movie was made for the whole family (which is fine) and, in the end, it didn't feel like a great movie. It felt like a good movie. You have to be ready to stomach the shmaltz, mind you (and there is a lot). <br/><br/>I'm torn between rating it 6 or 7. Why? Because on one hand, the shmaltzy elements alienated me a bit from the film but on the other hand, the movie has heart and is essentially a feel-good Christmas movie with all the fixins. And, I don't want to come across like a Scrooge. <br/><br/>It was well-filmed. Zooey looked beautiful. It was funny in a broad sort of way. James Caan isn't as badass or mean as you originally think, and in the end, he seems rather likable. <br/><br/>My complaint is that the movie could have more edge. Maybe it's because I spent the last few days watching really good thrillers, but I felt like this movie could have had a darker dark side. For me, it would have enriched the experience. <br/><br/>As it stands now, it's sweet, fun, harmless and stands alone as a rather storybook Christmas fairytale that can appeal to a huge demographic. But heed this warning: There are a large share of Christmas songs, and several shmaltzy moments. <br/><br/>Add this to your Christmas movie list. It's worth it. It ain't the best, but it's a well put together little tale with enough funny moments to make the experience worthwhile. <br/><br/>And a heckuva lot of Christmas spirit. Cheesy and cloying at times, but still... it's there. Enjoy it."

","Elf isn't a perfect Christmas movie, but it was sweet and charming with a great cast. The script can be a little too fluffy and unfocused sometimes though, while the pace occasionally lags and some jokes such as Buddy eating the sweets felt forced. However, it does look terrific, with the locations striking and the cinematography very nice. The soundtrack is a nice addition too, it made me nostalgic and all the more ready for Christmas. The story while simple and a tad predictable is at least original and well-meaning, while the direction is credible. The cast is what gives Elf its staying power and charm. Although I am not a fan of Will Ferrell, I think he really shone here as Buddy, while Zooey Deschannel is beautiful and a huge part of the film's charm, James Caan is a suitably gruff father-like figure and Bob Newhart is wonderful. All in all, it is a sweet film if you forgive the slightly cliché ending, by all means not for all but the cast do save the day. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

Will Ferrell as an elf, taking the lead role, I'm not really sure how he pulled it off, but it works brilliantly here. Elf is by far my favorite Will movie. It brings on family fun, and keeps the profanity on the back burner ( except for a few innuendos that should fly over little ones heads, so no worries there) What are you waiting for?

","To start off, Elf is not in the same category as A Christmas Story or A Christmas Carol. It is not even as good as Miracle on 34th Street, which had much better acting and dialogue. That being said, for the current generation of moviegoers, who are easily satisfied with whatever is served up to them as long as it has great production values (and this film has), Elf will more than fill the bill. I am a big fan of Will Farrell, and he does a great job of containing himself (something difficult for him to do) and not running amok with sexual innuendo (something that is totally lacking in the film; and rightfully so). I thought the casting of Caan was odd, but the rest of the cast seem to be mailing it in, anyway. Who can share a scene with Will Farrell and survive? Good film for the kids around Xmas."

","Like most people around the holidays, I'm usually up for a watching (or re-watching) of the great holiday classics (""Wonderful Life"", ""Home Alone"", etc.). For whatever reason, however, it took me until 2016 to actually sit down and watch ""Elf"" all the way through. While maybe not jumping up to the top of my ""all-time Christmas list"", I did find Elf to be an enjoyable romp.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Buddy (Ferrell), a human boy raised in the North Pole due to a mix-up with Santa Claus (Ed Asner). For most of his life, Buddy believes he is an actual elf, until realizing his shortcomings in that community. As such, he decides to strike out for the ""human world"" in order to find his real father (James Caan). Along the way, Buddy (as a result of his endearing cheerfulness) brings a bit of Christmas spirit to all those around him that are in dire need of it, including a young retail worker named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).<br/><br/>To me, ""Elf"" is primarily a success because of the iconic character that Ferrell creates. The script/plot itself is about as irrelevant and corny as they come, but Ferrell's quirky energy steals every single scene. Quotes like ""You sit on a throne of lies"", ""Bye buddy, hope you find your Dad!"", and ""Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?"" will forever be burned into my memory! I don't think there is an actor out there who could have played Buddy as perfectly as Ferrell.<br/><br/>Simply put, I'm glad I finally sat down and watched ""Elf"" from beginning to end. I don't know if it will get watched religiously every Christmas in my home (time will tell on that one...but maybe it will grow on me even more!), but I can tell you that I will be quoting it going forward!"

","A great excuse for Will Ferrell to run around in holiday garb, drawing sidelong glances from the sidewalk-strollers of Manhattan. Ferrell is the ultimate man-child, a six-and-a-half foot mess of arms and legs in green tights, buckled shoes and a pointy hat, matching the elvish wardrobe of 1964's Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. As physical comedy and ridiculous enthusiasm is his forte, Elf makes for an excellent vehicle, but it's also loaded with a swath of supporting talent (admittedly, another of the comedian's calling cards). Zooey Deschanel (somewhat unrecognizable in blonde hair) is a good fit as his skeptical, frayed love interest, but the best work comes from James Caan, Peter Dinklage, Amy Sedaris, Andy Richter, Kyle Gass and especially Bob Newhart as his sweet, yet long-suffering, adoptive father on the North Pole. Genuinely funny, warm, sugary and spirited; an unexpectedly effective successor to the Christmas classics it seemingly sets out to roast. Worth adding to the annual rotation."

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","8","2","2","15 December 2015"," Hilarious Christmas fun
","Jon Favreau's Elf is as snappy as holiday comedies come, mainly thanks to Will Ferrell's pretty damn hilarious performance as Buddy, a human baby stranded in the north pole and raised by pint sized elves as one of their own. Ferrell can be overbearing at times with his often hard to swallow brand of abrasive humour, but there's always moments where he reigns it in, sticks to the script and gives us magic. I think that this being a family film dictates that he especially needs to play it close to the chest and gives him a comedic track to run on without derailing into the desperate realm of cringy improv and sticking to the screenplay's wonderful jist, and not smothering it in ego and comedic decadence. It's a wonderfully sweet script as well, seeing Buddy travel from the north pole to bustling Manhatten to locate his long lost human family. His cranky birth father (craggy, immortalized James Caan) wallows in lukewarm disbelief as Buddy follows him everywhere, including back home to spend time with bis wife (Mary Steenburgen) and kids. He sorta kinda finds work in a mall due to his inherent elf-ness and gets himself into all kinds of trouble, until he catches the eye of a hired elf played by adorable Zooey Deschanel, who's got herself a case of the Christmas blues. Ferrell's upbeat, manic tone combined with Zooey's dry, laconic yet amused personality makes for perfect chemistry, especially in their odd, compelling rendition of 'Baby its cold outside'. Buddy blunders his way from one austere NYC situation to the next with shiny naivety and blind, trusting optimism to hysterical payoff, a dynamic which sits at the core of what's made the film so successful over the years. The only bad note for me is a terrifying animated version of the north pole that looks like Wallace and Gromit got drunk on rum and eggnog and dreamt some creepy version of Santa's homestead, complete with eerie talking seals. Director Favreau participates in a cameo as Caan's family doctor, Edward Asner shows up as a jolly enough Santa, and Bob Newhart steals many laughs as Buddy's awkward surrogate elf father."

","I saw it last night at a Christmas party and found it enjoyable. But despite its Christmas theme, it was really intended to entertain adults rather than children.<br/><br/>There was no profanity, graphic violence, and sexuality was limited to seeing the head and shoulders of a woman in the shower. But much of the humor would fly against most children's' heads. The basic story is about a human baby in an orphanage who crawled into Santa Claus's toy sack and ends up at the North Pole, being raised by an elf there. Buddy, as he is named, does not fit in as he is a giant compared to the elves, and Santa allows him to go to New York City to meet his biological father-who happens to be on Santa's naughty list for being too devoted to his career to pay attention to his family. Buddy meets his father, who disbelieves him at first, and he goes to the Gimbel's department store where he is mistaken as an employee and is put to work. Buddy inadvertently causes trouble there, and when he reunites with his father who finally discovers that Buddy was the son he never knew existed, he inadvertently brings trouble to his new family too.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the ""fish out of water"" trope, and Buddy is naive but not necessarily stupid. The ending is happy if predictable, and it works as adult Christmas entertainment. The actors work well in their respective parts too and Ed Asner makes a surprisingly effective Santa.

"zack-nichols13","8","2","2","7 December 2012"," Elf Review
","Elf, a movie directed by Jon Favreau features Buddy The Elf (Will Ferrel) as a human who was adopted by Santa Clause and his Elves at birth. His massive size has always hindered his elf-like talents but he is accepted by them none the less. When Buddy learns of his biological father (James Caan) being on the Naughty List, he is sent to New York city on his quest to regain his father's compassion. The film plot and storyline are somewhat predictable, but in an endearing way. Ferrell does a great job of really taking on a character with a ton of different quirks that a lot of actors would not take on as well as he did. His love interest in the movie, Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) is somewhat of a weak point acting-wise in the cinematic adventure. Her monotone voice does little for the vibrant aura of the surrounding actors and she has little to no relevance to the plot or events that take place during Buddy's antics. Overall, the movie is a great family film but also is a movie that is great for all ages. It has elements that appeal to a large variety of demographics and is slowly becoming a holiday classic that can be viewed on television multiple times during the season. OVERALL RATING: 8.5/10"
"MistyNoble1987","8","2","2","2 December 2012"," Good, Clean, Classic Christmas movie!
","Anybody who knows me knows I'm hard on Will Ferrell. However, after seeing this movie I have Ferrell fever! Ferrell proved himself worthy of the comedic giant status he has earned by portraying the naive over-sized ""Elf (human)"" named Buddy, a human adopted by an elf who is raised in the North Pole and somewhat reeks havoc on the elf community with just his sheer size. After having a talk with his father, he embarks on the mission of a lifetime to find out who Buddy the Elf truly is! Being fueled with nothing but sugar and a pure adrenaline rush, Buddy ends up lost in the big apple, unintentionally reeking havoc along the way, finding someone who graciously opens his home to Buddy only to have the door slammed right in his sweet little elf face after good intentions turn into bad reality. Along the adventure he proves to every stuffed shirt stuck up businessman the true Christmas spirit lies within your heart, and Santa Clause really does exist and is fueled by the pure joy of Christmas. This movie has become a staple in our yearly Christmas line up. Kudos to Ferrell for making a family friendly comedy unlike some of the other great actors that have come from SNL."
"StevePulaski","8","2","2","18 December 2011"," A rarity for the holidays and for Ferrell
","Elf has the premise and the look of a badly made Christmas special made solely for network TV. Going into this with mediocre expectations, it only took about ten minutes of seeing Will Ferrell in an elf costume to know that my predictions were dreadfully wrong. This wasn't a case of holiday dreck, but a case of the Christmas film that combined heart, soul, wit, and laughs into a beautiful holiday parable.<br/><br/>The story is about Buddy the Elf (Ferrell) who accidentally crawled into Santa's sack at the orphanage when he was an infant and gets taken back to the North Pole. Santa Claus and the elves choose to raise him and train him to become an elf. Buddy is of course a human so he grows a lot faster than the average elf. In fact, he towers over every other elf he works with, and this leads to problems when he is older.<br/><br/>Buddy then learns he is a human, which causes confusion and sadness. It is told that he was placed in that orphanage as an infant because his father fell in love with a woman who gave birth to him then gave him up unbeknownst to him. Buddy then decides he will go to New York City to try and find his dad and reconnect with him.<br/><br/>His goal is to also spread Christmas cheer far and wide because Santa's sleigh is almost forced to operate with an engine. In the olden days, Santa's sleigh could fly because of mass amounts of Christmas spirit and children believing in Santa Claus. Now, he has to resort to heavy machinery to do that job.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell hasn't sat right with me for the longest time, but as I see more of his movies I begin to like the guy in a sense where I'd like to see him do one of two movies; (a) heartfelt children's' films or (2) very serious dramas in the vein of his 2011 film Everything Must Go. He doesn't have the talents to pull off incredibly funny slapstick because his schtick is usually composed of running around like a towering dork or just screaming. Elf shows his ability to incorporate his persona in a character you can't help but love.<br/><br/>We also see Zooey Deschannel, one of my favorite females in the business today, as Jovie, a woman who works at a mall as Santa's little helpers. Buddy falls for Jovie in a sort of non-conventional way, but he winds up getting conventional help from his younger brother Michael (Tay).<br/><br/>Elf is more than holiday fluff, it's a successful romp of Christmas spirit sealed inside a good family film. The cast is lively, the antics aren't over the top, and the storyline unique and film sustainable. This also shows immensely that director Jon Favreau can be handed a script for a thriller, a comedy, a romantic comedy, a superhero film, or a drama and still be able to create on screen magic. I'm also sure this beats a movie about elves working in a tree during the dry season.<br/><br/>Starring: Will Ferrell, James Cann, Zooey Deschannel, and Daniel Tay. Directed by: Jon Favreau."
"Polaris_DiB","6","2","2","11 August 2011"," Maintains its gift of charm.
","I actually was not all that remiss to seeing this, Jon Favreau is one of my favorite filmmakers working in Hollywood today. Zathura is Where the Wild Things Are without the cerebralness or Karen O, I am of the camp that considers Iron Man and its sequel to be both living up to and counterbalancing Nolan's machismo brooding tale of The Dark Knight, Cowboys vs. Aliens promises to be geeky fanboy action in CGI awesomeness about in a blender with some actual plot and characters.<br/><br/>I find Will Ferrell insufferable when he yells.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is like Jim Carrey. People like him mugging, mocking, yelling, contorting his face, and generally just being a big child, when homeboy could actually continue to keep making awesome stuff like Stranger than Fiction (or in Carrey's case, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind). For whatever reason, actually having a character is animus to an audience that just wants a clown banging his head against a wall. I'm sorry, Will Ferrell. You deserve better than that.<br/><br/>So anyway, this movie is a modern classic for the Yuletide Time and for what it's worth, I can definitely see why. Buddy's absolute belief in Christmas cheer and his grinning dedication to spreading it is infectious, in its own way. It helps that the cynicism of the other characters actually works out sensibly. The movie still has to have its regrettable prolonged burp jokes, but it's nice to see things like random-taxi-hits-lead turn into actual character development as Buddy progressively gets a handle of this strange New York reality world he's found himself in and starts to adapt to its landscape... but all without losing his spiritedness. I can get behind that.<br/><br/>Could be better. It did feel like just a few scenes were missing in the love subplot between Buddy and Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).<br/><br/>What won me over in this movie was the North Pole land and the CGI references to old stop-motion animation Christmas movies of the past. Leon the Snowman is where it's at. Also, not only is Peter Dinklage an underrated actor, but his work in this movie shows he could do some really remarkable stuff if we'd all get over the ""But it's funny 'cause he's a little person"" aspect of it. Compare his role here (oh so woefully, woefully short, oh so scene-stealing) to his work in The Station Agent and then his work in Death at a Funeral (the, uh, British one, not the redundant and confusingly way too soon after remade one) and this man has a gift.<br/><br/>So what the hey, seal of approval for this one. Going back to Favreau, I can't emphasize enough he knows how to keep a movie moving and never outstays his welcome, Elf moves at a brisk pace and is over before you know it, whether you like it or not. Now that audiences are actually getting comfortable watching giant robot movies for two and a half hours or more, the art of moving along, one of Hollywood's major entertainment assets, sometimes feels like it's getting lost.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","Elf is the story of a human named Buddy who was raised by elves in the North Pole at Santa's Workshop. When Buddy becomes an adult, he is told that he was adopted so he goes on a quest to find his father in New York City.<br/><br/>This movie is hilarious. Will Ferrell is perfect for the role of buddy! He really portrays the character's sweetness with a comedic touch. One of the reasons I love this film so much is that it really captures what it would be like to take someone who has lived in fantasy land and throw them into the hustle and bustle of the big city. There are several montages throughout the film. My favorite would have to be when Buddy comes to New York for the first time because he does such bizarre things. If I were to see him eating the gum of the hand rail or playing in a revolving door in my town, I would think he was crazy! I end up feeling bad for Buddy because he is so clueless to how the real world works.<br/><br/>Another thing that makes this movie so hysterical is that in the North Pole the props, costumes, sets and back drop are so elementary and simple, it really accentuates the innocence and comical quality of the elf world. Also, in the North Pole, there are some animals made of clay animation. Their design is very similar to the old Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer movie, and that warms my heart and makes me laugh.<br/><br/>This movie is perfect for family night, watching with friends or when you just need a laugh. This story is touching yet funny as Buddy goes on an amazing journey to get closer to his father's heart and bring back holiday spirit to all. This is a great film for all ages because it contains the fun innocence of an elf that children can enjoy and it also has a bit of adult humor for the older viewers. Although young children will love this movie, I think ages 7 and younger should watch this with an adult or older child because they may get slightly confused or frightened. Over all, this is a wonderful film, whether it's the holidays or not.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Raven Devanney, age 13, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic"

","With Christmas just having finished,I've decided to take a little bit of a break from watching two of my favourite Christmas films (Bob Clarks definitive Xmas film-A Christmas Story and the surprisingly strong Muppets Christmas Carol.)and to try out something that I had been looking forward to seeing for the last few weeks.<br/><br/>With a surprisingly strong cast,a charming screenplay and a huge dollop of charm,the movie is something that can easily keep kids and adults very entertained over the holiday period.<br/><br/>The plot: <br/><br/>When Santa returns to his factory, from having dropped off all the presents.He makes a shocking discovery,that a baby has gotten into one of the sacks.Santa decides that the best thing to do is to let one of his chief elf's-Papa Elf raise the baby(whose named Buddy).Due to being raised by elves, overtime Buddy starts to believe that he really is an elf.Sadly one day at the factory,Buddy hears some of the other elves saying that they can not believe,that he does not realise that he is a human!<br/><br/>After hearing this,he tells Papa Elf that he wants to go and meet his real father(who does not know that Buddy has even been born).After hearing all of this,Buddy becomes very determined to give his dad the best Christmas ever.Though due to his dad now being too stuck into his job,Buddy has a huge mountain to climb,to get his dad to join in the spirit of Christmas. <br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Though the scenes where Will Ferrall is stuffing his face full of sweets,made me cringe (and not in the way that the film makers were hoping for)due to how forced the joke felt.Surprisingly,Ferrall makes Buddy stand out from all of his other fantastic characters,by removing any sense that Buddy has a very inflated-ego.and replacing it with a very natural sweet (though not sugar-coated) personality.Ferrall is given huge support,by a shining performance from Zooey Deschanel as the wonderfully punk style Jovie.Deschanel impressively shows Jovie going from being very agitated,to finding Buddy completely irresistible in a very enjoyable way.<br/><br/>Whilst the screenplay by David Berenbaum,could be seen as a very broad up date of A Christmas Carol (with Buddys dad having to learn the true meaning of Christmas)Berenbaum thankfully,gives most of the traditional Xmas set pieces for films,a fun modern trust (such as having the elves make modern plastic toys)Smartly David makes sure that the story is always the heart of the film,and that you are always following Buddy,and hoping to see his dad accept him for what he is...<br/><br/>Final view on the film:<br/><br/>A great film for the whole fame,with a stunning cast and a heart-warming story."
"Sasha_5","6","2","2","25 September 2008"," Will Ferrell is my favorite 'Elf'!
","'Elf' is probably one of my favorite Christmas films for its funny and sweet and original and did I mention funny yet? I love Will Ferrell and so maybe I'm a bit bias when giving this such a high rating, but I can't help it. I watch this movie quite a bit and every time I'm reminded of why I love it. The story is about a young orphan who ends up a stow-away one Christmas when he slips out of his crib and slips into Santa's big bag of toys. When Santa finds out he has a new guest he leaves baby duty up to one of the older elves (Bob Newhart) who never found love and thus never was able to have the children he wanted so badly. When Buddy (Ferrell) gets older though he soon realizes he's not like the other elves and this sends him on a journey to find his real parents. This journey leads him to Walter (James Caan), his father, a man who horrifically lands on Santa's 'bad list' year after year. The fact that Santa is all but not believed in make it difficult for anyone, including his own father, to believe Buddy, but the viewer is moved to love him more and more with each passing frame. This is a perfect role for Will, allowing him to tone down his over the top antics (I love those too) and give us a more family friendly performance that's as funny as it is charming. As Buddy strives to gain his fathers love and affection he must also try and resurrect the Christmas Spirit that so many have lost. With great supporting performances by Zooey Deshanel and Mary Steenburgen, 'Elf' is a delightful holiday film that is sure to please the whole family!"

","Will Farrell has done better films than this one but this is a warm feel good holiday film. When you look at it as a whole film, it holds a certain charm. That charm is established by framing the story around belief in the fantasy known as Christmas.<br/><br/>This is the most extensive work done by Bob Newhart since the 1990's. Bob is the framework that holds this story together. Ed Asner has a very small role as Santa & is just here enough to be recognizable having little chance to do much acting.<br/><br/>Brunette bomb shell Zooey Deschannel is charming as a blonde & proves she can sing. Hopefully she will get some better roles as her young career has proved she can handle them. In this movie, she makes the viewer buy that young innocent charm as she glows here.<br/><br/>Faizon Love is excellent in support as the Gimbles store manager. James Caan is OK here, less annoying than in some films, but for some reason he does not seem to get really good roles anymore.<br/><br/>There are some gross holiday bits, like downing a 2 liter Coke & a 5 minute belch which is entirely logical, and then some bits which are funny physical comedy. Farrell does not carry the whole show here and that is a good thing. While he is considered the star of his films, his films are better when the support can carry them. His easily worst film is Bewitched where he tried to carry the entire film & flopped badly.<br/><br/>This doesn't measure up to classic holiday films but is better than some of the lame efforts of recent years."
"raypdaley182","6","2","2","5 December 2007"," better than most of Ferrel's films
","I'll start by saying I can't personally stand Will Ferrel and usually don't like his movies. I don't find him funny and I don't normally find any humour or anything to laugh at in his films.<br/><br/>This is a rare exception. It's a Christmas movie and I'm reviewing it having seen it on TV at the weekend.<br/><br/>This movie is in the same kind of genre as Dudley Moore's ""The Santa Clause Movie"" and Tim Allen's ""The Santa Clause"". Ferrel plays Buddy, a baby who crawls into Santa's sack one year when he's delivering gifts to an orphanage. Sadly the film derails itself right there as a baby manages to open a locked cot and fall safely from 2 feet up without making a sound.<br/><br/>Ignoring that (and we must, unfortunately) the baby is only discovered when Santa returns to the North Pole workshop and is adopted and raised as an Elf. Eventually he discovers he is human and sets off to discover his real father (James Caan, not suited to comedy or kids films which this is really).<br/><br/>The film follows Buddy as he tries to fit into Human culture and how badly he is suited to that task having been raised in the Elf culture. The film is decent enough and is greatly improved by Buddy's love interest Zooey Deschanel (who I only knew from the Hitch Hikers Move and had the feeling that Reese Witherspoon turned this role down).<br/><br/>She looks great and plays her role well enough. James Caan has some good moments but really isn't suited to this type of movie.<br/><br/>The locations and sets are very good, there's a small appearance from KG (of Tenacious D fame) as a creative writer and the role of Caan's wife (Mary Steenburgen) could have been cast a lot better as she really isn't suited to this type of film either so both her and James Caan were very badly miscast.<br/><br/>The film is mildly bearable with the brain disengaged, even Ferrel manages to not annoy for a change.<br/><br/>OK for kids."

Two thumbs up for his first big project movie. <br/><br/>maybe there's one thing to criticize that the love between Buddy and his father it was showed too cliché and it was too easy to solve it.

While I watched this movie I found myself wishing I could be as carefree and innocent as the character Buddy is in this movie. Granted he didn't know any better, but that's part of the humor.

It was nice to see Will Ferrell in a role where his character didn't have these ridiculous scenes where he overplays to make it hilarious and just misses the spot. The funnier scenes were well played out by Will and fit the character of Buddy the Elf.<br/><br/>Sounds like my impressions of the film doesn't coincide with my rating of it, but it was a perfectly fine Christmassy flick that left me with a smile.

"sara-ropson","10","5","8","18 November 2012"," The Perfect Holiday Movie for All Ages!
","Will Ferrell stars in this Christmas comedy known as Elf. Buddy lives his whole life as a misfit Elf helping out Santa in the North Pole. One day Buddy, who is taller and clumsier then the other Elves, realizes he is not a real Elf and decides to go out and search for his real dad. Only knowing how his life was back at the North Pole it was a huge change in his life when Buddy traveled to the big city of New York. His journey is conveyed by hilarious humor when Papa Elf has to explain to Buddy that the, ""yellow snow was not for eating and the gum under the railings was not free candy."" This movie contains comedy and romance and is good for all ages! I give this movie 10 stars because it is trying to show the loving relationship between Buddy and his father. The movie was successful in trying to bring out the kid in everyone by using jokes that are funny no matter how old you are. Hidden beneath all of the comedy was a lesson in which although someone like Buddy may be unique, they still can fit in and belong somewhere in the world.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is absolutely very funny in this movie. The way he can act like a kid is phenomenal. No other actor could have made Buddy the Elf come to life and walk us through his journey as a misfit, sheltered Elf at the North Pole, through his many adventures searching for his dad in in the big city. With Will Ferrell's other movies such as Step Brothers and Talladega Nights, his role in Elf is a different side of him most people have never seen. In this movie he falls in love and develops a relationship with his brother that is unlike any other. Being 30 years old and dressing in an elf costume everywhere he goes is only a little part of this movie that makes it so funny. Being used to wearing his outfit around the North Pole, it was hard for Buddy to understand that his costume was not appropriate for the work life.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing it with children because they will not stop laughing. Buddy, ""traveled through the candy cane forest"" This is just some of what he says to capture everyone's imagination. Not only is the movie extremely funny but it is the perfect movie for the holiday time. I enjoyed this movie with my family because in the movie the actors develop multiple relationships. This can show people that someone can replenish a relationship that was once lost. To me this movie is trying to convey to the audience that with all of this comedy, there is something deeper. Buddy is trying to build a relationship with his father and get to know his brother. Along the way of finding this, he stumbles across a woman in the department store where she is one of ""Santa's helpers,"" who he falls in love with. His weird role is enhanced when he does not know how to ask her out on a date.<br/><br/>This movie is worth seeing. An adventure, a love story and Santa Clause all mixed together in a delightful holiday treat. Will Ferrell helps make this a movie that is sure to be enjoyed with you family each Christmas."

Favreau squeezes every funny ounce out of putting Ferrell in small spaces and the guy really is an endearing spaz.

There are some questionable times in the movie where Will Ferrell comes off as a bit sarcastic, not really living up to the elf he's playing, but this should probably go over young children's heads. There are so many great lives in the movie...it may have only been released about 15 years ago, but it's certainly without a doubt a classic, and Will Ferrell is at his best.

Who knows if director Jon Favreau, who also has a cameo role, punched-up debut writer David Berenbaum's script, but it is delightful.<br/><br/>Zooey Deschanel is a sweetheart, while James Caan and Mary Steenburgen just pretty much get to reprise their TV roles, in, respectively, ""Las Vegas"" and ""Joan of Arcadia.""<br/><br/>The visual references to other movies are amusing, from the Disney-like animation at the North Pole to treating the Urban Park Rangers like the Dark Riders from ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.""<br/><br/>The holiday song selections are mostly classic, though it's nice to hear new Leon Redbone interpretations on two tracks.<br/><br/>(originally written 1/19/2004)"
"slokes","5","4","7","7 September 2016"," Needed More Time In The Workshop
","Can a real Christmas movie get made in our cynical, charm-free 21st century? Probably not, if ""Elf"" is the best stab at it so far.<br/><br/>Up in the North Pole, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell) discovers he isn't an elf at all, but a displaced human orphan who found his way into Santa's bag at the end of a busy Christmas and was then raised in Santa's workshop. He undertakes to reconnect with his biological father, Walter Hobbs (James Caan), a gruff Manhattan executive who has found his way on Santa's naughty list.<br/><br/>Odd to step back in time and see Will Ferrell in this early starring role, playing so resolutely to PG sensibilities that he almost seems made of gingerbread. Unless you own Keebler stock or have an aversion to watching spaghetti being eaten with maple syrup, there's little here to offend you.<br/><br/>Alas, ""Elf"" is a film that thinks it's way cuter than it actually is. The idea of hearkening back to the stop-action TV Christmas shows I grew up with back in the 1970s is pleasant enough, and so is seeing NYC all dolled up for the holidays. But the story is a one-joke premise stretched well past its limit: Ferrell doing his man-child thing wearing an elf suit in the big city.<br/><br/>One sequence demonstrates for me the limited nature of the film. In it, a children's book author played by another future big star, Peter Dinklage, comes to Caan's publishing house office to help concept an idea. Buddy spots him and immediately calls to him as a fellow elf, thus sparking a WWF rumble in the conference room.<br/><br/>Sure, Dinklage is a little person and so the joke gets a bit of a laugh, but not anything to build deeper humor from. Why not, since we know Buddy is an overgrown kid, move past that and have the two get into a spirited disagreement about kiddie fiction, or what weather conditions are like on the North Pole? Instead, it's a short joke, some mayhem, and then cue the next scene.<br/><br/>The film has a lot of go-nowhere moments like that, whether it's Buddy getting mistaken for a store employee at Gimbel's or Buddy's stop-motion pals on the North Pole. Caan deserves credit for playing his part with a deft lightness I wasn't expecting, and indeed most of the supporting work is fun. I especially enjoyed Bob Newhart as an especially sedate elf who looks after Buddy.<br/><br/>There are also some funny bits for fans of Ferrell's wilder roles. Watching Buddy get into it with a department-store Santa (Artie Lange) who he accuses of being a fraud (""You sit on a throne of lies!"") is good for a few laughs, even if it devolves into another rumble. Zooey Deschanel is sweet as Buddy's left-field romantic interest, and the ending actually manages to be rousing, shot as it was literally in the ashes of 9/11.<br/><br/>But manipulation is kind of at the heart of this film, both when it's working and when it's not. For all his evident good taste and desire to please, director Jon Favreau seems at a loss when it comes to finding that next gear and giving ""Elf"" a sense of wonder or of mission. It's pleasant and light, and often amusing, but still leaves you with the feeling of a misfit toy."

","As a baby, Buddy {Will Ferrell} crept out of his crib in the orphanage right into Santa's goody bag. Thus he grows up at the North Pole working with the elves in Santa's work shop. Now firmly grown up physically, Buddy is shocked to learn that he is a human being, not an elf. So upon hearing that his father lives in New York, he sets off to find him. But can he survive New York? More to the point, can New York survive Buddy?<br/><br/>Like him or loathe him, Will Ferrell has a nice line in physical comedy. So with that, Elf is the perfect vehicle to showcase his exuberance. But with that also comes the problem with the film. For it feels {actually it is} like director John Favreau and writer David Berenbaum have plopped Ferrell into a fish out of water scenario and stitched together a number of sketches for him to run thru. The outcome of which may induce some amiable comedy along the way, but renders the finale a weak attempt at holiday message emotion. The supporting cast also suffer in the wake of Ferrell's domination. Something that annoys when you consider we have the likes of James Caan and Mary Steenburgen trying to breathe on the sidelines.<br/><br/>There's enough here to make it a safe holiday viewing for the kids and those adults who have a penchant for Ferrell's comedy.

","When I first saw the advertisements and previews for 'Elf', I thought that it looked like one of the dumbest films ever to be shown in cinemas. I thought: 'why would anyone want to see that stupid-looking film with that stupid-looking elf in pretty yellow tights and a green suit'? But, people saw it; some people I know saw it, and they said it was good, and I had to ask them if they were getting therapy. Well, anyway, I was wrong about the film. It has not been the first time, and it probably won't be the last. Whilst flying in the air, the airline showed this film, and I caught the later three-fourths (and watched the entire film shortly afterward). I *actually* thought that the film was funny - not just funny, but it was hilarious in some places. I can even still remember some of the events that made me laugh, but I won't post them here and spoil them, and some of them have to be seen to be appreciated.<br/><br/>Now, this is not a great film, so don't expect it to be a flawless masterpiece. Just expect to get a couple hours of laughter and a semi-touching story about an innocent and naive elf misplaced in the city. I recommend that you see it this holiday season. It will make you laugh and put you in the Christmas spirit - er, elf."

","The film is something quite intriguing with a very unique plotline; from the beginning it looks to be very promising and, is, in fact, promising. However, it misses a certain something that becomes more apparent throughout the film: after a while the pure immaturity of the Elf slowly begins to wear away on you until the film loses all of the original appeal that it had.<br/><br/>
Nonetheless, the film has some delightfully entertaining and hilarious portions, though overall it leaves much to be desired. The ending drags out painfully and becomes torturingly corny, nothing that is unpredictable about it. <br/><br/>In spite of the ups and downs that one has when watching the film, it can still be called a decent film. There was some very good exercise of comedy and admittedly it is superior to many of the films that have come out, but if you were hoping for anything more than just a slightly entertaining film, you will be disappointed. Aside from the minimal comedy to keep you interested nothing more is offered by the story.<br/><br/>The movie should make you laugh, and the movie is worth seeing, but again, it is far less than the Christmas classic that people are claiming."

","I watched this last night as it was on TV and there was nothing on at all last night so I said since we are reaching the holidays I might as well watch it. The movie is similar to Enchanted in a way(minus the animation)and it tells the story of a man who is raised by Santa's elf's and he goes to NYC to find his biological father who is a writer apparently . Buddy(Ferrell) then meets a girl named Jovie(Zooey Deshnail who is a dead ringer to Katy Perry)and becomes smitten with her.<br/><br/>I may not be a fan of Will Ferrell but I laughed at a few parts to this movie like the part where he is singing the Baby its cold outside song from Tom Jones and the part where he humiliates his father at work by some guy who he called an elf too LOL that was hilarious.<br/><br/>The movie is a bit stupid but I like fish out of water movies as I like how the characters interact with our world and that. I liked some parts to it but the ending was quite dumb. So I am giving it a 6 simply because its nearly Xmas and I like to get into the Holiday season."

None of the other elves act like they fell off the turnip truck.<br/><br/>And I thought the singing of Christmas carols toward the end was so hokie. Couldn't they had come up with a bigger obstacle for Santa to overcome and a more fun way of solving the problem.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Only for kids 11 and under."

","""Elf"" is a pretty cute film--but they're starting to overplay it a bit. Just this Christmas season, it's been on TV 1483857 times (give or take 2). And I worry that being shown so much that folks might have a backlash--might start to hate the film even though it's decent family entertainment and is worth your time.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell stars as 'Buddy'--a STRANGE young man indeed. Apparently, as a baby he was accidentally kidnapped and brought back to the North Pole by Santa. Not knowing what to do with the boy so he gave him to an elf (Bob Newhart) to raise as his own. However, he's a terrible elf. Part of it that he's absolutely too big to live as an elf--and part of it is that he's a bit...well....stupid. Eventually, after not fitting in for a very long time, the elves inform Buddy that they now know who his read father is and Buddy leaves the Pole for New York City to find his dad. Once there, Buddy once again does NOT fit in--and makes a mess of most everything. Can Buddy sort all this out and connect with his dad or will the audience leave the theater feeling depressed and miserable (yeah, right!).<br/><br/>The film has many funny moments (my favorite was when he exposed FAKE Santa to the kids waiting to see him), a few sweet ones and some very clichéd ones--but I can forgive this, as it IS a family comedy and I am not expecting Shakespeare! Well worth seeing....and a bit odd seeing Ed Asner playing Santa!"
"supremekingdan","7","3","5","27 November 2011"," Will Ferrell completely steals every scene
","Although it stands on its own, without the man, as an old-fashioned festive comedy with a good heart, Will Ferrell still completely steals every scene. He completely carries Elf, giving a charming performance with one foot in the spirit of Christmas and the other in cruel reality.<br/><br/>He plays a human named Buddy who is accidentally brought back by Santa (Edward Asner, better known as Carl Fredrickson in the Pixar film Up) from an adoption centre one Christmas. He is then raised by Bob Newhart as a Christmas elf, from childhood until adulthood. Though naturally, being a human means Buddy can stand out from the crowd a teensy bit.<br/><br/>When Buddy discovers he is a human, he sets out to Manhattan to find his natural father (James Caan). Things don't go too well when Caan turns out to be a bit of an arsehole. And from then on it's a father-son story, with a love interest thrown in for good measure and the natural Christmas spirit sprinkled on like sugar through-out.<br/><br/>But unless you're 6 or younger, you'll probably notice that the story doesn't really matter. As stated before, it's all Will Ferrell's movie, and he welcomely never stops chewing the scenery. He's terrifically funny while also never forgetting he's in a Christmas movie. What's great is that we all can tell Ferrell is aware his character is ignorant of the cruel reality of present-day Manhattan (which sets up some very funny routines), and he does the very best he can with the material, in a truly hilarious performance.<br/><br/>As for the other actors, they do their job. None of them really shine, but they all give satisfactory performances, and every one of them generously lets Ferrell steal each scene he's in. The scenes without Ferrell are rather tedious at times (particularly the scenes with Caan working in his office, which are likely to make children fast-forward to Buddy 's next scene), but they keep the story moving along.<br/><br/>The only major complaint is the ending, which for me is far too cheesy. Apart from one amusing send-up of the Patterson-Gimlin Bigfoot film, there are barely any jokes in the third act. It's the bit which revolves around ""pure Christmas spirit"", and this would have been absolutely fine with me if it wasn't such a sudden change of tone for the film. Going from funny comedy to sugary Christmas schmaltz in the space of two minutes is, for me, a bit of a letdown, but the Christmassy feeling is there so it's not a massive complaint.<br/><br/>Overall, Elf is a delightful seasonal comedy which has the Christmas spirit while also benefiting greatly from Ferrell's very funny performance. It may not be brilliant, but with its golden-oldies soundtrack and all-around festive feel, I hope it'll be recognised as a holiday classic in decades to come."

","Jon Favreau has directed a cute and quirky Christmas movie that will leave both children and parents satisfied. A script that could have easily been thought of as too dark and absurd (the absurd moments in the film are one of its many strengths) is pulled together by a man who continues to amaze me in every film he's in: Will Ferrell. Will Ferrell brings an edge of naivete to the character that is so charming and hilarious it makes it incredibly easy to sit through a film about Santa's attempt to regain the Christmas spirit. In the movie Ferrell plays Buddy, a human who grows up to believe that he is actually and overgrown Christmas Elf and eventually finds out that he is adopted.  Buddy sets out on a journey to the wonderful land of New York City to meet his biological father played by James Caan. Injected with many weird and quirky moments (including a cast of claymation animals a la ""Rudolf The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and a group of villains ominously know as ""The Central Park Rangers"") everyone puts in a good amount of charisma. Zooey Deschanel is quite memorable as the love interest with the sultry singing voice and Edward Asner is pitch perfect as a realistically jolly Santa Claus (Faison Love also puts in good performance as the Gimbel's Department store manager). Not a classic by any stretch of the mind Buddy is a great film to take the kids to see. Though I saw this film in a test screening in October I definitely felt the Holiday spirit. Yes, the movie has its syrupy sweet ""Good Lord this is corny!"" moments, but the off the wall bits of comedy balance the storyline out as a whole.Favreau and Ferrell are fully aware of what moments are sterotyped genre dreck and seem to ham it up.<br/><br/>Buddy is worth seeing for Ferrell's performance alone, mixed with both Favreau's sense of humor and direction its stands out amongst the sea of the standard Disneyfied X-mas tales."

Being a couple of sizes bigger then the Elfs that he lived and worked with at the toy factory Buddy felt out of place and with his overly big hands he was clumsy in making toys as perfectly and delicately as your average Elf. Buddy considered himself to be, to the horror of his fellow Elfs, a ""Cotton-Headed Ninny Muffin"". <br/><br/>One day Buddy's dad Papa Elf, Bob Newheart, came clean with the obviously confused Buddy and let the truth come out: Buddy your not an Elf your a Human. Buddy,were told, was left at the steps of an Cathloic Orphanage to be brought up by the Nuns there. One Christman Eve Santa came to town and Buddy slipped into his bag of toys and ended up in the North Pole and was secretly made to think that he's an Elf by Santa Papa Elf and all the Elfs working there. Now with the truth about him and his real dad Walter Hobbs, James Caan, a greedy and unfeeling children's book publisher who's, O' My God, on Santa's naughty list! Buddy crosses the seven levels of the Candy Cane Forest and past the Sea of Twirly Swirly Gumdrops and finally goes through, on foot, the Lincoln Tunnel to the magic city, New York, to finally meet his dad who he never knew up until now. <br/><br/>Looked at as ""Some kind of Nut"" at first Buddy's good and child-like nature, as well as his belief in the Christmas Spirit and Santa Claus, wins over everyone that he meets. From his dad Walter to his step-mom Emily Hobbs and younger brother Michael, Mary Steenburgen & Daniel Tay,as well as Jovie, Zooey Deschanel, the girl who he worked with as an Elf, what else,at Gimbel's Depertment Store. Through Buddy's skills as a toy maker as well as his all around good nature he made believer's of everyone in New York City that there is a Santa as well as a Christmas Spirit. Buddy did it with a little help from his newly found and made friends who at first didn't believe him and even thought that he was just a wee bit mentally unstable. Heartwarming Christmas Movie with Will Ferrell perfect as Buddy the Elf who saved Christmas with James Cann as his grouchy but later Santa believing dad. <br/><br/>Jovie who has a beautiful singing voice but was too stage frighten to sing in front of people, she only could sing in the shower, was so motivated by Buddy's actions to open up her voice in public at New Yorks Central Park, singing a Christmas Carol, where everyone in the park joined in including Buddy's at first apprehensive dad Walter. This gave Santa's sled the power to lift it up above the clouds and fly higher then it did, with the Christmas Spirit that powered Santa's Raindeer driven Sled in everyones singing the Christmas Carol, for years."

It was by no means brilliant - no comedy of this kind could ever be called such - but it was incredibly sweet and adorable. If you are someone who doesn't like cute or silly humor, you will hate this movie. It's the sort of thing that might give you a toothache. But if you like cuteness and silliness - innocent, simple humor - you will love this movie as I did. <br/><br/>Yeah, it's full of all the typical lame Christmas schmaltz and the santa stuff and all that groan-worthy ""christmas spirit"" pap, but I was able to enjoy it anyway, for the same reasons I enjoyed the old puppet rudolph and frosty shows. It's done in a very cute way that makes it palatable. It really made me laugh (in fact, at one point I had an uncontrollable giggle fit over how cute it was) and days later I still think about it every now and then and smile.<br/><br/>Again, not a smart or brilliant movie, but very sweet.<br/><br/>Also, I totally agree with others on this board - that Infinifilm thing is just terrible. I really liked the movie, but if I were going to watch it again I'd want to just watch it - not have these interruptions, and if I were going to watch the special features (which I would have loved to) I'd want to just access them without having to go through the whole film again. JUST TERRIBLE! I was disappointed I didn't get to see the special features but, forget about it!"
"zetes","5","12","34","8 November 2003"," Ferrell tries his best, but the writing is unambitious and mediocre
","So-so film with a few really funny moments. It always seemed like the comedy could have gone two steps further than it did. There are tons of missed opportunities and jokes that are built up without payoff (the news broadcast at the end of the film is a perfect example). Elf earns points for being a decent family film in that it has almost no objectionable content  one very long belch is about it. It's nice that it doesn't resort to gross-out humor, but it could certainly stand to be less lame a lot of the time. Will Ferrell, a former Saturday Night Live actor, stars as a human who is raised by elves until his enormous height compared to the other elves makes this fact all too obvious. When Ferrell finds out that his father (James Caan) lives in New York City, he goes out and finds him. It becomes a standard fish-out-of-water comedy. The writing is half-hearted, so the weight of the movie ends up resting wholly on Ferrell, who does his damndest to carry it on his shoulders. I've always been a fan of Ferrell, even if he did create a couple of truly obnoxious characters on SNL. He actually does a fine job in Elf, playing a truly manic but sweet idiot. The filmmakers should have trusted Ferrell more, because it really shoots itself in the foot when it begins to concentrate on a very cheesy and unbelievable crisis in the elf's newfound human family. Ferrell has run away from home, and Caan and his family think they can find him in New York City  which, of course, they do. And Ferrell (along with his family and his girlfriend) have to convince the people of NYC to have faith in Santa Claus so his sleigh can fly. They do this by having the girlfriend (a very cute Zooey Deschanel, who might look a bit too much like Reese Witherspoon to become a star) sing 'Santa Claus Is Coming to Town' on the news. I was enjoying the film, but this kind of formulaic garbage just ruined it. It's nice to see Bob Newhart, Charles Durning, and Andy Richter. One of my favorite comediennes, Amy Sedaris, was also there somewhere, but I must have missed her (was she one of the elves?). 5/10."

There was nothing amusing in the hour I managed to stay - I couldn't take any more! James Caan looked as if he needed a big dose of ex-lax the entire film. I would not smile either if Ferrell was my son.<br/><br/>Zooey Deschanel going out with Ferrell.

","Review:
'Elf' is a Christmas comedy film directed by Jon Favreau.
Possible one of the funniest Christmas movies to come out of the 21st Century. This is a movie I watch all year round, not just around Christmas time.
The film centers on Buddy (Will Ferrell), a human who was adopted and raised by Santa's elves. He learns about this and heads to New York City to meet his biological father (James Caan) while also spreading Christmas cheer in a world of cynics in the process.
Will Farrell makes his character funny without being annoying to the audience (as he feared he might be from the trailer). James Caan is good but has to work with the scrooge character of the film and thus gets fewer laughs.
It's refreshing to see a story where others are encouraged to rise to the level of the main character instead of him being overwhelmed and dragged down by the majority of society. There is nothing I dislike about this film. It's a perfect family comedy that has the Christmas spirit at it's core.
Overall, the film is very funny in the beginning, and gets more Christmassy as it goes on. The performances are top notch and could have been carried away with the cheesy comedy.
5/5"

I don't know that I watch it every year, but close to it.<br/><br/>I like that it didn't bow to the pressure of being rude or scatalogical in its humor, so that during those moments when it makes me cringe, it isn't from worrying what the child watching with us is seeing that they perhaps shouldn't. I saw plenty of reviewers who gave it one star as the worst movie ever, some wishing they could give it zero stars, and that is fine. I have seen movies and tv shows listed here on IMDB that are called the best ever AND the worst ever by different people. But it would be fun to know the real reason they trash it. I don't think it really offends their sense of artistic expression that much. There is something else at play. But never mind. Suffice to say that I personally rank Elf up there with my favorite holiday movie, A Christmas Story, though for wildly different reasons."

","""Elf"" starring Will Ferrell is seen by many as one of the greatest Christmas comedies in recent times. I, myself, am one of these people. Though it was released in theatres over a decade ago, ""Elf"" remains to be a staple in many Christmastime traditions, telling the story of a elf-human named Buddy as he stumbles through New York in search of his family. I first saw the film when I was about seven years old, having been suggested I watch it with my younger sister by my parents and at the time, I thought it was just about the most hilarious movie I had ever seen. I enjoyed every second of Buddy's shenanigans as did thousands of other children across the nation. 
 Director Jon Favreau also known for producing the ever popular marvel movies which include all three ""Iron Man"" movies and ""The Avengers"" including ""Avengers: Infinity War"", gifts moviegoers everywhere with the amazing story of ""Elf"". There is not a single dull moment throughout the entire film. Already, in the opening seconds of the movie, viewers are presented with a colorful, storybook style introductory credits featuring an adorable cartoon penguin and a first taste of an incredible soundtrack. The movie then begins with an opening shot of an orphanage. Viewers are then taken over to a single crib holding the child who will become the main focus of the movie. Then, only moments later, Santa Claus drops down into the room with his sack of toys, into which, the baby promptly crawls into and stows away back to Santa's workshop. Only until after Santa returns to the North Pole, is the baby noticed, and is taken in by the elves, launching the viewers into the main portion of the film. 
 Buddy, his name given to him by the elves upon his discovery, already appears extremely different from the rest of his elves, and rather humorously at that. He is double the height of his co-workers and is visibly inept at building toys. Will Ferrell proves to be the perfect actor to display this stark contrast. Eventually, Buddy realizes that the reason he is so unlike everyone around him is because he is not even of the same race as them. Viewers are then treated to a truly entertaining realization/flashback sequence of Buddy's severe discomforts with the facilities built for elves, who are rather small, instead of humans. Buddy is reasonably distraught with this revelation, to which he confides in his father figure, Papa Elf. He is then told his true father resides in New York, but unfortunately is on Santa's ""Naughty List"". Buddy then sets off to New York City, in hopes of finding his family and redeeming his father.
 Viewers are presented with yet another incredibly entertaining montage of Buddy's antics as he travels through New York, marveling at various common occurrences in the city ranging from the everyday escalator to the street side trash can. Upon his arrival, Buddy's family is quite skeptical of the thirty year old elf-man who just appeared, maintaining that he is one of them. Despite how they may receive him initially, we are treated to several bonding montages between Buddy and his new brother, Michael, who will then eventually bring his father and mother closer to Buddy. All the while, Buddy makes new friends throughout the city and spreading the message of Christmas Spirit. 
 However, humor isn't all that this movie provides for those who watch it. ""Elf"" also tackles more mature themes including death, struggles in the workplace, and family disputes. Many movies contain both humorous and emotional moments, but few can create a balance between the two resulting in a near-perfect film. However, pure humor and emotion isn't just what makes this film great. As mentioned before, the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and each and every scene is improved significantly with the addition of the movie's incredible background music. I couldn't ask for a more iconic, amazing, Christmas movie than ""Elf"" and I am certain that a great many others feel exactly the same way."
"AvidClimber","7","2","3","4 January 2013"," Elf — A goofy holiday comedy to bring you cheer
","Elf has an interesting premise: a human baby raised by North Pole elves and Santa Claus. The goofy twist to the story fits perfectly with Will Ferrell's acting style. He is just silly enough in a straight and earnest way to make you believe the whole rigamarole.<br/><br/>Every new development in the scenario gives the opportunity for more laughters, and the presentation of new aspects of the elf society.<br/><br/>The acting, editing, and special effects are simple and well crafted, nothing to detract from enjoying the spectacle.<br/><br/>It's a great recommendation if you're looking for Christmas related entertainment."

","So, aside from falling instantly in love with Zooey Deschanel when I first saw Elf way back in 2003, this movie still gets 10 stars from me because each and every year I watch it at least twice... and cry.<br/><br/>It's like watching Tinkerbell come down from atop the Matterhorn at Disneyland, the penultimate scene in Elf. It awakens inside of me memories of youth, innocence and memories of a time when everything was new.<br/><br/>Obviously I am cheesy and weak - but most of the year I am a bitter, aggressive atheist who compares believing in God to believing in Santa.<br/><br/>But not when I watch this movie.<br/><br/>I love the story, Mr. Narwhal, Bob Newhart (a god as true as any!), and Zooey singing. I love James Caan and Mary Steenburgen in this film too!

","You may expect this film to be a little on the kiddie side, but in fact it it is a great family comedy with jokes for all ages. The story is told by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), who tells the story of his son. Basically Santa (Edward Asner) was delivering at an orphanage, and a baby managed to get out his crib and crawl into Santa's sack (to get a toy), and he was brought to the North Pole. Papa raised this boy, he named Buddy, as his own, and as he grew he learnt the elf world as if he was one. But it is after he overhears that he is human that Buddy (Will Ferrell) decides he should find his real family. Papa gives him a photo he has kept of his birth father, Walter (James Caan), who deals with book publishing, and is unfortunately on the naughty list. So Buddy sets off to New York, and with his childlike innocence discovers all the wonders of the city. When he does meet Walter, he does not believe he is his son, or in Santa, so till he can get to him again, Buddy stays in the near toy store, where he meets his beautiful love interest, Jovie (Zooey Deschanel). The second time he meets his Dad, Buddy is confirmed from DNA results of his biology, and Walter does eventually let him come home with him to meet wife Emily (Back to the Future Part III's Mary Steenburgen) and son Michael (Daniel Tay). Walter does try to make Buddy more normal by taking him to work, and giving him normal clothes, but his childish behaviour still causes chaos, especially when the employees are talking to short children's book writer Miles Finch (Peter Dinklage), who Buddy keeps calling Elf. Walter loses his patience and sends Buddy away, but when Santa crashes in the middle of central park because he has run low on Christmas spirit to power the sleigh, everyone shows they believe by singing along with Jovie to help, even Scrooge-like Walter. The highlights for me are all of Ferrell, but more especially the snowball fight and the large burp after drinking a whole bottle of Coca Cola in seconds. Good!"

Will Ferrell was good, James Caan kept the movie afloat, Bob Newhart was a great presence. With such a great cast, I'm amazed they made such a mediocre film. The character of buddy the elf is kind of a one note joke, ""fish out of water"" character that really has no development in the film. Buddy is a human, who was raised as an elf, that goes back to New York to visit his birth father who never knew he was born. In New York he acts like an idiot, getting hit by cars and eating gum off the bottom of benches, etc. Buddy meets a girl played by Zooey Dechanel, who has a problem singing in public. I guess this movie is good for kids, but I found it to be very stupid. I thought Bob Newhart's narration (through the beginning and at the end) was a nice touch.<br/><br/>My rating: C. 94 mins.

"saxon-7","5","2","3","18 December 2006"," Sweet Little Christmas Movie
","Elf is a sweet little movie about Buddy who is raised by elves in Santa's workshop on the north pole, but Buddy isn't an elf, he's in fact a human and as such dosn't have the same nimble fingers as the other elves. When Buddy is told by his adoptive elf father that he's a human he goes to NY to find his birth father, here mayhem ensures because life here is very different than what Buddy is used to, furthermore Buddy has to save or rekindle the Christmas spirit.<br/><br/>Plot wise this is an okay little story, however as a fantasy buff, I was a bit disappointed by the elves, whom have more in common with a Gnome or Halfling than Elves who normally are about the same height as humans. Jon Favreau does capture the normal dislike between Dwarfs and Elves but as mentioned the elves in this movie has nothing to do with the general look of elves. The effects are so-so, what little there are anyway. The acting is also so-so with Mare Winningham and Zooey Deschanel performing best but in no way spectacular.<br/><br/>All in all a sweet little movie to waste a Christmas Holiday with but nothing more. 5 out of 10"
"SuperNewb","10","2","3","18 November 2006"," A cute Christmas movie
","This movie came out when I was young, nine or so, and I remember giggling and laughing through this film. C'mon, it was cute, I loved it and still do. But, this is just my personal opinion. I'll give an overview of the movie.<br/><br/>The Plot: The overall plot was...cute. Nothing amazing, just a typical Christmas tale. It tells the story of a young man who was raised by elves, and once finding out who he 'truly is', a human, sets out on a journey to meet his real family. And, before he sets out, Santa gives him horrible news. His father is on the naughty list. Buddy greets this by yelling 'NO!!!' as loudly as he can. Finally, he sets off to New York to find his dad, and meet his brother, a little boy played by the adorable Daniel Tay, and his father's new wife. Overall, it's a sweet plot with a sweet ending. No miracle, but it's cute.<br/><br/>The Jokes: If you're looking for jokes that you'd find on Comedy Central, then don't both with this movie. But if you're looking for primarily kid-appropriate, Nickelodeon-like jokes, then look no further. This is the movie for you. Children from about five/sixish to eleven should enjoy this movie, along with a handful of preteens/teenagers (such as myself).<br/><br/>The Acting: Okay, the acting's not great. It's adequate at the most. Will Ferrell plays his regular yell-out-lines role, though his facial features and comedic timing are pretty good. Zooey Deschanel's good, not perfect, but good. She definitely evens out the movie without trying to overuse comedy or burst out in exaggerated lines like a certain actor in this movie who was mentioned earlier. James Caan was probably the best in this movie. No, his performance wasn't Oscar-worthy, but it was better than the majority of the performances. He believably plays a spiritless man who's in denial of having Buddy as a son, and never really trails out of character. Finally, Daniel Tay, who plays Buddy's brother and, as we see later in the movie, good friend, is absolutely adorable in his snow hat. His acting's pretty good, not perfect, it was just a regular child performance. However, his performance is pretty much brushed aside because he's overshadowed by his adult co-stars. The other cast members were good, not great, and I must add that Lydia Lawson-Baird, who only says two or three lines, will practically melt your heart with her sweet presence upon screen.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a cute movie, good for kids. Don't watch this movie expecting something Oscar-worthy. If you're looking for a kid-appropriate movie, then this is the movie for you."

"pinkispunknotpimp","7","2","3","17 June 2005"," If you're looking for just one good Christmas movie this holiday...
","When I first saw the trailer for Elf a little more than six months ago, I immediately jumped to the conclusion that it would be yet another Christmas movie rehash, with elves, Santa Clause, and snow to draw its audience. But to my surprise, when I first saw Elf, I was more quickly drawn back in awe than let down. It's totally different than what I was expecting. Yes, it has elves, Santa Clause, and snow in it. But it's not the same as everything else you may have seen this holiday season. Elf is it's own movie. Not confined to the age-old tradition like a lot of other films.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting is simply top-notch and superb to the max. There can be no denying that. Will Ferrell is, without a doubt, on the top of his game in Elf. He displays all the signs of a good, up-and-coming actor. As if his comedian skills were not grand enough, now it looks like he is set on outdoing himself with acting. While some of his previous movies have done nothing but upset me, this one definitely made up for all of those. Then there is James Caan, who plays the role of Buddy's (Will Ferrell) father. As a grumpy, miserable old man, Caan churns out a good performance, and his change in attitude toward the end of Elf leaves the movie on a touching note. Not to forget the supporting cast, however. Bob Newhart (Papa Elf) and Zooey Deschanel (Buddy's ""interest"") both do their thing, especially Zooey who's character I really liked.<br/><br/>Christmas movies tend to be quite like one another. But something in Elf sticks out and makes it a whole different movie. I'm not sure if it was Ferrell eating candy and syrup-covered spaghetti, the snowball fight that ensued in between, or the epic ending that featured Santa Clause escaping from the media, but Elf just clicked with me.<br/><br/>As for complaints about Elf, I have but a couple that I'd have to say narrowly took away from the film. First and foremost is the predictability of it all. The ending is all too obvious; it wouldn't take a brain surgeon to figure out that everyone would leave happy, and Santa Clause would race off into the night sky shouting ""ho ho ho"". Nor was it too hard to guess that James Caan would come around sooner than later. Again, quite predictable. Also, the ending bugged me. I didn't like the angle of the media chasing Santa Clause. Up until the end, though, Elf was nearly flawless But these two flaws don't hurt the score of Elf too much.<br/><br/>So if you're looking for one good holiday film this Christmas, look no further than Elf. I overlooked it from the beginning... heck, you probably will too. But give it a try. I promise you, it will definitely be worth your time!"

","""Elf"" directed by Jon Favreau turned out the other night on a cable channel. Not having see this popular film before, we decided to take a look. Frankly, it was a pleasant surprise. The film, written by David Barenbaum, takes great pleasure in bringing together the unreal world of Santa Claus and his helpers, the elves, with present day Manhattan. What a ride are we in for! <br/><br/>As played by Will Ferrell with deadpan manner, Buddy, the elf of the story is wiser than some of the people he meets along the way. The encounter with a father, Walter, he didn't know until now, is at the center of the story. The jaded city people are not ready for this childlike figure that is all kindness. James Caan, an otherwise intense type, makes a great contribution to the film. Mr. Favreau gets good performances from his talented cast.<br/><br/>""Elf"" will be appreciated not only by children, but those young at heart who will have a great time watching the film."
"Quinoa1984","7","2","3","25 December 2003"," Not a bad Christmas comedy at all, though nothing great
","Jon Favreu and Will Ferrel as a director/star combo is a good premise and execution here in Elf, as they create a film that assuredly works for the whole family.  This is because the film is as much directed towards fans of Ferrel from Saturday Night Live (which ranges with both sexes from little kids to people in their middle ages) as it is towards those looking for the holiday spirit.  Bottom line is, he makes the movie fun to watch, among a cast of well knowns (the likes of Bob Newhart, Ed Asner, Mary Steenburgen, Artie Lange, and Andy Richter pop up, and James Caan has a better than average supporting role).  Here, Ferrel plays Buddy, a man who's grown up adopted in the North Pole.  Raised by Elves, it pains him to find out that he isn't one, and that his father didn't even make Santa's 'Nice' list this year.  He decides to seek him out in New York, and has a brief stint working in a department store, followed by the mailroom of his father's office in the Empire state building.<br/><br/>From what I described of the plot it sounds a little routine, and it is, but there are some things in the story that are inspired, though most of the joy in the film comes from Ferrel's Buddy.  Some might take his performance as over the top or lame, however I think he finds just the right bit of gleeful un-awareness at what he does, good and not so good, and there are a few real howlers too.  Best scene- Buddy confronts the department store Santa in front of the children (this is a near draw with the scene in the recent Bad Santa where Billy Bob beats down the plastic reindeer in the store).  Only the last part of the film, the Christmas Night bit, doesn't work at all.  A nice little Christmas comedy, which can be seen after the Holidays too. B+"

","It filled me with childlike joy. Perhaps my state of mind was slightly twisted at the time, but I REALLY enjoyed this movie. Having seen 'A Night At The Roxbury' a countless amount of times I was initially a bit disappointed at the the similarity between both of Will's characters. After five minutes I didn't care as I was too busy laughing. It's silly, childish, sweet and above all - funny. The naivety of the central character is perfectly balanced to provide children with plenty to relate to and adults with plenty to laugh about. Despite being 25 I found myself in the former category! As with the majority of Christmas films, it's delivered with a thick coating of candy, but that's what a lot of kids need. Believe in the magic of Christmas, if only for 95 minutes. If you can't do that, just laugh at the brilliant performance delivered by Will Ferrell. Certainly worth watching."

For the first 2/3rds of the movie I was laughing almost continuously and I don't think there was a scene with Will Ferrell in it where I didn't laugh out loud. I almost wet my pants several times. Fortunately there were only four other people in the cinema (surprising since it was the opening weekend), and they didn't seem to mind me busting a gut.<br/><br/>I heartily recommend for other Ferrell/snl fans.  Both the physical comedy and dialogue were of top-notch hilarity.  I even almost cried a couple of times (and not just from laughing).  See for yourself."

","Affable, amusing holiday fare.  There's really nothing terribly new here--the film's basically a collection of Christmas-movie clichés strung together like Buddy's meticulously crafted paper snowflakes.  But Will Ferrell's deeply committed performance makes things worth our while. Ferrell seems to be that rarest of creatures, the `Saturday Night Live' alum who actually can make it on the big screen.  Here he gives a big, childlike, wonderfully straight-faced performance--he never winks at the audience, and that's what gives him his charm.  In fact, the entire production has a refreshing earnestness about it--there's nothing all that special about Jon Favreau's direction (though his quick cuts in the reindeer scenes preserve the illusion beautifully), but we have to admire the fact that there are no annoying pop-cultural references, grossout gags, or smarmy jokes for the adults to laugh at.  There aren't too many belly laughs, either, but unless you have a heart of stone, you're likely to have a smile on your face for the entire 95 minutes.  7 out of 10."
"ThurstonHunger","7","2","3","22 November 2003"," Will Powered
","I'm starting to think that there are dumb comedies and smart comedies. The ""dumb"" ones typically I cannot stand and usually fall into the banal (Farelly brothers) or ride one joke to exasperation (""Romy and Michelle's high School Reunion"")<br/><br/>This is a pretty good dumb comedy. One that thankfully gets by on a single belch, a little ""tasteful"" vomit and a urine joke that spears asparagus. Instead it relies more on us liking and maybe even identifying with an ""idiot"" who is more childlike than clueless.<br/><br/>The more Will, the more power it has...especially when we get detours from the required plot landmark visits. Scenes like... -   Will running around New York city waving at a guy hailing a taxi, swapping pamphlets, etc... -   Will hitting the ""maple"" in the mail room...making a best friend -   Will getting a DNA check at the doctor's (director Favreau)<br/><br/>That last section may have been the funniest to me, as it felt the most free... I suspect some of that was just plain improvised based upon the props on the set??<br/><br/>Overall of course 99% of this was scripted, but whenever a film can at least feel like the comic is just riffing, that is a key for me. (And I think it is where Eddie Murphy's career evaporated...)<br/><br/>Certainly this film is well planned out, but to its credit (and largely to Ferrell) it does have a looseness. If you enjoyed Ferrell on SNL, you should likely be able to find humor in this. Or if you like tromp l'oiel this has some nice bits... Some of the other grandiose reviews on this (lauding Asner, for what exactly?) might unjustly inflate expectations. Product placement was a little heavy here, I wish they'd skipped that and just not spent the money on the CGI sleigh ride from the four horsemen/orcs of the central park rangers. The ending of the film suffers as many comedies do, it's the time when everyone has to pass their papers to the front.<br/><br/>Favreau is a sharp and gracious fan of film (from his IFC show) and Ferrell is funny as a stand-up sort of everymoron. 7/10"

In this one a human man who has been raised as one of Santa's elves is told the truth by his tiny elven ""father"".

","""Elf"", Jon Favreau's only Christmas film to date, might at first glance come across as nothing but a silly comedy with packed with Will Ferrell's trademark ""idiot"" humor. (Meaning he is playing an idiot, not that we are idiots.) But really, what ""Elf"" truly is is a perfectly well executed Christmas movie - I would go as far and say one of the best ones out there. As Ferrell's character, Buddy, finds out he's not at all a real elf but an adopted human, his deadpan father (played by legend Bob Newhart) sends him to the Big Apple to find his real father. The culture crash between the world of humans and world of elves is hilariously showcases in scenes such as the one in which Buddy consumes spaghetti with maple syrup and various sweets for breakfast. ""Elf"" does not at all lack comedy gold, neither is it afraid of getting charmingly Yule-cheesy and it succeeds in treading those grounds without ever becoming cynical or sarcastic. With great supporting roles, shining brightest being James Caan as Buddy's real father and Zooey Deschanel as the elf's love interest, ""Elf"" stands incredibly well nearly 20 years after its release. Is ""Elf"" a Christmas classic? In my opinion most definitely yes, and not only Ferrell's - perhaps - best work ever."

There were plenty of laugh out loud scenes. I couldn't even say it had any boring parts. The beginning was a little slow though. It was some solid good fun.

","At first glance, Elf would appear to be one of countless holiday- season cash-ins with daft costumes and even sillier special effects, featuring a well-known actor performing pantomime on a bigger budget and grabbing an easy pay-day in the process. That is stars Will Ferrell, one of cinema's most naturally hilarious funnymen who seems to be caught up in an endless loop of mediocrity - Blades of Glory and Stranger than Fiction excluded - as the titular human-turned- elf, bodes even worse. Throw in some little people dressed in elf costumes and a romance involving surely the only woman to accept a date with a man who claims to be from the North Pole, and it would seem like a movie tailor-made for a critical beat-down.<br/><br/>Only Elf is genuinely charming, and even more alarmingly, incredibly funny at times. Using Ferrell's man-child comedy chops to the fullest extent, this may actually be the best work Ferrell has ever done. He plays Buddy, an orphan accidentally whisked off to Santa's homeland as a baby. Taken in by the sympathetic Papa Elf (the wonderful Bob Newhart), it doesn't take long until Buddy is towering over his adoptive father and his co-workers. Learning of his biological pop Walter (played by James Caan) and that he is in fact a human, the 6-foot elf journeys to New York City to be with his real family, only for his miserable publisher dad to shun him. Buddy learns that his world no longer buys into tales of flying reindeers and a jolly fat man who knows if we've been bad, disbelieving in the 'magic' of Christmas and draining the power from Santa's sleigh in the process.<br/><br/>Directed by Jon Favreau and written by David Berenbaum, Elf is pretty standard stuff story-wise, and is hampered by a predictable sub-plot involving Walter's struggling publishing company and his dire need to lighten up. Yet there are many touching moments, particularly in the scenes involving Buddy and his young half- brother, and the former's awkward courting of a pretty toy store assistant (Zooey Deschanel) initially freaked out by his maniacal claims but who eventually succumbs to his hyperactive charms. It all inevitably leads to a climax built around a special-effect laden set-piece as Santa struggles to deliver the presents with a dying sleigh, but this is expected from a movie designed to win over those looking for something easy-going and festive. The world has grown cynical, and perhaps so have I, but Elf reminded me that it is no fun being so."

","Thirty years prior to the events of the film, a baby crawls into Santa's sack at an orphanage. Santa unwittingly takes the baby back to the North Pole, where it is decided that Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) will raise him. The baby, named Buddy (Will Ferrell), is raised unaware that he is actually a human, until his enormous size and poor toy-making abilities cause Papa Elf to tell him the truth. The old elf reveals that Buddy was born to Walter Hobbs and Susan Wells and placed up for adoption, that Walter never knew Buddy was born, and that he now works at a children's book company in New York. Immediately and full of optimism, Buddy sets out for New York to find his father.<br/><br/>""Elf"" is self consciously structured in the most academical and basic way screenplays are written, it is screen writing 1-0-1 and it knows that, so even though it cannot be commended for a remarkable depth, there is just no resisting the charm and the comedy this film has to offer with what is possibly, still to this day, Ferrel's best performance.<br/><br/>For someone who has always been somewhat of a Ferrell critic: I have rarely been able to enjoy his comedies and sketches, this film really surprised me and that is exactly because Ferrel is cast perfectly in the role of an over-enthusiastic human who thinks he is an elf. His zany and over the top comedy and his exaggerated facial gestures fit this film perfectly and grace us with moments of really good comedy. Favareau knows how to build upon this and has always the right camera set-up to enhance the comedic effect. He uses the classic shtick of people or objects entering or exiting into frame to incredible effect and even does some innovative things with the technique that really surprised me and had me rolling with laughter.<br/><br/>The film also has a classic Christmas message and story: the characters by the end need to save Christmas and to do so they have to believe in the Christmas spirit. It is standard stuff, but the film is written very effectively and its colorful characters navigate through a sufficiently original premise and set-pieces which make for an undeniably pleasant flow. You care about everyone involved thanks to some solid work from all the performers. Yet, once again, what really pushes the film a notch above has to be the comedy, it is inventive and always different, it does not go for the same gag over and over again as it would be easy to do with a fish-out-of-water story.<br/><br/>As I said, ""Elf"" cannot be praised for bringing to the table something new. The structure is predictable down to every emotional beat. There isn't a sense of overwhelming emotion involved with the characters and their struggle is never really given depth exactly because we know how it is going to go.<br/><br/>Still, the fact that the film is self conscious about that helps it build around a pleasant family movie which is also a very good Christmas comedy with enough flare to keep you pleasantly entertained for the whole duration."

The good supporting cast, including Zooey Deschanel, does a fine job. However, James Caan (as Elf's real father) is a ""cooler"" and sucks all the life out of the story, along with the dreadful office scenes. (I found the mail-room and ""midget"" book-author sub-plots to be stupid.) Like ""Santa Claus"" it's very uneven, and only comes back-to-life at the very end. Both Bob Newhart and Ed Asner are fine as ""Papa Elf"" and ""Santa"". Will Ferrell is surprisingly good as a 6 ft. tall ""Elf"". But NYC is not at all magical here, except for Rockefeller Plaza. Please note that Gimbels Dept. Store went out of business about 16 years before this movie was made. ""Zooey"" is adorable as ""Mrs. Elf"" at the movie's end."

Will Ferrell was the perfect choice for Buddy, and you just can't help but laugh at the crazy things he does in New York. Eating gum off the sidewalk, attempting to use an escalator; the jokes are funny for children and adults alike.

The actors are brilliant. James Caan did a good job as Buddy's father, but I think that the best performance goes to Will Ferrell for his portrayal as Buddy and successfully gives out his hilarious comedic moments. The rest weren't that bad either especially Bob Newhart, Mary Steenburgen and Ed Asner. The jokes in this movie are hilarious including the ""He's an angry elf"" part and the directing from Jon Favreau was surprisingly good.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint about this movie was the ending which felt too cheesy for my taste and in the third act, there were barely any jokes near the end of the film including it's atrocious dialogue, but I think the story was wonderful that boosts up the character development and it's not a complaint.<br/><br/>Elf may not be excellent, but I'm sure it would be known to fans of Jon Favreau as a Christmas classic for children young and old.<br/><br/>7.6/10"
"AloysiusWeasley","7","1","1","2 December 2007"," Through the seven levels of the candy cane forest and the sea of twirly, swirly gumdrops...
","I'm not usually a big fan of the sort of 'comedy' that Hollywood likes to put out, but this movie is GREAT! First, let me quickly sum it up. Buddy (Will Farrell) crawled into Santa's sack of gifts as a baby, and ended up being raised at the North Pole and working in Santa's toy shop. He's not near as good as making toys as the other elves, and one day he finds out he's actually human. With Santa's blessing, he makes his way to New York City to find his dad.<br/><br/>Needless to say, his dad, Walter Hobbs (James Caan) isn't too thrilled to be confronted by an apparently delusional guy claiming he's his son. Walter ends up having blood tests done, and Buddy is really his son. Then he makes efforts to integrate him into both his family and his work place, with often hilarious results.<br/><br/>All right, enough with the summary, you can find that anywhere! This movie is FABULOUS, and I usually despise anything to do with Will Farrell or Christmas. His acting in this movie is just perfect - Buddy wanders around with a perpetually curious, excited, dreamy sort of expression, and comes up with the most gut-busting things to say, all with a perfectly straight face.<br/><br/>The rest of the family (Mary Steenburgen as Emily and Daniel Tay as Michael) are great and perfectly believable. I usually don't even like the kids in family movies like this, finding them either nauseatingly sweet or horrifyingly ill-mannered, but I really enjoyed Michael. And poor Walter - he's in a good but often difficult job, and overseen by a tyrant control-freak boss we don't meet until fairly close to the end of the film. A small mention to Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), since she was fairly good, but I wasn't as fond of her character as I could have been.<br/><br/>Bottom line - the acting in this movie is brilliant, and it's pretty much non-stop laughs. I really only have one complaint about this movie - I suppose it's to be expected, but I really could have done without the sickly-sweet ending. It could have been worse, but I found the scene with everyone singing to bring Santa's sleigh up to the proper flying height to be really annoying. Other than that, though - I just CANNOT get over how funny and totally re-watchable this movie is!"
"view_and_review","7","1","1","8 March 2007"," Will Ferrell makes this movie work
","OK, for the most part the movie was somewhat corny. Here it is, Will Ferrell is playing a guy named Buddy that believes he's an elf. Even though it is rather obvious that he is a LOT bigger than every other elf, he goes on believing it until the elf he referred to as ""dad"" broke it to him that he wasn't an elf. So began Buddy's journey out of the North Pole and to New York to find his real dad.<br/><br/>Like I said, a lot of the movie was just corny, but I'll be darned if that guy Will Ferrell isn't a riot. Will Ferrell makes the ridiculous work, he was the perfect cast for the role. I just know that the movie doesn't have the same lustre or appeal with someone else in the role of Buddy. There was hardly a scene that Buddy was in that wasn't funny. And I would watch the entire movie again just to hear him say, ""He's an angry elf,"" when referring to an irate midget. Priceless."
"evanston_dad","7","1","1","12 December 2006"," A Modern Holiday Classic
","Will Ferrell has escaped the curse of most SNL veterans who try to transition to major motion pictures (at least those who have tried to make the jump in recent years) and manages to produce the most consistently funny films of probably any of them (including Mike Myers).<br/><br/>""Elf"" is destined to be a holiday classic, one of those you watch every year around the holiday season. Ferrell, a human baby adopted by elves (some scenes of him with his elf dad, played in a dead pan performance by Bob Newhart, provide the film with some of its funniest sight gags), goes off in search of his real father, a search that takes him to NYC. The joke of course is that Ferrell, wandering around the streets of New York in his elf costume and eating gum off of subway station railings, doesn't seem out of the ordinary in a place like NY, where people are used to crazies, and where every department store has a troupe of workers dressed as elves anyway.<br/><br/>He finds his dad (played by James Caan), falls in love (with Zooey Deschanel) and helps save Christmas when Santa's sleigh malfunctions due to a lack of Christmas spirit. It's all very funny and harmless, with a sense of humour that manages to satisfy both those who like their Christmas cheer served warm and those sarcastic cynics (like me) who watch ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" and root for the Grinch.<br/><br/>Favorite line, delivered when Ferrell gets a job in the mail room of a children's book publishing house: ""This reminds me of the North Pole, except that it smells like mushrooms and everyone looks like they want to hurt me."" <br/><br/>Grade: A-"

I like sappy Christmas movies; they are fun. I even like fantasies based on a silly premise. To work, however, there must be some semblance of believability.<br/><br/>The Elf character was so much over the top, that even as a non-human in a human body, he didn't quite fit reality. From the premise in the movie, elves are hard-working, optimistic, and encouraging, but they are not stupid. It was the other characters, though, that really stood out. When Buddy was doing his silly stuff, the other characters just stood there as if they were waiting for him to finish his lines, instead of reacting as you would expect New Yorkers to react to a wacko like that.<br/><br/>James Caan was believable, but no one else was.

He finds out that his old man(an embarrassed James Cann) is naughty and throws his usual annoying hissy fit. One thing that REALLY annoyed me was the scene in the mall. He erupts into a frenzy about the mall worker posing as a fake Santa. This is insanely annoying. The guy is dressed as Santa to serve some good kids, some bratty kids and does this for hours on end just so he can get an extra paycheck to feed his family and gets shouted at by some annoying jerk in an elf outfit. Leave him alone!! Let him do his job!! Also a cute woman dressed as an elf for some unexplained reason, gets a liking to this jackass. Another thing, If ELF was so offended by the fake Santa, why did he not throw a fit at the babe dressed as a fake elf?? She's a fraud too just like the guy dressed like Santa. Ferrell is naturally annoying as ELF. The ""comedy"" is stupidity. I almost feel sorry for James Caan. Perhaps Caan was here for another paycheck.

Hey, let's just forget it, okay?"" The plot just seemed to drudge along like a molasses sandwich. I just couldn't take it anymore. Especially not to see good actors like Bob Newhart, James Caan, Ed Asner get dragged into it. It's not that I hate Will Farrell, I think he's okay, but this movie just stank."

","As far as TV was full of rubbish on Christmas night, I chose to watch ""Elf"" as the less annoying program. I am prejudiced with this kind of comedies and unfortunately I was unlucky enough to confirm my opinion once again. Except the 4-5 first minutes (before the opening credits), the whole thing was a huge disappointment. It is supposed to be a film for Christmas Spirit and lost childishness. Probably, Ι have a distorted point of view on how Christmas Spirit should be presented and what can be the meaning (at least for the people who still believe in it).Peace, love, altruism. ""Elf"" tries to convince the audience that Christmas Spirit is overconsumption in the nearest mall and Santa Claus is a guy who takes a break between the shots of a well known refreshment's advertising. I fully agree to a previous review saying that this film was made without any talent and producers should offer the amount given for the ""Elf"" to the homeless (if they really wanted to promote Christmas Spirit). Another paradox in this movie is that the main contributors are Jewish. That means that they could not have a real feeling for the subject they have chosen to film. Really, what is the necessity of a Menorah as a background in the Doctor's waiting room or snowflakes made of paper depicting the Star of David in a film for Christmas? Plot was totally predictable without any deviation from Hollywood's formula for family ""comedies""...(The kind-hearted naive hero who manages to change the hardhearted guy at the end bla bla bla)... James Caan done his best(and he succeeded)and his poorly written character was decent. Will Ferrell was unbearable as usual.<br/><br/>My opinion.....Chose something else!!!"

I guess I was undecided about Will Ferrell, I thought I liked him, but this movie finally tipped me over to the 'I hate him' category. He's just not funny! He's shouty and creepy; as the titular elf, his man-child schtick is getting really annoying.

","Ebert starts his review of Elf this way:<br/><br/>""If I were to tell you 'Elf' stars Will Ferrell as a human named Buddy who thinks he is an elf and Ed Asner as Santa Claus, would you feel an urgent desire to see this film? Neither did I. I thought it would be clunky, stupid and obvious, like 'The Santa Clause 2' or 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas.' It would have grotesque special effects and lumber about in the wreckage of holiday cheer...""<br/><br/>And that's just how I saw it: clunky, stupid and obvious. And let me add, painfully unfunny. I cheerfully admit that I am in the minority here; Rotten Tomatoes has it at 83% I think, essentially a rave, and Ebert gives it three stars.<br/><br/>We turned it off after half an hour, and, if watching by myself, I might have turned it off after the nearly endless opening credits, because I knew I was in trouble. Very early in the film, Santa Claus sees something moving in his bag of toys. He says, ""What in the name of Sam Hill is that?"" Gee, what a useless, trite thing to say at the first moment of tension in the film. Even a simple scream would have been an improvement.<br/><br/>Ferrell's performance has been praised; I found him unlikable and tiresome. We've seen too much of this before, and done better, as in Starman, Moscow on the Hudson, and Time after Time: the naive waif encountering modern civilization for the first time. The elevator scene is almost funny: Buddy joyfully pushes all the buttons. What does the stranger in the elevator do or say? NOTHING! What a riot. Buster Keaton could have saved the scene with his ""great stone face,"" but here it's just one more opportunity squandered.<br/><br/>Is there anything good about this film? Yes, Bob Newhart puts in a welcome appearance, but it's a good thing that his old stand-up comedy persona is that of looking ""out of place and anxious about it,"" because that's exactly how he looks here in his elf costume, talking to the camera. Fortunately it's mildly amusing rather than yet another embarrassment. The special effects are reasonable... ""Buddy"" is convincingly a lot bigger than all the elves, though his animated toy friends look off, somehow. The paintings used during the opening credits are attractive.

","""Christmas is a time to be extra jerk"" is pretty much an attitude of every villains in every Christmas movie (even Die Hard 2). But the villain whose heart will eventually change by either ghosts, or Christmas-related miracle in Elf is not really someone you sympathize with. And that person is the Elf's father, which the audience will most likely hate him more than they like Elf.<br/><br/>""Will you tuck me in Dad?"" ""No, I will not tuck you in.""<br/><br/>To be fair, Elf is a grown man, and it will be creepy to tuck him in. But my point is not whether or not the father should tuck his grown son in. The point is, what kind of writer/director would want to put that scene into their movie? What kind of reaction should we have? Why is it funny? Is it funny because Elf is being stupid? Is it funny because the father is feeling awkward? Is it funny because of their tone of voice? Or is this the climax scene? I can never tell.<br/><br/>But I am getting ahead of myself. The movie started out extremely cute. Elf and his adopted father are both characters that we can all love even before they say a word. And we continue to throughout the movie. That is the problem because, guess what? People don't want to see bad things happen to the characters they love. And the whole Elf being in New York and get tease and push around by people, though he didn't feel bad by it (because of his innocence, which makes us love him even more), frustrated me even more. There are also scene like when Elf want to give raccoon a hug but instead the raccoon bites him. That's not funny. That's awful. <br/><br/>The fake looking talking Penguin at the North Pole shows that the director and the production team didn't plan on making this movie a classic (and by all mean, it isn't) which is sad because with some more thought into it, this movie could have been so much better. May be even a good movie. Considering how well this movie made in the box office.<br/><br/>Everything about it is a downer. The snowball fight was mean and unrealistic. The kid in this movie is a very bad actor (which is strange for this kind of movie). Santa Clause talked like he's reading Declaration of Independent. The view of New York is not at all beautiful. And the love interest character has absolutely no dimension. The way she change her emotion from bitter goth to Legally Blonde in a split second is beyond the definition of the word believable.<br/><br/>I thought this was going to be a very funny movie for a whole family since its DVD release was hyped up so much (and consider the fact that it did very well in the box office). But it turn out to be too dumb for adult, too dark and harsh for kids, and too uncomfortable to watch for anyone in between. Cute idea. Sloppy (cross that, very bad) execution.<br/><br/>Panasit"

","Elf is fun, but flawed no matter which way you look at it<br/><br/>Plot: When he was a baby, Buddy (Will Ferrell) accidentally crawls into Santa's bag one Christmas Eve. Flash forward a couple of years and Buddy is now an adult. He has been raised as a elf and nobody has ever told him he is human. Buddy is constantly worrying about belonging to the elf's, but can't seem to do anything right. One day his elf dad (Bob Newhart) tells him the truth and Santa (Edward Answer) sends him to New York City to find his dad, Walter Hobbs (James Caan). He learns his dad has lost his Christmas faith and is mean and bossy. He goes to live with his wife, Emily (Mary Steenburgen) and her son, Michael (Daniel Tay). He gets a job at Gimbel's and falls in love with Jovie (Zooey Deschanel). Promlems arise as kids across the world are starting to lose their Christmas faith.<br/><br/>The Good News: This film actually made me laugh hysterically and not just once, probably about seven times. The two biggest laughs are when Buddy wanders into the women's section at the mall and spots a tight see-through red shoulder strap shirt and the sign next to it reads, For Someone Special, so Buddy sends it to his dad and the other big laugh is also in the mall where Buddy walks up to a lady holding a perfume bottle and Buddy tries it out, only he sprays it in his mouth. The slew of great actors and actresses are great in their roles, but there is not a lot to comment on about them except they get the job done. There is very little else to like here except for a few sporadic scenes, but they are placed to far apart for it to be worthwhile. New Line Cineama provides this film with their infinifilm special features which deserves special mention because the features are shorter and more entertaining than the entire movie together! The main highlight is the commentary provided by director Jon Favreau and actor Will Ferrell. They share nifty little tide-bits about making the film and they make it easier to sit through.<br/><br/>The Bad News: The biggest problem is the pacing, the film is ninety-five minutes long and they could have shortened it to about an hour. I'm not a big fan of Will Ferrell, but I do realize he has acting skills and to me he looked like he was bored and wanted to collect a paycheck as soon as possible. A lot of the characters should have been thrown out for their uselessness. Most scenes feel contrived as if they dug it out of a hole in the ground such as the mail scene. What in the world? Although there are laughs some jokes fall flat on their faces and are not funny at all. The script by David Berenbaum and the direction by Jon Favreau suffers a lot and feels choppy and hackneyed. Through most of the running time the film is a complete bore and it is pretty hard to sit through. The awful costumes for the elf's is just well what can you say except awful. It's hard to digest the colors together and to have to see one character run around in the same outfit for the entire running time which is hideous doesn't add to the film at all. One of the most important elements in a film like this is to believe in the make believe world, but here you don't believe at all and it doesn't help that the special effects are really bad and it can get distracting. The relationship between Buddy and Jovie is really tacky and comes almost as an after thought.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Most of the jokes are good and there are enough good things to not declare it a total waste, but according to me... Not Recommended<br/><br/>Rated: PG for some mild rude humor and language"
"bregund","5","2","4","4 December 2006"," Has its moments
","Will Farrell seems to have taken a page from the Jim Carrey look-at-me school of acting. People like Carrey, and Farrell, and Bette Midler were probably the kind of people who, as small children, would jump onto the empty stage in malls and put on a show for their delighted parents, while other patrons walked by scratching their heads. It's not to say that these people aren't occasionally funny, but when your entire celebrity is built on self-referentialism, you'll hit more wrong notes than right ones. I have a hunch that they did many, many takes of each scene in this movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, the funniest parts of this movie come from the veteran actors themselves: Steenburgen, Asner, Newhart, and Caan. Each of them has perfect straight-man timing to Farrell's manic funny-man Elf. Steenburgen's spaghetti breakfast, Asner's crabby Santa, Newhart's deadpan delivery and Caan's irritable reactions are all priceless moments. Farrell is basically himself, the same person he plays in every movie, and yet even given his two-dimensional portrayal of a man raised as an elf, his peculiarly funny mannerisms are somehow never tiresome. With a manic laugh or flick of his eyes he can be humorous, but he often seems bereft of an inner critic and tends to overdo it. For instance, the dinner scene is hilarious (""Is there sugar in maple syrup?""...""Yes""...""then YES!""), but Farrell ruins the lighthearted banter by belching for a full minute, a scene that should have been left on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>All in all, not a bad Christmas film, although the entire Central Park scene looks like it was written into the script at the last minute. It's all a bit overdone, but then they had to have some warm fuzzies or it wouldn't be a Christmas movie."

","Will Ferrell is a pure performer, everything he does, he goes head-first into. I didn't love him in Old School, though many many many other did love the over-the-top 37 year old college kid, but I did admire his enthusiasm for the role and his commitment to make it funny. His shtick works much better for me here in Elf, the story of a 6'4"" elf named Buddy in Santa's workshop, twice as big as his fellow workers, though not twice as productive. His size hurts his ability to work hard, eventually leading to Papa Elf (the always devastatingly understated Bob Newhart) to tell Buddy that his father is a real human from New York, and Buddy came to the North Pole by accident. After leaving the Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer-esquire North Pole for New York. The childish naiveté of Buddy in the corporate world of business New York at Christmas time gets him into trouble, first with a department store Santa (Artie Lange from the Howard Stern show) then with an children's author who is said to have sold more books than Dr. Seuss, the surly Miles Finch (Peter Dinklage). James Caan plays Buddy's real father, he has the difficult job of playing straight man to Will Ferrell while convincing us that he really does think his son worked for Santa Claus. Mary Steenbrugen is Caan's wife, a woman who takes to Buddy right away and does not question where he came from and how he knows her husband. And then there is Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), a department store clerk who falls for Buddy, even though he sounds like a 14 year old, but somehow that wins her over. There is a lot to Elf that can be dismissed as too out there, but it is the triumph of director Jon Favreau (Swingers) that we buy into Buddy's character, that we root for both he and Santa (Ed Asner) to save Christmas, and that we don't question what is going on with Jovie's fascination with Buddy. Farrell sells Buddy to the max, every time we see him, we see a man in yellow tights walking down the streets of New York (or Vancouver, either or), running out into traffic and hugging James Caan. What would Papa Corleone think? Finally, there are the cute little animals that live in the North Pole, Favreau brings us claymation character like the ones we see in ""Rudolph"" and countless other Christmas specials, and I'm a sucker for them. Especially walruses. This last touch, seen in the beginning of the film, takes the viewer back to their younger days, where every year we wonder if Santa will be able to leave the North Pole because of the thick fog, and every year, Rudolph comes to the rescue. I think that's where the film's charm comes from. While not a great film, Elf is harmless holiday fun for the entire family, well mostly harmless. Will Ferrell does wear yellow tights..."

Quite honestly, I thought she was suggesting ""Alf"" to me, so when she pulled it up on Netflix I managed an inward groan to myself. The end result though, was that I came away pleasantly entertained by the naive innocence of the Elf character Buddy, disarmingly portrayed by Will Ferrell. I don't usually go for pictures starring former SNL comedians because they're usually mindless fluff, but this one had a way of holding your attention to see what silliness comes next. I got a kick out of the sight gags and Buddy's one-sided view of a world he had no knowledge of once he hit New York City on a mission to find his real father. The script writers apparently weren't too concerned about him finding his real mother, a thought that occurred to me throughout, especially with each time that photo of a young Walter Hobbs (James Caan) was shown with his one time girlfriend. But that quickly gets lost in the shuffle of Buddy's precarious encounters with the staff at Gimbel's and Santa's (Ed Asner) arrival fueled by the Christmas Spirit provided by all of Buddy's new found friends and family. I can't really claim that this will wind up a holiday staple with me, but for a one time experience, ""Elf"" will bring a smile. Because in the words of Buddy himself - ""I like to smile.

","Basically, director Jon Favreau's goofy but entertaining Christmas comedy ""Elf"" is a 'fish-out-of-water' saga, and David Berenbaum's screenplay relies heavily on incongruity. Visually, ""Elf"" is a delightful little movie with interesting characters. The North Pole set and the costumes that the elves wear are colorful.<br/><br/>""Elf"" concerns an infant up for adoption at an orphanage who crawls into Santa Claus' gift bag during Christmas and winds up at the North Pole. As it turns out, he is raised as one of the elves, specifically Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), who serves as the narrator. At six feet, three inches, Buddy (Will Ferrell) cannot do anything right as an elf. Ironically, Buddy has no idea that he isn't an elf. The revelation that he is not an elf staggers him. One day he is shown a picture of his mother and father. Tragically, Buddy's mother died without informing his father Walter Hobbs (James Caan of ""The Godfather"") that he had sired him. Buddy sets out from the North Pole and walks on foot to Manhattan where he finally comes face-to-face with Walter. Walter is married, has a teenage son, and works at a book publishing firm. Reluctantly, Walter takes Buddy into his house and disasters galore ensue. Briefly, Buddy holds a job at Gimbels' Department Store in the toy department. When he assaults a man masquerading as Santa Claus, Buddy lands in jail and Walter bails him out. Eventually, after exasperating Walter continually with his adolescent antics, Buddy leaves and is standing on a bridge surveying the river when Santa Claus (Ed Asner) streaks overhead in his sleight with his reindeer. Something goes wrong and Santa has to crash land. Naturally, Buddy heads to his rescue.<br/><br/>Light, frivolous nonsense from start to finish, ""Elf"" qualifies as scintillating comedy with Ferrell having a field day as the tallest elf on record. This is Ferrell at his finest in an emerald jacket and golden tights. Mind you, the former ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian is an acquired taste. He behaves like an imbecile and he stoops to conqueror with lowest common denominator humor. James Caan is appropriately harried as his selfish father, and Oscar winning actress Mary Steenburgen plays Walter's wife Emily, while Zooey Deschanel is cast as Jovie, Buddy's love interest. ""Game of Thrones"" star Peter Dinklage appears in an amusing small part as a children's book writer."
"hypestyle","8","0","0","16 December 2014"," Will Ferrell Anchors Modern Christmas Fable
","""Elf"" is a Christmas-themed comedy starring Will Ferrell. Ferrell plays Buddy, a human who, as a baby, accidentally crawled into Santa Claus' (Ed Asner) toy sack and upon discovery is adopted by an elf (Bob Newhart, playing a version of his harried TV personas).<br/><br/>One fateful day, Buddy is told the truth of his parentage, and decides to travel to New York City to find his real father. While Buddy's biological mom is deceased, it turns out Buddy's biological father is Walter, a high-ranking editor at a book publishing firm. Walter has since married and has a preteen son. He's totally incredulous and annoyed at this goofy, grown man claiming to be his son. After several hijinks, Walter grudgingly accepts that Buddy is the real deal, but that doesn't make life with him any easier.<br/><br/>Buddy's undaunted Christmas-minded mentality makes him an annoyance to most around him. He finds work at a department store where he falls in love with a coworker (Zooey Deschanel). Buddy's quest leads to several funny sequences as he gets to know his dad and the various people around him.<br/><br/>Director Jon Favreau (""Iron Man"", ""Swingers"") lets Ferrell do his shtick but the narrative is held together very well. Some of the actors are mild caricatures but they manage not to overdo it, since virtually everyone is playing it straight compared to Ferrell's Buddy. Ferell plays Buddy as a man-child who is relentlessly positive, despite all the grumpiness that he encounters in the Big City. Look for amusing supporting parts by Faizon Love, Peter Dinklage, Artie Lange and Andy Richter.<br/><br/>Since the film has no real villain, it allows the relationships to be developed without an arbitrary ""bad guy"" foil to overcome by the end. In an era where original Christmas holiday films are frequently run of the mill, ""Elf"" stands out as a charmer. It's endearing without being overly saccharine."

","I think that the movie Elf is a very entertaining and family friendly film that to this day still remains a classic; at any time of year. I enjoyed this movie because it teaches a lesson while still incorporating humor and entertainment. Elf is also a movie that is enjoyed from all ages, old or young. I feel that no matter how many times you watch Elf, it never grows old. It's decorations in the city of New York along with the location of the film were attention grabbing. Its US Box Office profit was at $173,381,405. I predicted that Elf would have been more successful that 205th on the list. It has Will Ferrell in it, who is a very well known actor; which makes it all the more surprising. I think that at the time it may have been less successful because it was one of those films that showed all of the highlights of it during the previews. Also, during the holidays, it is watched almost or just as often as it is nowadays."

","""You sit on a throne of lies!""<br/><br/>Elf is one of those rare comedies that grows on me each time I rewatch it. I remember I enjoyed it the first time I saw it, but I love it even more now. Not everyone is a fan of Will Ferrell's man- child character, but seeing him wear those yellow tights and his green elf suit is hard to resist. He is hilarious in this movie and at the same time charming. Elf is not just a comedy that aims for cheap laughs or plays on one gag, it is also wickedly smart and brings out the Holiday spirit in everyone no matter how much of a Grinch or Stooge they are. There are so many great scenes and memorable quotes. The funniest scenes in the film are the ones where Ferrell calls out a fake Santa in the department store where he has been hired, and when he mistakes one of his father's associates (Peter Dinklage from Game of Thrones) for an elf. Those two scenes were great, but there were so many more hilarious moments playing on his confusion. The love story is also sweet and Zooey Deschanel shines in every scene she's in. James Caan plays Ferrell's father (who's in the naughty list) extremely well. Elf has turned into a Christmas classic, but the great thing about these comedies is that you don't need to wait for the Holiday season to enjoy them. Jon Favreau has proved he can direct some great films and he has a great sense of humor. It's been 11 years since it first was released and it continues to be a joyous experience."

","'Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?'<br/><br/>So a baby 'Buddy' climbs into Santa's sack and is whisked away to the North Pole by accident. Upon this discovery Santa decides to allow 'Papa Elf' to raise and look after him. Not too sure why they just didn't take him back to the orphanage where he crawled into the sack, seeing as they know he came from there. I guess him being an orphan it didn't matter?.<br/><br/>From here on Buddy grows up at the North Pole as a worker in Santa's workshop. He soon discovers by mistake that he is in fact human and not an elf (elfling?), so off he goes to New York to find his dad. Turns out Papa Elf knew all about his mum and dad and what happened to them...somehow, handy huh. Is that elf magic or Christmas magic that enabled Papa Elf to know everything? or am I missing something here.<br/><br/>So lets switch off the cynical part of my brain for a moment. The start of this film is a typical Xmas setting and scenario yes...but its so damn charming cozy and delightful you can't not love it. I mean sure you can't really go wrong with Santa's workshop at the North Pole really, but the added gem of seeing the odd bit of classic stop motion animation on one or two cheerful little characters really added another dimension to the whole sequence. It all looked like a whimsical children's story book, a snowy happy world with cutesy fantasy characters plodding around. Arctic Puffin and snowberries? adorable!!.<br/><br/>Once we reach New York and the real world the tone shifts to that classic American Xmas movie magic type scenario which we all know and love from various other movies. And what better setting for a cold wintry Xmas tale than New York. Yeah you know straight away all the famous landmarks and stores you'll be seeing, we know how this goes...but does it get old? no, never. New York is probably one of the most atmospheric places in the world at Xmas.<br/><br/>'I passed through the seven levels of the Candy Cane forest, through the sea of swirly twirly gum drops, and then I walked through the Lincoln Tunnel'<br/><br/>This is basically a pure unadulterated Ferrell show, the whole thing is all about him as the innocent sweet childlike elf completely out of place in a dark sinister world. You have the obligatory love/hate issues with his real father played grumpily by Caan to great effect (you can feel the sense of shame and disdain he gives off for Buddy), all this of course plays out exactly how you think it will right from the start. Then you have all the visual tomfoolery that Buddy serves up as he comes to terms with reality and not the candy cotton world he's used to.<br/><br/>At no point did I actually get tired or bored of Ferrell and his cherub- like virginal antics. It is utterly predictable hokey Xmas pantomime guff of course but its just so enchanting and visually pleasing you can't look away. Everywhere he goes he elaborately decorates with Christmas cheer, baubles and shiny trinkets, he's like the Xmas monster. Some of the scenes where he learns about 'human' ways and everyday things/objects are highly amusing despite being so simple and kinda cheesy. <br/><br/>The board meeting where Buddy comes across the rather small elf-like Mr Finch (who is actually a little person) is hilarious. The way Buddy talks to the guy as if he were a very young child is easily a laugh out loud moment (must have been a South pole elf). I must also mention the brilliantly done forced perspective we see here and there. It looks like CGI but apparently its not, very clever and nice usage of an old trick.<br/><br/>This is probably one of Ferrell's best films and best performances...strange as it may seem. The whole idea is completely not original and is stuffed to the gills with every Xmas cliché you can think of. The only reason this film works is because of the infantile character that is Buddy the elf...errr human. The ending is totally sappy and cringeworthy but it still doesn't stop this Christmas juggernaut of yuletide spirit. <br/><br/>'Oh, I forgot to give you a hug!'<br/><br/>8/10"

","Elf review<br/><br/>Elf is an American Christmas comedy film, written by David Berenbaum and directed by actor Jon,  the film was released in 2003. The cast is mainly made up of Will Ferrell, James Caan, Bob Newhart, Ed Asnar and Zooey Deschanel; it was released in America on November 7th and it grossed over$220,400,000 worldwide. The plot is: one Christmas Eve a baby boy crawls into Santa's present sack while he's delivering gifts to children in an orphanage, Santa doesn't know that he has took the baby back to the North Pole, where Papa Elf volunteers to raise him. Through a misunderstanding the boy is renamed Buddy. He is raised unaware that he really is a human, not an elf- until his size and average toy making leads him to the truth. Papa Elf reveals to Buddy that his father is called Walter Hobbs, his mother was ('was' as she is dead) called Susan Wells and he was given up for adoption, his Dad still doesn't know that he exists. Walter now works at a children's book company in New York, Buddy then sets out to Manhattan to find his father. When he arrives in the 'Big Apple' Buddy tracks down his Dad in the Empire State Building, Buddy goes and sings to Walter in his elf suit just to be escorted out by security. The security tells Buddy (sarcastically) ""get back to Gimbels"" he takes that literally, he goes to the shop and is mistaken for a worker, there he meets Jovi a fellow worker.That night, the human-elf hides in the store for hours and decorates it from head to toe like the North Pole; it is soon revealed that Santa is arriving at Gimbels that day to meet children, Buddy then gets a shock when he realises he is not the genuine Santa that he knows. Then a fight breaks out between Buddy and the imposter, he is sentenced to 24 hours in jail. Eventually, Walter bails him out and takes him for a DNA test, the test reveals Buddy is actually Walter's son, he then takes Buddy home to meet his step-mother (Emily) and step-brother (Michael). The human-elf shocks the family with his weird diet, his childlike personality and the insistence that he actually walked from the North Pole to New York. Buddy becomes friends with Michael after a snowball fight in Central Park, Mike persuades his brother to ask out Jovi, his crush. I don't want to ruin the end in case you watch the film so I'll leave it there. Like I said in my previous review, I love Christmas films but I have high standards. Elf certainly meets those standards, it is humorous  for both child and teen (I can't say adult, I'm not an adult). It keeps Christmas spirit and is cute, the perfect film to put your tree up while watching it, or eat mince pies while watching it, practically you can do any traditional Christmas thing you want while watching it. All the cast do well but mostly Will Ferrell plays a great part, it's like he was made to play Buddy, he has all the characteristics: humour, silliness, etc. So it's well done to Jon Favreau you made one of the best Christmas films I've seen! RATING: 8.0/10<br/><br/>Best parts: Arriving in New York Decorating Gimbels Snowball fight in Central Park"

Basically one of the elves is really a human who was adopted and he is convinced he is an elf until finally one day he comes to New York City to see his real father. I love how it takes a while before they finally accept it, even after yelling and the usual chaos.<br/><br/>I will have to rate this a 7/10 due to unfortunate language in the film.

","When an SNL movie comes out, I always worry that it's going to have a few ""good bits"" in it but struggle as far as genuine narrative is concerned. Take ""LADIES MAN,"" for instance. ""ELF"", on the other hand, rocked. It's both genuinely funny and sweet. It does have two problems, however. I think if they had a second chance to do this movie, they would get rid of the ""gross bits""--the long Coca-Cola burp, the drunken mailrroom romp, the eating of used chewing gum--and play up the elfin stuff like the snowgunslingering, the bond between brothers, the Elf's really sweet tooth, his sweet infantile love for his father, and give us more of Bob Newhart's very touching Papa Elf. The second problem is the very weak, overly theatrical nonsense at the end with Santa's sleigh and the singing (off-key!)in the park. I know they needed to somehow conclude the movie, but that ending was childish--I think they lost the adults in the audience on that one. On the whole it is still a movie I watch every chance I get--I just shut it off right before the end."

","Elf is one of those Christmas movies that you can't help but love. You don't have to be a fan of Will Ferrell to find this movie irresistible, mainly because it's so innocent. It's refreshing that Ferrell's first major studio film (next to Old School)after leaving the comforts of Saturday Night Live can be so appealing to all ages. 'Elf' never fails to make me laugh. To this day I get hysterical at the sight of a cotton ball. It's a film that's not intended to be Oscar worthy or thought provoking. 'Elf,' in all its hilarity helps us to see that life isn't as serious as we make it out to be and that the meaning of Christmas is completely forgotten when we allow the holidays to stress us out. It mayseem a deep meaning for such a farcical film, but the bottom line is,this movie just makes me feel good. It gives me an hour and half of good natured humor that never has to be censored and never fails to bring a smile to my face. So for those of you who dwell on this movie's ""flawed ending,"" I say look and see if instead of pointing out the bad, you can see the good in 'Elf.' Enjoy the keen sense of Christmas Spirit. After all, that's what Buddy would do."

","As an absolute non-fan of Will Ferrell's comedy, I was dragged kicking and screaming to this movie, so my enjoyment of it came as a huge surprise. Turns out it's more of an adult movie than a child-pleaser, and some good jokes were lost on my 11-yr-old daughter (though she loved the World's Longest Burp). There were some very funny bits, but my greatest delight came from James Caan as the straight man in this script -- after I saw him a completely phoned-in goon in ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" a few years ago, I never wanted to see him again, but he was terrific in ""Elf"". Peter Dinklage is dynamite as a very full-of-himself bestselling author. And Will Ferrell was cast so perfectly that I thoroughly enjoyed him, too. Yes, it's schmaltzy, but hey -- it's Christmas; the timing is perfect. 8/10"

","The first lead outing for Will Ferrell is a rare thing for modern times. A nice Christmas film with some real Christmas spirit that is also genuinely good. It has the right balance of being nice and festive while also being funny. Recent years have seen a depressing lack in good Christmas movies, with many just being straight to video or being too childish, like The Grinch. At Christmas time we should have Christmas movies. They have dried up though and when you look at Christmas TV listings there is a big lack there. True most are not very good but the best ones should be shown.<br/><br/>Elf is funny and charming. It's a nice, if derivative story. Seasonal films can rarely be all that original though. Elf however is better than most and has added in a few original touches. <br/><br/>Will Ferrell is superb, he's full of energy, he has charm and I can see a great future for him. While seasoned SNL veteran's like Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy are faltering, Will is just launching himself and it looks like he could be a good leading man to rival the likes of Jim Carrey. He's a great comedian and a superb physical comic too. James Caan is good too and so is Mary Steenburgen but Ferrell absolutely steals the show.<br/><br/>I look forward to Ferrell's future work and I think I may have to hire out Old School as well. ***1/2"

","I had to be talked into seeing this, but in the end it was a very worthwhile experience. It has probably been well over 10 years since I saw a ""G"" rated film that wasn't animated. I won't risk putting in any spoilers, but let's just say that there were a number of scenes that made me wonder how this film achieved a ""G"" certificate. This was a surprisingly sophisticated film, and I'm sure it will surprise no-one to learn that Will Ferrell carries the whole thing. The important thing is that he carries it extremely well. Its a standard ""fish out of water"" comedy, but well executed. Ferrell's intensity strikes a nice balance between mania and insanity, although he occasionally crosses the line as when he hissed at a department store ""Santa"" that he ""sat on a throne of lies"".<br/><br/>The supporting cast did well, doing as they should: stand aside and let Ferrell do his thing. Nevertheless, there was some nice performances there too. James Caan, playing Buddy's biological father, showed a lot of skill as the Straight Man. He got one of the biggest laughs of the film when he was all by himself, opening a present from Buddy.<br/><br/>Andy Richter and Kyle Gass made some brief, but hilarious, appearances."

","Elf is a thoroughly delightful holiday movie!  I expected it to be funny (thanks to Will Ferrell), but I didn't expect it to be so cute or heartwarming.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that Elf delivers the Christmas spirit without too much syrup (figuratively that is, since actual syrup appears quite often in the movie!), and is directed by Jon Favreau in the style of the best holiday films (including adorable sets at the North Pole and the appearance of traditional stop-motion Christmas characters).<br/><br/>Will Ferrell stars as Buddy, a naive and joyful (not to mention sugar-hyper) human adopted by one of Santa's helpers at a young age (many jokes are gleaned from his 6'4"" stature among the tiny elves).  At the age of 30, he heads to New York City to find his real father (played by James Caan), who appears, to Buddy's shock, on ""the naughty list.""  Hilarity ensues as Buddy adjusts to life in the big city, and everyone else in the cast adjusts to Buddy.<br/><br/>Ferrell does an amazing job portraying Buddy.  Although Buddy is almost constantly hyperactive and could quickly wear on your patience, Ferrell imbues him with a childlike wonder and innocence combined with just the right dose of his usual crazy comic self.  The children and adults in the theater laughed at all the right places, and there was a collective silence at those parts that made your heart melt.<br/><br/>The casting is inspired: James Caan, Ed Asner, and Bob Newhart all play their roles straight and with conviction, while Zooey Deschanel shines (though she may possibly be too young to play opposite Ferrell?).  Cameos from a couple of offbeat comedians just sweetened the deal.<br/><br/>I think this film could become another holiday classic, in the tradition of ""A Christmas Story"" (though it's not quite as universal to the human experience as that marvelous film).  All I know is that I walked out the theater full of the Christmas spirit and itching to see Elf again!"

","Of course, ""A Christmas Story"" is in a class by itself, as it's one of the best films ever made about growing up in America - not just a holiday flick. ""Elf"" is a more typical Christmas movie, just an unbelievably good one. I pity any other Christmas movies coming out this year; they will suck almost by default after this.<br/><br/>The secret, I think, are director Jon Favreau's smart choices. He keeps Will Farrell and James Caan in character 101% of the time - he never allows them to comment on their characters in any way. Both play it absolutely straight and it works like a charm. Favreau also deserves some Golden Genius Award for casting Ed Asner as Santa and Bob Newhart - one of our national treasures - as Farrell's adopted Papa Elf. Both are priceless and will be long remembered for this movie.<br/><br/>Favreau's other smart choice is to keep the length of most scenes very short; he gets in, gets the laugh and gets out. It's very easy for this type of movie to become embarrassing or even cruel for the ""special"" character at the center. Favreau knows this and never lets a scene drag on long enough for our amusement to turn to pity.<br/><br/>As a film in general, ""Elf"" isn't important enough to rate more than a 7 or 8, but as a Christmas movie, it's a 10+."

","Elf is supposed to be a comedy, but it's more along the lines of travesty. We're supposed to laugh every time Will Ferrel's character Buddy does something boneheaded, but I found myself cringing and moaning almost every time he showed up on screen. Relentless stupidity and disgusting sight gags are supposed to pass for humour here, and it seems to be the only trick Elf has up its sleeve. For example, in one scene Buddy chugs a bottle of Coke down and starts to burp continuously for 12 seconds. In another, he licks bird excrement off of a rail. Ugh.<br/><br/>This buffoonery continues for 97 minutes, and it never gets any less painful. I could comment on the acting, but I don't know what to say. The actors all do a perfect job of being unbearable. The camera-work and sound are both fine as well. In fact, the cinematography is the high point of the film. However, when the best thing about a movie is the camera angle, you know it stinks. Little kids will love it, though."

"richlbii","3","5","16","4 November 2003"," Great concept, poor delivery
","Saw a preview showing and have to say that I was disappointed in the final product.<br/><br/>""Elf"" is the story of Buddy (Will Farrell), who grows up at the North Pole after Santa finds him in his bag of toys after returning from another Christmas Eve. Buddy is raised as any other elf, but his human size starts to make life difficult. So off he goes to find his human father, played by James Caan. He soon finds that his real father already has a son that gets no attention.<br/><br/>The story concept is interesting enough, and for that reason the first 15 minutes (which show the back story up through Will Farrell's departing the North Pole) are fairly entertaining. The jokes about Buddy's size are not overplayed as they could have been. There's an effective scene that involves Buddy and jack-in-the-boxes that was understatedly funny.<br/><br/>Then, it all goes downhill. Farrell is effective as Buddy, doing a pretty good fish-out-of-water job in NYC. But a lot of the jokes that could have gone into the story seem left out. He seems to adjust way to quickly to his surroundings.<br/><br/>Things get a little better as Buddy discovers love, both for the opposite sex and for his long, lost father. But again it seems like the director misses what he was aiming for. There are a lot of missed opportunities to flush out James Caan's relationship with his young son. Instead we are quickly shown the distance between them, with very little else to go on.<br/><br/>The ending sequence is totally off the mark. The idea that Central Park would be deserted seems downright impossible, yet the movie progresses as if it's a real possibility.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie just doesn't deliver an its hilarious possibility."

"TheBlueHairedLawyer","2","3","9","20 December 2014"," Terrible movie, at least in my opinion
","I watched this film last night because I saw its high ratings and thought it might be kind of funny to watch over the holidays. But oh my god, it was terrible! Not only is it full of that hokey happy-joy Christmas cr*p, it also astonishes me how the hell it ever got a G-rating. It's got everything from fart jokes to the main character pulling his pants down to trolls getting drunk to swearing. Yeah yeah, I know some people find crude humor to be hilarious (society is failing), but I think crude humor is disgusting and it really makes a movie a hassle to watch when you have to endure loads of nasty jokes and things you don't want to see. It's just my opinion, like it or leave it, if you think I'm being too harsh on this movie then that's up to you. Maybe I sound like a prudish old lady or something but I'd rather be a prude than an ignorant, rude pig who gets a kick out of fart sounds and pervy jokes in movies.<br/><br/>I thought the plot was somewhat creative, but nothing to deserve the rating it has. The acting wasn't very good at all (yeah, sorry if I've offended all you Will Ferrel fanatics out there). The soundtrack was trashy and cheap, completely unoriginal, and I've already called up my mom and dad to thank them for not showing me this when I was a little kid (back in 2003 when it first came out). PARENTS, DON'T LET YOUR KIDS VIEW THIS GARBAGE. Stick with The Polar Express or A Charlie Brown Christmas. At least those movies can be funny and creative without being too cheesy and stupid!"
"lukegardiner1","10","2","5","4 March 2019"," Elf: A Modern Day Classic
","During the holiday season, a yearly tradition done by many is to watch holiday movies. A few of these classics include Home Alone, A Christmas Story, and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. However, I believe one to be above all the rest. Elf, which was released in 2003, is the greatest Christmas movie of all time. There's a reason why Elf is always played over and over again during the Christmas season. It's a true modern classic. Because of its strong characters, wonderful humor, and amazing atmosphere, Elf deserves the title as the greatest Christmas film ever made.
Possibly the most compelling element to make Elf the quintessential Christmas movie is the strong characters, and the relationships they have. The main character, Buddy, played by Will Ferrell, is a whimsical, happy-go-lucky, naive Christmas elf who lives in the North Pole. After finding out that he was adopted, he comes to New York City to find his real father. This character could have easily come off as obnoxious and annoying. However, it's quite the opposite. Buddy's kind-hearted innocence is what drives the film. His pure, bubbly, Christmas spirit clashes with the real world, which leads to some amazing moments, like when he eats the chewed gum off the rails to the subways. Buddy's father, Walter Hobbs, played by James Caan, is a stuck up, dull, and stern businessman who is the perfect contrast to Buddy's personality. Their interactions are some of the best of the film, because despite being complete opposites, their chemistry works extremely well. The doctor's office scene, for example, displays how different these characters really are. The whole time, Walter is trying to get Buddy to sit still for the doctor, but Buddy's hyper-activeness prevents this.
Jovie, portrayed by Zooey Deschanel, is another character that plays off of Buddy very well. When Buddy comes into the Gimbels store and meets her, she is creeped out at first. This leads to some hilarious situations , like the ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" scene, and the ""I'm in a store and I'm singing"" part. Eventually, Jovie warms up to him, and finds his childlike wonder very charming. (Spoiler), She even marries him in the end!
All of those characters are exceptional in their own way, but Buddy is the main reason why Elf is so amazing. In an article written by The Guardian, authors Dee Cannon and Lyn Gardner state that ""Great acting, like great writing, is often in the eye of the beholder, but audiences almost always know when they are in the presence of something special"" (Cannon and Gardner). When Elf was released in theaters, it was an instant hit, and Buddy captured the hearts of millions. This was due to Will Ferrell's acting, and it was so special that it can't be re-captured.
Another major factor why Elf is the greatest Christmas movie of all time is the stellar humor. I can safely say that there are about one or two jokes that did not land for me. The rest hit, and they hit hard. The key examples include when Buddy screams ""SANTA"" at the top of his lungs when the Gimbels store manager announces that Jolly Ol' Saint Nick will be arriving at 10 A.M., or when Buddy makes his famous candy spaghetti amalgamation. Both the New York and Gimbels montage, the mail room scene, the snowball scene, work clothes Buddy, and the ""Angry Elf"" scene are all so funny that they are impossible to describe. The wonderful aspect about each scene is the variety of comedy that is present. There is slapstick, dialogue, visual, and even subtle adult jokes. The scene that I find the funniest is when Buddy is walking towards the Gimbels store, and gets run over by the taxi. Now, at its core, this movie is about clashing the happy-go-lucky spirit of Christmas with the mundane parts of the real world. Not only does the scene portray that feeling perfectly, but it's also only a couple of seconds long. It starts with an exterior shot of the Gimbels store slowly panning down to the streets, while the song ""Sleigh Ride"" is playing. As the camera pans, we see Buddy walking in the middle of the street to get to the store. Then, the music stops abruptly, as Buddy get smacked by a Taxi, and his entire body shoots up vertically. He quickly gets up and exclaims ""Sorry!"" The scene is perfect because it represents the dichotomy of the film in a short and sweet way. They don't delve on the joke too long, and it is cartoonishly pulled off, which makes it even funnier.
While I have been praising the moments of the movie that everyone knows, there are MANY underrated moments in the movie. Some fantastic examples include when Buddy claims that he got a full 40 minutes of sleep, when Buddy tells his dad that he loves him, and Walter just says ""ok"", and when Buddy lights up every single button in the Empire State Building elevator and claims that ""It looks just like a Christmas Tree!""
Now, the icing on the cake that ensures Elf as the greatest Christmas movie of all time is the wonderful atmosphere presented in the film. This wonderful atmosphere can be traced back to Jon Favreau, who is the director of the film. When regarding Buddy, Jon was quoted with saying ""if I made the world that he was from as though he grew up as an elf in Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, one of those Rankin/Bass Christmas specials I grew up with, then everything fell into place tonally"" (Susman). Jon is one hundred percent right. By making the North Pole setting feel exactly like those old stop motion Christmas specials, it creates a innocent tone. Also, by creating a bustling and mundane New York City environment, the perfect dichotomy of fantasy and reality.
In the wide landscape of Christmas movies, there are a lot of gems. However, all of them pale in comparison to Elf. Elf deserves to be called the best Christmas movie of all time because of its compelling characters, witty humor, and amazing atmosphere. Elf is one of those films that have stood the test of time. It will continue to be enjoyed for generations to come."
"hugosoup","7","2","5","2 January 2019"," Elf is not great, but it is a good Christmas movie
","I've realized in the coming years that Elf is not amazing, but it is quite a bit above average for a Christmas film overall. The cast all put in great and wonderful performances, the humor can get a bit annoying, however the movie (for the most part) manages to be very funny at the same time, and although the story is a bit cliched, there are so many good, endlessly quotable lines. If I had to complain about one major thing, that would be the ending, which is pretty corny and schmaltzy to the point where it hurts. Most of the reviewers here who gave it a 6 or 7 like I'm doing here, agree and have come to this realization that the movie falters in its final act; while it's definitely not the worst ending ever, it could've been a lot better and less generic kitsch than most substandard Christmas movies. Besides that, which is my only other complaint, it is a good movie. Sure it may not be up there with the likes of It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, and A Christmas Story in terms of quality, but it is certainly better than most Christmas films out there. I give this one an overall score of 7.6-7.7/10 (Good). - Michael C"

It is a light hearted film and should entertain the whole family. String popcorn, eat popcorn, and make merry while watching this film. Buddy Elf tries so hard to fit into his new human family.

","A Wonderful Movie For All Ages<br/><br/>""Elf"" is one of the best holiday movies I have ever seen. It is a hilarious comedy that is great for all ages. The director Jon Favreau did a fantastic job with the plot line, comedy, and casting the roles for this movie. Buddy the elf played by Will Ferrell is really who makes this movie though.<br/><br/>For example this movie is about a baby orphan named Buddy(Will Ferrell) who finds his way into Santa's sack on Christmas Eve and is then raised as and elf in the North Pole. As Buddy (Will Ferrel) grows up he realizes he is different from the other elves and Santa finally thinks he is old enough to know he is not an elf and that his real dad lives in New York City. Buddy ( Will Ferrell) then goes on a quest to find his father (James Caan) who does not know he exists, but his elf like qualities don't exactly fit in in New York City. This movie is a great holiday movie with a fun plot line.<br/><br/>In addition, to a good plot line this movie also has hilarious comedy. On Buddy's journey to find his dad he is oblivious to everything going on around him. He has this cheerful enthusiastic attitude every where he goes and it makes this movie hilarious and an amazing experience to watch.<br/><br/>Although many people may think this is not one of Will Ferrel's best performances, this might be because they are used to his usual roles in more adult type movies. Elf is a great movie for all ages and is especially good for families. When you watch it you can just feel the Christmas spirit surrounding you.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I believe the actors that were casted in this movie had the perfect personalities for their roles. They all did a outstanding job and they are what make this movie so good. All of them put a lot of effort into their roles and play them very well.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is one of my all time favorite Christmas movies and will be shown on TV for the rest of our lives. I also believe it will become a classic that our kids will watch in the future. This is a need to see Christmas movie."

The story tells the tale of Buddy, a human who when a baby crawl into Santa Claus's sack while in a orphanage and gets adopted by Papa Elf. He grows with the Elves but finds it hard to fit in before he is told the truth about his dad who is living in a far away place of New York City in America (and is also on the naughty list). He heads to NYC to find his dad with a thrilling and hilarious adventure to come. Director by Jon Favreau (Zathura: A Space Adventure) and written by David Berenbaum (Disney's The Haunted Maison), the Christmas of the year features an all-star cast: with Will Ferrell (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy) as Buddy, James Caan (The Godfather) as Walter Hobbs, Bob Newhart (The Rescuers) as Papa Elf and Edward Asner (Roots) as Santa Claus.

","I never had the urge to watch Elf. I saw the adverts, thought it an over-americanised piece of tacky, vulgar crap. So when my music teacher decided she was going to make us watch it, I wasn't looking forward to it. The fact she claimed to have watched it 6 times since buying it, before I saw it, was worrying, and the fact she wanted to show it to her GCSE music class was just as odd. But she had bought us chocolate logs (there are only 10 people who take music) so we all settled down to watch it (""if anyone asks, we're studying film music!"").<br/><br/>And wow. I mean wow. This film was one of the funniest and most touching films (considering what I thought it would be) that I'd ever seen. There are so many scenes that made me laugh out loud to count. And I can truthfully say that at certain points at the end, our entire class went ""awww!"" (the fact that we're all girls shouldn't factor into this.) The advert for this film doesn't do it justice at all. There's a plenty of humour in it to satisfy any adult (or 16-year old) as well as the kiddie laughs.<br/><br/>Will Ferral makes this film what it is. His child-in-a-grown-mans performance is admirable and everyone said that they would marry him just for his sweetness in this film. That said, Zooey Deschanels snarling attitude definitely brought a satisfying ring to the film, with her witty put downs of Buddy the Elf and her portrayal of 'teen angst' is fantastic.<br/><br/>Watch this.

"johnnymonsarrat","4","2","5","29 December 2004"," Jon Monsarrat review: Slow, awful, not at all funny
","Elf is a throwaway comedy in which it feels like the actors aren't really trying. Every line is flat. The first 20 minutes of the film is in narrative format. Narrative is a crutch for a writer, it's the opposite of ""Show, don't tell"". There is something really off with the pacing.<br/><br/>And the bits with Bob Newhart looking sad and unenergetic are really boring. How can anyone find that funny? It shocks me deeply. Maybe the film picks up (as Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace did after the first 20 minutes). But I didn't get that far. I like the occasional kids film but this one was awful. For Will Ferrell films, see Anchorman instead.<br/><br/>Who should see Elf:<br/><br/>-- Kids only, and maybe not even kids<br/><br/>I'll give Elf a 4 out of 10 which is the highest rating I'll give a film I couldn't sit through all the way."
"shaffer-4","10","2","5","29 December 2004"," Thought I'd groan - but I guffawed instead!
","I have to say, the negative comments for this movie are out of line - way out of line. Especially since, based on the promos, I expected them to be right on the money. If I'd read those reviews before seeing the movie, I never would have gone to see it. Hold on - that's exactly what happened until now.<br/><br/>Am I glad a local theater was having a free screening for kiddies and my six-year-old dragged me to see it. I have not seen a movie that provided so many belly laughs in years. I will now go buy the DVD.<br/><br/>I am a newly converted Will Farrell fan, surprised to find myself saying so. Elf was jam-packed with subtle (sometimes even cerebral) humor I hadn't expected. I braced myself for the typical sophomoric toilet humor mixed with not-so-thinly-veiled sexual innuendo which seems to pass for comedy lately. Imagine my thrill to find the lowest comedy in this film to be an unimaginably long belch followed by a line that even drew a ""HA!"" from prissy me.<br/><br/>OK, the reference to the short-statured man as an elf was pretty predictable, and in my opinion not terribly funny. But along with the eating of gross things, it apparently was there to toss a bone to those whose idea of humor might not have developed at the same rate as their physiques, and it certainly didn't cross the line the way some ""family films"" have.<br/><br/>If you are a parent or family-oriented person who is looking for a wholesome good time with a fun Christmas message to get you in the spirit, this is a must-have for your video collection.<br/><br/>If you are a would-be ""artiste"" or pseudo-intellectual who considers Spielberg a ""hack"", or if you prefer the frat-boy humor of lighting farts, and jokes about bodily functions, this is definitely not the show for you. You'll only relate to about 1/8 of the humor, and those parts are really intended for the younger audience. Also, you won't find sex, drugs or deep relationship twists. They managed to leave out angst and ""life sucks"" issues and don't even try to give any kind of ""film noir"" feel to a single scene. Nobody dies, and the only people who take themselves too seriously are the bad guys. There is a brief moment of ""violence"" in the toy store spat, but it really won't stack up to ""The Matrix"".<br/><br/>So use your common sense. This is a feel-good Christmas comedy, rated G for the whole family. If you want something dark and gritty, or something with inane low-brow humor, watch something else. Why would you watch a G-rated Christmas movie and expect anything other than light-hearted, somewhat predictable fun with a happy ending? This film goes the extra mile with Farrell avoiding the trap of overacting, and balancing his right-on-without-quite-going-over-the-top character with the understated, inarguable talents of the rest of the cast. This is combined with special effects that are so well executed they go almost unnoticed (rather than slapping you in the face, they quietly contribute to the story, adding to the atmosphere rather than taking over the scenes).<br/><br/>PS: I never thought I'd buy ""Lou Grant"" as Santa, but Ho-Ho-Ho-Boy was I wrong! -- OOPS. Too Punny; not funny. Trust me, the writers of Elf were much more skilled in their scripting!"

It had a pretty well strung together plot and a lot of humor in-between. As a baby Buddy (Will Ferrell) crawls into Santa's bag at the orphanage and the elves decided to keep him. But one day buddy notices that he's six feet tall. His elf father(Bob Newhart) tells him were to find his real father (James Caan) , in New Your City. So Buddy goes in surch of his father. It kept me laughing up until about 20 minuets from the end. By that time I guess they had to tie it all up some how, it is still worth seeing. 8/10 Some mild language and crude humor that parents may want to look into before getting for young children."

","I'm sure most of us could admit we have stretched our legs out into an almost split position while getting on an escalator or hopped across a crosswalk only touching the white squares. Or maybe even yelled out ""Santa! I know him!"" when you see one at a local mall, all because of this hilarious film we saw years ago and still continue to watch today around the holiday season. The movie Elf, featuring the hysterical Will Ferrell, is unforgettable for most. As we watch a so called ""elf"" adventure from the North Pole to find his biological father in New York City. Although this adventure isn't as smooth as you might think. A six foot tall elf named Buddy who claims he's pals with Santa and wears a green elf suit with neon yellow tights underneath, hopping around the crosswalks of Manhattan, doesn't fly with most uptight New Yorkers who are rushing to their next location.<br/><br/>Thanks to his perpetual sugar rush, we see Buddy run around the streets, stores, and malls of New York as his dad sends him away so he can continue to work. After much convincing and a doctor visit, Walter, Buddy's father is confirmed his real dad. He treats Buddy with little respect and love initially, but grows to know and love him more and more throughout the film.<br/><br/>Directed by Jon Favreau this film highlights the sweet stuff, looking into family background and overcoming past issues by discovering the history of their family roots and spending quality time with one another. Plus maybe a blood test or two!<br/><br/>Will Ferrell does a fantastic acting job as he seems to have a passion for his character Buddy, never playing him down to be too much of a nut job. Will is always in action, waving to hardened New Yorkers and doing circles in revolving doors, he is really quite hilarious. The script is killer as well; a film where most people you know can quote a line, as he uses funny and memorable phrases to captivate the audience and make you chuckle.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the costumes. Considering this movie came out in 2003, the fashion sense was quite different than now but they fit the directors purpose. Buddy struts his uniform of an elf suit, bright tights, and a pointy hat daily, which is fitting and quite laughable.<br/><br/>Lastly I'd like to touch on the overall setting throughout the film. It was a bit animated and dull to start off with at the North Pole, for example a weird-looking narwhal popping up out of fake water to wish Buddy good luck on his journey to find his father, was a bit unnecessary I'd say. But after Buddy arrives, it develops into a beautiful and festive New York background with glimmering streets and snowy nights.<br/><br/>One of the best parts of the film is the music, it's familiar, holiday themed, and filled with upbeat sing alongs that are well known by most. A song can do a lot in a film, it enhances the good and the bad. It makes a happy moment more happy or a sad moment more sad. Overall music can affect one's emotions more than the actual scene itself. Elf's music choices really get you in the Christmas spirit!<br/><br/>Sure, Elf is a predictable ending and maybe a bit too feel-good, but overall an extraordinary movie with few complaints. It covers issues on biological family, and is a witty Christmas movie entertaining to family and warming to the heartstrings of the audience, after Walter finally accepts his son. Besides, if it ended any differently it would be like finding coal in your stocking on Christmas morning."

","I've seen a lot about Elf, but I hadn't ever seen it before. I actually was expecting something slightly different from Elf. I haven't seen Will Ferrell, so I had some weird expectations. For some reason I thought Elf would be intended for adult audiences. Now, well, it's not simply for kids, but it is a film for the whole family, which means it has a lot of themes kids appreciate more than adults. By that I mean such typical holiday spirit that grows towards the end - and how adults in the film aren't interested in Xmas or their children and blah blah. Sure, that is unfortunately true, but it has been used so many times in films it's becoming boring.<br/><br/>Sure, Elf had some originality. The idea of an elf adjusting to human life is silly but interesting. Of course the theme of that idea has been explored over and over again, but adding the Xmas feeling to it makes it different from the typical theme. <br/><br/>The story goes on the same way every single comedy film seems to go. It is funny until the end where it's almost sad because something goes so badly wrong, but in the end everything is alright again! I saw that pattern even before I was half-way through the film. <br/><br/>But then again, it's a Xmas comedy film for the whole family. How could that be original? So when thinking of that, Elf was an alright film."

","Orphan Buddy (Will Ferrell) sneaks in Santa (Edward Asner)'s bag and ends up in the North Pole. Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) raises Buddy as an elf. His giantness causes all kinds of problems.

He gets a job at a store and befriends fellow worker Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).<br/><br/>Childlike Will Ferrell is giving off so much joy and innocence. He is so silly that it is impossible to not laugh at his slapstick humor. He fully commits and that's what makes it so hilarious. The only minor difficulty lies with James Caan.

"Lejink","7","1","2","14 December 2009"," Your very good elf...
","A delightful Christmas fantasy for all the family, proof that latter-day Hollywood can still knock out a charming festive film, just like in the old days.<br/><br/>Sharing with the classic ""Miracle on 34th Street"" its New York department store setting, the story here is as improbable as any you'll encounter on any Feast of Stephen you care to mention. But forget that and just enjoy Will Ferrell accomplishing a wide-eyed but never over-played naiveté rarely seen since Jimmy Stewart in ""Harvey"" as the innocent elf (actually a human baby born out of wedlock) abroad, attempting to bond with his curmudgeonly old dad this particular Christmas (of course!).<br/><br/>Thus Buddy's many humorous adventures and encounters with the people, sights and sounds of New York naturally take us on an emotional roller-coaster ride but by the end of the movie, as if you didn't know, he's gotten a pretty co-worker (the wonderfully named Zooey Deschanel) to fall in love with him, made up big-time with his dad and just for good measure restored Christmas spirit to all and sundry in a nice, even exciting conclusion, which gives us the memorable sight of Santa's sleigh taking off over Central Park so that old Saint Nick can get on with his naughty or nice list.<br/><br/>The casting is very good, James Caan, like fellow 70's tough guy De Niro before him, adapting neatly to family comedy, with in support, the ever-lovely Mary Steenburgen as his too-good-for-him wife and old MTM stalwarts Bob Newhart and Ed Asner, even more improbably as Buddy's adopted elf-father and Santa Claus respectively. Ferrell makes the film though, his wide-eyed wonder infectious right from the outset. The only real drawback for me really was the too-obvious product placement inserts. Otherwise, the film stays away from maudlin sentimentality particularly in its treatment of children and is filled with uplifting Christmas music, settings and spirit, rarely stooping to vulgarity for its laughs (okay, we do get a couple of near-obligatory flatulence and burping jokes, but that's okay, kids love 'em!).<br/><br/>I heartily recommend anyone in need of a Christmas tonic to watch ""Elf"" and bring out your inner-child."

Buddy soon realizes that he is a human, and begins the search for his father. His father is living in New York, with a new family.

So Buddy tries to get acceptance from his father and his family and succeeds with his everyone else but his father. Buddy wreaks havoc and falls in love with a department store Elf(the great Zooey Deschanel). <br/><br/>Elf is a fun Christmas movie. I don't think it is as good as Ron Howard's Grinch movie or bob Clark's A Christmas story, but the film works. Will Ferrell is pretty convincing and the film will get you in the Christmas spirit. The performances are good and it's a cute film. Jon Faverau somehow always tries to bring silliness of some sort into his movies. He does a good job here. I give Elf a big thumbs up. <br/><br/>Elf: ***/****"
"Whythorne","7","1","2","10 January 2009"," Funny, enjoyable and...if only!
","One of the best of the more recently-made Christmas movies, ""Elf,"" for the most part, impressed me as a throwback to wholesome, quality holiday movies of the past. I say ""most part"" because the last fifth of the film suddenly switches gears and turns from being about Elf and his relationship with his dad into the sappy and clichéd ""do you believe in Santa Claus"" routine reminiscent of ""the Polar Express."" <br/><br/>Up until that point, though, the film is consistently funny and enjoyable with Will Ferrel playing the title character to innocent and charming perfection. There are lots of funny scenes and bits, following each other one after another. Most of the cast is excellent, especially with James Caan's straightforward, deadpan portrayal as Elf's dad. (The lone exception is Santa played by Ed Asner, who comes off as a grumpy, unappealing curmudgeon.)<br/><br/>But-drat! If not for that ending, this is the kind of movie I otherwise would love to have as part of my Christmas DVD collection."

","I signed on to this site now to check if Will Ferrell received any awards for his portrayal of Elf. He really tapped into his inner child for this one, because he is spot-on in this role. Its a difficult job for any adult actor to convey such innocent charm. The supporting characters are good, the directing very good, and the writing is excellent. I loved the run home to hide in his bathroom in his undersized house when he had his feelings hurt. The film was weaker in its second half, but Will Ferrell makes Elf such an endearing character that I've watched it repeatedly for just that.I really don't care for Will Ferrell's other movies or characters, but this was a wonderful performance!"

","Why is British Christmas TV so damned depressing?There is an annual Yuletide Cull in all our favourite soaps,characters we have let into our homes for months or years get raped,pillaged,bludgeoned or stabbed or emotionally destroyed with indecent haste over a four day period,leaving us rubbing our eyes with disbelief.Of all the Christmas Specials only ""The Royle Family"" was even vaguely uplifting.As Jim Royle would say,""Happy Christmas - my ar*e!""So in desperation I scoured ""Radio Times""(other listings magazines are available)for a movie to get me out of the slough of despond.""Santa Claus - the movie"" lasted 10 minutes,a multitude of ""Chrismas Carol"" clones had me reaching for the Amontillado.""A matter of life and death""?A fine movie but hardly likely to warm the cockles of my heart........""Elf""?Never heard of it.With nothing to lose except my taste for mince pies I turned to Filmfour as I have so often done more in hope than anger before.Bingo!! ""Elf"" is 100% a Christmas movie.It has elves in it(honest!),reindeer,some cute North Pole creatures including a wonderfully surreal narwhal that pops its head out of the water to say farewell to Buddy(Mr W.Ferrell) as he leaves on his Odyssey to the Big Apple. Chief amongst the elves is the wonderfully laconic Mr B.Newhart - remembered with affection by my generation for his brilliantly inventive one - sided telephone conversations.His is the voice - over that helps the story move along. What I loved most about ""Elf"" was its unremitting optimism,its belief in the inherent decency of mankind despite all the evidence to the contrary not only in 2003 but even more so today. It has all the wonder and innocence of childhood and the deeply - held conviction that we lose rather than gain wisdom as we grow older. Mr J.Caan,splendid as Buddy's natural father, is a deeply suspicious man totally unable to accept his newly - acquired son at face value.Miss M.Steenburgen - perhaps more in touch with her inner child - has an immediate empathy with him.Here is an actress who has grown more beautiful and honest as she has got older. With all the best bits from many earlier Christmas movies lovingly embedded,""Elf"" is a pure pleasure for adult or child. Together with its diametric opposite,""Scrooged"",it will certainly play at my house for many Christmasses to come,and as far as I'm concerned the BBC can go and jump for their licence fee next year."
"Electrified_Voltage","7","1","2","22 November 2008"," Sometimes unsurprisingly cheesy, but an overall impressive Christmas comedy
","I have now seen a bunch of movies starring former ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian Will Ferrell, but it took me a while to get around to seeing this one, even though I have now been aware of its existence for probably about three years. It's getting to be that time of year again, and just yesterday, I finally rented ""Elf"", not exactly sure how impressed I would be. It could have easily turned out to be yet another cheesy, boring family movie from recent years, but while it may seem like that at times, it usually isn't. It's sometimes cheesy, and certainly not consistently hilarious, but I'm still impressed.<br/><br/>One Christmas Eve, a baby boy at an orphanage is placed in his crib shortly before Santa comes. When Santa is not looking, the baby crawls into his sack and stows away to the North Pole, which is where he's finally discovered in that sack! The elves name him Buddy, after the label on his diaper, and Papa Elf volunteers to raise him. So, Buddy grows up at the North Pole, living the life of an elf, and still thinking he's one of them, even though he's a lot bigger than the others, and can't make toys nearly as fast as them. After finally finding out that he's actually a human, he learns about his real father, Walter Hobbs, who is a children's book publishing executive in New York, and doesn't even know Buddy was born! Buddy learns from Santa that Walter is on his naughty list, due to his selfishness, and the human raised by elves sets out to New York to find his father and change him. Obviously, this won't be easy, and it doesn't help that Buddy has never experienced the human world that awaits.<br/><br/>The film starts out with an opening narration from Papa Elf, which certainly isn't the best part, and the segment where he says how trolls once worked for Santa, but they weren't toilet trained, showing an example with a troll in a diaper, may suggest the film is going to be another cheap gross-out comedy for kids. But hey, not so fast! The vast majority of the film is definitely NOT like that! I got some BIG laughs out of this movie, I think starting with some of the gags that involve Buddy's life as a grown human at the North Pole. I definitely laughed pretty hard when the main character meets a raccoon on his way to New York and tries to be affectionate with it! After he arrives in the city, the things he does there, being unfamiliar with life in a community like this, a lot different from the North Pole, are also good for laughs. Some of the gags I didn't care much for, including Buddy spinning around in a revolving door until he throws up in a garbage can, but for the most part, Will Ferrell's antics in the lead role didn't fail to amuse me. Interesting story as well.<br/><br/>Being about Santa and his elves at the North Pole, one might think ""Elf"" is strictly for kids, and I guess I thought that might be the case. However, overall, I would say it has enough to please both child and adult viewers, not ALL of them of course (it's obviously not for the many Will Ferrell haters out there), but a lot of them. Now, there are obvious reasons why this movie is rated PG, a great example being Jovie (an employee at Gimbels, a clothing store in New York) singing in the shower, and Buddy coming into the restroom to sing along, not realizing she's naked! I found this to be another comedic highlight in the film, but parents might want to be cautious. Anyway, while this movie clearly isn't perfectly clean family fun, I would say it's close enough to it, and a lot better than the last Christmas movie I watched, ""Deck the Halls"", that's for sure"
"Floated2","7","1","2","5 October 2008"," Really nice movie
","When i first thought about seeing this film, I was expected it to be some cheesy Christmas movie where Will Ferrell acts like an idiot but i was pretty wrong. Will Ferrell's character is a 30 year elf and he acts as if he hasn't seen humans..Although some of his acting is a little over the top he plays his character well. But other than that, the movie is a really nice Christmas movie. Its a classic Christmas story.<br/><br/>In the beginning it starts out a little boring but then it picks up the pace and the movie gets more interesting. It starts better when Buddy (Will Ferrell) goes and moves out of his elf home and decides to find he's real dad in New York...This movie isn't really funny but it has some funny scenes. For example when Buddy goes to the mall and see's Santa Clause for the first time but he notices that its an impostor, then they start fighting...Another funny scene is when Buddy hangs out with his brother Michael after school then they see bullies throwing snow balls at them, so Buddy starts making a ton of snow balls then they start firing back at them and the bullies leave and run away. That was classic The movie is a really nice film but it has its mistakes, anyway great work"
"moviemanMA","8","1","2","27 July 2005"," ""Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?""
","Christmas movies go into two categories. There are the ones that become classics and sometimes become a part of a family's Christmas tradition. Then there are the ones that are just there for the season, like the ones made for TV or just some that have been forgotten. This movie is definitely one that will become an instant success in your house around the holidays.<br/><br/>Elf is the story of Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell) who is essentially the spirit of Christmas as we like to see it. Buddy is a human living in the North Pole because he found his way into Santa's sack of toys. Growing up around elves, he began to notice some differences between him and the other elves. When Buddy's adoptive father Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) tells Buddy that he isn't an elf, he sets out on a journey to New York City to find his father Walter (James Caan), the publisher of children's books who doesn't really know the meaning of Christmas.<br/><br/>During his time in NYC, Buddy shacks up with Walter and his family. He gets a job working as a department store worker in their Christmas department. There he meets Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), the girl who catches Buddy's eye with her kindness and great personality. Buddy tries to get his father off of Santa's naughty list and bring his family closer together.<br/><br/>Ferrell is absolutely perfect as Buddy. His childish character is hilarious and what better than letting a ""kid"" run free in New York City. A place full of new experiences like traffic, rotating glass doors, and elevators. His character really does embody the spirit of Christmas. To be good, sing songs, and celebrate. Although Christmas has gone commercial, this movie is a great way to feel good around the holidays. The relationship between Buddy and his father is an awkward one at first, but grows over time. Whenever they are near each other it is a laugh riot. Ferrell is always hilarious and truly makes the movie. Nobody could have been Buddy better than Will.<br/><br/>Elf is a joy to watch over and over again. Soon after you see it you will be quoting it all day long. It's addictive in a good way. Ferrell has been on a roll with movies as of late and this is a Will at his best. He makes being a big kid look easy and fun. Elf has comedy and is appropriate for the whole family. This movie will make you feel all warm inside even in the North Pole. Elf is a winner."
"camachoborracho","7","1","2","23 November 2004"," Weak third act dwarfs otherwise great film
","MINOR SPOILERS<br/><br/>Although calling this film ""instant holiday classic"" is somewhat premature, that is not to say that ""Elf"" doesn't have its great moments. The only thing that keeps it from being entirely wonderful is its schmaltzy third act, which seems to give up after so much energy that the film had before and give it a Hollywood ending instead.<br/><br/>Elf is a fresh take on an old premise of someone/thing leaves the North Pole because they feel out of place, and many viewers will probably be reminded of Dudley Moore's performance as Patch in ""Santa Claus: The Movie"" (1985). Only in this one, Ferrell's ""Buddy"" is really not an elf and so he is out of place at ""home"" but has grown up under elves and so seems out of place in the ""real world"" as well. Simple, yet effective.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell brings a lot of the magic to this film as ""Buddy"" since he can so easily portray childhood glee and make it seem natural and make you smile at it - others have tried and been less successful. James Caan is also good as his crotchety father on the ""naughty list"" - he's got a good soul deep down but he's selfish and greedy, as you would expect a foil in Christmas movies to have. All is well and seems plausible even with Caan's character taking in Buddy since he IS his son despite him thinking he is crazy and annoying. There are some great scenes - one I really enjoyed was the mail room scene in which Buddy and a worker who looks like he escaped prison drink coffee with ""maple syrup"" and revert to drunken glee, a classic moment that made me smile. I only wish this type of scene was apparent towards the end. <br/><br/>So what makes the third act weak? It is schmaltzy as I have said: Caan's character, who kicks out Buddy in a harsh way, suddenly has a change of heart because his other son comes in and calls him selfish before his nasty boss on Christmas Eve. This didn't work since it didn't seem like Caan cared about Buddy and REALLY wanted/needed this job and yet he up and quits. THEN to add to the cheese, there are scenes where Buddy's love interest sings and gets people of New York to sing thereby adding belief in Christmas again, thus saving Santa and therefore Christmas and therefore the world. The whole thing of Caan publishing a story from the whole thing and succeeding ties it up nicely though (and reminds me of Misery, in which he played an author -wierd), but that half hour before that needs to change since the pacing and events drag here and seem routine and cliché, which was disappointing.<br/><br/>Also I have to add I enjoyed the claymation characters and Bob Newhart since he seemed like the perfect adopted father. I recommend that the studios remake this film in a few years but change the cheesy last third (but keep the first two) and they will then have a classic.<br/><br/>OVERALL RATING: 7 of 10 stars. Worth a watch or two for fans of Christmas, family comedy and/or Will Ferrell, but be forewarned of a cheesy ending."
"film-critic","5","1","2","20 November 2004"," You sit on a throne of lies!
","This review took me some time to write, rewrite, and confirm my thoughts. Over the course of two days, I had to think about this film to make sure that I was putting my correct words down on paper. This film was reminiscent of an airplane take-off. As the plane begins for take-off it taxis around the runway (opening credits) and then gets its engines up to full throttle before eventually lifting into the air (the beginning of the film), but once in the air, we coast and outside of some brief turbulence, you have a smooth flight the rest of the trip. That is how I felt about the film Elf. Director Favreau (of Swingers fame) bursts onto this film with such raw imagination and humor that by the time he gets to New York City, he is panting for air and eventually tired of the entire endeavor. With a medium to medium rare Ferrell, Favreau starts this story with amazing imagery, some moments of classic Christmas television memories, and powerful creativity, but in the end it all reads like a Hollywood playbook. Everyone is in their positions, let's play a good game.<br/><br/>Ferrell is a very funny actor. In fact, I praise him for the return of the 'funny' comedy with his work in Anchorman, but in this film it just feels as if he is going through the motions without the emotion. You could tell that he just didn't feel as comfortable in his role of Buddy as he did as Ron Burgundy. Farrell, and perhaps it was more the writers fault, provided no really memorable lines that the kids will be quoting for years to come nor did he do anything that wasn't already expected of him. I don't think this was his sled, for lack of a better word. Then again, perhaps it didn't work for me because he didn't have the backup he needed. Ferrell is one of those comic geniuses that play off other actors very well and some of the most memorable Ferrell moments are when he is ad-libbing with others. James Caan was a horrible choice as the father. He is cranky, yes, but not from acting. I couldn't help but cringe when I saw him at the end of this film, he was pathetic. I couldn't tell if he was interested in this film, or just needed some extra cash. I felt the same about the rest of the cast that surrounded Ferrell. Deschanel and Steenburgen were completely miscast and literally just walked through the motions spewing lines from their mouths to pay for their new car. The best example is when Zooey says to Ferrell, 'You missed' during the romantic scene. It was worse than poor and amateurish. Wasted talent from Sedaris and Richter only angered me further. The only saving actor from this entire film was Dinklage. He was hysterical and commanded the screen for the few minutes he was on literally stealing the scene from Ferrell. It was a plus in an already full film of minuses.<br/><br/>For this film to really be pinnacle Christmas achievement, it needed some powerful writing that would just have you in your seat laughing because of the words behind Ferrell. Sadly, that could not be found in this film. There wasn't enough originality in the script to make this film really stand out. I saw a glimmer of it when the film began with some of the CGI animals, but that was lost indefinitely after the first ten minutes. When I first started watching this film, I saw it as a combination of all of our favorite Christmas programs. This perception ended when Buddy made it to New York. Riding in a cliché drawn horse and sleigh, we follow Buddy through New York as he attempts to bring humor to the simplest of situations. It felt as if when Favreau found a joke, he never let it go, nearly killing the fun each time. The syrup joke is the first that comes to mind. The second was entire Central Park episode. Everyone involved couldn't pick up the pieces from that 'crash and burn'.<br/><br/>While it sounds like I am sitting here furiously upset with this film, I am not. I went into the film with high expectations, but was left with only medium results. Ferrell was funny, but not Ferrell-funny. He was scripted, almost to the point where you could count his beats. This was a holiday movie, but not one that will be played over and over again in this house. Overall, it was disappointing, but thanks to a little help from Dinklage, it seemed just a tad bit better. <br/><br/>Grade: *** out of *****"

","Elf was better than I expected, and when it got going, it became good. Nothing amazing, or spectacular, but good. It entails a charming comic charm and Will Ferrel was superb as Buddy. I do have one major gripe about this movie though, its production design (in the North Pole scenes). Its blatantly obvious it was low-budget, to me it had little charm, only the actors did that. I especially loathed the awful animatronics, the kind you'd see on a day-time BBC kids program, cheap plastic toys made to look integral with the actors, it was a major setback in my opinion. I think its $30m budget should have been bumped to $40m, and it would have made for more charming and magically inventive sets. <br/><br/>7/10"

","I went to see this movie with my family expecting something icredibly stupid and unenjoyable.  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised!  The humor was for both adults and children, and there was a great family message throughout the film.  I would absolutely recommend Elf to families looking for a nice way to spend a free afternoon during the holidays.  This was one of the better Christmas films I've seen in a long time."
"jpintar","7","1","2","21 November 2003"," Funny
","I decided to see this movie instead of the overhyped Cat In The Hat.  From what I read, I made a good choice.  I though Will Ferrell was funny on SNL (it has suffered in his absence) and he is funny here too.  I actually believed he was this oversized elf looking for his natural father.  And it turns out to be Sonny Corleone (actually James Caan, the actor who played Sonny in The Godfather though that would be a movie worth seeing).  Many people think Caan is miscast, but I don't agree.  Caan is a perfect cynic to Ferrell's believer.  The other interesting casting is Bob Newhart as an elf and Ed Asner as Santa Claus.  It's interesting to see them in a movie like this.  See this movie again and again.  7/10"
"Ronin47","8","1","2","20 November 2003"," A Christmas movie that doesn't suck! (***1/2)
","Good Christmas movies are a rare find, great Christmas movies even more rare. At this point, I wouldn't yet count ""Elf"" among my very favorite Christmas movies, like ""A Christmas Story"", ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" or ""Ernest Saves Christmas"" (that's right, I said ""Ernest Saves Christmas""), but I really loved it, and I think that it may join those other movies once it ages a bit. It really is that good.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is definitely an acquired taste, but it's hard to imagine anyone who wouldn't be amused and delighted by his very enjoyable performance as Buddy, a human who was raised by elves in the North Pole after he crawled into Santa's toy bag as a baby.<br/><br/>Thirty-or-so years later, when Buddy has outgrown his elf surroundings, Papa Elf (a droll Bob Newhart) suggests he go to New York City to find his real father (James Caan).<br/><br/>Naturally, there are no big curveballs thrown at the audience. There are lots of fish-out-of-water jokes, an innocent romance with a co-worker (Zooey Deschanel, who is great and looks much better with blonde hair than I expected), and a heartwarming ending, as expected. But this isn't the kind of movie that needs to be extra-original, and it more than makes up for its lack of originality with huge amounts of heart and charm.<br/><br/>Having a pro actor/filmmaker like Jon Favreau directing (and not just some hack) is also definitely a plus. He gives a formulaic Christmas movie style and feeling, filling the soundtrack with lots of big band jazz and assembling a great supporting cast that also includes Mary Steenburgen, Faizon Love, Peter Dinklage, Andy Richter and KG! (Tenacious D fans will know who I'm talking about)<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very fun, very pure movie that I heartily recommend to anyone who, like me, thinks that most Christmas movies suck. This is the real deal, and I know that because it made me feel like a kid again."
"ctopher","7","1","2","17 November 2003"," too many product placements
","This isn't a full review, I just wanted to point out the one thing about this movie that I thought was annoying -- the product placements.  It starts out at the North Pole with the Monopoly games, Barbie Dolls, Etch-a-Sketch toys, and it just got worse. There was a bottle of Coca-Cola, a box of Pop-Tarts, a jar of M&Ms, Lite-Brite toys, and Legos. Oh yeah -- I forgot the Isotoner gloves and the authentic NFL jersey. I'm sure that I have even forgotten a few.  This movie was over the top in terms of the number of product placements, it really became distracting after a while.<br/><br/>The positive comment that I will make is that it was fun to see Andy Richter and Kyle Gass get bit parts."

","This is a truly funny tribute to MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET and RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER. The references to RUDOLPH are very clear, but if you haven't seen that one, you'll still find this a funny movie. If you remember the seventies, you'll feel a certain nostalgia, what with the presence of Ed Asner, Bob Newhart and, as the voice of a Burl Ives snowman counterpart, Leon Redbone. (The snowman even looks like Leon Redbone, just as RUDOLPH's snowman resembles Burl Ives.) James Caan shows an ability with pathos and Will Ferrell has a silent movie comedian's ability to appear simultaneously naive and knowing. I also like the fact that the department store in this is the now-defunct Gimbel's. I understand this was the case because Macy's wanted script changes. It works as a New York movie, too.

"midge56","2","2","8","22 November 2015"," Absolutely Terrible
","I loved ""The Santa Clause"" trilogy & bought this movie thinking it would be similar. It was NOT.<br/><br/>Some of the worst scriptwriting & dialogue ever. Almost perverse in the way this supersized man wanted to hug, snuggle & play tickle games with every grown man he encountered. Will Ferrell was a real turn off in this movie. I would not want a child to see this movie.<br/><br/>It is one thing that a human was raised by elves & was out of his element in the human world, but this human has the maturity level & IQ of a Turnip. He is an oversized, overgrown adult human behaving like a 5 year old who is rude, obnoxious, destructive and goes out of his way to insult & embarrass the other cast members. Let us also not forget he is running around in leotards and a short jacket. Quite disturbing.<br/><br/>Even if he was elf sized, he would not be sitting in the adopted elf father's lap as a full grown adult. This depicts him as mentally unstable with an IQ of 50 & the mentality of a kindergartener in the body of a 40 year old man.<br/><br/>He is rude, disruptive, does not follow instructions, attacks & insults people and destroys his fathers home to the point where he could not be left home alone. Frankly, any normal person would have had him committed to the asylum. He clearly had no business being out in public without someone to accompany him. It also made no sense that the elves would have allowed him to go alone to the human world with no traveling companion to chaperone him.<br/><br/>This movie is offensive. Not funny. A terrible script & I hope to never see Ferrell again.<br/><br/>If the script had cast the elf as a mature, intelligent 15 year old boy who was escorted by another elf to meet his human father, the story might have worked with a lot of behavior editing. This mentally deficient intellectually challenged, overgrown 40 year old in tights doing stupid things like eating cotton balls at the doctors office & pouring syrup on spaghetti & sending his father a negligee simply were not funny. These Jim Carey slapstick & 3 stooges style script was not amusing.<br/><br/>Additionally, it is one thing for the human raised by elves to be disoriented with customs & surroundings; and quite another to behave like a loudmouth child with bad manners & mentally defective. It was like watching Lily Tomlin's ""Edith Ann"" character. Ferrell also made it worse by grossly overacting his childish behavior.<br/><br/>This 6' 2"" forty year old human elf literally sat in his tiny adopted elf fathers lap, crushing him (this was a visual effect. I am referring to the visual concept of him sitting in the elf dad's lap at his age & size). Whether he was human or elf, he should have behaved his age instead of a Jim Carey version of Lily Tomlin's ""Edith Ann"".<br/><br/>It was sickening. Clearly, the producers hired bloggers to artificially pump up their reviews."
"Nixonbrian42","3","2","8","8 December 2012"," Zooey was the highlight
","I watched this mainly because of Zooey. She's beautiful and the scene where she's singing in the shower was the best scene in the film. The salute to the old classic puppetry animation Christmas specials near the beginning was superb. The snowball fight was pretty cool. There is quite a few scenes in this that had great potential. What's wrong with this film is simple. Casting Will Ferrell in the lead severely damaged what could have been a hysterical Christmas comedy. People are being overly nice to it because it's a holiday film. There is a lot of talent here; Zooey Deschanel, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, even the kid is good. Unfortunately Will Ferrell wasn't any good. He isn't funny.<br/><br/>I guess Jim Carrey cost too much or something. He was brilliant in The Grinch and in A Christmas Carol. He even worked with Zooey in Yes Man and their chemistry was right on the money. This should have starred Jim. Jim Carrey in the lead would have made the film much better and definitely much funnier.<br/><br/>Anyway, to sum up, don't expect to laugh at Will unless your intent is to pass on sympathy for his unfunny performance since it is a holiday film."
"Oosterhartbabe","3","2","8","25 December 2004"," Treacly Christmas sentimentality strikes again
","I hate Christmas movies. Probably the only exception would be A Christmas Story, which does not have the schmaltz and smarmy faux Christmas cheer that are a stock in trade for just about every other Christmas movie that I've ever seen. And Elf is no exception, either. This movie just would not gel. There were a few funny scenes-mostly when Will Ferrell is turned loose and allowed to play his own brand of goofy, insane big kid shtick. But the movie has far too few of these scenes, and far too many 'heartwarming' ones. I believe the yardstick for this kind of crap is It's A Wonderful Life, a movie I despise with a whole hearted and sincere passion. Christmas seems to bring out this drivel in all filmmakers, making them revel in mawkish sentimentality and long soliloquies on 'the Christmas Spirit'. Elf had this in spades, especially with the forced last third of it. I never ,ever wanted to see James Caan 'converted' into a nice guy by love and the Christmas spirit. My gorge rose at that atrocious signing scene, where everyone was learning to believe in Santa Claus once again. Sickening. And the whole point is flawed, since shouldn't we learn to love each other all year round, not just once a year on a commercial driven holiday? And please don't talk to me about having the 'Christmas spirit' all year round. If i had the Christmas spirit all year round, I'd lock it in my basement and torture it with electrodes. To all filmmakers everywhere-please, please, PLEASE stop making inspirational Christmas tales. I'm begging you, just STOP."

","View from the Second Star: Elf<br/><br/> Elves, it seems, are good for one of three things. Building shoes while the shoemaker is asleep, making cookies and tea in trees, or manufacturing presents for all the good little girls and boys in Santa's workshop. ""Elf"", starring Will Ferrell, is the story of a human baby who snuck into Santa's toy bag while he was delivering toys to an orphanage. Santa, the kind hearted old fellow that he is, upon find this child in his toy sack, had this human baby raised in the North Pole amongst the elfish as one of their own. However, when a now fully grown Ferrel, learns of his mysterious history, he sets out for New York city to find his father and his past. Well actually not his past, just his father. sort of.<br/><br/> This movie was funny - and anyone who says it was otherwise isn't me. From intro to the credits, I chuckled my way along the twisted bewildering path down which Ferrel leads the audience. The costume alone was a slap-in-the-face; it had me giggling at least once every fifteen minutes. Will Ferrell is hilarious: his expressions, his mannerisms, and this innocent little Elf routine: gold my friends, gold. He was good on Saturday night live, he's great in Elf.<br/><br/> The story itself isn't really much more than a vehicle for Ferrell's parade of cutesy insane behavior. A workaholic father, a mom who cares, and a son who needs a friend, cliché if ever there was; yet somehow, a six foot elf-man really brings the whole thing together. No moment to cheesy, no ""Dad I love you"" ending. Its obvious that this film wasn't created to cater to the family audience; I think, moreover, this film was designed specifically not exclude the family while appealing Ferrels main fan base, the teens and twenty somethings, at the same time. We've seen comedy designs like this before; Shrek anybody? Another example would be Shrek.<br/><br/>The only grievances I have for this film revolve around the late third and forth quarter where things begin to slow down comedy wise. The ""I'm an Elf in the city"" routine works beautifully, but one can only laugh at the same thing for so long. Aside from the wrap up being a little boxy, the lagging denouement, this film's marginal errors are hardly noticeable to the always entertained eye.<br/><br/> A ridiculous setting, a heavily recycled story, and a man dressed in yellow tights. This movie has no point, but who cares - I sure didn't, and I usually care too! It works, and it's funny. Good for the kids, great for the dates. Not doing much Friday night, or any night for that matter? Why not go see Elf; if you don't have many friends you can always find people to sit with there.<br/><br/> 7/10"

","Despite me growing up with this beloved Christmas classic, I went into my probably thirtieth rewatch with fresh eyes and a critical mindset. But wow, I could not stop laughing throughout the entirety of Elf. Whether it is Buddy the Elf doing the dumbest things that make you burst out laughing to the heartfelt redemption of the father character or the really cute romance between Buddy and Jovie, Elf is such a fantastic film on many levels.<br/><br/>What makes this film so endearing is that it is just so incredibly funny. There are moments where you will burst out laughing, which is exactly what I was doing in my theater. Ironically, I think Will Ferrell isn't the funniest guy in the world and believe him to be heavily oversaturated in American comedies, but he was incredibly charming here.<br/><br/>Minor complaints: First fifteen minutes have some horrendous CGI, cringe scenes, and really odd elf stuff that differs from the rest of the film, which is perfect. Once Buddy arrives to New York, all is good. Buddy makes some really dumb child-like decisions. Why would he eat chewed gum off the rails in New York city? Also, the implied Christian messages here are a little annoying. Like the fact that Santa's sleigh used to run of human spirit, but nobody believes anymore. But the film actually plays off of the religious undertones a lot, without specifically advocating for or against Claus as a Christian savior.<br/><br/>Regardless, Elf is perhaps my favorite Christmas film of all time. The complaints are minuscule compared to how hilarious this film is to you. I will forever play this in my household each year.<br/><br/>Also, Zooey Deschanel is only the most attractive woman from 2003. Wow. My first childhood crush."

Although it never truly gives a reference to the Bible, it has a good message and is not sending people a wrong one. I highly recommend this movie because it's just downright hilarious!

Hard to believe this movie is 9 years old already. I laughed watching it when I was a kid, and I'm still laughing just as hard today. This movie got so creative with the humor, slapstick, puns, lines, this is literally my favorite Christmas film next to Its a Wonderful Life. Will Ferrel was perfectly casted as Buddy the Elf, a heart loving Christmas elf from the north pole who finds out he's actually a human being who was raised by elves after he snuck into Santa's toy bag at an orphanage when he was a baby. The plot was just fantastic, and was thought thru well. The movie teaches a very valuable lesson, do what you love in life, don't let others stand in the way of that ever, and that you should always be yourself. The movie shows the great relationship between a father who doesn't believe his son is an elf from the north pole, but accepts him the way he is in the end. Many can learn the true meaning of Christmas, as well as life lessons in this holiday classic. This is another holiday film that will live on for the years to come."

","Elf is one of the better Christmas movie I have seen. The only movies associated with Christmas that are better than this are the first two Home Alone movies. This is nothing Oscar-worthy but it is a feel-good holiday film. I think Will Ferrell is an mediocre actor at best but I feel this is his best role.<br/><br/>This is about a human who was raised in the Arctic by Santa and the elves. When he is thirty, he ventures out to find his real dad. Unfortunately for Buddy, his dad seems to have no interest in having him as a son.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good. I mentioned Ferrell before and I am surprised on how I actually liked him. The older guys like James Caan, Edward Asner, and Bob Newhart were wonderfully cast.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic Christmas tale. It's definitely the best one this century so far.

","Will Ferrell is one of my favourite movie funny-men, but even so, I had my reservations about Elf: it is a Christmas film after all, and they do have tendency to get rather sappy for my liking.<br/><br/>Still, I put aside my doubts, and to start with, I admit I had a chuckle-some time, with Will providing some amusing 'fish-out-of-water' moments as wide-eyed innocent Buddy, the titular 'elf' (in reality, a human adopted when a baby by one of Santa's workers) who leaves North Pole to travel to New York, where he hopes to find his real father (played by James Caan).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the makers of this film just can't help themselves, and gradually allow over-sentimentality to take control, before unloading a whole sackful of saccharine sweet clichÃ©s in the final act: Buddy's mean, inconsiderate father miraculously transforms into a loving dad; good old Santa pops up needing some Christmas spirit to power his sleigh; and everyone starts singing carols and being all happy and stuff! Hell, Buddy even gets the girl (pretty shop assistant Jovie, played by Zooey Deschanel). Gag! A bit of cheesy schmaltz is to be expected this time of year, but this amount in one massive dose is just too much for me to handle.<br/><br/>I rate Elf an unexceptional 5.5 out of 10, very generously bumped up to 6 because, hey, it's Christmas!!!."
"fearfulofspiders","9","1","3","17 September 2008"," Great For the Christmas Season...
","I absolutely enjoyed Elf far more than I could ever have predicted. From the acting, the tone, and overall story, this is definitely great for those who are in love with the Christmas season.<br/><br/>Will Ferrel's portrayal of Buddy the elf is one of his more definitive characters that the audience can actually relate to -- unlike Ricky Bobby or Ron Burgundy. Bob Newhart's screen time is too short to really comment on, but his total of 15-minutes are very good. Zooey Deschanel is a gorgeous actress and her performance really adds a more mellow tone to the otherwise more energetic Ferrel.<br/><br/>The ""fish out of water"" concept is easily recognizable, such as with Big, but Elf is far more than that, as our main character not only seeks a father figure, but also acceptance. The writing is very good, and the comedy never falls flat, be it slapstick or not. The direction by Jon Favreau is slightly simple, yet every scene works and none falter, which awards him a nice applause.<br/><br/>The music aside, there's not much to comment on on that particular subject, as it has a lot of the twinkles and jingles of the vast majority of other Christmas-themed films.<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend Elf to any family looking for a film to watch on a cold, winter night, with a hot cup of cocoa, as the vibe is nothing but positive and rewards the viewer with a greater sense of morale."

","This was a funny holiday film with great performances all around. Will Ferrell gives one of the best performances of his career (and one of the funniest) as a human raised by Santa and his elves. When he was a baby, he crawled into Santa's sack, which explains how he got there. Now that he's an adult and six feet tall, he realizes he's no elf. He gets Santa's permission to go to New York and find his father, who is on Santa's naughty list. Once he arrives in New York City, however, he has a tougher time adjusting to the ""human"" world than he ever imagined. He tracks down his father (well played by James Caan) and convinces him of who he is. Initially a jerk, having Buddy (Ferrell) in his life makes Cann make some changes in his life and priorities. He is originally totally immersed in his job. I think this was a wonderful family film for the holidays and really recommend it.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

Bill Murray, Jane Curtain, Dan Ackroyd and Dana Carvey can carry a movie and keep the continuity. Most of the others can't. The jury was still out about Will Ferrell until I saw Elf. A nice little film that has landed on my ""watch every Christmas"" list. Great supporting turns from James Caan, Zooey Deschanel (Who sings beautifully), Mary Steenbegen, Bob Newhart and Ed Asner round out this delightfully written story about a boy who is raised as an elf. There's even a hip Burl Ives snowman played by Leon Redbone who sings a duet with Deschanel during the closing credits. Watch and enjoy."

But was I ever pleasantly surprised! This movie was really funny! Wil (Buddy the elf)was hliarious as a man raised to believe he is an elf. His genuinely good heart and sweet disposition just make you smile, even when hes not saying a word. To see 'tough guy' James Caan in a comedy was also a bonus- he is great as a cold-hearted New York career man! As always, Bob Newhart is just awesome- who is more funny than him? His facial expressions alone deserve comedy awards!!! True this film is not gonna win any awards but who cares?! It has a great supporting cast, all of whom play their parts perfectly! Its is funny, enjoyable and a really good holiday picture. Great for kids, adults, teenagers, whoever!! You're gonna laugh and thats what a comedy is for!!!"
"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","1","3","29 December 2003"," It's what you'd expect really
","SPOILERS (but then, it was always going to be predictable!)<br/><br/>So it's Christmas time again, and as per usual, in amongst the ""Lord Of The Rings"" and the other big blockbusters, there's the occasional Christmas fairytale. This year's offering is ""Elf"" staring Will Ferrell, a film which is really exactly what should be expected.<br/><br/>In ""Elf"" Ferrell plays Buddy, a baby who one Christmas crawls into Santa's sleigh, and is then raised by Elves as their own. Thirty years later and Buddy finally realises that he's different to everyone else (despite being double their size of course). So with this in mind, Buddy heads off towards New York looking for his biological father (James Caan). Whilst there, Buddy influences everyone around him, and eventually revives the Christmas spirit.<br/><br/>So what can actually be said about ""Elf""? Well, first and foremost, someone on here wrote that this film will be shown every Christmas for years to come. That person is spot on. ""Elf"" is forever going to be shown along with a selection of films (""Jingle All The Way"", etc) over Christmas at times when adults will want to sleep and children will want to be distracted. Secondly, it's worth stating that this film isn't as bad as some people might expect. If you expect cheese and you expect that weak plotted family film, your probably spot on. The special effects are simplistic when used, and the plot might be as weak as previously mentioned, but all in all, what would you expect from a film about an oversized elf?<br/><br/>I guess it's hard to say too much about Farrell as I must admit to being a newcomer to his humour. He does what seems an acceptable job, and he cracks the occasional hilarious line. What seems ironic though is that some of the funniest lines are actually designed for adults and spoken by James Caan. Right now I can imagine people reading this review thinking ""what the hell is he on about?"", well all I can suggest is to listen more carefully. There is, I admit they're rare, the occasional really funny comment made in this film which, as a result of it being a childs film, probably won't be noticed in a cinema full of children. These comments aren't particularly hidden, but they are throw away comments which aren't fussed over.<br/><br/>To summarise, ""Elf"" was never going to be anything special. It was always going to be a typical Christmas story, designed primarily for children, but with the occasional throw away adult line. With this definition in line, ""Elf"" fulfills it's pledge. It doesn't look though like the type of film which would really make too much money (In England anyway, it's run has coincided not only with the final ""Lord Of The Rings"" film, but also with the far more appealing live action version of ""Peter Pan""). This film is in the end of the day, definately one for television."
"Ben_Cheshire","Null","1","3","13 December 2003"," Find out: why Will Ferrell's performance is a good one, and which radiant newcomer to look out for...
","As the delightful human who was raised by elves at the north pole, Will Ferrell, the greatest new comic actor out, walks a fine line between satire and genuineness.<br/><br/>If he played Buddy completely for laughs, the movie would not imbue the audience with christmas spirit, and make us forget our doubts for a magical hour and a half.<br/><br/>If he played Buddy completely subversively, poking fun at the christmas myth, adults would perhaps have had a few more laughs than they did.<br/><br/>The reason Ferrell's performance is one of the best comic performances in recent memory, is that it serves both these purposes: there is a hint of satire in Ferrell's over-the-top enthusiasm, yet the innocence on his face appears absolutely genuine. One of the greatest sources of humour in the movie comes from actually believing Buddy has the mind of a child.<br/><br/>Truly a remarkable thing. After this he goes on my list of greatest comic actors.<br/><br/>My other favourite thing about this movie (which i found absolutely magical) was exciting newcomer Zooey Deschanel. She was absolutely radiant in this movie. I would watch it again just to watch her. She played William's sister in ""Almost Famous"" who leaves home to become an airline hostess (and plays Simon & Garfunkel's ""America"" to her mother to explain why she must, in one of the movies's best scenes). She also played one of the funniest characters in ""The Good Girl"" - Cheryl who remedies her boredom with her job by insulting customers without their understanding. I've now become a pilgrim of hers, and will follow movies wherever she goes. And believe me, i'm not usually this enthusastic!"
"tfrizzell","Null","1","3","9 December 2003"," Not Your Typical Christmas Story.
","Former ""Saturday Night Live"" standout Will Farrell stars as a man who was actually reared at the North Pole by Santa Claus (Ed Asner) and a group of kind and loving elves (led by Bob Newhart) after he wandered into Asner's bag of toys by accident one night at an orphanage when he was a baby. Fast-forward 30 years and the secret is finally out that Farrell is really human and that his father (James Caan) hails from New York City of all places. Now Farrell decides to leave the only home he has ever known in order to hopefully fit in with the human world, but his transition is difficult with usually hilarious results. ""Elf"" is another one of those productions this year that I liked even though there is really not as much substance as I would have hoped. Farrell, who was the only redeeming thing in the disgusting ""Old School"", is basically given free-will to run everything in the show and ends up dominating with a consistent performance that is surprisingly believable and definitely comical. Everyone else is present, but Farrell proves to be a true comedic force almost by himself. Overall the good messages sent by the film, the smart Christmas undertones and some very creative attempts at entertaining its audience are all enough to make ""Elf"" a strange winner that could best be described as the guiltiest of guilty pleasures. 4 stars out of 5."
"VenomX","6","1","3","6 December 2003"," Will Ferrell shows tremendous potential in this paint-by-numbers Christmas movie
","When I first saw the Elf trailers, my initial reaction was ""oh great, this looks pretty bad"".  Judging from the low quality of the trailers and the fact it was opening up on the same weekend Matrix Revolutions was opening I had little faith in this film.  But after watching it actually take out the titan it shared a weekend with and continue to stay near the top combined with the positive reviews and excellent word-of-mouth I decided to see what made Elf so special. <br/><br/>Well, what I can basically say about Elf is that it takes almost every single Christmas movie cliche and throws it together to make a two hour movie.  We have the ""disgruntled man who needs to be shown Christmas spirit"", ""Santa is unable to deliver presents so main character must help him"", plus with a sappy ending that reeks of positive spirit.  But what I believe prevented this from turning into another I'll Be Home for Christmas is that Will Ferrell shows so much potential as a comedian and as an actor and his performance did save this film.<br/><br/>Of course, many of the good jokes were spoiled in the trailers which I personally hate when it comes to any comedy so that did impact my perception of Elf's humour a lot.  But what I was seen for the first time was very humourous and the way that Ferrell brings the Buddy the Elf character to life is amazing.  All he needs is one consistantly good film and his career will take off, I guarentee that.  I'm saying that because I only see potential in Ferrell, Old School was too short and the jokes were badly paced while this one just feels like another Christmas movie.  Considering the immense success of Elf however, I can honestly say we will be seeing that one film very soon as demand for Ferrell goes up.  The choice to make James Caan the father of Buddy was a pure genius move since Caan still has the ability to make his character seem rough around the edges, (though his ""good ending"" was a little forced).  A lot of Ferrell's scenes clicked and many of his jokes did indeed hit and that is what I feel makes Ferrell so gifted.<br/><br/>Basically, what I'm trying to say is that Elf is a basic Christmas movie with little surprises but Ferrell's performance truely shows his potential.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

It was ONLY Buddy the human ""elf"" that had a five-year-old's personality.  So, what is the true personality of an elf? Sadly, this movie cannot offer a clear answer.<br/><br/>I don't think it is possible for Ed Asner to be a warm cheerful believable Santa.  Tim Allen has the range to hit the warm fuzzy Santa notes.<br/><br/>One other point, some people here seem confused about Buddy being a slow worker at the North pole, and a fast worker in New York.  The explanation for this is that Buddy is slow only if compared to real elves.  Compared to humans, Buddy's elf training makes him seem to have superior skills and abilities."

","I'm pretty sure I'm simply too old now for anything but a decently written and executed film; neither quality is in abundant evidence in ""Elf"".  I really don't mean to insult all of you who've found this movie to be entertaining, but; you are all really easily amused.  This is simply not a funny movie.  Anything which could be counted as a joke can be seen coming as if it was a flaming asteroid about to hit Earth.  Will Ferrell is just not funny (not in this movie, anyway).  James Caan walks through his lines, Mary Steenburgen really has no lines worth saying, and Bob Newhart's portrayal of an Elf who doesn't show too much emotion only drags things down even more.  (MINOR SPOILERS) The story is inconsistent: Buddy's character has a particular reputation regarding his performance as a toymaker in the North Pole, but in Manhatten he displays the opposite qualities.  James Caan wants Buddy out of his life forever, yet completely changes his mind moments later for some feeble reason given by his son: ""Buddy was right"" or some such nonsense.<br/><br/>There are a couple of laughs but out a whole professionally produced movie, they are not nearly enough to carry the day.  Director Favereau has done far better work.  What happened here isn't clear.  One high point, though, is Zooey's lovely singing voice, especially during the credits with Leon Redbone.<br/><br/>Geez, I must sound like quite a Grinch, but if you've 12 or under and you've never seen anything else, perhaps this is a funny movie.

","""Elf"" is a movie about a big guy in a green suit that made some big green and made other filmmakers green with envy. Speaking of ""Made"", ""Elf"" was directed by Jon Favreau; the star & director of ""Made"" and star & writer of ""Swingers"". With the blockbuster status of ""Elf"", Favs is evolving into one of the superlative comedic directors of our generation. The star of ""Elf"" is not doing too shabby himself. And why not! He is probably the funniest entertainer working in show business. I am not ""toying"" with you! Of course, I am referring to Will Ferrell. His performance as Buddy, the lanky nitwit raised by elves who is now on a quest to find & bond with his biological father, was the paramount laugh riot work of 2003. It had me in stitches! (This way the elves could put me back together.) Another impressive showstopper was Zooey Deschanel as Jovie, the toy store employee who becomes Buddy's fem buddy. Deschanel is an actress on the up-rise who is definitely not on the bad acting ""naughty list""; even though this hot blonde could be naughty to me anytime. ""Elf"" also contains the best comedy scene of 2003; the corporate meeting scene when Buddy mistakes a surly publication executive giant (wonderfully played by dwarf actor Peter Dinklage) for an elf is honest to say as absolute comedic mastery. ""Elf"" is ""boy toy"" heaven at its best; I hope that was not taken in a certain context. ***** Excellent"

","This movie has its fans.  The ones who have already seen it several times and yell ""Yes"" at every inside, supposedly cool line in the movie.  They are more annoying than the movie itself, but not by much.  A comedy is supposed to make you laugh hard, not just smile occasionally.  I remember  several years ago, some geeks in my ""Dumb and Dumber"" audience not liking or getting that movie, an imperfect one admittedly, but one that had me laughing so hard at times that my stomach hurt. 'Will play every Christmas'?  I hope not.  Mainly for geeks and people without strong senses of humor, in my opinion.  I have been wrong with some comedies before, having seen some in a bad mood--as I did this one--and sold them short initially (""Meet the Parents"", for example, which I saw in a unpleasureable setting on rental, not in the theater, and did not initially like. While it is not as good as 1980's ""The In-Laws"", it is very good, which I discovered on repeat viewing).  Still, it seemed that every time I tried to get into ""Elf"", I was left unrewarded. As for the dorks sitting behind me yelling ""Yes"" and anticipating their favorite lines, it took everything I had not to jump over the seat and pummel them."

"makosharkrdg","10","1","5","28 February 2019"," Elf Script Review (No Spoilers)
","The script for Elf the movie was, in my opinion, an amazing read. There was no point during my read that I was not interested and it only kept me wanting to read more. The way Jon Favreau so cleverly put together this fantastic piece of literature was so interesting and hilarious. I might actually have to read this again because I love it so much. I have never read something so intriguing, thrilling, and funny in my fifteen years of being alive. If there would be any piece of literature to recommend it would be the Elf Script because it is, in my opinion, the best. The character development of Buddy the Elf is my favorite aspect because he was funny, quirky, and lovable, he might be one of my favorite characters I've read about. The plot was also enjoyable and the way it was scripted was brilliantly delightful. If there is any way to entertain yourself it would be this fine piece of art, in my opinion, from the read to the movie it is an amazing experience I wish I could forever relive. I strongly encourage you to pick this up and read or even watch it, either way, it's a joyride that I'm sure you won't regret. "" Whoo! That's strong! Must be two percent!"" Said by Papa Elf, I think this quote relates to the story, very strong."
"obenstehend","9","1","5","20 February 2019"," Elf Script: A Modern Classic
","I can never get enough of this movie around the holidays, and everyone else (especially AMC) can't either. So when I started this script around the holidays, it was a complete joy. Every time I watch the movie or read the script, something new is found and will guarantee a laugh. For example, I completely forgot about the countless amount of times the main character, Buddy, gets hit by a taxi. It's brilliant. But that's beyond the point, I'm here to tell you about Elf and how great it is.
The script starts off with the main character Buddy turns out to be a human. After being raised by elves, he finds the desire to meet his dad in the real world, New York City. After departing from the North Pole, Buddy finds himself already in some trouble after he gets mauled by a wild racoon. After that, he meets up with his dad, Walter, and he seems pretty creeped out. The story progresses by Buddy trying to convince Walter that he is the elf's dad. When finding out he is the father, Walter is in disbelief (Strong verb!) and realizes he has to take care of an elf. Joke after joke, the movie gets even funnier. Buddy meets his brother, Michael and though Mike doesn't like him too much, he gains respect for him after saving him from some gangsters in a snowball fight. Buddy also eventually becomes friends with Jovie, someone who he thinks is an elf, but just works at Gimbels. Progressing even further, on Christmas Eve, Buddy becomes a burden to his father's work and almost gets him fired. For example, Walter becomes very mad a Buddy and screams ""Go anywhere! I don't care if you're crazy. I don't care if you're an elf!! I don't care if you're my son!!! JUST STAY OUT OF MY LIFE!!!"" This creates even more conflict and Buddy runs away. His brother looks for him and convinces his dad that what he said was wrong. This escalated to Buddy running into Santa. Santa's sleigh won't work because of the lack of Christmas spirit. However, Jovie steps in and gets the whole town of New York to sing some carols in the snow. Buddy is found and Christmas is saved.
In my opinion, the part that really stood out to me was the comedic elements. In almost every scene there is at least one thing that will make you laugh. For example, I can name the best part of the movie when the taxi hits Buddy. This scene had me rolling. Another example is when Buddy gets into a fight with the fake Santa at Gimbels. This also had me rolling. Also, the rewatchability in this movie is fantastic. In every scene, you will miss something and nothing will hold you back to watch it all over again. Every time I watch the movie I see something new and find it either funny, interesting, or unique. For example, I bet everyone missed the part where Buddy nails the bigfoot walk on live television. Yep, watch it again and check it out. The final aspect that I love about the story is the perfectly articulated character development. For example, at the end of the story, Buddy is still happy go lucky, but mature at the same time. And Walter's character development is fantastic. He goes from being a money hungry businessman to being a hardworking family man. Overall, great development on all sides.
In conclusion, the Elf script was extremely funny, incredibly rewatchable, and displays great character development. With the modern classic of Buddy the Elf going to find his dad in New York, this is surely one to go down in the history books."

All of us enjoyed the movie (even the teenagers, who are very fickle, let me tell you). How great is a movie that can bring together the whole family, on their own free will? Will Ferrel is a comic genius. I love his mannerisms and his style of comedy. I was skeptical about this movie at first, because I wasn't sure how anyone could pull off a Christmas movie and make it sensational. BUT THEY DID! I have even enjoyed this with my fellow peers in college (we made a drinking game to itevery time you see a Christmas tree...drink!....yea, i know, we're college students, so sue us).<br/><br/>I just wanted to convey that this movie is enjoyable by any age.

","Okay,at first,this movie looked stupid. I thought it was a desperate attempt to make a good Christmas movie.Boy was I wrong. Elf is about a human named Buddy who was raised by elves after Buddy as a baby,crawled into Santa's sack while he was delivering presents to the adoption center.As Buddy grew up,he grew faster than the other elves but still grew up learning about having Christmas Spirit like the other elves.Then,still not knowing he was human,he overheard some elves discussing he was human and asked his adoptive father about his origin which lead Buddy on an adventure to the low-spirited city of New York to find his real father and possibly spread some Christmas Cheer.That's all I'm sharing with viewers who haven't seen this movie.<br/><br/>Elf was probably the best Christmas classic movie I've seen since well,any other Christmas movie.This movie had hilarious moments and some moments where you just wanted to take a moment and wish you met an elf or anyone like Buddy.Will Ferrell really shines in this movie and proves to be an excellent actor as the innocent,child-like and lovable elf new to a city with no Christmas Spirit.He along with the other cast members bring this movie to life.Zooey Deschanel was amazing as Jovie,the moody yet considerate department worker who later discovers her amazing singing voice thanks to Buddy.James Caan was great as Walter,the grumpy and busy father of Buddy.<br/><br/>I don't care what anyone else says,I loved this movie and really makes me laugh.I don't know about all or you but I'm rating this a 9/10"

","Who doesn't want to see a movie of Will Farrell dressed as an elf wandering the streets of New York City? Will Farrell stars in the funny, family friendly christmas movie Elf as the main role of Buddy the elf. Buddy is a human who was raised by elves after sneaking into santa's bag at an orphanage. Buddy spends most of his life, into his 20's living in the north pole thinking he was an elf. When he comes to realize he's not the same as the other elves, and he's really human, Buddy sets off to find he real dad in the big city of New York. Being raised by elves, Buddy struggled to fit in on the streets wearing his daily elf clothes and acting as he would have at the north pole. Buddy's unique personality made it difficult for him to connect with his workaholic father specifically, but his wife was happy to take buddy in as their adult-child. Even with his different lifestyle, Buddy is even able to find love in the big city.
Will Farrell has starred in many movies during his career that has created him the reputation of a funny, child-like actor, including in the movie ""Step Brothers"". Step brothers follows the lives of two forty year old men who live at home with their parents, have no job, and act like a 12 year old. Farrell has also been known for his incredible wide range of character impersonations. His goofy hair and looks helps Farrell really play the role of a goof. Will's bubbly, christmas loving character, is met by his mean, workaholic, christmas hating father who is played by James Caan. James has had many ups and downs in his career, but he is most known for his acting in The Godfather.
There are a number of jokes embedded throughout the script of elf. Although many of them are funny and make the audience laugh, there are a handful of jokes that are just not good. Besides the occasional bad joke, the jokes are made to be funny to a little kid, while also being able to make their parents laugh. The way the movie script was written, the majority of the time the jokes are very discreet and missed by the audience. Although this makes it better, because every time you re-watch the movie you are guaranteed to hear a new joke.
Overall, Elf is a great, hilarious, family friendly movie, and although it is a christmas movie, it is a great pick for any night of the year. See what it's like to live in New York City as an elf who came from the north pole. Whether your 7 years old or 70, your sure to love this movie. Buddy the elf has spread the christmas spirit all through New York, he was even able to get his snobby father to enjoy a little christmas caroling."

Will Ferrell does a great job with portraying it in a funny and an overall enjoyable way, catching the kid spirit. The soundtrack for the movie was perfect, using a lot of well known Christmas songs. CGI was actually decent and the stop motion animation they used on Christmas land had a charm, more fantasy and light hearted.

I know I'm not declaring like for like but Elf is just....better<br/><br/>And it's all thanks to Will Ferrell. The supporting cast are great, especially Grinchy old James Cahn and brassy Zoey Deschanel the tough as nails new york princess who we see suddenly and completely disarmed by Ferrell's absolute innocent abroad. Who says girls are attracted to boys on Santa's naughty list?<br/><br/>And seriously who wouldn't want to discover that sugar addicted Will Ferrrell in an Elf's costume is actually their long lost and unknowingly begotten son? Ferrel is simply the only person I could imagine pulling this off. He's fantastic in this role, slowly conquering New York, probably the most cynical city in the world, with a palpable sense of pure joy and the kind of energy normally reserved for a brand new puppy. Gritty compelling cinema."

","If it wasn't for the tacked on and plot driven love story this would be the perfect Christmas movie. Farrell is at his absolute best and Buddy is a great comedic figure. There is so much glee and Christmas spirit that comes from Santa's biggest helper that it is hard to not get swept up in the cheesy Christmas laughs, fun and cheer.<br/><br/>I just re-watched this today for the first time in over a decade and it struck me how there is a lot of surrealist moments in the film-Leon and the other parodies of the classic Christmas cartoons for example-that make the film really work for older folks. It's not just silly kids stuff, but there is a subversive edge to a lot of it. Notice how Santa was ready to deal with a mugger for example. I had either forgotten or didn't pick up on this quality when I first watched the film.<br/><br/>This film just flies by; neither the director nor screenwriter puts too much time into any one joke or gag. Unlike a lot of SNL comedies it doesn't feel like a skit stretch out way to much. It is always amusing. It warms the heart a little bit too. Caan manages to make the climax work despite the weaker writing.<br/><br/>This will be added into my Christmas rotation."
"karkalch","Null","0","1","16 January 2018"," Why Santa's Sleigh Can Fly
","I read the list of Trivia, goofs and continuity. Someone said Santa's sled should not fly just because people believe. Santa's Sled flew because when Jovi was having her Ramen Noodles on Christmas Eve and saw Buddy on the TV News she set her dinner down and went to Central Park. She met Michael and the Mom. She remembered: ""The best way to spread Christmas Cheer is singing loudly for all to hear."" (First rule of being an elf). She gets up and her singing causes the crowd to sing. Michael's (and Buddy's) Dad shows up, and during the singing Michael notices Dad is not singing. Dad says yes he is. Michael says Daaaaad!!!! so Hobbs starts singing. Just when he does start actually singing loudly the sled flies right up and over his head. It was their Singing Loudly for All to Hear which made the sled fly. The idea of seeing Santa or not well that is just not important. The idea is to be good to Sing Loudly to show love to your children and spend time with them and care for them, not just your self or your problems. Actually when he quit that job at Greenway, things got better. And he spent more time with Buddy and ideally and of course Michael as well. Seeing a Santa, real or not, is really depending on if there is a person in your group or your Mall or your Community Meeting Places, who dresses up like Santa and does the what do you want /pictures thing. Some give presents. It depends on the situation and the groups. Some people just have their family members who give gifts and Santa is not needed. Believing in giving to others is the Message of the Santa Character. The Santa Myth The Santa Tradition, and of course the first persons who so long ago went around with a bag and gave gifts. Maybe he was old. Maybe he wanted to be anon. Long ago the tradition began and it continues. Animals that run and want to flee from wolves such as reindeer, deer, bunnies and so on, the wish they could fly. They do if they get written into a story to fly. Sometimes I think it would be cool to fly. Flying is faster and you can get above everything and get there faster. Now the chimney thing. That must be because who wants to have to watch their doors for a stranger, unannounced and sneaking in their homes at night? Nobody. So someone made the story fantastical with the chimney thing. That ought to be phased out. Maybe in the olden days when kids were forced to be chimney sweeps like in the old original film Oliver Twist. Maybe Santa was in the chimneys & fireplaces with gifts to cheer those fellows up. I like to think so. They had a hard life. Those kids sure needed cheering up and needed to be saved from being forced to be chimney sweeps. So Labor Reform Laws... Good. The Mail Room Funny. I like the redemptive and loving and good messages in this film. That there were car crashes because of that man running around in those tights sure is believable that's kind of sad. After a while you get used to the costume, and e the new outfit his Dad gave him is great. The first sight of him there in the City is quite shocking. A film with lots of surprising things, not to use the word shocking again. Does syrup have sugar? lol K.J.H."

But when its comes to movies with Will Farell I am not pleased as I find his movies rather too silly at times and rather boring but Elf was great one as its funny and sad and enjoyable to watch for the whole family. I loved it when Peter Dinklage came on scream as Miles Finch he did amazing job as Miles finch which makes him my favorite character in this film. Can't wait too watch him in the game of thrones as I heard he does amazing job in it But Buddy is the one who I think that steals the show as he going searching for his long lost father and to make have a change of heart about Christmas <br/><br/>Overall a great Christmas movie wroth watching 8/10"

","Can't believe this movie only has 6.9 on IMDb, it is absolutely hilarious and heartwarming, the best Xmas movie ever. Generally I like Will Ferrell but he is in his element as the oversized 'Elf' buddy, who finally realizes he doesn't fit in at the North Pole and goes off to find his real family. He brings his innocent, fun loving side to cynical New York and a workaholic father with very funny results. We love it for the laughs, but like all the best comedies, there is a serious message too. That everyone would do well to have a little bit of Elf in them, slow down, have fun, spend more time with your kids and worry less. OK that sounds cheesy but this film isn't cheesy really, it delivers the laughs and the family message in a very funny and enjoyable way. If you haven't got this on your family Xmas movie list, add it now!!"
"luke-a-mcgowan","9","0","1","12 December 2015"," An essential for the holidays alongside Love, Actually and probably Ferrell's most delightful work to date.
","Probably the greatest Christmas movie of all time, Jon Favreau's Elf is made wonderful by Will Ferrell's disarmingly innocent performance as Buddy. Many of the best scenes are Ferrell in character walking around New York and interacting with people, places and things. A sweet screenplay and magical direction from Favreau also boost this beautifully novel idea.<br/><br/>Ferrell's deliriously happy Buddy is the film's heart and soul, but there's much to be said for James Caan's flawlessly cast Walter Hobbs, Buddy's biological father. Grumpy and irritated in that quintessentially ""dad"" kind of mood, Caan owns the role and performs even better in the film's final warm scenes. Zooey Deschanal is cute but her romance with Buddy is carried by the writing and Ferrell's committed fervor, as Deschanal drones the film's lines with dead eyes and little energy. Faizon Love as the manager of a toy store that Buddy accidentally works at for a day is a scene stealer.<br/><br/>Elf is sweet and cheesy in that ideal Christmas film way. Its an essential for the holidays alongside Love, Actually and probably Ferrell's most delightful work to date."

","Elf will definitely make it down in this generation's list of Christmas classics. Growing up, although the original classic Christmas movies hold a nostalgic place in my heart, I've been fed up watching them time and again, year after year.<br/><br/>Elf was a new addition and a great one at that. Will Ferrell plays the part of an elf exploring the world outside of the North Pole in search for his biological family. The cast does a great job of eliciting joy, emotion, and humour from viewers throughout the entire film, and it makes for a great family film.<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend this to anyone who's looking to add to their list of Christmas movies to watch, if it hasn't already been added."

","I'm not a huge fan of Will Ferrell but I really enjoyed Elf! My family watches it every Christmas and we still laugh every year. Will Ferrell plays Buddy the Elf - really he is a human baby who has been raised at the North Pole. Ferrell is great as an innocent man-child with a heart of gold who loves Christmas way, way too much. <br/><br/>My dad and I have always both loved Bob Newhart and he is great as the head elf who has raised Buddy all these years without telling him the terrible truth, but now that he's older and frustrated that he's not as handy as the other elves, he tells Buddy the truth and he goes to New York City to find his biological father. James Caan plays a mean, materialistic dad who cares only about his work, and Mary Steenbergen is fantastic as always as Caan's wife who makes him accept Buddy into their home. When Buddy falls into a job at a department store he meets his romantic interest, Zooey Deschannel, who is predictably funny as usual but surprisingly (at least to me) also is a great singer! <br/><br/>Through the story, Buddy struggles to get Caan to accept him as his son, and to deal with living in the much less friendly and more complicated human world. On top of that he has to get Deschannel to see past his bizarre behaviour and get her to fall for him. Plus, there just might be a huge Christmas Eve disaster that only Buddy can help Santa solve. <br/><br/>It's quite family friendly and a very fun and refreshing Christmas movie with some great laughs. Peter Dinklage's small part as a full of himself children's book author also has a great payoff. If you're a fan of Christmas movies or comedies in general, Elf is worth checking out."
"lee-dugan","Null","0","1","14 February 2012"," Elf is fun
","This film is directed by Jon Favreau who has made his mark as a director of low budget films like ""Made"" and also as a character actor but this is his first effort at directing a mainstream Hollywood movie. He does a commendable job and as I watched this film I kept having the feeling that he purposely made the most commercial film that he could. Favreau as an actor has mostly appeared in small roles. As a director his small films are lucky to play at art house theaters and I seriously doubt he's getting rich hosting ""Dinner For 5"" on the Independent Film Channel. It looks as though he wanted to make a crowd pleasing film that will ultimately be playing on some cable channel for the rest of our lives. I'm not knocking this decision at all, it's a smart move and he's become a major Hollywood player with the success of this film. Even the script was carefully written to insure that WHEN this plays on television there will be nothing to edit out. The closest thing to a bad word is uttered by Caan when he says ""Hell"" once towards the end of the film. This is a fun film that does have undeniable charm and its heart is definitely in the right place. It's sentimental and corny but thats part of the appeal. The script doesn't try to hard and the energy and flow of the film keeps at a constant pace, it doesn't try to go over the top which is refreshing. Ferrell is a natural performer and his dopey wide eyed expressions never grow old. This film must be doing something right because tough guy James Caan is believable as a caring husband and father. Very old fashioned story that never raises itself above lightweight status is nonetheless funny and charming. Like I said earlier, this film will be playing on television every year for the rest of our lives!"

","This film is one for the whole family. I love Christmas and Christmas movies and this one is one of my top five. Buddy is perfect. He loves Christmas and everything about it. The story of how he becomes an ELF is almost believable unlike his SNL buddy Adam Sandler, who's movies are about as dumb and ""unbelieveable"" as anything on the screen today. Last movie I went to see of his, I actually felt stupid as I left the theater. Anyway, Bob Newhart is great (as always) as Papa Elf. And the girl is as cute as a button. By the way, I love ""Its a Wonderful Life"". But I think I might be the only person who likes it and also likes ""Elf"" and ""A Christmas Story"". Almost everyone who left a review that ""hates"" both these movies suggests watching Its A Wonderful Life instead. Im assuming they are in the 80-200 year old bracket. Enjoy the movie, its great! But if your an old ""crabby-patty"", don't bother."

","This is probably the funniest Christmas movie that exists. It is one of my absolute favorites and it also has action, drama, romance, and a good plot with its humor. It is one of the few Christmas movies that has it all in it. Again, Will Ferrell has made a great movie, only your kids can actually watch this one. The adventures of the human/elf Buddy is very humorous filled with ups and downs and a good happy ending. If you don't own a copy, you should still at least watch it every Christmas season. It is in my top three favorite Christmas movies. So enjoy watching it. There are many other great actors and actresses in it as well which just add to the greatness of the movie. I hope that everyone here enjoys it."
"lesleyharris30","9","0","1","26 December 2011"," One of the Sweetest and Most Entertaining Christmas Movies around,
","Elf is a fantastic movie with a very well written plot and a great comedic cast. It's a film that I always insist on watching at Christmas time, because it's just so much fun, I never get tired of it. The humour remains constant throughout while still managing to be sweet and very charming. <br/><br/>The only thing I ever felt was missing from Elf was more tension between Buddy and Jovie's relationship. It's too perfect, when they meet up there is a bit of conflict, but shortly after that they have no real issues, they should have made them split and convince the audience that they were not getting back together, so that it would feel more fulfilling once they did. <br/><br/>The performances in this film are outstanding and everyone suits their roles perfectly, whether it be James Caan as a business executive who struggles with the responsibilities of being a father, Zooey Deschanel as a complicated girl who is confused with the idea of falling in love, Bob Newhart as the father of all the elves, or Edward Asner as Father Christmas himself. Everyone plays a character that suits them and their own characteristics or personalities perfectly. The highlight of the movie is of course Will Ferrell, he is funny, charming and very lovable, though the movie may not be that old, Ferrell's performance as Buddy the Elf is already iconic, we can relate to him on several occasions, whether it be his sense of optimism, trying to find the good in everyone, or even just his love for Christmas, there are several aspects that make him one of the most beloved characters of any Christmas movie, and Ferrell is to thank for most of that. <br/><br/>Sweet, heartwarming and very, very funny, Elf is a perfect film to watch at Christmas time that the whole family will enjoy. <br/><br/>When Buddy, a human raised by elves in the North Pole, learns that his real father lives in New York, he heads off to find him.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Will Ferrell"

","If this movie is not a Christmas classic by now, then it will be. Elf is the story about a human who was raised by elves, who finds out that he is human and goes to New York to find his dad.<br/><br/>The story starts off great as Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) is introducing us to who elves are and what they do in their lines of work, such as making shoes, baking cookies, or making toys at Christmas. Then it transitions to when Buddy was a baby at an orphanage who sneaks into Santa's sack while he is eating cookies. Later, Santa (Edward Asner) and his elves find a baby in the bag, who Papa Elf volunteers to raise.<br/><br/>The story then focuses on Buddy being raised and trained to work like and elf, even though he can't keep up the pace with the other elves. He later realizes that he is a human and thinks about times when he does not fit. This makes Buddy decide to go to New York and find his dad, played greatly by the very talented James Caan.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell stars as the human raised by elves named Buddy. Ferrell is great and shows many talents as a comedian and as an actor. You laugh at times when he is dumb because he does not know better. He also makes you feel for him at other times such as when he meets and likes a coworker named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).<br/><br/>As I said, Caan does a great job at his role as Walter Hobbs. He knows that Buddy is a grown man, but knows that he needs to get to reality, even though he loves Christmas. As for the rest of the supporting cast, Mary Steenburgen does a fine job for her part as Emily, Walter's wife. Daniel Tay does a great job at being very believable as Michael, Buddy's half-brother. You can understand what he's thinking when he first meets Buddy. Deschanel is wonderful as Buddy's love interest, Jovie. What Deschanel does great as Jovie is making her to be this girl who just wants to get through Christmas, yet she changes her ways after meeting Buddy.<br/><br/>My favorite supporting players are the aforementioned Edward Asner as Santa and Bob Newhart as Papa Elf. I think so just because I enjoyed watching how great they naturally acted in their parts.<br/><br/>The director of the movie is Jon Favreau. What Favreau does best with this movie is great storytelling that is fun for both kids and adults. I am 21 years old and I still enjoy watching this movie every year. Favreau proves how well he works with his cast, and make every part of the movie work and be fun. I enjoy seeing parts, such as Leon the snowman, as that makes me think about all those classic Christmas films like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."

Buddy decides to bring Christmas cheer to the New Yorkers, especially his father and make them believe that Santa Claus truly exists. At the same time, Buddy falls in love with a shy department store worker named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), who has an lovely voice. This is one adventure in the Big Apple that Buddy will never forget.<br/><br/>Directed by Jon Farveau (Iron Man 1 & 2, Made, Zathura) made an amusing Christmas movie that is somewhat different and fresh, thanks to a very likable performance by Farrell. Which Farrell is absolutely charming and child-like in his role. Deschanel is lovely in her role as Buddy's love interest. This movie has some very funny vignettes and an strong cast in the supporting roles. Caan does his best in a underwritten role. Asner and Newhart has some moments in their scene-stealing roles. Peter Dinklage has one of the funnier moments with Farrell is the biggest laugh of the movie.<br/><br/>DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (Also in Pan and Scan) and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The Single Disc DVD, the only special feature is the original theatrical trailer. ""Elf"" is certainly one of those movies will play during the Christmas holidays. ""Elf"" isn't a perfect picture, it has some flaws. But it is Farrell's amusing performance gives the heart in the right place, which it will delights kids and adults. ""Elf"" is a very good movie to watch, especially during Christmas. The movie has some choice cameos, including Peter Billingsley (Who is best known playing Ralphie in ""A Christmas Story) and director:Favreau as a doctor. (****/*****)."

","""Elf"" was yet another Will Ferrel film that I thought from previews was just going to be silly and stupid.<br/><br/>I've learned by now to get over my prejudices going into ""Silly and Stupid"" Will Ferrel films. They almost all are that. But somehow they are also funny, and tell stories with more depth than I would ever have imagined. By the way, the same phenomena happens with me regarding Adam Sandler movies. I always think they sound horrible, and I always have far more than my average share of laughs for a comedy.<br/><br/>In elf, its unimaginable that an actor of Ferrel's age can bring off the complete naivety required for a human raised at the North Pole who enters American society as an adult. Yet he brings it off the same way be brings off all of his unlikely sounding roles.<br/><br/>Of course, in the process the people he interacts with learn that a little naivety and purity of heart can be a good thing. Yes, there is both slapstick and (mild) gross out comedy, but overall this is a quite entertaining movie, and a suitable Christmas comedy for kids and parent to watch together."

","Watch ""Elf"" a few times and it instantly becomes a favorite Christmas movie. At least it did for me. Nearly everything about this film is funny. An Elf (Will Ferrel) leaving the North Pole to find his real father (James Caan) is just the setup for this film. From there to the end it's straight laughs. So many great gags are formed by Ferrel's ignorance to the real world and other peoples' reactions to him. It's fast-paced and very funny. Some minor drawbacks include some gross sequences with Buddy the Elf overindulging in sweets in unappetizing ways, as well as an unnecessary scene in which he gets into a fight with a midget-sized famous author with a temper. Aside from that, it's one of the most enjoyable films I've seen in quite some time. I've seen it at least four times, and it's still just as funny. Not only is Will Ferrel well-cast for his role, but it's also great to see older stars such as James Caan and Bob Newhart make a comeback for this back. Watch it next Christmas or you'll miss out on an annual treat that is very charming and fun. Great for the whole family, and for just about anyone.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"

","Buddy the Elf(Will FArrell,still not yet a star at this point)has never truly been an elf. But raised from infancy in the North POle and knowing nothing other than the Elf lifestyle,he is as true a helper to old St.Nick as any of the other workers that are. At full adulthood and finally starting to realize that he's not like the others back home,he sets out for New York City to find his true family,mostly his father(JAmes Caan),now a Department store exec. I suspect that one need only see the trailers to figure that when Buddy finds his true father,a host of blissfully nutty events ensues.<br/><br/>No surprises in this film,from the hi-jinx promised to the obligatory romance for BUddy,personned in this case by a bored but decent department store worker(Zooey Deschenal,neither too sweet nor too sour). The casting is so letter perfect it seems almost brainless:Bob Newhart as Buddy's adoptive father,Ed Asner as Santa Claus,MAry Steenburgen as Caan's understanding wife,Andy Richter and Kyle Gass as Caan's underlings,Amy Sedaris as Caan's sweet secretary and Peter Dinklage as a very un-elf-life storybook author who looks like he could be a perfect ringer for one of Kris Kringle's workers. Director Jon FAvreau's movie moves as easily as any,and while I personally wouldn't call this a ""new classic""(though it would still seem like MIracle on 34th Street compared with another holiday themed film that came out around that time,Bad Santa)in Yule flicks,this makes for perfectly fine holiday themed entertainment."

So, I caught it one day on USA. I'm a big fan of holiday movies. I'm a sucker like that. I really like the 1934 version of A Christmas Carol, The Grinch Who Stole Christmas (animated version,) White Christmas, The Charlie Brown Christmas Special, all the real classics. <br/><br/>After multiple viewings of Elf, I have to say that based on at least three reasons it is a bona-fide holiday classic, whose destiny is to sit on the same shelf as all the heavyweights.<br/><br/>1. The brilliant casting (James Caan is incredible and Bob Newhart as narrator was a stroke of genius.) <br/><br/>2. The absolutely superb acting, including a career-making performance by Will Ferrel (can you imagine anyone else in that role? Okay, Martin Short aside,) <br/><br/>3. The fantastic direction by John Favreau (look no further than the scene with the jack-in-the-box, it was poignant and hilarious, always an incredibly tough combination.)<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also incredible and chosen with a extreme care.

","""Elf"" is one of the most inspiring Christmas movies you will find. Its entertaining and shows what true Christmas spirit is all about. Christmas is the most magical holiday to celebrate and Will Ferrell is the perfect elf to share that spirit. His character Buddy thinks ""the best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear."" Buddy starts as a small boy who lives with nuns because his mother abandoned him. When Santa slips down the chimney on Christmas Eve he crawls into the bag. Buddy is taken to the North Pole, and that is how he became an elf.<br/><br/>Even though Buddy was two or three feet taller than the rest of the elves, no one had the heart to tell him he wasn't really an elf. Santa is all about accepting people how they are, whether you are on the naughty list or the nice. Buddy decides he wants to meet his real family so he travels to New York City. Upon meeting his father there is instant tension. Will they ever learn to accept each other though? Buddy brings more Christmas spirit than his family could ever imagine. Will Ferrell is a natural performer as he gets in touch with his childish side. From lining the house with paper snowflakes to decorating a humongous Christmas tree in the living room, Buddy proves to be the true work of Santa Claus. Decorating and embracing the holiday season should not be a chore, and I think Buddy proves to his long lost family that they really need this spirit to show them the real meaning of Christmas. By decorating the house like the North Pole he helps them realize what he sees all year round, thus bringing them a little closer to his ""other life."" Buddy's experience in New York is a very different than the North Pole he is used to, but is an accurate picture of what we would actually see. I think its important to keep the real places true to their appearance. When depicting the North Pole the producers can be very creative, however; I am glad that New York was portrayed as we know it. By keeping it the same it gives the movie a more realistic setting with a fun North Pole twist.<br/><br/>The scenery is incredible throughout the entire movie. Starting with the North Pole and all its wonders the story then moves to New York City. Buddy walks the streets of the city in his picturesque elf suit, complete with hat and elf shoes. Various scenes throughout the movie are decked out with twinkling lights, fluffy snow, shiny wrapping paper, and all eight reindeer. Watching this movie I realized how magical Christmas really looks. Everyone has their own way of decorating, but it all comes back to the classic Christmas symbols.<br/><br/>The biggest theme in this movie is family. When Buddy goes missing, his father has to look deep inside himself to realize that finding his slightly abnormal son is more important than his job. Also, just because Buddy has found his birth father it doesn't mean that he has forgotten Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) who raised him. It is important to not forget everyone who loves you, family or not, during the holiday season.<br/><br/>The music in this movie is very uplifting. Hearing all of the singing makes you want to sing along. All of the scenery is inspiring; resembling a winter wonderland. There are all the classic Christmas decorations. Toy trains running around Lego sculptures, cotton strewn about the floor, and a giant red velvet chair for Santa to sit in. The entire scene put together with music, decorations, and family will bring a smile to anyone's face.<br/><br/>No good movie would be complete without a fairy tale ending. This is the best elf journey with a splash of Christmas spirit movie you will find to watch this holiday season. Between little elf characters and adult puns it is sure to be fun for the whole family to watch again and again."

","Surprisingly, ""Elf"" caught my attention. And in a very good way; Will Ferrell was very funny. The whole story just makes you feel good inside and makes you want to believe in Santa. Kinda crazy, I know. But seriously, I loved this movie. The acting is above average because it is just a feel good movie. So, I wouldn't say take it seriously and just have fun. I think that this movie might even go in with the holiday classics. It brought me back to the days of the grinch and a Christmas Story. Yeah, the story is a little cheesy, but it keeps your Christmas spirit going. So, I would highly recommend watching this around the holidays with your family. It's very funny and lovable.<br/><br/>8/10"
"TxMike","Null","0","1","7 February 2005"," Whimsical fairy tale, repeated viewing has become our Christmas Day tradition.
","Will Ferrell plays Buddy, who grew up with Santa's helpers, thinking he was an Elf. This is his story. Ferrell is much better here than he is in other movies. In fact, this is the only role I like Ferrell in. Pleasant viewing for those who like a modern fairy tale.<br/><br/>Born to a single mom, baby Buddy was placed in an orphanage, and one Christmas night, while Santa (Ed Asner) was eating a cookie, crawled out of his bed and into Santa's toy sack. Upon discovery when Santa got back to the North Pole, Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) raised Buddy, who was quite larger than the other elves. Finding out his true identity, and who his real father was (James Caan), Buddy set out to find him in New York.<br/><br/>When he does, comedy follows, as Buddy doesn't know any of the customs of the real world. In the process he makes a friend in pretty Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) who was dressed as an Elf, working at a store preparing for Christmas.<br/><br/>Self absorbed dad is made to see the light, And eventually enlists Buddy to help create new, interesting children stories for new books.<br/><br/>December 2019 update: I first saw this in 2005 but today, Christmas 2019, we just finished watching it again. A very nice and funny Christmas movie."

","Seems like most reviewers are anti-Will Ferrell. I don't watch SNL because it is always stupid, so I had no pre-conceived notions when I saw this movie for the first time on the big screen.<br/><br/>I laughed when Ferrell was funny (which he was in this movie regardless of whether he is generally funny in anything else), I felt bad when he felt bad, and I was impressed that he was like an excited child about life. That's what made the movie worth watching. His character was always positive and wanting to make other people's lives better. He was so excited to meet his real father!! When he decorated the store, he was so excited!! Kids can really relate to him. How can anyone say the enthusiasm of his character was not funny or engaging? <br/><br/>His character really was charming, so don't listen to the reviewers who just came on here just to trash Will Ferrell. Sometimes he would be sad because he would not ""fit in"" and these scenes were very touching. Some of us out there can relate to feeling like they somehow don't ""fit in"" with the rest of the world.<br/><br/>It's true that the ending of the movie was very sappy and silly, but I could forgive this about it because the rest was so charming. This is a movie for the whole family, which is refreshing in this day and age. Anymore, Christmas movies seem to appeal to American audiences only when they are crude, revolting and degrading (i.e. - ""Bad Santa""). This movie was, happily, nothing of the sort. I have never understood why people think that being crude and gross somehow is funny. True humor is thoughtful and uplifts a person's heart, not degrades it.<br/><br/>One of the most delightful surprises is that Ed Asner actually is GREAT as Santa Claus. Had I known he was this character before I saw the movie, I would have thought he was hugely miscast. But, he is a totally charming and warm Santa Claus.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good, clean holiday movie that has a thoughtful script and story."

With the exception of a slight nose dive at the end, it was very entertaining. Farrell was great as the naive elf. It did get a little old towards the end, but for kids it would be a movie that they could watch over and over again. Caan was great as the long lost father, and the story was fun and lighthearted. I would give it a strong 8 out of 10. Just enjoy it for what it was intended to be.

","""Elf"" is a sweet, little holiday movie that tells the fish out of water story of Buddy the Elf, played by ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Will Ferrell. Buddy leaves the North Pole, and winds up in New York City, the oft chosen location for these types of stories. Following the tradition of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"", goodness and cheer is pitted against anger and greed, as Buddy attempts to remind people of the Christmas spirit. Ferrell plays the awkward elf in a highly sympathetic fashion, providing laughs as well as an emotional connection for the audience. The plot line fulfills the sappiness expectation of holiday films, but the light, heartwarming humor of the film is really its strongest attribute. It lacks the timeless quality of ""A Christmas Story"", but it keeps from delving into the dark humor of ""Scrooged!"". ""Elf"" is a good natured film worth at least one viewing."

","Good Christmas movie. As with other good Christmas movies it mixes reality with fantasy. It may have some funny scenes. These are the type of movies about Santa Clause that I like. I like Zoey Dascahfel who played as the department store elf. Bob Newhart and Ed Asner are good at their roles in the movie. These movies help to make the holiday season. It has some similarities with the movie ""Santa Clause"" with Dudley More. Bothe involve a lot of fantasy. There are themes in this movie about home, family and Christmas. There is also some similarities with ""Rudolph the Red Noese Randeer"". This I think is a ""must"" for the Holiday season! Hi Polly Baldwin in ST.Louis and stan paden wherever you are!"

","I've read most of the other comments on this movie, and I guess I'm just missing something not only about the movie, but about Will Ferrel in general. I guess this movie is alright for fans of his, but from ""Elf"" to ""Old School"" to ""Roxbury"" to SNL, it seems to me that Ferrel's comedic talent is viewed as WAY more original and hysterical than it really is. I've just never seen the guy do anything that hasn't been done somewhere before, and better. As far as the film, I think it's a stretch to say that it's a ""star-studded cast."" I mean, James Caan is awesome, but can you name anything he's done in the last ten years? Bob Newhart? I'm sure his phone is just ringing off the hook. It's just sad that this is what SNL comedians do after their run on the show is over. Look at the SNL stars of the past that went on to bigger and better things. Dan Akroyd, Steve Martin, Bill Murray, Adam Sandler, Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock, etc. Just seems that all the SNL stars of the past ten years just end up doing crap like ""Elf"" or ""The Ladies Man"" every other year, and a few cartoon voices on the side. Sorry, I just don't think Ferrel is ever going to be a bigger star than he is now."

I found that this happened when I tried to do these functions while an 'extra' was showing underneath the movie via the 'infinifilm' format. Very annoying. To watch the DVD extras you have to watch the movie again, wait for the 'extra' to prompt you and then and only then can you watch any film extras. i enjoy DVD extras sometimes more than the film, so why should I have to rewatch the movie just to see them?

"stamp1","10","0","2","9 March 2004"," One of the funniest movies ever!! Great Quotable Lines!
","I saw this movie the day before Thanksgiving, and I couldn't stop laughing, it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! There are many numerous quotes in the movie that make you want to repeat them over and over, like when answering the phone, ""Hello, this is Buddy, what's your favorite color??"" and a 1000 others! I am looking forward to owning this DVD so I can memorize all the lines in the film! AND WHAT A GREAT CAST!<br/><br/>Philosophy: Get in the Christmas Spirit!! And laugh a lot!! Have Fun! And LOVE other people even if they don't deserve your love!!<br/><br/>SOME SPOILERS: The North Pole scenes were great, they were a tribute to all the old puppet animation Christmas movies of the past, like Burl Ives ""Frosty the Snowman"", and ""Rudolph the Reindeer"". It brought back fond memories. Buddy leaves the North Pole and goes to New York City, and meets the real world, which brings lots of laughs at both NYC and Buddy's fish-out-of-water experience. (He is like an alien just arrived on Earth who can't fit in, and it is funny! I know that experience first hand myself.)<br/><br/>He finds his real-life dad, who doesn't want a weird 30yr. old son showing up, but Buddy shows so much love, that eventually everyone who gets to know him, begins to love him. He is child-like, and gentle, and VERY LOVING to everyone, always thinks well of others, and puts other people first! If only everyone in the world were nice and sweet and thought of others first like Buddy! And he is FUNNY! He has strange habits he picked up at the North Pole living with Santa and the Elves, like eating only sugar, syrup, candy canes, and other sweets. It is hilarious watching him eat, and drink soda, and bake, and making paper snowflakes, and... well just everything he does is AMAZING and HILARIOUS! You have to see the movie to believe it!! GO SEE IT!<br/><br/>At the end, it becomes bittersweet, Buddy is misunderstood by his dad, and in a scene straight out of ""It's A Wonderful Life"", he goes to a bridge to jump, but instead of Clarence the angel showing up, Guess WHO?? Santa Claus flies right over the bridge and distracts Buddy the Elf. Santa and Buddy reunite, and give jaded New Yorkers the Christmas spirit, and Buddy's father and half-brother and step-mom bond and love one another. And I won't tell you what else!!!!!<br/><br/>The songs in the movie are great, the soundtrack was wonderful. Zooey (Buddy's girlfriend) has a beautiful voice, and her duets in the locker room and the closing credits I thought were the highlights of the film. Guess What?? The director of the movie, Jon Favreau, is in the film! Can you guess which part? Hint: He tests Buddy while Buddy eats cotton balls! The snowball fight scene was wonderful, putting the star on the Xmas tree was hilarious. Redecorating the room at Gimbel's was magical, and Buddy fighting the fake, smelly, Evil Bad Santa was GREAT!<br/><br/>I gave this film 10/10 because it was the funniest movie of 2003 (even funnier than ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Pirates OTC"", and because I just fell in love with the film and all it's characters! And the songs! And the Quotes! Standout actors: Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner, Bob Newhart, little step-brother, and of course, Will Farrell. It is his best role by far! This movie grossed almost $200 million at the US box office, so a lot of people liked it. I saw it twice myself!"

Now while this may sound like a corny, children's x-mas movie, this is brilliantly pulled off and genuinely funny throughout. In the cinema I found myself along with many adults laughing just as much as the children.

","""Elf"" from actor/director Jon Favreau is a delightful holiday movie which benefits greatly from a strong comedic performance from Will Ferrell in his first solo lead role.<br/><br/>An orphaned baby on Christmas Eve crawls into Santa's sack without his knowledge and is taken to the North Pole. When discovered it is decided that the toddler will stay and be raised as an elf but as the years pass he realizes that he is different from everyone else and sets out to find his biological father who works as a children's book publisher in New York. And then as they say the fun begins.<br/><br/>The humor is not aimed squarely at children which makes it the perfect family comedy and not at any moment does Favreau play down to a younger audience.<br/><br/>Ferrell is the perfect choice for the title role. He's not over the top like Jim Carrey or smug like Mike Myers. He brings a childlike innocence to the movie but never delves into the juvenile.<br/><br/>The production design in the North Pole sequences are quite schizophrenic with differing styles but somehow it all gels together due to familiarity. Familiarity is the key to this movie. It's a completely new story but with characters, settings and situations you know from years of watching Christmas movies and holiday specials.<br/><br/>My bet is that ""Elf"" will also become a Christmas staple much like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and ""Home Alone"".

","I saw this film a few days before Christmas 2003 when it was in the theatres. I took two children, a boy aged 9 and a girl almost 10, as well as another adult.  We all loved it!<br/><br/>Buddy (Will Ferrell) as a baby in an orphanage accidentally ends up in the North Pole when he climbs into the bag of Santa (Ed Asner) to play with a teddy bear. Once Buddy is found, Santa and the elves decide to raise him as an elf and Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) becomes his father. Clearly something is wrong when Buddy towers over his peers and just doesn't have the innate toy-making and other abilities that the elves do.  He's told that he is actually a human being, and his real father, Walter (James Caan) works in Manhattan - and is on Santa's ""naughty"" list.<br/><br/>The story of Buddy's returning to Manhattan is a delight for children and adults alike.  Bob Newhart brings his typical understated comedy to the role of Papa Elf that he made popular in TV shows from the 1960s through 1990s, such as ""The Bob Newhart Show"".  Santa doesn't play a major part in this film, but Ed Asner was ""the man"" to bring to life a reasonably jolly but bit ""fluster-able"" character.<br/><br/>Buddy's enthusiasm and sappy sweet optimism is filled out with remarkable scenes of his speed and agility in working with Christmas decorations and snowballs, as well as a delightful relationship he builds with the lovely Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).  I loved the music, especially the duet of Zooey and Leon Redbone in ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"", as well as Ella Fitzgerald's ""Sleigh Ride"" and Eartha Kitt's ""Santa Baby"".  And the scenes with Santa's sleigh were exciting to see!<br/><br/>This is a fun and relaxing film for all ages to get into a holiday mood or just to smile anytime of the year.  Young children should particularly enjoy the costumes and Buddy's antics, and I would think that all but the most jaded would find ""Elf"" to be a light-hearted and fun film with a good, retro soundtrack.

Why would a pretty blonde like that even talk to an elfin retard who can't figure out an escalator? If you're going to throw the sap around, at least make it somewhat believable. This disappointing movie contains exactly TWO laughs.  The first occurs early when they explain that elves can only do three jobs (shoe repair, cookie maker, Santa worker) and shows the hazards of putting an oven in an oak tree.

","Christmas seems to be arriving earlier every year. Halloween and Thanksgiving are now the forgotten holidays as stores and businesses strum up garland and other holiday decorations in order to prepare for the hopefully fruitful shopping season ahead. The movie industry must be thinking the same thing starting this year especially after the success of last year's The Santa Clause 2, which opened the first weekend of November to nearly $30 million. New Line offers up their pre-holiday treat entitled Elf, which features the former Saturday Night Live comedian Will Ferrell, who has recently become a new rising star in Hollywood. After the dismal first half of the year with flops like A Man Apart and The Real Cancun, the studio bounced back in the second half with Freddy vs. Jason, Secondhand Lions, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and hopes to continue the trend until their mega-success The Return of the King opens near Christmas. Can Elf do that? If it's anything like The Santa Clause 2, it easily could but the Ferrell's comedy faces a lot more competition then Allen's did. Not only does the film open up against The Matrix Revolutions, the yuletide feature goes head to head with the highly publicized The Cat in the Hat and Disney's The Haunted Mansion later this month. Until then the film will have to build up pretty good word of mouth for it to still hear cash registers ringing come Christmas Day, let alone Thanksgiving.<br/><br/>The story focuses a larger then usual elf who learns he is actually a human and travels to New York City to find his father. Up at the North Pole, elves are busy getting ready for Christmas but there is one elf that is learning that he doesn't quite fit in. Buddy is not the typical elf, his large size being the biggest factor. He eventually finds out from his adoptive father that he is actually a human that as an orphan baby climbed into Santa's gift bag one Christmas Eve and found his way to Santa's Workshop. After learning his true origin, Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and be part of a real family. But this is easier said then done as his father is a real Scrooge and is prominently found on the naughty list. Buddy, who has never been to the human world, is unfamiliar with many of the things we are accustomed to like revolving doors and food products that don't include sugar. The unusually happy elf must find a way to change his father's workaholic attitude and help his new family find the true Christmas spirit. The story for Elf, though on the predictable side especially as the feature starts to wind down, works surprisingly well. This happens mostly in part to Ferrell's performance but there are also plenty of moments that come off as hilarious even without the lead stars<br/><br/>Though the feature doesn't have an exceptionally large cast, the film doesn't have to with some lead characters picking up any slack left over by that. Will Ferrell, who was featured earlier this year in the hit comedy Old School, once again proves he has as much comedic timing and talent as he ever did on Saturday Night Live and probably even more so. Ferrell is able to make Buddy the elf both lovable and hilarious without pushing the personality of the character too far as to make him annoying and pathetic. James Caan, who takes on the role of Buddy's real father, has the grizzly workaholic business man down pat. The only problem lied not with Caan's performance but the character itself in how quickly the character changed his attitude at the end without really having a change-of-heart experience. And a big highlight came from the performance of legendary comedian Bob Newhart as Buddy's adoptive father. Newhart looks like he had a lot of fun with this role and gives a delightful performance that many will remember despite being only a supporting character rather then a lead.<br/><br/>Overall, Elf joins the ranks of such holiday features as The Santa Clause and Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas that shows Hollywood is still able to make a yuletide classic as good as the old days. It's the wonderful atmosphere and Will Ferrell's exuberant performance that makes this film a delightful treat for the whole family can enjoy without one member of the family being alienated by certain material. There are relatively few complaints that can be made about comedy. The only one that is prominent in most minds would be that film tends to be bit predictable at the end of the feature but the filmmakers pull it off so well that many write it off and they should. The slightly-predictable ending shouldn't ruin the overall amusement and delightfulness that the rest of the film presented up to that point. Ferrell's over-the-top performance should be a decisive enough reason to venture to the local movie theater and see Elf but if you are not truly convinced, here may be a better reason: Elf will keep the children busy for an hour and a half while the parents do their Christmas shopping. Smart, huh?!<br/><br/>My Rating: **** ½ out of 5 (Grade: A-)"

","Will Ferrell is a comic genius. Only somebody with his talent could develop naive Buddy the human elf into a great family film. The film is done with a lot of heart and sometimes is even corny but it is a great family film. There is rarely expletives or violence in the film. Will steals this film easily from stars like James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner, and Bob Newhart. If you're looking for a good holiday movie without any preaching, this is it. I wish Artie Lange was doing more acting like this than the Howard Stern show. He is an untapped comic genius in his own right. Artie Lange is the John Belushi of our generation and sadly he has some of the same problems. Will Ferrell is worthy of the success. He is brilliant, likable as Buddy. How can you not love him after seeing him in this film? If you're a fan of SNL, you will know why there are volumes of his best work.

","The last time I saw stop-motion on the big screen was 2000's CHICKEN RUN. Will Ferrel (SNL and THE OBLONGS) plays a human raised by elves. He is like a little kid in the real world. The humor is good. ""The Clausometer is going down!"" ""Hey Buddy. Wanna play?"" ""Not now Arctic Puffin."" There were some gross scenes apart from his loud belch. The scene where he eats spaghetti with chocolate syrup, and chocolate pop tarts, and m&ms. YECH! Try drinking coffee with ketchup, or hamburger with sugar. What would the Society of Orthodontists and anyone who is allergiced to candy will say about this? This is totally homaging/spoofing Rankin Bass. The Chiodo Brothers (KING COBRA and the 90's version of LAND OF THE LOST) are responsible for the stop-motion scenes. Speaking of stop-motion, Ray Harryhausen, legendary stop-motion animator who had his name on the walk of fame on June 2003 supplies the voice of a young polar bear cub. Read this stop-motion lovers. And now here what I got to say about stop-motion in the 21st Century. Alas we are in the 21st century. We saw this special effect since 1908 in HUMPTY DUMPTY'S CIRCUS. And we thrilled by seeing it used in special effects like CLASH OF THE TITANS. But now thanks to CGI it is no longer used in special effects. It is used in cartoons, commercials, and in home movies. We are witnessing it fade away. But we can keep it alive by using it in our home movies. Happy 95th Anniversary Stop-Motion. Besides this film is better than those SANTA CLAUSE movies with Tim Allen.

","'Elf' is without a doubt the best movie -- and certainly the best family movie -- to come out in a very long time.  Although I very much enjoyed ""Master and Commander"" (far more than I expected to), 'Elf' is by far a better film.  Okay, perhaps I shouldn't compare since they are two entirely different kinds of story, but given a choice to see either again sooner, I'd choose Elf.  I cannot find words to describe what an increbibly pleasant surprise Elf proved to be.  Very well- and smartly-written.  There were many points in the story where they could have gone in any of several wrong directions but instead chose the right one.  This movie is (for lack of less-overused words) very heartwarming and touching.  Good (and relatively minimal) special effects, some good action, and an abundance of laughs.  Movies haven't honestly earned that much laughter from me in quite some time.  The performances were well-executed. James Caan was perfectly cast for his character, and Amy 'Strangers with Candy' Sedaris has a pleasantly light-hearted supporting role to Caan's. In particular, Will Ferrell's performance was spot-on, maintaining just the right level of earnest child-like innocence and skillfully avoiding going over the top or descending into mere clownishness.  A well-chosen soundtrack, some clever pop culture references and a well-crafted opening credits sequence round out this wonderful flim."

"stedrazed","8","0","1","28 November 2003"," Not for the overly cynical.
","Jon Favreau's ELF is one of those movies that the cynic in us wants to hate, but the child in us has the good sense to love. When it was over I wanted to clap, despite the fact that no one involved in the film would hear the applause, and I literally couldn't stop smiling throughout the entirety of the end credits. Yes, of course it's corny; it's about a man raised by Santa's elves. And, yes, it is rather predictable in that every character and plot nuance comes to its logical conclusion. Far-fetched? Obviously; it's about a man raised by Santa's elves! But ELF never pretends to be anything more or less than what it is: that most dreaded of cliches, a ""feel-good"" movie. Now, usually I am the first one to scorn corny, oversentimental art of any kind, and I have been known to (as Stephen King once phrased it) ""blow my nose"" on happy endings. Well, I went into ELF with a healthy dose of my usual cynicism, knowing only that anything involving Jon Favreau was, at least, sure to make me laugh once or twice. What can I say? ELF is funny, touching, and basically just fun in every possible way. Will Ferrel as Buddy: the perfect way for this great comic actor to become a star. In his first leading role, he carries this film like a plate of Christmas cookies. The ease with which he assumes the role makes you wonder if he really was raised by elves. James Caan is quite good as Buddy's human father, Ed Asner is the best Santa Claus ever put on film, and Bob Newhart is ... well, Bob Newhart, but the icing on the gingerbread cookie is Zooey Deschanel as Jovie, the cute-as-an-elf human with whom Buddy falls in love. There is a youthful, exuberant beauty about her that makes you forget how painful love can actually be, and this beauty extends to her excellent voice, a key factor in the film's third act. Her acting, of course, is not put to the most rigorous of tests in this film, but is certainly strong enough for the role she plays. ELF is one of the best Christmas movie to come out since TRAPPED IN PARADISE. Avoid THE HAUNTED MANSION, THE CAT IN THE HAT, and probably any of the other big ""Kid's movies"" this season (except maybe the new HARRY POTTER), and see this with your family instead. Or see it alone; I did, and enjoyed every minute."

Elf is the first movie since Bill Murray's Scrooged to do some good for the holdiay's cinematic potential. It's made by smart people and this is an obvious fact that shows itself in every scene. Yes, the plot looks silly and uncreative. An elf is really a human and has to go find his real Dad. It looks dumb. Part of the fun of this movie is how big a surprise it is that it turns out to be great. It's not about plot. It's about humor. Every role is perfectly cast, every scene is designed in terms of achieving maximum comic potential, and Will Ferrell, who is ussually more annoying than not, has finally found the perfect role for his style of humor. This movie uses Christmas right and keeps us laughing so often that it's almost impossible to walk away unsatisfied."

Not only is this a brilliant script with excellent direction, but Will Ferell is perfect as the role of Buddy the elf. The movie opens with a creative inroduction, using ideal narration to catch the viewer up on buddy's story. As a young boy, Buddy is at an orphanage because his mother had put him up for adoption and died several days later. His father never knew of his son. On Christmas Eve, Buddy is awakened when Santa comes down the chimney to deliver presents to the orphanage. The curious young Buddy crawls into Santa'a sack, and is brought back and raised as a Elf. Many years later, he sets out on a journey to find his real father, and to live life as the human he really is. What follows is a hilariously entertaining, wild romp as Buddy's story folds out at the absolute perfect pace, thanks to director Jon Favreau. Also tied into the story are a girl Buddy finds himself interested in, an angry vertically-challenged author working at his dad's publishing company, and a catastrophoc failure of Santa's sleigh engina, which only Buddy can fix.

It's a perfect family film, as I stated in the one-line-summary, but I wouldn't choose it for a person who loves comedy and all comedy.<br/><br/>You'd find somethings corny, such as when Jovie sings, and everyone turns around at once in order to join her. First of all, why does every movie recently made have to have a love interest for a main character in it? It's not like the film wouldn't have gone on without her. The film is a family film, for gods sake! (But it's not like she ruined the whole film either.)<br/><br/>One thing I respect about the film, though, is Will Ferrell's acting. He is the type of an actor who could play any character or genre, and be very good with it. I found him surprisingly good at being ""Buddy"", a jolly ""little"" elf, although his jokes were often based for younger kids (Though I laughed at certain ones.)At first I felt kind of awkward about seeing Will Ferrell as a children's character, basing this on his former acts on SNL, but he turned out very funny and sort of adorable.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is very enjoyable.

I thought the begining started out very promising but dropped about halfway through.  The ending (involving Santa and the chase scene in Central Park) didn't seem to fit the movie. But anyways, I wouldn't say ELF is a waste of time, just not the ""HOLIDAY CLASSIC"" everyone is talking about. If you really want a funny, good hearted comedy go see ""SCHOOL OF ROCK"".<br/><br/>Thanks"

","The movie was a an unexpected surprise.  The theatre was packed and everyone was rolling on the floor.  This movie elicits more than a few chuckles and snickers - nothing less than full blown brings-tears-to-your-eyes laughs. I have to give special kudos to Will Ferrell (he finally broke away from the bland, boring, lackluster writing at SNL)to show that he does have his own considerable comedic chops - without him this film would not have been half as good.  I also give thumbs-up to Bob Newhart, who played Farrell's elf mentor and looks his most pained when giving Farrell a heart-to-heart talk on his elf-sized lap.  It was good to see Bob still has his deadpan timing. Edward Asner was also up to the mark with his protrayal of Old Saint Nick. Everyone in the film and out seemed to be enjoying themselves. This is definitely an adult/child crossover movie (like Shrek)that can appeal to both groups simultaneously.  I recommend it to help limber up those so seldom used laugh muscles."

","SPOILERS!!!!<br/><br/>I admit I did laugh a few times. I usually love fish out of water<br/><br/>stories and I have always loved watching Wil Farell on SNL so I<br/><br/>thought even though this appeared to be a kiddy film I thought I'd<br/><br/>give it a shot. I think there were a lot of good ideas and the idea of<br/><br/>a 6'2 elf walking around New York City to me is just funny, but as<br/><br/>another comment pointed out; Buddy seemed to adapt to his<br/><br/>surroundings WAY too easily and quickly. He won everyone over in<br/><br/>like a minute. He found a girlfriend, won over his father and gained<br/><br/>the respect and love from everyone with way too much ease. I also<br/><br/>found it bizzarre that the reason he did not fit in in elfland was<br/><br/>because he was so inept, however his amazing skills at building<br/><br/>rocking horses and decorating beautiful christmas displays would<br/><br/>prove otherwise. It didn't fit. It was kind of a Rudolph the red nose<br/><br/>raindeer I suppose, but much less effective. I also felt the end<br/><br/>scene with James Caan walking out of a career ending meeting<br/><br/>because of Buddy was rediculous. Buddy had done nothing but<br/><br/>interfere and mess up his life so it didn't make sense that at that<br/><br/>particular moment he'd forfeit his career for this man. I saw so<br/><br/>many movies, Christmas and otherwise that were ripped off for<br/><br/>this movie and they were all 100 times better than this one."

","Who knew that it would take the writer of SWINGERS to direct the latest Christmas classic?  <br/><br/>At the top of this, I would like to thank Jon Favreau for pointing out that Bob Newhart will never go out of style.  <br/><br/>Mr. Favreau brings a breezy swirling-cocktail style to this project.  The homages to the classic Christmas tv of the 60's and the sight of Will Farrell in yellow tights makes for one of the best Christmas movies since George C. Scott assumed the role of Ebenezer Scrooge.  No one but Mr. Farrell could have pulled this off, and no director could have made the movie seem hip, other than Mr. Favreau.  <br/><br/>And, to boot, it has one of the best and most exciting ""Santa and the reindeer"" scenes ever put on film."

The Donna Reed part would be fittingly played by Reese Witherspoon. I realize it's treading on sacred ground here to even consider recasting the movie, but why not?<br/><br/>It would be great to see a resurgence in well done holiday movies, perhaps even claymation specials, and I don't mean cheesy sequels like ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year""...where are the great stories and writers out there?

The over worked parent, the attention deprived kid, and the unexpected visitor that seemed to show up right at the nick of time, were all included.

While most of the other characters didn't exactly make you want to stand up and clap, Will Farrel certainly made tears form in your eyes, but not because you were unhappy. I personally came out of the theater still giggling under my breath with the image of Buddy running head long into the Christmas tree in attempt to get the star on the top fresh in my mind.<br/><br/>Still, most (if not all) of the funny parts were already shown in the trailer, so the best part was just waiting for them to happen. I found myself nudging the person next to me when I recognized the part coming up. Although I had seen it time and time again, the atmosphere of the entire theater doubled over laughing made it almost three times funnier than it had been on a computer screen.<br/><br/>The bottom line: It had the ho-hum and predictable plot with the corny lines, but the abnormally tall elf/man with the wierd felt hat and the pointy shoes made you want to stand up and say ""Bravo!"""

","It takes a pretty big pair of snowballs to release a Christmas movie this early in November.  The studio has to have enough confidence in their film that it will last at least to Christmas, which is more than a month and a half away.  After seeing ""Elf"", I understand why New Line was so confident.  ""Elf"" is destined to become a Christmas classic.  In the footsteps of Chevy Chase's Clark W.. Griswold III; and Bill Murray's Francis Xavier Cross, Will Ferrell's Buddy the Elf will be rerun for years to come on the Superstation for generations to enjoy.  I was skeptical at first that he could pull it off.  Where Eddie Murphy and Robin Williams have succeeded in making the leap to family films, others have failed.  Ferrell seems at his best when he can be a little raunchy and unpredictable.  His Frank the Tank in ""Old School"" was fantastic, but could he do the family thing?  Absolutely.  He has added another dimension to his acting, and this could prove to be a major turn in his career.  Also adding new dimension is John Favreau.  Favreau has made a career writng and directing films that are dialogue driven.  ""Made"" is one of the funniest films of the last decade, so for him to take on ""Elf"" must have been a harrowing decision.  He has eloquently captured the tone of what a good Christmas movie should be, and should be commended.  ""Elf"" also features great camp performances (which I will not spoil) and James Caan delivers his best performance since ""Bottle Rocket.""

","This movie was really very funny. The beginning scenes, with Will Ferrell living in the North Pole with other elves, was a bit corny, and I was wondering where exactly this movie was going. Fortunately, it went in exactly the right direction, and it had some fantastic comedic moments. Ferrell is hilarious as a hyper, super-polite elf who has no idea how to act in the human world. He is fascinated by glowing elevator buttons, terrified by an escalator, amazed at the size of human toilets, and basically awed by everything that normal people take for granted. The supporting characters are good too (especially Bob Newhart, who delivers all the goofy narration with a deadpan straight face), but Ferrell steals the show. He is a riot. <br/><br/>I truly believe this movie could become a classic Christmas film. I could not help but like it, even though it was a little on the hokey side.

Now he set his sights on a comical family/Christmas movie.  But I didn't know if the plot line would be that great.  Would it make me laugh so hard I spit out my $4 soda, or would I just be sitting there waiting to go home?  I guess I needed to go check it out to know for sure. Well the movie did not disappoint.  Sure, it had some of its moments where you were like ""that's so played out"", but most of the movie was full of happy Christmas joy.  Edward Asner was the perfectly cast Santa Claus, one of the best recent Santa castings.  James Caan as Buddy's father was very... what's the word... naughty.  You really despised his character for the most of the movie.  But that's what they were getting at.  And the biggest wow of the movie was Zooey Deschanel (Jovie).  She did an awesome awesome awesome job with the whole singing aspect of the movie.  She also was great in the acting aspect too.  She's the type of girl I could see myself hanging out with, which is a good thing because I love to relate to a character in a movie. This story was awesome.  One of the best written family movies in a while. School of Rock is the only family movie of the last few months which I think is written up to par with Elf.

"MovieManMenzel","8","0","1","9 November 2003"," A fun holiday film with a lot of heart and laughs
","Elf stars Will Ferrell as Buddy the elf in this fun holiday film. The story is rather simple; Buddy when he was a baby crawled into Santa's bag at the hospital on Christmas Eve. Santa found buddy once he returned to the North Pole and didn't want to return Buddy to the hospital since Buddy's parents put Buddy up for adoption. As he grows he is told that he was a human who has been raised by Elves and that he was adopted. Buddy then sets out to New York City to find his dad (James Caan) and spread the holiday spirit.<br/><br/>
I feared going to see this film but when I walked out of the film I was not only happy to have seen the film but was also rather touched. The movie from the trailers looks like nothing more than a silly movie where some big elf travels to NY and gets hit by cars and falls and continues to do this throughout the film. However to my surprise this was not the movie that I thought I was seeing. <br/><br/>Buddy the elf is a very funny and lovable character. Will Ferrell plays the character well and you really feel for him as a character.  It is a real pleasure to watch him on the big screen for the whole 1 hr and 35 minutes of this film. James Caan also comes in to this movie, as I guess in this movie you would call the Scrooge character. The film's other highlight character to me is the lovely Zooey Deschanel, who is Buddy's love interest in the film. I am a big fan of Zooey Deschanel and to me its not fair her career hasn't taking off yet. She was the highlight of many movies I have seen in the past including the Good Girl, Big Trouble, All the real girls, and Almost Famous. I guess what I am really getting to is the cast of this film was perfectly cast.<br/><br/>The humor of this film was a lot of slapstick style humor however thankfully no fart jokes, which was another big surprise for me. The humor sometimes in this film is in the dialog and not everyone catches the laughs. It's not all sight gags here. The film also is very beautiful. The views of New York City and the Christmas stores have a real Christmas feel to them just as if you were in New York City for Christmas. The director Jon Favreau did a great job on this film.  <br/><br/>The problem with this film could be this, it's not really original, and it uses scenes we have all seen before in movies but the question I ask is that necessarily a bad thing? Not all the time as long as the script is good and tries to be original at times and is not a carbon copy of another movie. Elf does have scenes of movies we have seen before but it also has some things that are original, which is where it counts. This isn't a academy award winning film, it's a holiday comedy. <br/><br/>So in conclusion, I thought I would hate Elf because of the way they marketed the movie but after long doubt and reading endless amounts of good reviews for this film, I took my brothers and we went to see Elf. It was a funny, pleasant, and heart felt movie, which I think, would soon become a Christmas classic like Scrooged, The Christmas Story and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Elf is fun and touching and when you walk out of this film you will feel good. I highly recommend this film to not only kids but also to adults and anyone who wants to jump-start their holiday spirit. My final rating for Elf is an 8/10."

","(Synopsis-Spoiler?)Will Ferrell stars as Buddy in this cute and wacky Christmas movie about a child raised as an elf at the North Pole at Santa's workshop.  After he grows to be twice the size of the other elves, he finds out that his biological father (James Caan) lives in New York City.  With his child like innocence, Buddy sets out on a long journey to find his father, and when he does, his father is like Scrooge and his stepbrother (Daniel Tay) doesn't believe in Santa.  Buddy can't understand why his new family and the people of New York City have forgotten the true meaning of Christmas.  Buddy works to bring back the Christmas spirit.  Buddy helps his brother win a snowball fight against some bullies in Central Park, and they become true brothers.  Next, he decorates the Santa Claus room at Gimbel's and meets a beautiful girl (Zooey Deschanel).  The Christmas spirit returns to New York City when everybody sings a Christmas song in Central Park. Kids will love this Christmas story and it will be enjoyable to parents. (New Line Cinema, Run Time 1:35, Rated PG) 6/10"

","So a few weeks ago my 20-something-year-old male friend mentioned how much he wanted to see this new movie Elf that was coming out and starring Will Ferrell.<br/><br/>Immediately I cringe inwardly, but nod my head and mention that I vaguely recall seeing something about that film on TV somewhere. Wasn't James Caan in it too? Hmm. Maybe it could be good. Heh.. maybe.<br/><br/>A little over a week later and this said friend is giving me a call. We decide to make plans for Friday, but why go out to eat again? After a few seconds of mentally listing the pros and cons of it, I just say it. I say, ""Didn't Elf come out today? Why don't we go see it since I know you want to."" A few hours later as we walk into the theatre, I'm praying that this movie will at the very least have more entertainment value than From Justin to Kelly. See? Not much in the expectations department.<br/><br/>Okay, so to get to the point of all this.. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. It's slightly childish, slightly unbelievable, and very, very funny. I fell in love with it, and I cannot wait to be able to add it to my collection of DVDs so that I can pull it out every year around Christmas and get myself in the mood to start buying strands upon strands of Christmas lights.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is right at home as he prances across the screen in tights, picks used gum off railings in New York City, bounces across beds in department stores, and naively assumes midgets are elves. This film pays homage to other Christmas classics, it miraculously has a decent plot to it that, while cheesy, is cheesy in a very good way.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I'm kind of hoping at least one of my other 20-something-year-old friends is interested in seeing this movie. Because I wouldn't mind seeing it again."

","Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Jon Favreau (the greatness of ""Swingers"", also the doctor in ""Elf"") provides the seasons first touch of holiday spirit.  Will Ferrell is perfect as the wanna-be/thought-I-was six foot three elf.  This film works because it has a nice little story (actually a couple of them) that provide the framework for some classic comedy scenes.  The VERY attractive and talented Zooey Deschanel (""the Good Girl"" ""Mumford"") is very good as Buddy's co-worker and friend.  I am looking forward to seeing just how good of an actress she will become.  She has the look to play a love interest or the bad guy/girl role.  A wonderful supporting cast helps make this one work.  James Caan as the Scrooge character and Ed Asner as Santa are both perfect, as is Bob Newhart as Ferrell's adopted elf father.  The key role of Caan's son/Ferrell's brother Michael is played well by Daniel Tay (played Harvey Pekar as a kid in one of this year's best films ""American Splendor"").  Also nice to see Peter Dinklage (from another of this year's best films ""The Station Agent"") in a bizarre, yet brief role as an angry, children's writer for hire.  This is definitely one you can take the whole family to.  There were kids in the audience from ages 2 to 80.  Go with the Christmas spirit, as this is not Shakespeare!"

","*If you hate spoilers, do not read this before Christmas!*  I'll admit it. The primary reason I went to see this had nothing to do with holiday spirit. It was more like morbid curiosity.  I mean, let's face it: BOB NEWHART IN TIGHTS??!   Well, once I got used to the sight, I quickly got into the main plot of the movie.  James Caan and Mary Steenburgen were their usual (consumate professional) selves.  Relative newcomers Daniel Tay and Claire Lautier are definitely going to get more film roles.  And, so will Zooey Deschanel (who does her own superb singing on the soundtrack)!  True; this was geared mostly for the seven-to-pre-teen demographic.  *There's even some light-hearted jabs at some of the Rankin/Bass classics.* So, the thirty-plus crowd might want to fake several trips to the rest room or the snack bar during the lamer (from a grown-up's p.o.v.) jokes.   Even so, it's a lot more family-friendly than most other stuff out there.  So, even though I'm a few weeks early, ""Happy Holidays""(and enjoy the flick)!"

","Caught a screening at the Austin Film Festival, and I can honestly say that I've never heard an audience laugh so continuously through a movie EVER. The humor is so sharp and so pervasive, that the laughter drowned out some of the lines. Screenwriter David Berenbaum, Director Favreau & Elf Ferrell have created a film that appeals to all ages and does the tradition of Rankin-Bass, ""Miracle on 34th Street,""  and ""A Christmas Story"" proud."

","Having just seen ""Elf"" I found myself wondering ""who would NOT like this movie""? It is so void of the usual self-indulgent ""irony"" of most of the crap comedies out there. There are no precocious kids uttering snap phrases or playing pranks to show what idiots adults are, no one stepping in dog-do, no un-funny gags or jokes that beg the question ""what were they thinking when they wrote this?"" I think it is the unique movie that is not made specifically for kids, but would be thoroughly enjoyed by them. Sure, the premise has been played out a million times (which one: the fish out of water, the innocent man-child who teaches all a lesson about being positive or seeming to be a genius in his naivete, the grump who sees the light about what's ""really important"" etc.) but in what a great way. Will Ferrell totally captures how a child comments and behaves on things he sees and just can't believe,  and what a lineup for the rest of the cast! Who knew Zooey Deschanel had such a great sexy voice? The duet in the Gimbel's bathroom is simply charming. Artie Lange as the ""fake"" Santa? (an ""Old School"" reunion of sorts!) And Amy Sedaris as the chirpy assistant to James Caan? Give the casting director a raise.<br/><br/>The filmmakers obviously had a great time making this clever Christmas movie (the use of Etch-a Sketches is brilliant as are the Christmas decorations that Buddy makes)that leaves you with a grin on your face. If you are looking for existential film fare, this ain't it. And that's okay. You just can't help but enjoy this movie."
