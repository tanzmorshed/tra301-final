"Treyroo","6","59","69","24 November 2012"," Great idea, mediocre execution
","Everyone is on a clock. What keeps the general population from devolving into id-driven mobs is the fact that no one knows how much time they have left on theirs. If you had a constant reminder on your forearm, however, you might simply go about your life in a desperate attempt to prolong it. Or not.<br/><br/>Will Salas (played by Justin Timberlake) is a 28-year-old factory worker whose one year clock started and aging stopped, like everyone else in the film, when he turned 25. He and his 50 year-old mother Rachel (played by Olivia Wilde) live in the ghettos of Dayton hoping to earn and save enough to at least see the next day. All while wages in the ghetto are constantly going down and the cost of living is constantly going up. Then, while out drinking with his friend Borel (played by Johnny Galecki), he learns of a man with more than a century left on his clock who has unadvisedly advertised his good fortune while in the same bar as Will and Borel. A local time-thief enters the picture and, rather than retreat like his friend did and advised him to do, Will comes to the aid of the fortunate stranger. While saving his life was all for naught, the stranger gives Will all the time left on his clock before allowing the time on his own clock to run out while he's sitting on a bridge overlooking a dry river basin.<br/><br/>""Time is money"" was a phrase first coined by Benjamin Franklin. While the idea of reversing that concept to ""money is time"" is interesting, I don't believe the cast was up to the challenge of exploring it. Whatever success Justin Timberlake might've had in supporting roles, he doesn't have what it takes to be the leading man. Amanda Seyfried, whose role has her playing off Timberlake for a lot of the film, is another professional whose appeal tends to overshadow her abilities for some reason. Perhaps an independent production could provide actors with genuine talent, who are young enough to look the part, but this is closer some sort of CW melodrama."
"droze01","7","174","216","20 January 2012"," Great start, decent follow-through.
","As others have said, the idea of this movie was excellent. You could call it a skeptical analogy of what is happening in some parts of the world – the richest people of the planet abusing poor.<br/><br/>What I liked about the movie, especially in the early stages, was how much the movie made me think. It was also bizarre to think of what things would be like if nobody looked older than 25. The movie played upon the possibility of multiple generations would look the same age – at least for those rich enough to afford to purchase the additional years. The story was also well thought out in relation to how people would act within the differing classes of society: the rich would take their time and take few risks. The poor would treasure their time, moving quickly, and, with less to lose, would be less risk adverse.<br/><br/>Great premise, great start to the movie, decent follow-through. Although I wish the strong start was able to be carried throughout the movie, I found this movie quite enjoyable to watch."
"wittmann73","Null","65","80","9 December 2011"," Interesting concept, but ...
","Let me play the nitpicker here: First off, the idea that your ""clock"" is always visible is pretty stupid to begin with. That's like us walking around with a bank balance stamped across our arm. It should become visible with a touch on the wrist or something.<br/><br/>The fact that all you have to do is touch arms to take time is stupid, ,too. There's no way to make it voluntary? No kind of security? I mean, it's you life for crying out loud!! <br/><br/>Will and Sylvia robbing their first time bank. How did they get a hold of an armored truck in the first place? All you have to do to rob a bank and get all the time you want is crash into the front? If it was that easy, everyone would be doing it! There are people dying in the streets everyday and no one has thought to do this? <br/><br/>Olivia's death, it was too cliché. Literally missing it by like a second? Come on!<br/><br/>Why would the lead Minute Man want to 'fight' Will? (also, they never made that concept clear until they sat at that table) Why wouldn't he just take his time and be done with it? He had nothing to gain from it. It was just weak writing in my opinion.<br/><br/>And what happened to that subplot of Will's father? They kept alluding to some great reveal or that Leon knew something Will didn't, but then the film just forgot about it. Are they trying to tell us that Will's altruism was hereditary? When Will got to Greenich, what was his plan? It seemed to me like he was just buying his way into high society and playing with the rich. I couldn't figure out what his endgame was going to be.<br/><br/>This one is again not a flaw, but can we all agree that car crash into the ditch looked just ridiculous? Terrible CGI and not believable at all.<br/><br/>And how they got the jump on Weiss, Sylvia's father. He's got more security around him than the President, but all you need is a pair of sunglasses to get the jump on him? Does the ""security team"" consist of random people who do not know each other? Then once you got him to lead you upstairs, all his bodyguards did what? Went out for lunch? Why didn't they go after him? Why weren't they waiting downstairs for him? Why weren't any alarms sounding? Stupid. So you have a million years in you hand and presumably only an hour on you wrist, yet you don't take any for yourself? I guess handing a little girl 999,999 years, 11 months, and 28 days just doesn't have the same resonance.<br/><br/>You can pay one year to get into Greenwich zone ... or you just walk in, there is no security or guards anyway.<br/><br/>""Wire me my per diem- wait, never mind ..."" that was stupid. All he had to do was put his arm out. Also, it made it obvious from that point how Leon was going to die.<br/><br/>Conclusion: If you're the kind of viewer who can overlook flaws like this, I can see someone finding this movie enjoyable, it had an interesting premise, with a good cast, but plots holes you could drive a monster truck through."
"kgmarra","6","296","395","1 November 2011"," Great idea. Poorly executed.
","Live forever or die trying. Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried star in the new sci-fi action film ""In Time"". Will Salas (Timberlake) and Silvia Weis (Seyfried) live in a futuristic world where time is the currency. In this world, people stop aging at 25. Once they turn 25, they only have one year to live, unless they find a way to get more time.<br/><br/>Will lives in the ghetto where people constantly are timing out (running out of time and dying), while Silvia lives in New Greenwich where people have centuries. It's extremely dangerous to have too much time; those with centuries are usually accused of stealing and are immediately killed.<br/><br/>When Will is accused of murder, he takes Silvia hostage and they run from the timekeeper (Cillian Murphy). Several times, they find themselves cutting it close with only seconds left on their clocks.<br/><br/>The concept is extremely unique and innovative, which made me think it was going to be an ""Inception""-type film. However, it was disappointing to see ""In Time"" fall short of my expectations. It pains me to say this, but Justin Timberlake should not have been chosen for the role of Will Salas. He just can't pull off the character of a tough guy from the ghetto. Amanda Seyfried is decent as Silvia, but she and Timberlake don't have much chemistry.<br/><br/>I also don't think the script was very well written, which causes Timberlake and Seyfried to be even less believable as their characters. In addition, the characters are not developed enough; it's difficult to get a sense of whom these people, from opposite worlds, really are.<br/><br/>I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the movie. I was distracted and the movie felt much longer than it actually is. For all of these reasons, I give ""In Time"" a 6 out of 10. Great idea. Poorly executed."
"JanTornado","6","41","51","19 December 2013"," Interesting idea, poorly executed
","If there's something instantly captivating about a movie - it's when the idea's new. In ""In Time"", the plot revolves around the interesting idea that time is the new currency and rules the world like the Dollar once used to. The poor must fight to live for a few days, the rich are practically immortal.<br/><br/>This could have become a new scifi milestone, if it wasn't for the poorly executed script, stiff acting and highly predictable plot. The scenes are thrown together and feel like reenacted from typical ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Romeo and Juliet"", two against the world and enemy of the state type movies. None of the scenes seem original or well executed. Actions and reactions by the actors seem unnatural or rushed, unrealistic even. Some character development just feels plain wrong. Not because of the plot, but because the characters don't seem to be portrayed very well. Although a scifi movie, realism is still necessary. ""In time"" shows a world that is not believable and many scenes seem straight stupid.<br/><br/>It's not a great movie. If not for the cool plot idea and the likable main character, it wouldn't be worth watching at all. But if you want to see a world, albeit fake, where people fight over time to survive, give it a go."
"tr91","8","53","70","30 September 2013"," Very unique film
","'In Time' was a film that I saw advertised when it was released and thought it looked good but then I didn't hear any more about it until I came across it on DVD. I'm glad I did manage to see this at last because it was very enjoyable.<br/><br/>The plot for this film is very unique, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this. There was a lot of familiar actors in this (Cillian Murphy, Johnny Galecki, Vincent Kartheiser to name a few). The acting was very good overall I thought, even from Justin Timberlake in the lead role.<br/><br/>There was some good drama as well as good action scenes (car chases, shooting etc). It is the sort of film that will keep you guessing as to what will happen next and it was just a very interesting concept overall.<br/><br/>It would have been nice if there was a bit more back story though, it was never really explained why the world was like it was. Apart from that, just take it for what it is and enjoy it.<br/><br/>Would recommend it to anyone who fancies watching something a bit different.<br/><br/>8/10."
"primona","7","13","15","1 March 2013"," In Time is Surprisingly Time Well Spent
","I found this movie original and enjoyable. It's about a futuristic world where people stop aging at 25. They all have a digital clock on their forearm bearing a year's worth of time. The clock begins its countdown once you turn 25. There is no money in this bleak future world. Instead the currency is time. Everything you do from getting coffee to riding the bus is paid in time so literally time is money. Within this backdrop is a love story and revenge tale. Justin Timberlake is suitable as factory worker Will Silas and Amanda Seyfried plays the beautiful, pampered Sylvia. They are likable and the chemistry between the two is believable. The main downside to the movie is the subplot involving Timekeeper/Cop Raymond Leon and his cronies. I found his character annoying and his zeal for the job unbelievable. However, the plot is strong enough to make-up for this distraction. As someone not expecting a lot, I was glad I took the time to watch this movie."
"rajan-stwf","8","23","29","9 May 2013"," In Short, Thoroughly Entertaining.
","I don't know about you but looking down at the reviews there seem to be an overwhelming amount of negative responses. I was completely disheartened by this.<br/><br/>In my opinion, In Time was an original well written and well acted and truly thought provoking production and I loved it. The fact that it subtly questioned our morality and made us question real world issues such as poverty and political stance was just one of the things that made me love this movie.<br/><br/>To the people who dislike the feature and to those negative reviews which I have read I have a few responses. Firstly, I saw a point about not enough back story into the body clock. The first thought that struck me was really? The movie is not centred around the body clock, and furthermore throughout the film we are told of its uses and get to a fairly good understanding to how it works. Do you not agree that any more back story would waste time and most likely just bore the typical viewer? Finally to those who disliked the acting and script I strongly disagree. I though both Justin and Amanda played there parts very well and there chemistry was as good as any action film I have scene.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film to anyone, and suggest if you haven't already seen it you should definitely make some time if you think you will enjoy this movie."
"skepsci","5","262","410","30 October 2011"," Time is wasting and you may want your time back at the end of the film
","I'll start straight off the cuff. Niccol is one of my favourite writer/directors. In fact, one of my favourite films is Gattaca, which has been so under-rated over the years since its release. To me he's been a great Sci-Fi writer, so going into this I was hopeful of something of quality.<br/><br/>Alas, ""In Time"" is not for the true Sci-Fi thinker. It paints a world in which time is money. That isn't that new an idea, but Niccols does succeed in pushing the metaphor as a commodity. Those with time are rich, those without time are poor. It's a simplistic analogy. As with Niccol's other films, the cinematography is beautiful. The best actors in the film aren't the main characters, rather Cillian Murphy, Vincent Kartheiser and (surprisingly) Alex Pettyfer present more interesting characters. They all shine, especially Murphy. The film seems like one long car chase, when what you actually want to delve into are the complexities - the debates between the characters themselves over the issues of the world they live in. Not a single clever conversation happens between anyone. Murphy is a great actor and I would have been interested to see the debate about right and wrong become greyed through some thinking. Life is not black and white. The film ending is unrealistic and I wonder if this was the ending envisioned by Niccol or the ending the producers wanted to boost sales. <br/><br/>Sadly this film could have been a great deal more. It had a good topic. It had some great actors, yet it failed because the story lost the nuances and complexities to meet the lowest common denominator, rather than raising questions or making the viewer think critically. See it, but be prepared to be disappointed. It isn't subtle."
"derekblake","Null","228","357","1 November 2011"," Make Time for this Movie.
","A very unusual film screen-play, well written and shot, don't expect any CGI effects here, this is a very down to Earth sci-fi that bears more than a passing resemblance to our current problem with world banks. Surprisingly Justin Timberlake puts in a very professional performance, and not a song in sight, Timberlake carries the part with a very grounded performance being so laid back that he is almost horizontal. Amanda Seyfried submits a polished performance although her make-up makes her look like one of those Japanese animations of what a European looks like, complete with over-sized eyes. The film holds the attention from the first to the last frame and provokes some emotion from the viewer on several levels. Certainly worth a watch, not quite a Rolex, but much better than a Timex."
"ArtandJoyofMovies","Null","168","262","5 November 2011"," Time well spent!
","This is a really cool idea for a film. A day in the future when the commodity of value is not cash or gold, it is time. Everyone gets to live to age 25. After that you have one year to live, or less. It all depends upon whether you use all your time credits or you earn more. Regardless, if you live to age 100, or longer, your body physically remains looking twenty five.<br/><br/>On the plus side is Justin Timberlake coming back and showing that his misstep in Bad Teacher (2011) was just one of those embarrassing Hollywood screw ups. Timberlake has real drama and acting talent and is definitely here for the long haul. (Too bad Elvis was never given such chances.) Timberlake gave us a glimpse of his depth last year in The Social Newtwork (2010) , but his talents were not fully developed for Friends with Benefits (2011). <br/><br/>The script starts with the eerie, sobering reminder, and all too familiar words, ""We don't have time...we don't have time..."" Think if today you had to buy everything with time, instead of bank credit or cash. Coffee costs four minutes. A bus ride costs an hour. A car costs two years. People can give or take time from each other. Just don't run out of time or you will die on the spot. If this were real, would you treasure and spend time more wisely? The real interesting question may be that time really is the currency we live by now, we just fail to see it that way. The simple fact is that you can earn countless piles of cash and gold in this world, but you really cannot buy time. Despite the wealthy in today's world sometimes being able to cheat a few years with better health care, we all are going to die in the same average years.<br/><br/>While the script is the superficial tale of Will Salas (Timberlake) and his Mom (Wilde) trying to pass time in a futuristic world, the messages of the film go far deeper. It is really a tale of class warfare. People who have time, like the mega ""eonaire"" Phillipe Weis (Katheiser) and his rich daughter Sylvia (Seyfried) and those who constantly struggle to keep time (or run out of it) like the Salas family. Will gets the chance to move up into a better time zone thanks to a man who has just decided that after a hundred years or so, he prefers to ""time out."" He leaves Will the prophetic warning ""Don't waste my time."" How Will chooses to spend his time, for himself or for the benefit of all, is now the story.<br/><br/>I really did not mind that the future depicted in this film was not futuristic looking and all the cars were vintage 1970's models with updated lighting and electric sounding motors. It saved a huge budget rather than try to make the world look like it probably will in 2013 or so. And I think the point was that the future is really now.<br/><br/>As an entertaining film, my 7.5 rating is spot on. As a thought provoking experience, I might have given it a 10.0. After seeing this film, you should go out and visit with friends. Your own clock is ticking down. Are you really using it wisely? Unlike the time down clock on the arm of the people in this film, you never know when your time is about up.<br/><br/>This film...it's worth your time."
"Fields201","4","203","323","30 October 2011"," A Really Good Drinking Game
","The only way In Time could be fully enjoyed is make a drinking game whenever someone says ""time"" in the movie. You will be drunk halfway through the movie and most likely dead at the end of it. <br/><br/>There were two things that made me want to see this movie: 1) The premise sounded interesting. The fact that it's about people living off time, with the rich living forever and the poor living off borrowed time is a rather thought-provoking one. And 2) I like Justin Timberlake. What saddens me is that he just wasn't very good in this movie, as he and the dowey-eyed Amanda Siegfried both just seem so bored throughout the entire movie. They have zero chemistry and I'm even going to say that they are just as bad as Anakin and Padme in Star Wars. That's the lowest bar you can go in the chemistry lab. <br/><br/>Not only did Justin Timberlake seem bored, but he also has a hard time conveying certain emotions. Take the scene where his mother dies in his arms, for instance. Wasn't convinced, Justin. His crying felt forced and it was. After that he vows revenge against all the time people, and risks being chased by the Timekeeper (the always awesome Cillian Murphy), and after he is given a decade worth of time from someone who is tired of living, he meets up with some rich people and kidnaps a rather high Amanda Siegfried and then starts taking time, and giving it to people, you know, like Robin Hood.... except with time. They work together, bored the whole way through, and they try to convey emotions like love.... because if you have a guy and a girl on screen together, you have to make them full in love. That's Hollywood 101 right there!<br/><br/>This is really disappointing to me because I expected better out of In Time. What I got is pretty much a boring movie, with a premise that sounded interesting but then it turns the movie into a one-note-wonder. If I could turn back time, I would have seen Puss In Boots instead."

","Looking at this film and its concept I was intrigued. With this said the film does fail to live up to the potential of its concept. One of the few major issues i have with this film is the lack of back-story with regards to the implementation of the 'body clock', along with the lack of true quality acting and a well written script. As a result of this what the viewer will get from this film experience are moments (and i mean moments) where you are enjoying the film, but by the end of it all you can reflect on what you have seen and notice that you could have done a lot more with your money if you had not gone to watch In Time.<br/><br/>...What a pity"

Time is the commodity in the future. But the best part is how the filmmaker show the audience how to use this commodity in normal everyday life. How much time you pay for certain things, where to get extra time, etc. Simply brilliant.<br/><br/>I never cared too much about Timberlake before, but his performance in Social Network caught my attention, and In Time further proves that he can act. The pace can be quite a drag here and there, but its full of suspense all the way, many chase scenes and all.<br/><br/>For those of you who are tired of prequels, sequels, three-quels, superheros, robots, aliens, etc, give In Time a shot, its definitely worth your time.

He plays a ""Time Keeper"" but dies by forgetting to watch his time... the mysterious stranger who gives away time also needs no reason to, other than being tired of living.<br/><br/>There was even an oversight somewhere in the middle, whereby JT asks AS for a ""loan"" only to get rejected though he has but hours to live.

"napierslogs","7","14","18","13 November 2011"," Time is money and the science fiction romance genre is money for Hollywood
","In the world of ""In Time"", time is money. Literally. Set in a future where everybody ages until 25, then they have one year left to live, except that one year is currency. The rich can live at age 25 eternally and the poor don't always have a chance to live. Time zones are classes of wealth and you can't cross over without upsetting the order of the world. It's quite possible that they have taken this time is money equation too far.<br/><br/>But I enjoyed this twist on the same old action movie. It even starts with some thoughts on philosophy. A rich boy finds himself in a poor man's bar where everybody wants a piece of him, so much so that his considerable wealth and time line are in danger. While the poor are in constant need of money, it turns out that the rich don't have the same drives for life. This rich guy is impressed by Will's (Justin Timberlake) honesty and earnest desire to find out how the other side lives. Will is then faced with the possibility of an infinite life time of money.<br/><br/>From there, we get a Robin Hood action movie. Will pairs up with a daddy's girl vixen, Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) and they are on the run from the time keepers (Cillian Murphy). I have enjoyed Timberlake's recent foray into the world of movie stars, but I like him more as a comedic straight man than as an action hero. Seyfried, on the other hand, proves that she can play pretty much anything. A mysteriously innocent, sharp-shooting, sexy action girl suits her well.<br/><br/>The logic that this new world presents is pretty easy to figure out, but as you are doing that at least you are distracted from the usual action movie set-up. Hollywood has ventured again into the science fiction romance genre, and has again come out with an intelligent, action-packed film with something for everyone."

","I went into this one with the lowest expectations, and boy was I wrong. For one thing, before I saw his name in the opening credits, I had no idea this was an Andrew Niccol film, and since he is the stylish, stylized genius who gave us GATTACA, suddenly things were looking up. Then, wow, this cast! Sure, I knew about Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, but check out the rest of them: Olivia Wilde, Cillian Murphy, THE BIG BANG THEORY's Johnny Galecki, WHITE COLLAR's Matt Bomer and genre-It Kid, Alex Pettyfer. I mean, come on! How can a movie be directed by Andrew Niccol AND contain so much of the pretty AND also be science fiction and NOT be completely, exactly, entirely the kind of movie that I would love, love, love? <br/><br/>Want to know why my expectations were low? I'd seen a snippet of the trailer -- which just looked to me like a bunch of TRANSFORMERS-style running around the place -- and had read the basic film synopsis sent to me by Fox Studios' publicity department. So what I knew was this: <br/><br/>""Welcome to a world where time has become the ultimate currency. You stop aging at 25, but there's a catch: you're genetically-engineered to live only one more year, unless you can buy your way out of it. The rich ""earn"" decades at a time (remaining at age 25), becoming essentially immortal, while the rest beg, borrow or steal enough hours to make it through the day. When a man from the wrong side of the tracks is falsely accused of murder, he is forced to go on the run with a beautiful hostage. Living minute to minute, the duo's love becomes a powerful tool in their war against the system."" <br/><br/>Why was I hesitant about this premise? Because, come on! How many sci-fi tropes do you want to hit? Predetermined age-limit to combat overpopulation: LOGAN'S RUN, among many others. Being able to effectively purchase immortality: Elizabeth Moon's Familias Regnant series, among many others. Falsely accused and on the run in a future, dystopian society: hello MINORITY REPORT, THE ISLAND and who knows what all else! But you know what? Much like he did in GATTACA, where he took the already well-worn path of the genetically-superior being not necessarily being superior and made it his own, writer/director Niccol brings a freshness, almost a whole new sensibility to these and the other trappings of classic sci-fi he offers up to us here. We also get action, suspense, romance, humor, social commentary, gorgeous visuals and, as I mentioned, bucket loads of the pretty -- I would pay good money to see Matt Bomer and Olivia Wilde in anything; impossibly beautiful doesn't even begin to cover that blessed pair -- and wow, what a thoroughly, unexpectedly fun, truly thought-provoking and utterly engaging time this movie was. I am still flabbergasted at just how much I dug this. I actually broke into spontaneous applause as the credits rolled. And I can't wait to see it again.<br/><br/>But the big question: how was JT? He was, I will have you know, excellent. I have long felt that there was something effortlessly engaging about his whole persona, whether in interviews or on SNL or in roles as diverse as beleaguered rookie cop in EDISON, Napster hipster Sean Parker in THE SOCIAL NETWORK or squirrelly substitute Scott in BAD TEACHER. He doesn't really seem to act: he just IS. Here, he is an unlikely action hero, but somehow, he pulls it off in grand style, looking simultaneously earnest, dangerous and adorable, and easily holding his own even alongside someone the likes of Murphy, whose hypnotic eyes can convey more in one blink of an eyelash than many a lesser actor can get across in an entire soliloquy.<br/><br/>All of the other performances are top notch, particularly from Wilde and Galecki -- who brings most of the funny in the film -- and hey, you know who else is in here! Vincent Kartheiser, AKA Connor from ANGEL! And he's not bad at all, either. In fact, he and Pettyfer are our main bad guys, and both pull of criminal cool pretty damn well.<br/><br/>The long and the short of it? See this film. It's entertaining, it has a message, it is a feast for the eyes, and we definitely need to be encouraging more of this kind of genre filmmaking. True, it's not a truly original piece of work. In fact, in addition to all of the other things it reminds me of, it also brings to mind EQUILIBRIUM -- not so much in its content but in the way that it is essentially a mashup of a whole bunch of established ideas out of speculative fiction, but gives them new life (Equilibrium went with BRAVE NEW WORLD, FAHRENHEIT 451, 1984 -- and also LOGAN'S RUN as its inspirations). But that's okay; I really like EQUILIBRIUM, too. <br/><br/>In doing a little research for this review, I discovered that the ever-litigious SF luminary Harlan Ellison is suing Niccol and various studio-types for plagiarism, given this movie's similarity to his 1965 short story ""'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman."" Having not read the piece in question, I can't comment, but considering Ellison's unrelenting pursuit of copyright infringers, one would think that if Niccol WAS to knowingly steal from anyone, he'd have picked a safer target. After all, most of the ideas in this movie can be found all over Sci-Fi, not to mention in Action, and Drama and Crime, as well.<br/><br/>But sometimes it's not about the provenance of the ideas, it's what you do with them. And here, Niccol has done wonders. (As long as you suspend your disbelief and go with the fact that Timberlake, Seyfried and the rest are, biologically, only 25. Luckily, Hollywood's been conditioning us to do just that for years.) <br/><br/>-- Rachel Hyland, Geek Speak Magazine"

","Well this film was surprisingly better than I was expecting it to be.. Justin Timberlake isn't a very strong actor in my opinion, but he took the spotlight in this one. Amanda Seyfried looked beautiful as ever with her little bob, and the acting really wasn't too bad.<br/><br/>There's sad and happy moments all with that little bit of constant tension as you'll find if you watch it.<br/><br/>It was a really good concept and an enjoyable film, I gave it an 8/10 as I think they could've thought of a better lead actor but it was enjoyable none the less. I would recommend it to anyone, it doesn't really ever become boring and the tension keeps you focused at all times."
"jhonny-201-705311","2","162","285","1 November 2011"," Worst movie i've seen in a cinema for a long time
","So we went to see this movie with my girlfriend, she was eager to see JT so i said oh well, my friend said it's a one-timer so we can give it a shot... and a shot in my head too.<br/><br/>I don't know where to begin. The good things: only one. The whole concept of the film is a great idea that money=time, and that rich people are greedy and they steal all the money(time) and poor people have to live day by day or they just die, not literally. Which is just like how the world is going, and which way the world is going atm. So that i liked. There were some OK suspense moments also, but seriously, those are the only good things i can say about this film.<br/><br/>What i didn't like: everything else. So there is this 28 year old badass guy from ze ""ghetto"", * (OBVIOUS) SPOILER ALERT * they get together with this gal from uptown, and after figuring out what to do, they break into a bank in the middle of the ghetto. There are no cops or security to stop them, they just drive through the glass, open the vault, hand out all the cash, then drive away. Seriously, why didn't any of the ghetto people EVER thought of this before? And after that, they rob one of the richest people of the USA, get away with so much money(time) that the whole economy could collapse... and they just drive away in their car. No police, no nothing. Oh yea, did i mention that cops don't have any radios or anytin? Super- future where computer interfaces are all over the place that can read human DNA, but not a single cell phone or any mobile device, NOT EVEN FOR THE POLICE!!! ARE YOU FREAKIN KIDDIN ME? Is this for real? And all the time, all the same 3 people chase our heroes around. The girls father walks around with like 15 security people, and they have 3 cops to chase the big bad villains. Yep, that's the future for you. And these 2 always get away just by running & driving around. JT beats every1 and any1 not even breaking a sweat. But hey, what did i expect, i guess it's my fault...<br/><br/>Conversations are like if they were written by 5 year old, and i'm not kidding. I can't even remember one, but it's something like this: stupid question, stupid obvious answer, rince & repeat.<br/><br/>And i could go on and on, but there's only 1 more thing i'll mention. The structure of the film. Holy Cr*p. It's like they just made cuts and scenes, pasted them together and thats it. They just get from one situation to another and i was scratching my face, what the hell are they doing here now? How did we get here? And seriously, WHY? Why is that everything in this film is soooo obvious, that i would've liked to scream out loud in the cinema while tearing my own hair out. The first few mistakes you smirk and get over it, but they just keep coming and coming at you like if someone deliberately wrote this to test your nerves.<br/><br/>So that's it. I've never written a movie review before, but i just had to put it out there to warn everyone. I'm only giving this film a 2 out of 10 because the idea wasn't that bad to begin with. But everything else is screwed up, almost as if someone would try to deliberately write a bad script out of a good idea."
"ironhorse_iv","6","15","21","6 November 2014"," This movie was a waste of time for me. Great concept, badly executed.
","It's time to review this dystopian sci-fi thriller film. Written & directed by Andrew Niccol, the movie open up in 2169, where people are born genetically engineered with a digital clock on their forearm. To help avoid overpopulation, when people turn 25 years old, they stop aging and their clock begins counting down from one year; when it reaches zero that person ""times out"" and dies instantly. Time has become the universal currency. The country has been divided into ""time zones"" based on the wealth of the population. The movie focuses on two specific zones: Dayton, a poor manufacturing area where people like Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) live day-to-day and New Greenwich, the wealthiest time zone, where Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfield) can live nearly forever. This is an everyday struggle for Will until he ends up rescuing a rich guy named Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer). For this favor, Henry gives his time to Will, so that he take revenge for the death of Will's mother (Olivia Wilde). Now with plenty of time, he plans to give the people, the freedom of their lives, by making the upper class pay. Too bad, Will Salas is a hypocrite. He delays all this, so that he can spent time, buying nice cars, eating at fancy restaurants, trying to hook up with Sylvia, attending rich people parties and playing high stakes poker. It takes forever to get to the 'Robin Hood' plot that the movie trailer promise us. Lots of filling scenes that slow down the pace to a crawl. The movie plot is a thinly-veiled allegory for the Occupy Wall Street movement against the 1%. It's supposed to be social commentary about the growing global divide between the haves and have-nots. It's an intriguing premise, but unfortunately, the movie follows a really predictable formulaic plot, ending with lousy satisfying conclusion. Robbing banks will solve the economy?!? What? This is a good example of Hollywood not understanding economics. Do they think, robbing banks would solve the economy? It would make it worst. ""Is it stealing if it's already stolen?"" quotes the movie. Yes, it is. This movie is just a mess; trying to add a Bonnie and Clyde type heist story with political overtones doesn't work. There was no depth to the movie's resolution other than everyone deserves equality. The movie lacks good exposition. It's too heavy-handed, explaining a lot of things that didn't need to. The movie takes a lot of Artistic License in science and economic causing a lot of things to make no sense. Obviously made for a teen demographic, everybody in the film cast is beautiful as hell. It's implied, they are genetically engineered, but still, I didn't know, the really poor, can still look amazing gorgeous, despite only have hours or minutes to live. It's really jarring. I do hope that the film makers know that aging isn't a gene. Even if the rich can live forever, the skin will still be thinner and wrinkled by time manly due to exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Aging can't be stop. Only postponed. Also, why 25 year old is the cut-off date? Isn't that the age frame where most people do the most work? Why not, use the ones that you selection to be born, longer like until 50 or 60 year old until terminating them? They isn't no point to eliminate them in the first place. You kill a lot of young people, who does the majority of the work? There is no reason why children should even being born, if they're genetically engineered and nobody dies from old age. Another thing, why waste resources waiting for the children to reach 25 in the first place? Just create a fully grown male and female. It doesn't make sense why people still need to eat and drink, when they don't feed on energy. How can you get alcohol poisoning if disease are eradicate in this world? There are so many loose-ends that I can go on, about like what happen to the time, when people die due to mauling to their bodies. If they are genetically engineered, couldn't they just get fix up? The movie even forget sub-plot like what happen to Will's late father. The movie is also very insulting. A lot of over the top rich people have Jewish last names pushing the Greedy Jew stereotypes. The acting is mediocre. Justin Timberlake is pretty lackluster. The best actor in the film, had to be Cillain Murphy. Amanda Seyfield is just there to be the love-interest, despite Will kidnapping her at gunpoint and almost killing her in a car accident. How romantic, Stockholm Syndrome, Patty Hearst right there. How stupid! The good things about the film is the score, the action, and the set design. It really does look futuristic. I love the time fighting race against the clock tense moments. Still, there were a lot of stupid suicidal disregard of time allowance by characters that makes you wonder. Are these people, stupid? Will himself keeps coming into large quantities of time, then giving it away and leaving himself only a few hours or even minutes instead of a few years. There is a strongly reminiscent of this film to other media works. Due to that reason, the film got often dealt with copyright lawsuits. One is Harlan Ellison whom believe that the film's plot was based on his 1965 short story 'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman"". Another is Lee Falk who believe it was taken from ""Mandrake and the Goldman: Time is Money"", a comic issue. Many of the elements of In Time can be found in the 1987 short film 'The Price of Life' & the Hannu Rajaniemi's novel 'The Quantum Thief' as well. Overall: There isn't enough time in the world, to get me to re watch this bad movie. You're probably better off just watching 1997 Gattaca than wasting time and money on this movie."
"tklliang","10","13","18","2 September 2012"," Exceeded Expectations!
","The concept of using time as currency totally intrigued me into watching the movie. When the time runs out on a specific person, the person dies. This also means that some can live forever. Then there's Justin Timberlake. I like him as an actor as much as a singer, whether solo or N*SYNC. The rest of the main cast is great as well. I have been a fan of Cillian Murphy since 28 Days Later. His performances in the new Batman franchise and Inception really sets him apart from the pack. He did not disappoint in this movie. I like Amanda Seyfried's contribution to the movie as well. The only other lead role that I've seen her in was Red Riding Hood. She has great potential and I will definitely be following her career, Les Miserables now became more promising as a good movie to me now.<br/><br/>The set, the props, the visuals of the movie all complement each other and formed a great stage for the actors to perform upon. This is a science fiction film, but it is made so that the viewer can relate without being alienated. In the movie, people drove cars that are recognizable, dressed in current fashion, and used technology more or less familiar to us. Of course, the whole concept of time as a currency and its transaction methods will be new to us, and that is pretty much it. The viewer will not be distracted by flying cars or outrageous clothing.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to all with an open mind. It can be a great discussion piece, for it can truly be opened up for deep talks. I will not be surprised if this movie is talked about in an academic setting. Sit back, enjoy, and possibly discuss after it ends."
"thomasajjouri","6","18","27","7 December 2011"," A awesome idea wasted
","I honestly didn't know what to give this movie. The idea is truly awesome and the movie is actually entertaining, which for me is perhaps the most important thing. But at the same time it could have been so much better.<br/><br/>The main problem is simply that it is insanely unrealistic. For example: why has the CELLPHONE been uninvented? They don't exist in the movie. Only phonebooths :/ The death of the mother could have been easily prevented with a simple phone call or SMS. And why on earth is the security in general so weak? It is WAY too easy for them to rob banks and do whatever they want. Just one guy and one girl with handguns. Why hasn't someone done it before? If I knew I was going to die in a few hours unless I robbed a bank or something I think I would at least TRY it. Would you? Doesn't make any sense at all! So in the end I'll give it 6 because the idea was great and the movie kept me entertained. But besides that I think it was a waste of a really good idea..."
"jain_ashu","1","54","96","16 November 2011"," An awful movie
","I went to the movie with high expectation generated by really good trailers. But the good part ends there. The storyline is too simplistic and out of depth. The protagonist is modern day robin-hood who takes it upon himself to rob time rich people and distribute the excess time to the poor. He robs the bank with such an ease and without any resistance that I wonder why anybody before him didn't try that! <br/><br/>The movie is a series of goof ups. <br/><br/>1) The girls gets her hand on the gun first time and she shoots like a pro. <br/><br/>2) She and the hero have and argument, runs down a long road, negotiate and sells the ear rings and then hide from the police but the two minute that was left of the girl's life doesn't end. ROFL! <br/><br/>3) When the chase between the cop and the protagonist begins suddenly the road turns lively teeming with cars and trucks and as soon as it gets over the road suddenly gets deserted.<br/><br/>4) The building into which the protagonist takes a man in course of saving his life is nondescript and empty except for two costly looking pieces of sofa kept right in the middle of the floor. As if somebody knew that they will be coming and arranged so that our hero doesn't face any discomfort.<br/><br/>Leave along the hero, even the villain does't lives up to the expectation and dies without a whimper. Clearly, the movie lacks strong storyline. The direction was without the direction and acting average.<br/><br/>Its a total waste!"
"andell","9","39","68","28 October 2011"," The Social Commentary is obvious...but the film still stands out well!
","It's interesting that this film is coming out now, as the ""Occupy"" movement is raging in several cities around the world. It couldn't be more opportune for a film like this, which makes an obvious statement about the concentration of resources in the hands of a few, and the pain and complexity the creates in the lives of the many.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake is impressive as Will Salas, a 28 year old man who is chronically living day to day, literally, due to the fact that he was born in a slum, in a world where your life span is the only currency out there. Of course we are left with no doubt that although he feels the pressure acutely, he is still very generous to the people in his community.<br/><br/>One night at a local bar, Will happens to meet Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), a man who has lots of time, but is weary after having living for more than a century already. Will saves Henry from a gang of time hustlers known as ""Minute Men"" by hiding out in a factory. It is there, after Will sleeps, that Henry empties his clock of all but 5 minutes, topping up Will's life span before leaving to secure a poetic end for himself.<br/><br/>Will all this time on his clock, Will gives some to his drunkard friend, and intends to use much of the rest to treat his 50 year old Mother Rachel (Olivia Wilde), only to get to her too late to prevent her from ""timing out"" for good. Devastated by her loss, Will decides to work to help others and shake up the system.<br/><br/>Along the way, Will is pursued Timekeeper Leon (played effectively by Cillian Murphy) and by Fortis (supurbly played by the gorgeous Alex Pettyfer) and his Minute Men gang. While trying to evade both men and their factions, Will takes rich girl Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) hostage...which turns into a romance There are some scenes that are fun to watch...among the funnest for me was the showdown between Will and Fortis. Fortis and his men capture Will and Sylvia, and as he was holding a personal grudge, Fortis decides to fight Will, man to man, as they do it in that futuristic day. Of course little does Fortis know that Will learned how to fight from his Father...and before he knows it, his men are shot dead, and Fortis himself is ""timed out"" (or in other words, killed) by Will. It is an excellent scene in a very good film! <br/><br/>The film itself however works because the commentary is so relevant: Will sees the system for it's cruelty, but as he works to change it, he's unable to do it without the help of Sylvia. Timekeeper Leon was once in the ghetto like Will, and he seems to be a fair man, but he believes that the system is the best one available to THIS society at THIS time...so it's best to uphold it and accept it. Fortis is the scumbag criminal (albeit gorgeous) who plays dirty and cannibalizes his own community to get ahead...so he likes the system because it lets him do what he wants to do. Sylvia is the curious and insulated branch of affluence who knows the system is unfair, but is unsure of how to change it.<br/><br/>Check out this film...it's certainly worth it!"

Everybody ages normally, until they reach their peak at Age 25 (an age I guess where we all felt we were at our best) - And then their Clock starts.<br/><br/>Everybody is given a year, gratis: But in this future, the only currency is TIME. The cost of a Bus Ride, is 2 hours - One more hour than Justin Timberlake's Mother (Olivia Wilde) has.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake works in a factory where they make devices that store TIME. They pay him in Time - But today, they shorted him, because they did not bother to tell him his quota had gone up. That is the problem with this future, nobody bothers to tell anyone else when things that matter like this suddenly change. So a person who depends on stability for day to day living gets put into a jam when suddenly, it costs more money to live than they have left on their ""clock."" But Timberlake, sees a Rich Man enter the Bar where he hangs out - The man is wasting money with no regard for ""Minutemen"" - Crooks who will steal your time. Timberlake protects the hapless guy from Main minuteman Alex Pettyfer (I Am Number 4) and they hide in an abandoned Warehouse. But the man was Henry Hamilton, who was worth Hundreds of Thousands of Years - He only had a hundred years left on his Clock, and he gives it to Timberlake, with the Admonition ""Don't Waste My Time"" - Because, people are implanted with a Clock that can either give or receive Time from any other Living person. If a person dies with time on their Clock, that time is gone forever. So Rich Guy Hamilton ""gives"" Timberlake ALL of his time save for 5 minutes which he uses to Sit on a Bridge - Timberlake tries to save him, but all that does is put Timberlake's Face on a Camera at a Crime Scene.<br/><br/>This starts Timberlake on a little romp where he has to evade not only The Minutemen, but Timekeepers. The first thing Timberlake does is give his best friend 10 years, but his friend drinks himself to death. He then tries to give some to his mother, but Mom could not get on the bus, as they had increased the fare by more than she had. She tries to run all the way, but misses Timberlake by mere seconds. <br/><br/>With nobody left to keep him, Timberlake decides to see how the 1% lives - So he takes a cab ride ""uptown"" - Where he meets rich man Phillipe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser) and milks him of several hundred grand worth of Time. This impresses daughter Sylvia, and Timberlake gets invited to Weis' little Party for the 1%.<br/><br/>But the Timekeepers want to talk to Timberlake as to why he ended up with the last of Hamilton's time, and they crash Weis' party - And so Timberlake grabs a very Goth-Looking Silvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) and its the best case of Stockholm Syndrome she ever had.<br/><br/>Several Times, Seyfried and Timberlake are left with Mere Seconds to live, but using wits they keep afloat, and eventually beat the 1% and give the 99% some hope - By ""redistributing the wealth"" a bit - Seyfried and Timberlake decide to create their own little Stimulus Package when they rob her pop out of the only existing Time-Storage Device that has 1 Million years on it.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later) is the Time-Cop who is trying to catch Timberlake, Murphy plays the role like he always plays em, makes us believe it.<br/><br/>This film is populated with every young actor in Hollywood - Remember, nobody ever ages past 25. So, some of these actors do a great job of making us believe that they are several decades older than they appear."
"projitmookerjee","8","10","14","5 March 2012"," Do you have Time?
","From director Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, Lord of War, S1m0ne) comes a sci-fi thriller that paints a stark world where time has replaced money. In the real world if you run out of money, you can still survive for a day where you work out alternative means for survival. But in this universe, you have to ration it out so carefully because if your time runs out, your heart stops beating. So your every action has an catastrophic effect on your time. So if you get your head around this concept, you will find that this world has been mirrored in exactly the same fashion as the real world, where there are Ghettos with people who are always struggling to get time and on the other hand are the rich people with eons on their hand to spend. I will not talk about the intricacies of the plot, which i will leave for the viewer to discern.(because as is the case with any good sci-fi thriller, the number of time you watch the movie, the more it unravels its mysteries). Niccol does a terrific job at throwing the viewer in the deep end of the pool, and expects them to swim as the movie progresses. The cast is top notch here with Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, Cillian Murphy, rendering a credible performance. They are ably supported by a supporting cast of Olivia Wilde (House), Matt Bomer (white Collar), Johnny Galecki (Big Bang Theory) and others who keep adding layers to the plot. Special mention for the set design, cinematography & special effects as they paint a contrasting universe which is so real and so different and yet looks exactly like the world we live in and the way it functions. There are a few areas which might stick out as sore thumb, but in the end it will certainly leave you satisfied. This is one film which will certain make you value your time more."

Enough drama and thriller to catch the breath of the audience, followed by strong performances. In the end, it leaves you with lots to think about, even though the ending is not in the same volume as the rest of the movie. The director did a great job in keeping the love story in normal paces and emphasizing in the main idea, the resistance to the unfair time system. Dramatic characters, with passions and strong believes, are combined nicely into the story, which has also heartbreaking moments, such as the scene when Will's mother dies in his hands.

The story involves life in a world where life has become the standard currency for all things worthy of being purchased. Thus if one wants to buy something, he or she can trade their time life for it. Thus Time becomes the coin of the realm. Thus, Time becomes money. What's further unusual is the cast for this incredible bit of entertainment. Already recognized as an established singer, Justin Timberlake now plays Will Salas with Amanda Seyfried playing his rich and mostly ambivalent girlfriend who's Romeo and Juliet relationship leaves their tire tracks all over the screen. There is intense drama and incredible excitement, enough to create memories which will certainly generate requests for a sequel or a TV series.

Nothing is priced according to how much it costs to manufacture, but why? Because manufacturing costs have plummeted in the past few decades but pay rates have stayed the same, while retail prices have gone up? There is no such thing as the Free Market anymore, prices are set according to the country or District you live in.

","A lot has been said about this movie, the most common critique is : great concept and premise, poor execution. In some level, I can understand this critique, but I think this movie suffers from a concept that´s too good for it´s own good, if that makes any sense. Yes, the concept it´s better than the execution, but that doesn't make the execution poor in anyway. Justin Timberlake, it´s competent enough, as is Amanda Seyfried and Cillian Murphy. A ground breaking movie, none the less.Super original concept with a competent execution ."

","Andrew Niccol obviously plays with Marxist ideas. What a nice example of how the profit-hungry Hollywood machinery ones more proves its dynamic flexibility by fulfilling the current demand for critical thoughts on our capitalist system.<br/><br/>Bearing in mind that In Time is a sci-fi, one should not be overcritical with small discrepancies, such as Amanda Seyfried always running with high heels. Comparing time with money, however, is not only a creative approach, in combination with surprisingly good (or at least acceptable good) actors and nice pictures this movie is definitely worth watching it."

","Its the year 2161 and genetic alteration has allowed humans to stop aging after their 25th birthday thereby making it possible for them to live forever. But due to concerns of overpopulation, the system is tweaked so that money is replaced by 'living time' as the standard currency and people must acquire more time through labor and commercial means after turning 25 years of age, or die within a year. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is a 28-year-old man who lives with his 50-year old mother, Rachel (Olivia Wilde) in the ghettos and works in the factory. He encounters a 105-year-old Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), who has more than a century on his clock and is attacked by Fortis (Alex Pettyfer), the 75-year old mobster boss of a gang called the 'Minutemen', who are infamous for stealing other people's time by force. Will helps Hamilton escape the confrontation. Hamilton tells Will that there's enough time for everyone, but it is being stockpiled for the rich to use in becoming immortal. An upset Henry describes how he is tired of being alive. He commits suicide, but not before transferring all his time to Will. Raylond Leon (Cillian Murphy) and his Timekeepers investigate the death and believe Will killed Henry for his time. So now Will is on the run from the law. After the tragic and unjust death of his mother later that night, Will promises to bring down the system and exact revenge. He forages into the upper class New Greenwich and along his travails, he meets the beautiful 27-year-old Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) who is the daughter of the 90-year old millionaire, time-loaning businessman Phillipe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser). Will kidnaps Sylvia while escaping the Timekeepers.<br/><br/>If not for the extremely powerful performance by Cillian Murphy, this movie would have been less than mediocre. He brings a level of complexity and intensity which is much needed to the movie. A few scenes on his back story wouldn't have hurt. Alex shines in his role as the bad guy. This is the first time that I thought Timberlake was actually an able lead actor who could carry a movie all by himself. Seyfried was amazing as well. She was perfect in her transformation from a doe-eyed, young, bored rich girl to a fighter who is rebelling against the system and more so, against her father who suffocates her life. The movie isn't too subtle about raising the issue of the huge divide between the rich and the poor or the human bodies which lay about the ghettos in broad daylight while the people never seem to be interested in them and move on like its normal, as in our society. But it never came across as heavy handed. The movie could have done away with some of the cheesier dialogues and scenes though. The opening scene where we find out that Olivia Wilde's Rachel is actually the mother of Will amazed me. Her death was heartbreaking and Olivia played her role wonderfully. It was a bit disconcerting to see everyone being so young in a movie and yet playing the parts of mothers, fathers and family. Also the use of guest stars was done really well. Johnny Galecki had a forgettable outing, but Bomer really impressed in his short screen presence. <br/><br/>Andrew Niccol who has brought us really good movies such as Lord of War and Gattaca has let go of some of the intellect he had there. ""In Time"" is a slick action movie which is quite ingenious and has a terrific concept. Its like a Robin Hood movie, where time is the money. But it is almost undone by some of its fatal flaws in screenplay and writing. The lack of security in time banks and video cameras on the streets, Will infiltrating the security of Phillipe, the apparent lack of Timekeepers who are the law enforcers and many other improbable, jarring flaws. But it does make us look at life from a different perspective and raise interesting questions. Its not as good as it should have been given the rich narrative. Despite that it is entertaining and I enjoyed the movie. The way i see it, people will be highly opinionated about it. But in the end, I think it is worth a watch and definitely not a waste of your time.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I've been watching a lot of movies lately and this one is by far my favorite of 2011. I enjoyed how the currency was time and how it all makes a great story. I've never seen a movie so exciting this year that I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time. The sad part is when Will Salas's mum died, I knew it was coming but there was still that little bit of chance of life since Will was on standby with 116 years on him. It was laid out properly, unlike most movies I watch that just are to predictable. I absolutely love how the richest girl there hooked up with Will and how her kidnap became her adventure. I love Will's reactions to all the new things that he never got from when he was poor too. It was an amazing movie and I'm happy that I went to see it, can't wait to purchase it on DVD! THANK YOU for the wonderful experience! :)"
"jayp8510","1","33","60","1 November 2011"," A movie this bad should not remind its viewers that time is limited.
","OK, so I had high hopes for this movie. I saw the trailer and as a closet socialist loved the clear underlying theme of the rich having to keep many people down in order to maintain their power. So as I sat down in the theatre I was hoping that even if the movie wasn't up to scratch at least the underlying message would make it all worth while. <br/><br/>But from the very beginning there are so many flaws with this movie that I could not bring myself to enjoy it. The concept itself is so flawed that I could not bring myself to see past it. <br/><br/>The idea is that in the society of the future (which looks strangely like today but with slightly modified cars) there has been a breakthrough in medical science that stops people aging at 25. This is somehow achieved with the price tag that everybody must have a time display on their arm that counts ever down to zero. When you get there, you die. An interesting idea which brings up many good questions such as ""is time rationed or is it being hoarded by the authorities?"". Sadly these questions are lightly glossed over rather than any in depth exploration. <br/><br/>JT is a character in the ghetto and lives his life permanently ""broke"". This means he rarely has more than a day or two of life left. And here we come to the first major flaw of the concept. Everybody around JT is the same. They all have almost no life, ""in the bank"", all the time. And yet these people walk around casually drinking coffee (costs 4 minutes) and drinking in bars (also costs time) when they are just hours from death. Thinking about this for even a second it becomes clear that people this close to kicking it would be doing anything in their power to try and get more minutes. There would be no semblance of society as any body who was prepared to steal time off others would, and very quickly they would be the only people left alive. JT casually gives time to a girl on the street, a very nice gesture to be sure, however completely unrealistic given that at the time he had less than a day to live. Its all very well to give away money when you are broke but to give away time when you are about to die, that is a very different story. People this close to the edge all the time would act very differently from you and me, something this film does nothing to explore. <br/><br/>There are many many more flaws in this film but I won't go on about them. But the thing that finally tipped it for me was when they started trying to expand on the commentary of the capitalist system in the US by having outlets that lent time to the poor people in the ghetto for extortionate interest. These are the same people that seem to constantly have less than a day of life to their name. Once again this does not stand up to any real scrutiny. There is no way that a person who has allowed themselves to get down to less than a day of life is going to have any assets. If I was going to be dead in a day I am definitely selling my TV to try and get more time. I am certainly not likely to have anything that a loan shark considers capital enough to back a loan. <br/><br/>But enough of my whinging. In the end because this movie could have been so good I couldn't enjoy the aspects that where well done. I have focused on the story flaws because they are what annoyed me the most. I am prepared to look past JT's bad acting, I am prepared to look past the fact that the future looks just like the present but with cars that have slightly strange lights, I am prepared to look past all the poorly thought out and completely unnecessary action scenes and I am prepared to look past whatever was going on in that hand of poker. But in the end this movie is flawed from the very beginning when the society they create could never exist due to basic human nature. Very few people would ever allow themselves to be just days from death when so many opportunities exist around them to gain by taking advantage of others. This movie had so many interesting areas it could have explored but in the end it is just disappointing. <br/><br/>In the end if you are prepared to look past these things and you just want to see JT without his shirt drive round in a damn sexy old school E type jag and just generally be cool then you will probably enjoy this one. However if you are like me and have trouble ignoring the big holes in the basic concept and can't watch such an interesting idea be butchered then best to save the time this movie will take for something else."
"bdgill12","2","70","138","9 February 2012"," Simply Put: This Movie is STUPID
","At an unspecified time in the future, humans are genetically engineered to stop aging at 25. Everyone has a bright green counter embedded on their forearms which show how much time they have left to live. As a byproduct of this new system, time becomes currency; the rich have decades, even centuries to live, while the poor are lucky to have more than 24 hours on their arms at any one time. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) works at a factory and never has more time than hours in the day until a chance encounter with Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), a rich man whose life he saves from a vicious gangster (Alex Pettyfer). Hamilton, though, doesn't want to go on any longer and while Will sleeps, he transfers over his 116+ years of time. Before he can celebrate with his mother (Olivia Wilde), she runs out of time and dies, prompting Will to make it his mission in life to bring down the system. After being tracked to a mansion by Timekeeper Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy), Will makes a hostage of his host's daughter, Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried), and sets out on the run. The pair soon becomes a futuristic version of Bonnie and Clyde as they attempt to stay one step ahead and right the wrongs their society has imposed on the poor. <br/><br/>Concept films almost never pan out, the reason being that ideas are easy to come up with; putting those ideas into motion is a different story. Make no mistake, writer/director Andrew Niccol has a great concept to work with. But as is often the case with sci-fi films, the concept at the heart of In Time is approximately one hundred billion times better than the film itself. This movie could succeed as a sci-fi book or short story but the way in which it is executed on screen makes for an excruciatingly bad experience.<br/><br/>In Time misses the mark on virtually every front. To start, it is rife with poor acting. No, that's not enough. In truth, most of the performances within this movie are downright terrible. Niccol assembled a cast of attractive individuals who unfortunately have yet to figure out their way as actors, aside from Murphy, who looks like a man who knows he's boarded a sinking ship. Timberlake, Seyfried, and Wilde may end up being worthwhile performers at some point but at this stage of their respective careers, they need real guidance and good material, neither of which is provided by Niccol. (It should be noted that I did not include Pettyfer in that list because while the others show at least some promise, Pettyfer does not. He is genuinely talentless.) In the end, though, the numerous sleepwalking portrayals and elementary-level dialogue don't come close to measuring up to the train wreck that is this movie's plot.<br/><br/>To list the holes within the plot would be to craft a short novel. Absolutely nothing about In Time works the way it is supposed to. The film simply doesn't make a bit of sense on any level whatsoever. I'd love to know how it got green lit in the first place or how it made it past the test screening phase. It seems that no one anywhere in the chain of command ever asked some rudimentary questions about why this or that happens. Add to these crater-sized holes a staggering number of side plots that serve no purpose and receive no payoff. The most interesting character within the entire mess of a film is Timekeeper Leon and yet his development never enters into the equation. <br/><br/>Really what I'm saying in this review boils down to this: In Time is stupid. (I almost just wrote that sentence as my review but I felt that wouldn't be received too well.) It is riddled with head-scratching plot holes, anemic dialogue, and cringe-inducing acting and worst of all it is a waste of an interesting and potentially dynamic concept which, as a sci-fi nerd, makes me furious. Stupid. It's just stupid. <br/><br/>Please check out my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com"

","I think this film's rating is too low. This movie not only presents a plausible nightmarish idea for what life might become in the future, but also provides a thought-provoking critique of the present. We already sell our precious time, of which we have an only limited amount, for money. It is already true that some people's time is worth many times more than the time of others, and that many poor people in America spend their lives working and running around, with almost no time left over for themselves, their family, and what they actually *want* to do in their lives. It is true, also, I think, that people now have much less free time than they did in past centuries - ironically despite all the new technology that was supposed to have given us more free time. It is likely that in the future there will be even less free time left, and that if healthcare continues to be in private hands, it will really be a matter or life or death. I can forgive this film the car chases and the guns (which, I agree, are not needed and boring, and could have been taken out), but I think that the dialogue was interesting, and the characters were not one-dimensional. For all this, I think this film makes a lasting impression and will even give you nightmares."

","I saw a trailer of the movie some time ago, and I waited it since. I found the whole ""time"" idea interesting and philosophical, simple and yet so innovative. So I went to see this movie with very high expectations. But all that changed after watching the first ten minutes of the movie. My fist disillusion was the acting, which was poor to say the least. No one gave me the impression that they really care about the time they have, the actors were rather like the characters of a computer game. There was no attraction between the two main characters and the director tried to save the most dramatic scenes by choosing large angles rather than focusing on people. But maybe all that was because of the poor script. I don't understand how can you fail starting with such a good idea, but Andrew Niccol did. He tried very hard to make the life of his characters miserable and they concentrated so much on how to survive one more day that the denouement seemed random. Maybe it should have remained just a trailer. After all, Justin needs just four minutes to save the world..."
"naufalprananda","7","6","8","15 May 2019"," ORIGINAL
","Starting from the opening where the movie explains the world that we will witness, which is the world where time is truly money where human aging is programmed to stop at the age of 25 years. In each person's hand there is a time indicator that they have. In this film time is used as a medium of exchange similar to money in our world. The more often they use their time to buy something, the less time we have which will led to dying.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie was so phenomenal and very original to watch so the concept of the story delivered was still embedded in my mind even after more than 5 years the film was first aired. But starting from the conflict part until the resolution part of the conflict, in my opinion this movie failed on conveying the story well, where the conflict and motivation of the protagonist to resolve the conflict is not conveyed in depth so it is very unfortunate.<br/><br/>But still this movie provides an experience that is worth the time we spend watching it. There is the sad part, angry part, happy part, all emotions exist in this movie so this movie provides a satisfying experience. Also the moral of this story can be implemented in the real world. Where we are made aware of how precious the time really is."

","I don't believe this film earned as much credit as it should have done. The 6.6 rating 'In Time' received definitely does not depict the unique ideas and innovative aspects that this film portrays. When I first heard of this film I was put off by it's rating and reviews, but after sitting down and watching it, I think it is one of the best films I have seen in a while. Andrew Niccol's futuristic view of life and the comparison between living in the ghetto and the city emphasises the severity and the nature of each individual as a categorised human being. I was skeptical at first about Justin Timberlake and his presence in the film but surprisingly his professional performance intrigued me to keep watching and write this review. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I highly recommend it to any agnostics who don't know the rating is misleading. Happy Filming!"

","I thought it was going to be another singer-turned-actor star vehicle, with girls in the audience drooling over Justin and the pretty-but-bland Amanda Seyfried included to persuade the boyfriends to accompany them to the cinema.<br/><br/>I humbly admit that I was completely wrong on every score.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake was awesome. Whereas most singers-turned-actors bring their star persona to the screen (Beyonce will always be Beyonce, no matter what role she's cast in), he looked like he was an actor, period, up there with any of the contemporary Hollywood A-listers. I could easily see him taking roles from Jake Gyllenhaal, Tobey Maguire or Ryan Gosling, maybe even Leonardo Di Caprio. There's a surprising grittiness about him, along with a real sensitivity to the needs of the role - he inhabits the character in a way that honestly blew me away.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried's previous work in Mean Girls, Mamma Mia and Dear John didn't exactly endear me to her either, but far from being just pointless eye-candy, she totally held her own in the role.<br/><br/>As regards the movie, it's an extremely interesting premise, well-considered and well-executed. While it's ostensibly a sci-fi, it plays more like an alternative present with realistic social themes - think V for Vendetta, Gattaca or Equilibrium instead of I, Robot, Total Recall or Minority Report. But it is equally an action movie, with car chases, shoot-outs and plenty of bad guys chasing the good. The movie also has some surprisingly tender scenes - it definitely has heart - and a little bit of romance thrown in along the way.<br/><br/>In short, don't ever judge a book by its cover. In Time surprised me by being actually very good and, unlike many other action/sci-fi movies, it sticks in your mind long after you've finished watching it."

It keeps a decent tension throughout while offering slightly more than an above par 'B'+ movie, yet with added twists that pervade the film. Damned original in how it approaches the subject of universal exchange and certainly well executed from a cinematic perspective. Much as I don't care for Justin Timberlake, he always impresses me in film. It's truly an emotional ride in many ways by way of an improbable future, 'Logan's Run' being an obvious inspiration to this visage. I do recommend it for its ease of delivery and entertainment, as well as the current, socio-reality aspects alone."

","In Time comes from writer/director Andrew Niccol and tells the tale of one Will Salas (Justin Timberlake), a man who is wrongfully accused of murdering a wealthy man. This isn't murder by our standards but the running off with of a borrowed time in a future where everyone stops aging at 25 but must work to earn more minutes.<br/><br/>Will travels across ""time zones"" that serve as tollbooths separating the poor from the rich. Can't have any low on time mingling with the immortals. In the affluent city of New Greenwich, Will encounters debutante Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried). In a confrontation with a Timekeeper (Cillian Murphy), i.e. cop, Will runs off with Sylvia and sets out on a quest to make those in power pay.<br/><br/>There are better movies in this genre, and one of them is written and directed by the same guy who made this movie. In fact, In Time is a crappy knock-off of Gattaca. Don't believe me? In Gattaca a man goes up against a class system that exploits genetics. He acquires a redhead, is chased by a cop, and drives a vintage auto. The differences are that Gattaca doesn't halfheartedly attempt to be an action movie, Gattaca has a quality lead actor, and Gattaca makes sense.<br/><br/>Unfortunate for everyone who sees In Time, a host of problems prevent it from being even a shell of what could have been. Timberlake is simply not a movie star. He isn't believable and his thin character is not likable. Being in a dystopian future everyone is a stoic incapable of expression, naturally. In Time is played so stiff with seriousness that the lack of humanity prevents and audience from caring a lick for anyone.<br/><br/>The actions scenes are sparse and nothing inventive. There's a car chase, albeit a brief one. There are guns, which many characters seem to be capable of using, but not with action movie gravitas.<br/><br/>The technology hindering so many is not explained in a satisfying manner. Using time as currency presents a variety of problems upon investigation. Money is already applied to time in our world so the metaphor is too blunt. Who mandated these laws, witnessing a birth, or attempting a birth outside of the system are never mentioned.<br/><br/>The problem imposed on the characters of In Time is all that is ever talked about. You'd think/hope that if you knew you could live forever that you wouldn't spend all your life talking about living forever. Instead of addressing the curse of being born with LCDs on their forearms and trying to do the logical thing like preventing newborns from suffering the same fate—the typical but tried and true savior of humanity narrative—they run off and loot banks for more time. When characters care so little about the movie, I know I shouldn't."

","It is either the future or some alternate reality. The population is encoded with a clock which is geared to your life functions. When you reach 25, the clock starts ticking away your last year. The currency on which everything operates is time to be added to, or taken away from, your clock / life expectancy. You can earn time, spend time, trade time, win time, or steal time (and all these things happen). Will Salas (Justin Timberlake), who lives in an impoverished time zone, is give over 100 years by jaded rich man Henry Hamilton who has wearied of life. Will makes his way into the affluent time zone where he wins more time gambling with time mega-tycoon Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser). However, by-the-book time policeman Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) believes that Will murdered Hamilton, so he confiscates Will's time, and Will kidnaps Weis' daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) and goes on the run.<br/><br/>The idea of a dystopian society where an early death is pre-determined has been done before, of course, notably in Logan's Run, but I can't recall a story where life expectancy is the unit of currency, and the rich live longer at the expense of the poor dying early. It is a nice - and original - notion, and the surface of this society is well realised.<br/><br/>The trouble is that, having come up with a terrific idea, writer/director (also writer of Gattaca and The Trueman Show) doesn't seem to have much idea of what to do with it. We spend a lot of time seeing the privation in the poor sector and the privilege in the rich sector, and the crooks who steal time, and how you pay tolls to cross time zones (it costs you a month to cross out of the poorest zone, a year to cross into the richest zone), but what we are left with is ultimately a chase movie and, what's more, a chase movie which doesn't have any real resolution. I enjoyed it, but I felt that there was a great deal of potential in the premise which wasn't touched.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Amanda Seyfried wins two prizes, one for the Bulgiest Bra Scene (sadly, the time police raid interrupted a promising game of strip poker), and the other for the Longest Sprint In Inappropriate Clothing Scene (about 1,000 metres, flat out, in a miniskirt barely bigger than a wide belt, and high heels which were almost as tall as she was)."
"grahamvandyke","7","4","5","2 October 2018"," Writing the story =/= good direction
","I have been a fan of Andrew Niccol's writing since watching The Truman Show. I had watched Gattaca previously as a kid, but it was strangely made to the point where it didn't feel like a classic. The Truman Show is an absolute classic movie, amongst the top 250 here on IMDB. The difference? Niccol wrote both story/scripts, but only directed the more poorly executed film. It seems he is his own worst enemy: taking amazing ideas and scripts and directing them into mediocrity.<br/><br/>In Time is an example of a great concept turned mediocre movie. It definitely has a few high points, but they're marred by an overwhelming sense of ""this scene could have been punched up a few notches"" throughout the entire film. The same thing could be said about the delivery of lines by the actors. This sci-fi, dystopian future film lacked exactly what makes a film sci-fi and futuristic. All the locations are bland and are lacking in any real uniqueness. Many lines and characters feel completely out of place, due to the nature of the age (or LOOK of age) that the actors had to be. Taking the blandest of existing cars and giving them a ""futuristic"" sound doesn't constitute conveying a future setting. These are just many of the small things that add up to make the movie not hit it's mark.<br/><br/>The reason I gave this a 7 instead of a 5-6, is because there is one scene in particular that was perfectly executed, heavily emotional and brought me to tears. It made me think had the rest of the movie been constructed with such care, this could have been an amazing sci-fi movie. <br/><br/>7/10. Worth a watch at least once, but don't hold your breath for a mind-blowing movie."

","Great movie. Hitchcock/Blade Runner -- yet, so, so real. I was surprised how well Timberlake could act. Very likable.

Some of her shallow comments seemed appropro for her character -- yet, deep without trying. His responses, too. Delivered also within the context of his character and situation without it appearing as acting, i.e: ""Unfucking believable!"" was so dead on. Pay no mind to the reviews. Too bad we can't stop their clocks. With teaspoon depth, never venturing from Van Nuys, out-of-touch Hollywood and incapable of thought, the movie was lost on them. Take it from me. Great film."
"chaboyap","9","5","7","19 July 2012"," Provided hours of thinking after watching, Great movie.
","***Partial spoiler alert!***<br/><br/>Well it seems this movie got a lot more negative then I would have anticipated. It shows rich people (having goggles of time) and the poor people who scrape every second to make ends meet and face possible death daily. Getting sick to them could very well be a death sentence and that goes for injuring oneself as well. I believe this currency and economy are meant to equate back to real world politics and movie enthusiast side with their personal political alliances instead of I believe giving this movie an objective and unbiased review. So I will try and give an opposite view of the gloom and doom reviews.<br/><br/>*** Rest of this review is spoilers***<br/><br/>Basically this movie turns the metaphor time is money into something everybody can understand. In this world it shows plainly, what greed can setup and cause.<br/><br/>I found the characters not being overly emotional good. For me this made the movie more real as it goes with how you would feel if you were never going to die and took no risks. Also if you were at risk for death everyday, your emotions would harden up and you wouldn't emote because you would bring undue attention to yourself. This is a culture at least 125 years into the future. I don't expect emotions from Japanese actors.<br/><br/>I believe enough was explained in the amount of time the movie took. It is lacking in technology explained, back story, more fleshed out actors, etc. All I can say was this movie was long enough as it is, you really want it longer? Plus all the things they didn't tell you aren't ""Plot holes"". Sure there are holes but you're suppose to fill them with your own imagination, just as you read a book, I found the movie thought provoking for this very reason.<br/><br/>The script wasn't perfect but the concept is excellent and the story decent. Main plot being a woman and man team up to bring down a immoral system to make way for a new world system, which the rich find ultimately futile. Subplots like the time cop, where he knew what he was doing was wrong on some level but he had to keep doing it. If he were to stop people would stop working and society would fall apart, many people would die. As is likely to happen at the end of the movie. They didn't claim everything was happy go luck for the next generation or two, they just showed the ""redistribution of wealth occurring"", which was what the whole steal from the bank premise was about anyways, granted they could have used a more thought out literary device.<br/><br/>Yes there are some real plot holes, mostly surrounding the technology and the strange and unlikely ways it is implemented. Like rich people not shown using any communication devices, however this can be counter by saying it was ""outlawed"" for some unknown philosophical reason. Having them would cause the ghetto to uprise maybe. Maybe social communication was outlawed due to its disruption of the order, who knows? <br/><br/>The point is it's the future you should have suspended your critical thinking about technology, sure its nice when the technology seems possible and likely to happen, but that doesn't mean that's the way it should have been.<br/><br/>I will be watching this movie again and would recommend it to everyone I know."

"Christian_Dimartino","8","5","7","11 March 2012"," It's not Inception, and may not have been trying to be, but it's still fun.
","To me, it feels like a lot of films have been following in Inception's footsteps. A lot of films are trying to have unique story plots with brilliant complexities. And they've worked. The Adjustment Bureau wasn't really one, but it had a sort of unique-ness to it that worked, and so did Source Code.<br/><br/>In Time, from director Andrew Niccol(Lord of War) is the latest attempt. And it probably has the most original of the premises, excluding Inception, but yet it's also the most unrealistic.<br/><br/>The films takes place in a world where you only live up to 25 years old, and after that you have to buy time in order to stay alive. But you remain looking 25 forever(Joan Rivers and Dolly Parton could've done with this world). Will Salas(Justin Timberlake) struggles to buy time, but when he is bestowed with over a hundred years of time, his world is turned upside down.<br/><br/>After the death of a loved one and the death of a stranger, it comes to Will's attention that some people don't actually need all this time, and that everyone should get a fair share instead of those who have too much. So soon Will and a girl(Amanda Seyfreid), who's father is the richest man in the world, become Robin Hoods and try to escape the law, lead by an Elliot Ness-y character played by Cillian Murphey.<br/><br/>The film has a neat, cheeky if not ridiculous premise that never really runs out of steam. It's fun, but I feel that the ending could have been a little better. I like the weirdness of it. I like how Olivia Wilde plays a 50 year old, and Justin Timberlake's mom. What a good looking family that must of been. Who was the father? George Clooney? Sister? Megan Fox?<br/><br/>Is it Inception? No, and I don't think anything will ever be,excluding The Dark Knight and P.T. Anderson's Magnolia. Unless that film is directed by Christopher Nolan. But it's good while it lasts, so see it.<br/><br/>B+"
"rebecca-ry","7","5","7","3 March 2012"," Not a waste of time.
","'In Time' is one of those films that you enjoy watching but can't help but think there's something missing.<br/><br/>The acting is generally good, Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried are okay but it's the other actors like Cillian Murphy, Olivia Wilde and Alex Pettyfer who strengthen the film as a whole. <br/><br/>The plot is very interesting; a world where the currency is time itself. Films set in a dystopian world are common but the intricate details of this film are what make it unique. The plot is discussed well in the film, there are no points where you find yourself asking questions about the reasoning behind the fact that time is used as currency, scenes where people discuss their lifestyle as being like 'capitalist Darwinism' are really interesting and give the story a better setting. Some parts of the story could have been developed further, however. Johnny Galecki's character should have been given more screen-time. When his off-screen death is announced you feel bad but they could have done a lot better with that aspect of the story. <br/><br/>The dialogue was the main fault, there were some scenes particularly involving Timberlake and Seyfried where conversations were so basic and lifeless that it just didn't seem natural at all. Even some scenes with other characters involved discussions which lacked something, it was too obvious the conversations were scripted and not natural.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this film. It's thoroughly entertaining and there are no obvious flaws aside from some scenes where the dialogue is weak. It's a film worthy of watching, however."
"MrAlfa","8","5","7","23 February 2012"," Topical, enjoyable, suggestive movie.
","It's possible that the film was not developed to the fullest. It is still a good movie anyway, enjoyable and interesting. Probably is not even easy to deepen all the aspects suggested by the theme. I find it very topical. The scenes in the workplace are certainly suggestive. From the time when the robberies start and the unlikely transformation of the princess into bandit, maybe the movie loses something, going in the direction of an action movie. But probably this was the original intention. There are however many interesting points and some key messages, which allow you to think and that tickle the imagination. This leads to further personal developments, which is at the end a feature in an good film, in my opinion. I think that the film may end with the phrase ""you can do anything in 24 hours"", since what follows is quite unnecessary and most suitable, in fact, to how the film was developed at the end. But the message stays clear, as it remains a good movie. It is not possible to give less than seven stars to the movie, beyond the development I give eight for the concept and to counteract the undeserved low ratings."
"SteveMierzejewski","8","5","7","23 February 2012"," In time is worth the time
","I suppose there are hard core science fiction fans who may pick apart some of the premises in this movie, I don't think it would be hard to do so, but, just accept the idea and enjoy the ride. The concept is interesting enough and the story is compelling enough to keep most of us entertained.<br/><br/>I have been quite critical of Justin Timberlake in some of his recent performances, but he is credible here, perhaps just one step away from a serious lead role. In fact, most of the acting is up to par. The movie is true to itself in that it is guided by the concept and not by what they think the audience expects. This is made clear in a scene in a hotel room where I expected the obligatory sexual encounter, despite the fact that the two lead characters were in danger all the time. However, adherence to realism triumphed over audience expectations and, perhaps, even higher ratings. The director deserves some credit for this.<br/><br/>In short, this is a film worth watching that will give you much to think about in the process."
"kdorsey321","8","5","7","11 February 2012"," Nice Concept
","Checked out the movie ""In Time,"" starring Justin Timberlake, Cillian Murphy, and Amanda Seyfried. This movie is about time actually being the currency of a world instead of money being the currency of a world. Two people are doing whatever they can to save time and save as many people as possible from the dominating wealthy people who want all the time in the for themselves. A very interesting concept to me! <br/><br/>I really love the concept of this film. I feel like it was simply nice to see something other than money be the motivational key to why someone is rich or poor. This movie is a solid action thriller. The fight scenes are done pretty well. That is always nice to witness in a action movie. There's just something about this movie that I really like, but I can't quite put my finger on it. I thought Justin Timberlake did a very good acting job. I can tell that he'll be in more films and I look forward to that. I also feel like this movie hit all cylinders. I felt like there was nothing missing. <br/><br/>I give this film a 8 out of 10. This was a solid film that I think everyone should give a try at least once. I plan on getting it on DVD one day, but its definitely worth a Redbox or Netflix's purchase!"
"robbrock3","7","5","7","28 January 2012"," Well-explored idea, solid movie.
","Due to a bit of a dearth of sci-fi releases around the release of 'In Time', I think it will unfortunately be labelled a sci-fi flick that never held down enough sci-fi to grip fans of the genre. It's in the future, yes, and it creates a new concept for humanity, but I would only put it on the sci-fi shelf along with Equilibrium, Minority Report etc. A near-future, ""wouldn't it be terrible if..."" kind of a setting.<br/><br/>The main draw of the movie is its concept. That of perfected capitalism, where money has been done away with and instead people are faced with the choice of living long but frugal lives, or living to the full and dying very young.<br/><br/>The result is plausibly shown as somewhere in the middle, and whilst the true capitalist fat cats at the top are basically immortal, the majority get by from day to day, month to month, as we do anyway in our time.<br/><br/>What I like about In Time is how it sticks to its concept and really explores it. I thought I had grasped the idea early on and thought 'ok got it, now get on with the movie' - but what it does is constantly throw up new ways in which this system might affect your life, and (hopefully) in ways you hadn't thought of.<br/><br/>Timberlake has proved himself an actor in this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised by that. Seyfried is also very likable in her role and plays the part well. Cillian Murphy is again excellent, and I would love for a director to hire him in a really challenging lead part so we can see his true potential.<br/><br/>Overall, In Time covers a lot of bases, different audiences will take different things from it. Some futuristic shenanigans, some relieving fast-paced action scenes, some tense set-ups and a good idea that runs through all of it. The plot might not grip you for the duration but at least it never goes totally AWOL.<br/><br/>7/10 and well worth a watch."
"galaxtri","9","5","7","25 January 2012"," Excellent movie, concept too simplistic
","The concept of the underlying idea is excellent. I am not very picky, there may be some minor flaws in the execution. Like woman running very fast with high heel shoes, or people swimming in deep water without never touching the ocean in their life. I can cope with these little issues with no problem. As long as there is no major absurdity that contradict the main theme.<br/><br/>What I find as a flaw, and this is just my personal opinion, is that the concept is too simplistic. I find unrealistic that the ""poor"" people in such a society could be that law abiding. These ""poor"" people are more civilized than most of the richest men on Earth today! With real human behaviour, a country like that will actually turn into chaos in no time."
"seamancup","1","18","35","29 January 2012"," Truly makes me despair
","Where to begin? Every aspect of this movie was so bad I don't even know how to. I must try ny saying that I sincerely despair of the world after finding out this has a 6.6 out of 10 rating here on IMDb. This is way worse than global warming, overpopulation, rising garbage mountains, ozone holes or any other reasons one might despair for the human race. This means the great majority of people, assuming the average moviegoers are a fair representative of people in general, are utterly and plainly stupid and with no means whatsoever to distinguish quality from pure trash.<br/><br/>Now I always try to be as just as possible when reviewing a movie and in most cases I think I can see it for what it is, who it targets and see its qualities even though I don't necessarily belong to its target audience. Here however I can't see how any adult could possibly find this anything other than offensively bad. The directing and editing is awful, the shift between scenes is awkward and seems more amateurish than anything I've ever seen in this budget scale. The plot is really stupid and has more holes than I can count. I would have given a few examples but then I'd have to mark this review as containing spoilers which would shun people who haven't seen it from reading the review and spoil the opportunity to deter them from doing so. The dialogue is absolutely laughable as well but the worst part of it all is the horrible acting. It's really like watching amateur theatre. Especially ludicrous is the portrayal of the wealthy Mr. Weis: A powerful and incredibly wealthy old man, albeit inside a 25 year old body, who still comes across as insecure and awkward in his mannerisms as a timid teenager. Surely this has got to be the worst casting mistake ever?"
"michael-colan","5","6","9","20 August 2012"," Such an Intriguing Idea Gone (for the most part) to Waste
","What an intriguing idea. This is the type of SC-FI that I usually tend to like over just another film with space battles. SC-Fi films that make you think and make parallels to real life. Once I saw the previews to this film I thought this film would be something special. Not only did the film have an intriguing idea but only draw from mythic arc types like Robin Hood and numinous of great themes but the film falls short on such a great idea with a failure to really understand what type of scope there really could have been with this story along with a less than stellar cast the film is entertaining but only a footnote of what it could have been.<br/><br/>The film's concept is a future where humans have been genetically engineered to stop ageing after age 25 but after that you have only one more year to live. Time is the currency of the time, no such thing as money. You work to get more time but it is a bleak future where the rich have all the power and all the time. Meanwhile the rest live in the ghettos where almost everyone has only has 24 hours to live and they live by the clock. <br/><br/>While the story opens with a man in the ghetto named Will Salas is given the gift of time from a man who doesn't care to live anymore from the rich-infected lifestyle. Will is then accused of murder and on the run from a police force known as ""timekeepers."" With a rich man's daughter at his side he hopes to effect change in the system. <br/><br/>The film's story should have been one of the best of the decade. I mean the idea is so good it feels awful that it was a bit wasted. The film story does a good job on laying out the ground rules of the universe they live in. This was great about it a short speech in the beginning and then you are trusted into the life of Will Salas. You get a pretty good picture on how he lives just from the first 10 min. You learn a lot about the world and the film starts to set up some story lines but that's where a lot of the film's really strong points end.<br/><br/>The film starts up several story lines and just never delivers. Some just seems abandoned by the end and others that kept building and never got the final ""crescendo"" or pay off. It seems like not only that with these great ideas and scary parallels to real life class warfare the idea could have been bigger than it ended up being, It hard to say exactly what it was missing. I feel like the film could have been even bigger with its ideas and themes. It fact with this idea the film could have been a great long SC-FI epic. Maybe my expectations for the film was just too high but I feel I was let down by story because of the potential it had and that's just aside from the plot holes and incompletion of certain story lines. There were also some scenes I honestly thought could make for some classic scenes like when we finally get to see what ""a fighter"" is and how they fight. The scene was too short and was a number of others felt a little short in fact the film overall felt a bit short without a real good conclusion.<br/><br/>The film seems to leave the possibility of having a strong story oriented film instead opting for an action fueled story. The film has no shortage of action sequences and that is properly the saving grace to the film. It does keep the viewer entertained and it does keep the story moving. Without this factor the film would unsalvageable. There are some good car crashes and also on foot chases. A good number of gun battles to be boot. Even with the PG-13 rating it is able to have some real action and violence. However I think I could have done without a couple of these so we would have a stronger story. <br/><br/>The acting is also questionable. I would have made different choices. Justin Timberlake stars a Will Salas and Justin is good here for the action sequences but he isn't the greatest with the dramatic scenes. This is a shame because I thought he would because I really liked his performance in The Social Network (2010). Amanda Seyfried's performance falls flat in my eyes even though she had some nice chemistry with Justin. Cillian Murphy is amazing as the timekeeper Raymond Leon. This is an outstanding performance from Murphy as he usually delivers. The rest are decent but nothing special. Shyloh Oostwald is okay; I liked Johnny Galecki as Borel. I didn't love Olivia Wilde even if she didn't have a big part. Alex Pettyfer is finally getting better roles since his role in Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker (2006). He is good here as Fortis the ""minutemen"" which a ""gangster of the future."" <br/><br/>Andrew Niccol is a great talent behind the camera and I don't doubt that either. His look to the film to perfect for this film. Also his of practical effects over CGI heavy effects is defiantly noticeable in a good way. The music by Craig Armstrong fits perfectly.<br/><br/>Really with this type of idea it really could have been something special. The acting hurt the film a bit with the exception of Cillian Murphy. But with a talented director behind the camera and talent behind the scenes also with some really entertaining action sequences makes the film watchable but you can't help but feel it could be so much more. If there was a film that I would like to see remade, this would be it.<br/><br/>Final Score<br/><br/>5.5/10"
"the_one-756-914381","9","6","9","24 March 2012"," Surprisingly new
","This is a movie surprisingly refreshing. Not only the idea (some reviewers pointed out that that's not quite new; regardless, it's certainly new in a movie, and here works superbly), but the movie itself. Without aiming too high (still much more than average though), this movie really works - at all levels.<br/><br/>The last one to make you think (as to new ideas into play) in the last 15 years or so (Inception) failed - was too full of itself (see my review on that one). This one on the other hand, works differently (more than average on everything: acting, camera work, music etc. and especially the story), and guess what? It works. You won't see any cool FX here, but what you'll see is far from cheap too.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's also low on violence, swearing, and sexual content (without which, apparently, you can't make a movie nowadays) - which means your entire family can enjoy it - as long as they had already jump-started their brains.<br/><br/>So don't expect the cool FX from Matrix, but not the diluted and full of holes story from Equilibrium either. Rounded, surprising little gem, worth seeing more than twice. I had already planned to buy the DVD - and haven't bought one in several years, which should tell you something. These are not the days you build up a collection. Unfortunately, these are the days you rent your 2 hrs. entertainment, then immediately forget it (the dose to make you run another day - how cheap we have become).<br/><br/>Its real value is at a solid 8, but I give it a full 9 only for the (courage and) novelty of being novel.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

It is equally appropriate here;-<br/><br/>""I met a traveler from an antique land/ Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone/ Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,/ Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,/ And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,/ Tell that its sculptor well those passions read/ Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,/ The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;/ And on the pedestal these words appear:/ ""My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:/ Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!""/ Nothing beside remains.

","In Time is a brilliant movie set in the not so distant future using a Time counter as a life clock after hitting the age of 25 your time clock starts and you from that moment on stop aging and really only die when your time clock runs out.<br/><br/>It's a brilliant movie supported by a fair stella cast, Justin continues his brilliance with In Time to follow on from Friends with Benefits and Social Network.

","It's an interesting concept that deserved a much better story, better actors and several other things. I clocked out rather rapidly when things that didn't make sense started happening. Combine that with stupid behaviour from the protagonists, and my suspension of disbelief just got waylaid. I kept thinking to myself how and why? Just a few examples. How does he have that amount of time left (more than once)? How is it so easy to steal from a loaning bank? Why is there no security? Why does the fugitive stay at his own address when he knows the police knows his identity? I could go on.<br/><br/>I found the acting rather poor especially from Amanda Seyfried (the ravishing redhead daughter), with a couple of exceptions (the ""older"" guys being two). The suspense was rather pitiful and the few action scenes were unexciting. That forearm ""wrestling"" with the time codes was just ridiculous. As for special effects, besides the glowing green digital clocks under people's forearms and a few cheap-looking modified vehicles, there wasn't much else. The thinly-veiled social commentary on the woes of capitalism was badly done and I'm one who usually enjoys such criticism. Emotional moments fell flat and artificial. The dialogue too often seemed awkward or cliché even when not delivered poorly. This movie was weak on all fronts (except lighting because I'm nice). It's a badly implemented sci-fi concept, lame thriller and boring action movie that felt longer than its actual running time.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 out of 10 (Poor)"

"bob the moo","Null","11","21","15 April 2012"," Standard chase thriller that isn't that well done and doesn't seem interested in its own message
","In Time starts strong. The idea here is that time literally is money as it has become the currency of the world – those that make time (the rich) can in theory life forever as they have loads of time on their hands (literally as the clocks are embedded on their wrists); by contrast the poor life day to day, working to keep time on their clocks for as long as possible. As an allegory for money and the contrast between rich and poor in our world, it is a clever one and it offered the potential for quite a smart piece of sci-fi – I was hoping that it could keep the ""ideas"" coming while delivering an enjoyable thriller as well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it doesn't really do either of these things and while i hoped it would get cleverer and more engaging as it played out, the reality was that it did the opposite – getting sillier, less thrilling and less interested in the ideas it had originally. Early on we have plenty of good things – the death of a character is impacting and little things like rich people doing nothing at speed etc are clever observations within this world. However, once Will goes on the run with Slyvia the film takes a dramatic downward turn. Funnily enough this section of the film also marks a low point for special effects too as it features a car crash which is done with hilariously bad model-work. At this point the film becomes some sort of Bonnie & Clyde thriller and it suddenly loses interest in many of the things it had been doing well up till that point.<br/><br/>In terms of the thriller content, this means that the air of desperation and the air of vulnerability that was in the film early on just evaporates and suddenly Will is an action hero who cannot be stopped. It is a shame because without this atmosphere a lot of the action is exposed for what it is – rather silly and basic. Harder for me to take though is that the film loses interest in the message it is delivering – what we have here is basically a film rallying against the world of capitalism and stating that it is only fair that those with the time share it fairly among those without rather than hoarding more than they need. A fairly brave message but by the time we get to that at the end, the film doesn't seem to be convincing even itself and it seems more interested in getting cool shots of our characters with guns and creating false dramatic moments of running and clock-beating. It is a real shame that the intelligence went out of it – and the lack of strong thrills and ideas means that you end up thinking about other things in this world and picking holes in them.<br/><br/>The cast list is young but decent. Timberlake gave me pause but he is actually pretty good and it is a shame that the second half of the film gives him nothing to do. Seyfield is oddly pretty but her character makes less than no sense and she cannot sell it to herself far less us. Murphy is always watchable and his presence deserves more than he got – in particular his final scene in the film is poorly done. The supporting cast is an odd mix of TV faces that you'll recognise from things like House, Mad Men and White Collar – none of them bad, but like the main players, the material isn't there for them in most cases.<br/><br/>A good one-line idea of a film then. I was hoping it could be thrilling and smart but in the end it wasn't really either as it descends into a Bonnie & Clyde scenario that doesn't make much sense and doesn't play out convincingly. While it does this it also stops caring about the message it is rolling out – by the end it seems like the ideas in the script are just an inconvenience getting in the way of the simple thriller the film is trying to focus on. Distracting but disappointing."
"chris-williams-113-468296","3","7","12","22 September 2014"," A disappointment
","Given the pedigree of the director of this film (notably GATTACA which I'd rate as one of the best science fiction films ever made and criminally overlooked), I really expected more.<br/><br/>The production is very much in the same mould - the 'future' world is understated, in many ways a retro-styled present day bereft of any CGI or flashy special effects. That's in keeping with the high concept underpinnings of the film, which much like GATTACA is based on extrapolating the ramifications on human living of a development of medical science.<br/><br/>So far, so good and it certainly seems to hold promise initially. Unfortunately the subtlety of the earlier film is quickly lost as the plot leads not toward a considered analysis of social implications, but instead a heavy handed adventure thriller which succumbs to a misguided appeal to popularism (or perhaps its stars' vanity), by becoming a melodramatic action-flick.<br/><br/>I can't lay too much blame at the feet of Tiberlake, Murphy and the rest of the cast as the material really doesn't lend itself to credible performance from its cast.<br/><br/>I find myself left to ponder if this is one of those pieces of cinema which started out as something which would have been thoughtfully considered and delivered a genuine emotional resonance, that was then ruined by the desires of producers, actors or other influence to present something which might attract a greater box-office. In the end the effect was just to butcher something of potential into a dog's breakfast of an offering that satisfies as neither a piece of escapist entertainment, nor a work making serious points about serious issues."

The few points it makes are buried under absurd.<br/><br/>The acting fits what little there is of the script to go around.<br/><br/>If you like to watch over an hour of plot which is full of annoyances a third grader wouldn't include in a film - then its for you.<br/><br/>There is no typical consolation prize by intense car chases, sex or explosions to even try and substitute for the lack of everything (as they usually do).<br/><br/>And if you are a Timberlake fan, there are cheaper ways to look at him.

The conceit of being able to electronically transfer time to another person is neat, and neatly executed. I found it fairly easy to buy into. It's a gritty, snappy, sexy, well-written, well-acted science fiction film with social commentary that is not irrelevant to our modern world. Timberlake was great, as was Seyfried.

","I am not an obsessive fan when it comes to movies and I give each movie every chance and do not tend to feel the need to share my opinion on them. But this movie really pushed me to my limit and I feel I have to say something as it has a truly undeserved 6.6 rating when everything was so terrible.<br/><br/>The acting was dreadful, Justin Timberlake let himself down here big time his line delivery and reactions to certain events was just so bad it is hard to even know where to begin when criticising him. He was not alone though the whole cast was poor there was not a single decent performance in the whole film.<br/><br/>The script was so weak, I could write a better one and I failed GCSE English. Also the poker scene was truly awful, I know most people in the world do not know much about poker but surely if your going to put it into your movie you could at least learn a little bit about it. <br/><br/>First things first I will start with what happened after the hand, Will is congratulated like he just played very well and won because he was a better player, when in fact he played it shockingly. Almost all of the time was put into the pot before the river card was dealt. Will had only 9 high at this time and could only win if he hit a gut shot straight which meant there was 4 cards left in the pack that he could win the hand with. On top of that, Will says something to his opponent about knowing that he did not have a good hand, when the cards are turned over at the end he shows 3 queens, which at the time was the 3rd best possible hand there could have possibly been only losing to 89 and JT. I barely know much about poker myself but I have played a little and this scene was outrageous.<br/><br/>The special effects were as big a joke as the acting, just watch the car crash scene where they burst his tyres with a stinger and send him rolling down the hill. I have seen better in Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends. <br/><br/>What I feel was the main flaw was the story **** main spoiler coming here***** <br/><br/>When his mother dies as she ran out of time because the bus fare had doubled meaning she had to walk. I thought initially that was a good idea, them running desperately to each other her with seconds left and him with his new found fortune of 100 years. In my mind I thought 'oh no, now it's on!' They have killed his mother because nobody would even give her 1minute of their life to save her. <br/><br/>I could picture it, the ultimate revenge. He was going to take all the time in the world because they had taken his mother who was all he had. But alas, he hardly gave her a second thought for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>In fact there was some weird back story about his father between him and the police officer that was out to get him. I thought it got totally dull and boring from there on, in a way he was getting revenge on the system but there was no mention of his dead mother still lying on the street.<br/><br/>There are a million jokes about how time has been wasted watching this film that I wont ever get back so I wont bother."

It's a pretty complex storyline but the script enables you to get a hang of it rather quickly, and you get drawn into the story instantly. Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried are excellent together, they have a chemistry on screen that is electric. Amanda Seyfried is the wealthy girl who comes ""from time"", who is kidnapped by JT but then abandons her previous life to become a fugitive, her character is one of the best in the film, she is a tough lady, and Justin continues to get better and better.<br/><br/>Basically to me this movie seemed like a futuristic sci-fi version if Bonnie And Clyde, it's just as awesome as that and I definitely recommend that you go and see this film on the<br/><br/>big screen.

I was surprised by the performance of Justin Timberlake, and I was very pleased to see Amanda Seyfried in an action film, because she usually plays in drama or thriller films. It's a very good film with a very good point and it makes you wonder all the time: What will you do if you knew you have seconds to live? Is it fair that someone has more time than someone else? How will you feel if you knew how much time you have left? How big is the cruelty of men? Can we be more greedy than we already are?

"estebangonzalez10","7","6","11","10 November 2011"," Interesting premise, enjoyable film
","¨For a few immortals to live, many people must die. ¨ In Time is the  latest Andrew Niccol sci-fi futuristic flick where people are  genetically developed to grow until they're 25. People don't age more  than that, but the downside is that they are only guaranteed one more  year of life. Once they turn 25 a clock starts ticking on their arm  with a glowing neon light counting down the days. Time has also become  the new currency as people work and are paid with time, and they also  buy products with their time (bus ticket fares cost two dollars for  example). The premise is a very interesting one as we see rich people  living practically immortal lives as they continue to buy and buy more  time. They don't age so they can be over a hundred years old and still  look like a 25 year old. In one scene we are introduced to one of the  character's family and we see his mother, wife, and daughter all lined  up looking like they were all recent college graduate friends. On the  other hand it has become increasingly difficult for the poor to live  past 26 since the cost of life exceeds their earnings so the people in  the ghettos don't have much life expectancy. That is precisely how the  rich want things to balance out because according to them ¨for a few  immortals to live, many people must die.¨ Niccol, who also directed the  1997 sci-fi film Gattaca (a much stronger film than this one) and wrote  the screenplay for the critically acclaimed The Truman Show, perhaps  has made one of his weakest films, but it never fails to entertain  nevertheless with its engaging premise. Yes, there are many plot holes  and if you dig in too deep some things might not make sense, but  nonetheless I had a great time playing along with the premise and  receiving the clear social message Niccol's was trying to lay out.  Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) has been 25 for three years now managing  to survive in the ghetto at a day to day basis along with his mother  Rachel (played by the hot Olivia Wilde) who should be fifty, but looks  like his girlfriend. Will's life changes when he runs into Henry  Hamilton (Matt Bomer), a very wealthy man who apparently has arrived in  the wrong neighborhood. Will saves Henry from a group of time thieves  led by Fortis (Alex Pettyfer), but he didn't really want to be saved.  Henry tells Will that he is tired of living and that men were never  meant to be immortal; his body might be 25 but his mind is old and  weary. He gives away his time to Will (over a century) and commits  suicide, not before telling Will to use his time wisely. Once Henry is  found dead, the police (known as timekeepers) begin to investigate the  alleged murder and Will becomes their prime suspect. Raymond Leon  (Cillian Murphy) begins to pursue Will who has now traveled to the best  neighborhood (called time zones), New Greenwich. Will doesn't  understand how the time keepers are so interested in investigating a  suicide when there are hundreds of deaths everyday in the ghetto that  they simply decide to ignore. That is when Will discovers that there is  something wrong with the system and it's time to balance things out. He  meets a millionaire banker named Phillip Weis (Vincent Kartheiser) and  ends up kidnapping his daughter, Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried), in order to  escape from the timekeepers.  From this point on the sci-fi flick begins to take a classic Robin  Hood-ish turn as Will begins to steal time from the rich and give it to  the poor. The action becomes non-stop, although predictable, but it  doesn't mean it becomes less interesting. I really was entertained with  this movie and really enjoyed the premise although I recognize its many  flaws and see why many people didn't like it. The futuristic look of  the film is also worth a watch considering that Roger Deakins (the best  in his field) was in charge of the cinematography and it's very  stylish. The lead performances from Timberlake and Seyfried weren't  among my favorite; I think the best performance comes from Cillian  Murphy who is great in his relentless pursuit of the fugitives. He is  not the typical villain we see in most action films. The rest of the  cast really doesn't get enough time to show off their talents as they  get little screen time. Once the premise is set the movie loses some of  its groove, but I was still entertained and had a decent time. This  might rank among Niccol's worst projects, but it still is a fine good  movie; although probably not worth watching again."

"dashjoe20","6","11","24","26 October 2011"," When Life is Money
","""Do you want life or money?!""<br/><br/>Apparently this is the question thieves ask. Because we all know that no matter how much we wanted 'money', there is no use if we have no 'life' to use them. Which means we have to obediently and reluctantly give our 'money' to the thief. (But of course it is not the case now, because thieves just snatch. That's why they are called 'snatch thieves')<br/><br/>But in ""In Time"", it is a different story. Because Life IS Money.<br/><br/>Ever wish that you can be young and look young forever? or even live an immortal life? Well I'm sure everyone does. And in the movie, your dreams come true. But with a price to pay, and you have to earn them.<br/><br/>In the movie, people stop aging at 25. And after that, you have a timeline for your life. Imagine having to live your life by constantly looking at how much time you still have. But you can earn them, like how you earn money by working, and paying everything with the time of your life left. When you gamble or fight, you don't gamble or fight for money, you gamble or fight for exchange of your life. Pretty challenging task. And you kind of have to be a good 'time' manager and organize your 'time' well.<br/><br/>Like the real world, they have borders which divide the 'rich' people and the 'poor' people. 'Poor' people live day by day, with not much extra to spend, earning enough for a day's living. Maybe spend 30 minutes for a meal, 1 hour for a bus ride. 'Rich' people have a higher possibility to live a longer life. Even can afford to spend years to buy assets. But they all live in fear that their 'time' might get 'stolen'. Which then, they die.<br/><br/>Well imagine today in this world, if all these are real. If you can earn your life, and live to be young forever. Would you want to be immortal and live forever? If you are among the poor, what would you do to continue living? If you are among the rich, how long do you want your life to be? how many years do you consider as 'enough'? or you think you will never get tired of living? Would you keep all the years to yourself?<br/><br/>The story reflects very much to the reality, when money takes its place. In the real world now, people see money as important as their lives. Money is important, but how much money is considered 'enough'? Are you living happier with lots of money? Is earning a lot of money really the achievement of life?<br/><br/>The movie focused a lot on actions. When Justin Timberlake, starring as Will Salas, was incidentally given a lot of years to live. So he wanted to 'transfer' to the 'rich' zone. But he was tracked by the police, or better known as the 'timekeeper', because they thought that the years he got were stolen. I will leave you to watch the rest of the story, because the truth is, as a movie (or action movie), this was actually not such a great film. There were lots of plot holes that you could not really explain or list down, but you know they were there. The transformation and the flow of the movie was not quite there, and it could have been better if it was written a little differently. But if you actually watch the movie on different perspectives, you could gain a lot from the movie. If you are willing to go deeper from just the surface, it could make you think further and comprehend the true message of the story. I personally think that the idea or concept is actually bloody damn good. And if it was given to a different director, for example someone like Christopher Nolan (Inception), the movie could have been turned around.<br/><br/>I find the movie funny at some point though. Was it fun when everyone looks 25 years old? Imagine our grandparents and parents look exactly the same age as us. Or you might be dating someone who is actually 100 years older. :) But well that is just a minor opinion on the movie.<br/><br/>Now let's come back to the real world, you are back to a normal human, earning money, not life. You have the ability to earn your living. But you have a limited life. How many years do YOU have?<br/><br/>*Interested readers do feel free to visit my new movie blog http://joethemovieblogger.blogspot.com/ I will keep a weekly update on new movie reviews. Thanks! :)"

","I just got back watching ''In Time'' with a couple of friends. When I first sat down I thought ''Wow! A glowing watch on his arm, very creative very creative..'' Needless to say, I was quickly captivated by the angles and camera work put into this. Very subtle movements that really highlight the action and drama.<br/><br/>The Acting: How can I put this..? The acting was....unemotional and unreal most of the time. Hence, most of the time. Real acting is when you're watching a movie and you connect with the actor; traveling deep along them on their journey/adventure. They're able to bring out the emotions from the audience. Anyways, the acting in this movie didn't do any of that for me! I just didn't feel like connection the way I do when I watch a great movie. Felt really pushed and one-noted. Bleh.<br/><br/>The storyline: Great concept, but, failed to delivery I think. The whole idea of ''Time is Money'' is really interesting; but the way it's presented didn't really piece together to me. Such as the idea of having your bank on your hand and anyone can take it with a simple touch.<br/><br/>Overall this was an okay movie. I almost fell asleep because it wasn't that alluring and wanting me to see more of it when it progressed. Kind of disappointing... I give crops to whoever picked the crew members though. Very handsome looking people."
"sschimel","3","7","15","22 November 2011"," No time for In Time
","I find it hard to believe that this movie was directed by the same man who made Gattaca. I can see what Mr. Niccol was aiming for in In Time. Gattaca ha a chilly tone throughout, establishing a 1984-ish premise and atmosphere. Uma Thurman's character is chilly. The sets are chilly. And it works perfectly. Unlike Uma Thurman, who's best movies utilize her rather aloof persona, Amanda Seyfried has always projected a warm and sunny persona and here, playing against type, she is just out of her depth. Justin Timberlake, a likable actor, comes off as too nice to pull off the transition from protagonist to antagonist. The script is mediocre. All in all, not a great movie."
"changmoh","Null","7","15","28 October 2011"," ""In Time"" Quickly Becomes a 'Waste of Time'
","When film distributors slap an embargo on the reviews of critics, it usually means that the movie in question stinks so much that they don't want bad reviews to mar the movie's opening. This one was embargoed until the day it opened (Oct 26) - and you guessed it, it stinks. The premise, about time as currency, is flimsy at best - and it provokes more questions than answers.<br/><br/>The premise: It's the future and it's a world where time is literally being used as money. Aging somehow stops at 25, and the only way to stay alive is to earn, steal, or inherit more time. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) lives from hand to mouth in a slum-like sector of the city, until a windfall of time gives him access to the world of the wealthy and powerful.<br/><br/>There, he meets beautiful young heiress Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) and they team up to become a futuristic Bonnie & Clyde, despite being relentlessly pursued by a 'Timekeeper' cop (Cillian Murphy).<br/><br/>The sci-fi world where people stop aging at 25 - is novel and attractive, until you start thinking about the mechanics of it. One of the most disturbing is the LED timer embedded in the left hand of everyone. Is this timer embedded at birth? If so, it is curious how it stays on when the child grows up. What if the timer is discarded before the age of 25? Will the person die at once? People transfer time by clasping each other's hands and even in arm-wrestling. How does the exchange really work, especially in cases of robbery? These questions mar our acceptance of the movie's premise - and makes the whole idea trashy. And even if we can overlook this set-up, the main plot of Will and Sylvia robbing banks of their time and giving it away sounds so implausible that we feel cheated. Will has spent his whole life fighting for time and he has even lost his mother (played by Olivia Wilde as Rachel) because of just a few seconds. To see him squandering it in that Robin Hood manner is just bad writing and poor motivation.<br/><br/>Timberlake and Seyfried are acceptable in their Bonnie & Clyde roles, complete with a titillating underwater scene. Basically, they just need to look macho and sexy respectively, and they succeed in this. Murphy, as expected, shines in his portrayal of a 'time sheriff' where he is part villain and part hero! Thanks to him, there is at least an emotional side to the whole movie. Otherwise, it is a sheer waste of time. (Full review at limchangmoh.blogspot.com)"
"bassrourke","Null","8","18","26 October 2011"," It's not 'Inception' or even 'Logan's Run' it's 'In Time'
","No spoilers here but let me just say that the trailer doesn't give the film any curious benefits. Timberlake can act, that goes without saying now, but he is let down a little by the story. In a nutshell, there's no money in this futuristic world, there's time. There are also zones as named in the film that start from the ghettos to the ultra high class. Once someone is 25 they need to work to earn time to stay alive but the higher the zone the longer the life. J.T plays Will, who after an unfortunate family circumstance and a meeting of a stranger ends up with lot's of time. Moving up zones he meets a beautiful daughter (The china doll-like Amanda Seyfried) of a rich banker type with infinity time in his possession. The pair get together and go on the run in an inspired Robin Hood type escapade. Andrew Niccol also directed the superior 'Gattaca' and this does have a few unique ideas, just not enough explanations either. Cillian Murphy rocks though."

","Well acted, great sci-fi plot, good entertainment value. This movie kept my husband and I engaged. We thought it was well enough written and left no huge gaps in the story that we really paid attention to. The only scene that keeps jumping out in my mind as totally annoying was the guy selling coffee who upped the cost over-night. I just did not like the way that scene was handled. The movie ended well, very satisfying to see the empty vault, so, could there be a clever follow-up plot, because this society has some interesting development potential. Great for a Sociology class assignment for thought and conversation stimulus. We'd like to see more of the matured Mr. Timberlake please. I'm liking the trend in multi- dimensional story lines with Inception and the Adjustment Bureau prior to this. More from Timberlake would be good."
"Likes_Ninjas90","3","11","28","26 October 2011"," Once this silly film is released officially in America there will be a new reason to hate socialism
","In the future people suddenly stop ageing at twenty-five years old. They can live longer by working for more hours, adding to their dwindling lifespan engraved on their arms. Time is also a currency where one can spend individual minutes or hours on commodities and share time with others to survive. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) and his mother Rachel (Olivia Wilde) are a part of this dystopia. One night at a bar, Will attempts to save a man who is being pursued by gangsters because he has a century's worth of time on his arm. They escape and the man reveals that society is deliberately increasing the cost of living in the ghettos so that people will die out. After the man shares his time and then kills himself, Will is investigated by a 'timekeeper' (Cillian Murphy), who is essentially a detective. Angry at another significant death, Will enters the wealthy district for revenge. At a casino he meets Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried), the daughter of a wealthy businessman and they connect. When the timekeeper turns up, Will kidnaps Sylvia. She comes to admire his recklessness and together they begin to literally steal time from the rich. <br/><br/>In Time has about as much subtly as a grandfather clock striking midnight. There will be heavy speculation about how such a fascinating concept, drawing richly from the themes of Aldous Huxley's dystopian fiction, became such a misfire. The film is written and directed by Andrew Niccol, who previously made the science fiction film Gattaca (1997) and penned the screenplay for The Truman Show (1998). Those were terrific films, examining surveillance in such intelligent and visually inventive ways. By writing and directing this himself, his first feature since Lord of War (2005), Niccol has not been able to take a step back from his own material. His script is at fault here because it reads like a bad first draft. In a sea of mindless action films and reboots, he deserves credit for attempting to touch on ideas of class and economics. Yet it never overcomes the starting block of being more than just a potentially good idea. All of the characters are sketchily drawn and reveal too thinly the transparency and mechanics of the screenplay. As the characters stand around to debate how unjust society has become, we realise that they are ciphers for Niccol's thematic concerns. This would matter less if the lines were well written but the dialogue is grating and repetitive, thanks to clunkers like: ""No one should live like this. You've never lived a day in your life father!"" As shown in the superior dystopian film Children of Men (2006), a distinguishable setting and selective camera-work is invaluable to expressing a way of life. But Niccol's has forgotten the golden rule of screen writing: 'show, don't tell'. He lacks aid and imagination from the film's cheap visual design. The city, mimicking the likes of an impoverished Detroit, is never affecting and given this is meant to be a world where time can be transferred in a handshake you'd expect its architecture to be more elaborately enhanced.<br/><br/>Potential for social commentary and satire is also weakened by Niccol's bid to show his hand too soon. There are no shades of grey here. The rich are wealthy but bored and the poor are cheated by the state so that it increases the cost of living. Sound familiar? The director compounds the simplicity of this issue by having characters verbally reference the likes of Charles Darwin and the 'survival of the fittest'. There is rarely a moment where the themes are allowed to boil under the surface, letting the audience think for themselves. Viewed as a straight thriller, In Time is an untidy piece. The narrative is episodic, made up of obligatory car chases and superfluous characters. The script needed tightening because there are scenes, such as the one in a casino, that are overextended and logically amiss. The strangest inclusion is probably its best and that's when the film alludes to Bonnie and Clyde (loosely) and John Dillinger, as Will and Sylvia start robbing places, giving out time quotients to the poor. If it had focused on a series of heists and had less of the gangsters and Sylvia's father, it would have been more cohesive. The performances are mostly uninspired. Timberlake, brilliant in The Social Network (2010), has proved that he can act. The kid is a born performer but he's been reined in and told to scowl more, which means the film makes less use of his charisma or cheek. Murphy looks like he's just walked off the set of The Matrix (1999) and Seyfried brings little edge to her character. When she says that her father thinks she's reckless it's laughable. Olivia Wilde has the most thankless part because with just two or three scenes she's reduced to little but a cameo. Given that there was an embargo preventing any reviews of In Time to be published before its starting date, it's presumable that the studios saw what was coming. Once this silly film is released officially in America there will be a new reason to hate socialism."
"NDanger","3","8","19","2 November 2011"," Who can I blame for this?
","I went into this movie hoping for a reasonable remake of the 1976 SF movie ""Logan's Run"". Well, that's not what I got. What I got was an unworkable premise, bad actors(or un-actable scenes and/or dialog) and extremely unbelievable situations. Premise - In a way that is not even attempted to explain, you are born with an embedded time clock that will 'go off' at 25 and begin counting down your last year of life, BUT this clock can be manipulated by 'pert near anything. So, as we find out (eventually) the poor work hard to afford a little bit of luxury, while the rich live forever. Immediately I saw that it would never work. If there was a device that interfaced with the clock, then it could be reversed engineered and THEN where would the system be. Acting - How would someone behave if your world revolved around this concept?? That thought gives my critique of the acting some slack. Since I have no baseline on how emotionally retarded the extreme classes presented in the film would be, it's hard to be too damning. But damning is what my instinct say be. Wooden, purposeless? I suppose Flat would be my best one word for the acting. Unworkable situations - Without being a spoiler, there are several scenes in the movie which are just... ridiculous. Even if I had put my brain in a jar, my butt was smart enough to see the implausibility of several scenes. I gave it a 3 simply because there were a few entertaining moments, the nice set on Amanda Seyfried, and the acting may have been inhibited/warped by the director (& screenwriter)."
"Turin_Horse","8","3","5","24 July 2013"," Very original and correctly done
","Don't be mislead by the not so good reviews for this film. In Time is among the best recent SciFi films you will see, give it a try. A very original story, which (not many seem to have realized about it) is a clever allegory of today's capitalist world, but with time except money as currency. The structure of society and economy are a mirror of our own society, but in the much more scary version that those affluent can live, as they earn enough to have years or even centuries of life ahead them (genetic engineering has made it possible to remain young for as long as one lives), whereas the less affluent ones have to struggle daily to get more time to remain alive. Banks give you loans of time, at very high interest rates, and the system is controlled by the rich and powerful, whom just raise the interest rates and prices and lower the salaries when they detect that something may threaten their privileged position.... doesn't this ring a bell to you??<br/><br/>Other people have commented about the inadequacy of the actors chosen for the main roles (don't agree), the lack of chemistry between them (same) or a weak plot (strongly disagree). The main point of the film is the extremely original central idea (don't leave minor points distract you from this), correctly developed in a good plot, and with moments of Bonnie & Clyde-like thriller which make the whole film worth to see."

","Why all the hate? I thought ""In time"" was very good. Although I want too hate Justin Timberlake, I can't fault him as an actor, and too tell you the truth, I've been impressed with most off the movies I've seen him in (I have too say even his music, though not my kind off thing, is good for what it is).<br/><br/>I Believe that Timberlakes presence is perhaps what has cursed ""In time."" An otherwise original movie, that sci-fi fans should be lapping up. Maybe it would off done better if it starred someone the average bloke thinks is cooler, but for now it's probably a film guys are getting dragged too by their girlfriends. If my girlfriend had dragged me along too see this though, I'd off been glad, because it's entertaining.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm too overwhelmed with excitement when something is actually ""original"" these days (it does cause me too dish out a high rating straight away) but the unique premise off this flick is what people who didn't particularly enjoy it even admit too it having. Judging it by everything else that's in it though, I still think it's good. It's got a good cast, some half decent (though small amount of) action, and even uses the way clocks are always counting down in the movie too add some extra excitement too it. Plus Amanda Seyfried looks great in it. Oooft!<br/><br/>""In time"" also doesn't overdo it with the way the future that is represented here looks, meaning it will age reasonably well. Even though it hasn't been that highly praised now (people complain that it's not explained how these people off the future are the way they are, even though it clearly says that they have been genetically engineered this way at the beginning) I can see it becoming a cult classic off sorts in the future."

","How can a good idea be so poorly executed? The film starts with a very interesting premise: humanity, able to provide immortality, has now only one worthy trading value, which is time. Based on this you would expect to see some radical changes in human behavior, with lots of existential issues at stake. What this film delivers in an absurd device to control the ultimate human currency, a society which is pretty much the same as nowadays and tons of ridiculous scenes which cannot be believed even if one tries really hard. Characters in this film have zero depth, the story develops to more and more absurdity and it looks as if in the middle of filming they really didn't know what to do about it. On top of it acting is bad, so... what else can go wrong?<br/><br/>I give it a 2 just because of the original idea, and I am completely lost by the current rating at IMDb at the time of writing this (6,7: did I watch a different movie or what?)"

","Too many glaring plot holes really screws this movie out of any enjoyment value for me. I can't stand it when the reasons for a characters actions aren't adequately explained. (Perhaps if the story was better I wouldn't have had time to pick it apart.)<br/><br/>IN TIME posits that time is now the world's currency. Everyone carries around their life's savings displayed as a digital clock in their arm. Anyone can take or give you 'life' by merely clasping your arm. If this was the case, I think murders and muggings wouldn't be restricted to a couple of 'minutemen' (hoodlums) driving around in a car. Every single street corner would have someone who, about to run out of time, was primed to steal your time.<br/><br/>The premise states that all people born are immortal; genetically engineered to stop aging at 25. This sounds great until we're told that this age marker initiates a countdown starting at 1 year worth of time. If your counter reaches zero you die, instantly and painlessly.<br/><br/>All income and payments for goods and services in this new world are applied in time units. The ultra-rich have thousands of hours on their clocks and the corporation they run manipulate what time is worth in order to control the population of workers.<br/><br/>Several things really bothered me about this premise. How do people live until they are 25 if their clock doesn't start until then? How do they perform the transactions needed to purchase food or receive wages? I saw one child begging for money (time) using a 'cassette', but that scene only opened up more questions. I can see why the film glossed over the problem.<br/><br/>With only a few Timekeepers wandering around, crime would have been rampant. Look how easily 2 people could take what they wanted from the time loan banks and even from the Greenwich ultra-rich.<br/><br/>What could have made this film better? I would have had Will download the million years into his arm which would make his clock malfunction. He would then download his malfunction to every person he could, and ask them to do the same, starting a chain reaction. This would be the start of a revolution. That's as far as I want to go without rewriting the book but it would have been a more satisfying ending in my opinion."

","The idea for the movie was interesting. That's why I watched it. However, there were plenty of things wrong with this science/economic fiction film. The biggest flaw is that there would be no possible way for anyone to get as rich as those guys were if this was real. Based on the 4 minute cost of a coffee that would be $2 in real life, it would cost $30 an hour 24 hours a day or $262800 a year just to stay alive. That is without food, rent, or anything else. People are only given one year to ""spend"" after they turn 25. I can't see anything besides food, medicine, and other non elastic goods being worth any significant amount of time. That means these people stole $262.8 billion dollars and just walked out like it was nothing. There is no way for that much time to exist unless the bankers at some point went in with guns and killed people for time. Who would give these people a loan at 30% if they have no capital to pay it back with. Unlike wealth in real life which is what money represents, there is no way to create time. This movie makes no sense."

Once the clock runs down to 0, you're dead.<br/><br/>Of course there is then the separation between those who have a lot of time/money & those who don't - one man, JT, doesn't like this idea very much.<br/><br/>It turns into a Robin Hood type film, I won't say too much.<br/><br/>I would recommend watching this film.

"jerryberling76","7","2","3","3 November 2013"," A good fable that looks at the consequences of income equality
","The movie ""In Time"", offers a unique look into human nature and the coarseness of humanity. The film starts off by offering a general explanation of how time can literally be bought and time is literally money. Justin Timberlake's character, Will Salas, learns this lesson the hard way when his mother does not have the means to purchase time. Salas comes into some ""money"" and from then on pursues a vendetta against the upper class. He comes into contact with Amanda Seyfried's character, Sylvia Weis, a girl from the right side of the tracks who is somewhat of a spoiled brat and is bored with her rich lifestyle. <br/><br/>The film has several common underlying themes including a look at income equality and how money is the difference between life and death. It is essentially a fable about the selfishness of humanity that means to show the path that we are headed down if the gap between the 99% and the 1% continues. In the film, each character must pay for and bank enough time within their time clock, which is embedded in their arms, in order to stay alive. The rich keeps getting richer and the poor keeps getting poorer. Will Salas is also relentless pursed by Cillian Murphy's character Raymond Leon. Leon is a timekeeper whose job it is to ensure that the poor keep a safe distance from the upper class. This is much like in real life where it seems the police are more at favor with the upper class. Many movies use the element of time to express a human need for immortality, but in this movie it is not about immortality; it is about just trying to stay alive. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie, you waste ""time"" by buying your basic needs. Coffee costs ""time"", the bar costs ""time"" etc. This provides an accurate look at the rising cost of living that we are experiencing in real life. For many, just buying basic items can make or break a person. The movie utilizes specific motifs to express the grim lives of the people who live in the ""ghetto"" and the people who are the upper class. One is the consistent use of the bodyguards, enshrouded in black, who are tasked to protect the rich. They drive bullet-proof heavy duty cars in order to ensure that the rich are protected. We also see the use of shiny, clean glass buildings in the better parts of town while in the poor parts of town we see drab, concrete buildings throughout. The relationship between Will Salas and Sylvia Weis is a pretty typical depiction of opposites attract. <br/><br/>But, what makes this movie great, is the music score that was used. The music used was a great choice. It helps to set up the mood and while the movie is set in the future, the music is reminiscent of the past and makes you connect more with the characters and their plights. The theme of the rich being separated from the poor as also been done in countless movies and more recently in the film ""Elysium"". Both ""Elysium"" and ""In Time"" take place in the future and we see that the rich inhabit the best areas."

","In a futuristic dystopia money has been replaced with life - the moment your credit runs out you end up dead. Life as a commodity to trade had changed society into those who can afford eternity and those forced to work at dead-end, quasi-slavery, jobs only to survive the day. This order remains unquestioned until time-stricken Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is gifted over 100 years by a rich outsider fed up with the reality in which he lives. This allows Will to venture into the most expensive living zones, where he soon unravels the corrupt system created for the egotistical few. Followed by authorities led by Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy), who fail to believe that someone would have gifted 100 years of life to a complete stranger, Will meets up with heir to Weis Time Bank corporation, Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried). Hungry for adventure and a life not dictated by fright of death Sylvia and Will create a gungho Robin Hoodesque / Bonnie and Clyde team who steal time from the rich and offer it to the poor.<br/><br/>With a strong concept rife with capitalist and philosophical undertones, director Andrew Niccol takes the bare minimum exterior, filling it with action fluff, instead of some well-crafted idea-expansion. Tragically empty with some uninspired performances by the surprisingly wooden Seyfriend and Timberlake, the whole movie rings hollow, echoing of wasting opportunities. After some initial promise the whole story spirals downwards, playing with gimmicks resulting from the base idea, instead of exploring the possibilities it offers. Lacking any clever observations and fronted by two leads with absolutely no emotional pull, ""In Time"" dissolves any initial interest, making it forgettable drivel not worth the time credits spent on it."

","Like most of the other reviewers here, I have to concur that IN TIME is a great idea in search of a decent story. Despite a compelling High Concept behind this project, the writers just don't seem to know what to do with it.<br/><br/>The main issue is that nothing really happens, other than JT runs around robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, just like his late father.<br/><br/>Then there's the heavy-handed allegory, comparing a world which runs on time to our world which runs on money ... as Leona Helmsley once famously said, ""Only the little people pay taxes.""<br/><br/>But allegory alone doesn't make for compelling storytelling ...<br/><br/>Sadly, IN TIME is a bit of a Waste of Time, really ...

","Great idea with incredibly dumb execution. In the future, time is currency and everyone stops ageing at 25 for some reason. Timberlake finds himself receiving thousands of years from some guy tired of immortality. He ends up being chased by the cops in charge of time, and by some very non-threatening gangsters. The idea is wonderful, and the perfect vehicle for social satire. The poor spend their lives on food and essentials, literally living day to day, meanwhile the rich just spend, spend, spend. It also has the great chance to view the pain of immortality and how it's not how long you live but how you live. Which is why I'm so angry at the stupidity and nonsense in this film. I understand that nobody ages, but why does everyone look like a model? Characters just vanish, and it just becomes one huge assault on the 1%. Like a teenager with a good idea, but doesn't understand what they are talking about. There are huge lapses in logic. A major character dies because of time running out, even though simple maths would show that she would have survived. People run at each other in slow motion, with dramatic countdowns, but it doesn't play in real time. Timberlake's character knows how to fight, which I put down to his mention of his father being able to fight, and then we find out that fighting just involves holding hands. This makes for the most boring confrontation between Timberlake and the antagonist. Let's hope for an intelligent remake in the future, because this just ruins the premise."

","I watched this movie a long time ago. It is an okay movie. The trailer of the movie is amazing, but the movie does tent to be a bit less catchy. The things that i really loved about the movie are that Amanda Seyfried and Justin Timberlake are two of my most favorite actors. Unfortunately i have seen both of them play in movies where the character which they played had better scrips and was a character highly aware of his/her goals. The idea of the movie has caught my eye when i watched the movie. I believe it is a very unique idea. But than again the characters don't seem to value their ""time"". I guess that they were supposed to be that way, but it just felt like i knew that nothing would happen to them, and they always seemed to gain ""time"" very fast and easily. So there were things that i did but also didn't like about the movie. It is meant to be an action-thriller, and it is, but in my opinion the action is like the wind blowing calmly, instead of a wild hurricane."
"lourensini","7","2","3","28 March 2012"," A Brilliant idea! Not that brilliant executed.
","Taking off horrible car actions scenes and the unstoppable message of ""time is money"", In Time is a brilliant movie, with an original idea (at least I haven't seen a movie treating the ""life span"" like this one before).<br/><br/>Timberlake does a good job on his character, and its impossible to see Johnny Galecki and do not remember him on The Big Bang Theory. Because his laugh is exactly the same, haha. Apart from these two, there is some bad actors doing poor acting. Something to take care of, if someone intent to make a sequel (or prequel, because how science evolved to the point on put a clock on people's arm and make them share life time like a USB cable from arm to arm is still a mystery).<br/><br/>Right in first 10 minutes we can see we're about to get bored about how many times they will spend talking about time and enjoying life, and bla bla bla. Really, this was supposed to be subjected, and not repeated throughout the whole plot.<br/><br/>Another issue is the car action extremely slowly moving scenes. Is this the best stunt man can do? They're clearly the worse part of the movie. They're so bad produced that we can see when the car is ""running"" 5 miles per hour. Really, they suck.<br/><br/>What salves In Time is photography and the fact producers used old muscle cars instead of prototypes in a futuristic scyfy movie. That was really a well though idea! Amazing! it gives a kind of retro atmosphere to it. Thumbs up! Apart for some mistakes, In Time is really a great movie. To bad it doesn't make you think like one."

","In a society where time is money (yes literally, time is the new currency), and the average citizen is programmed to live twenty-five years, a poor kid from the slums finds himself on the run when he is accused of illegally holding a hundred and ten years on his life clock.<br/><br/>I see a great idea behind In Time, but it never aspires to anything more than a chase scene movie. Andrew Nichol's third feature works on a superficially as an action film that doesn't rely on bullets and explosions, but the experience feels a bit too much like a video game. (especially when the characters are constantly rushing to refuel their time clock). Characterization is fairly wooden, and the whole movie is cut together in a manner that makes you feel like it's all taking place within a few city blocks. I would have liked to have seen a bit more helicopter mounted camera work myself.<br/><br/>Although he's far from being a good actor, Justin Timberlake is good at making a boring character feel less boring, by bringing some energy. Here, that's definitely a positive. Part of Timberlake's strength of course is that he has wit. The same cannot be said about Amanda Seyfried, who is once again adorably boring. That said, perhaps she shows a little improvement over her last couple performances.<br/><br/>What bothers me most about In Time however, is the credibility of the setting. Of all the Orwellian societies I've seen in the movies, this is the one that struck me as the one that would never function. Nichol has taken a potent concept and put it forward in a kind of B- grade fashion. It's not impossible to watch, but it's not really worth watching."

","In the near future, everyone stops ageing at 25 but the catch is that once people get to 25 they only have 1 year left to live (everyone is programmed with a timer on their left arm showing how much time they have left to live). The poor find themselves having to either work, beg, steal or borrow in order to survive whereas the rich are able to buy themselves decades of life at a time pretty much guaranteeing immortality for themselves. When Will Salas (Justin Timerlake) is gifted over 100 years of life by a man he is wrongly accused of murdering he finds himself on the run and kidnaps the daughter of wealthy entrepreneur Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser). Although she is initially sceptical of Will's motivations when she sees first-hand what life is like in the slums she hatches a plan to help Will overthrow her father's brutal capitalist regime...<br/><br/>I remember when this film came out 8 years ago and being intrigued about seeing it due to its rather unique premise. Whilst in some ways it lived up to what I expected it to be it is also disappointing in many ways as well...<br/><br/>For starters, next to nothing is explained in regards to this new future and how it came to be in existence; when did it all start and by whom? How did the rich become so rich? What was life like before? These things are occasionally eluded to at various points in the film, but we're never given a definitive explanation. In some ways this is frustrating as it becomes a film that you have to watch and just accept what you see in front of you; this is not the same as watching a film and agreeing or disagreeing with what is put in front of you; films of this nature with strong well-developed narrative can invite discussion and reflection, but as you're only given a bare bones story with In Time it's not really possible to do this. The film also has a pointless sub-plot surrounding the death of Will's father which is only ever half developed at best.<br/><br/>Having said that if you are prepared to take it for what it is then what you will get is a briskly-paced thriller and given the fact that every person is effectively against the clock it does have a real 'race against time' feel to it. I lost track of how many times you saw people's clocks count down to within seconds of their life being ended. On this basis it succeeds and in many ways the fast-paced nature of the film does help to paper over the many cracks within the story. The acting performances are all so-so with a possible standout being Vincent Kartheiser as the slimy rich CEO of Weis Time Lenders.<br/><br/>There are other things that are not really explained such as what happens to the bodies of all of the deceased? Do they just get buried or cremated? Also why did Will and Sylvia wait till the very end when they only had seconds to live to run to the Timekeeper's car to buy more time for themselves? Why didn't they do this when they stole his car earlier in the film. On the same note, if the Timekeeper knew he didn't have long to live at the end why didn't he buy himself more time?<br/><br/>So yes there's clearly a number of flaws and some semblance of a backstory and any kind of explanation as to what was going on would have resulted in a much stronger film. Having said that In Time is still pretty damn entertaining and is a fun ride if you just go with the flow and try not to think about it too much."

","I had my doubts when I read about this story in which people all die after the age of 25, unless they start paying big money to add more years to their short lives. Did sound silly to me, but I am glad I tried watching it anyway, because however silly and futuristic this story may sound, it is directed, acted and photographed with impressive suspense and credibility.<br/><br/>The futuristic settings are run down and gloomy, without any scifi stuff. I liked that look a lot. It's basically a portrait of almost the same society we live in nowadays, only a few decades ahead.The story is a portrayal of the survival of poor people in society, who cant afford to live much longer than 25 years old. Justin Timberlake is one of them. The rich can buy time to prolong their lives, the poor can't. But by accident Justin Timberlake gets the chance to live a hundred years, while his poor family and friends are about to die soon. What will he do with the long life he has been given?<br/><br/>Without being depressive or sentimental about this struggle between the poor and the rich, this movie is quite suspenseful, with enough riveting action. It is also quite an impressive emotional character driven story with really good acting by Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried.

","I just saw ""In Time"" again for the third time or so, and it's my new favorite movie. It's hard science-fiction, much harder than most. The future doesn't look like ""the future"" at all, but more like the 1970s. The cops drive 1970 Dodge Chargers, not goofy electric golf- carts. There are phone booths, no cell phones, and the Internet is not a major force in anyone's life. No one is emigrating to Mars, as in ""Gattaca (1997)"" -- also written by Andrew Nicol -- and there are certainly no star-ships, and no space aliens. The single technology that has gone forward is medicine, and that life clock thing, naturally. ""No one dies; no one gets sick."" That's the thing that makes it ""hard"" science-fiction; it resists throwing a bunch of stuff on the wall, instead holding tightly to its premise. <br/><br/>Because of the immortality-with-a-price premise and the 1970s action-movie styling, comparisons to ""Logan's Run (1976)"" are unavoidable. Whereas ""Logan's Run"" envisioned a future where we got everything we ever wished for, only to see it wind down, ""In Time"" envisions a sort of stagnant future that one rarely imagines in a movie, not even obviously dystopian, just stagnant. This is what I love about the movie: it's not really about immortality at all, but about Economic Fascism. In the movie, people have jobs making widgets, making just enough to live day to day. Prices are methodically inflated so that no one gets ahead. There's no upward mobility whatsoever. It's like ""1984"", except Economics (with the help of that clock thing) does all the work of the secret police. It's a metaphor for our modern post-2008-crash economy. <br/><br/>This movie reminds me a bit of ""The Island (2005)"", which I also liked, a big difference being that there's no ""secret"". The characters in ""In Time"" tacitly consent to their situation. <br/><br/>This is a fast-paced, beautiful action-adventure science-fiction film with a brilliant premise, destined to be a cult classic. Hollywood, please make more movies like this."

"matthew_schaffner","5","1","1","28 February 2015"," Great concept, sinful movie
","From the outset of In Time, I was willing to follow the ""time is money"" concept. Sure it was far fetched, but it was intriguing. I held on, content with Timberlake's acting, how the story unfolded, the cinematography, and the music worked well.<br/><br/>Half an hour into the movie, and the illusion begins to die. A combination of poor editing, writing, and acting left the main chunk of the plot disjointed. I felt character motivations were left of field, or at least not explained well. I felt the dialogue between characters was very stock standard, and made the characters seem hollow. I swear they repeated the ""is it stealing if its already stolen"" line over 10 times.<br/><br/>But worst of all, what let this movie down, was its coherency. I felt like there were gaps in the narrative that were lazily breezed over, and just left me confused. They also forced in a love story, which goes to show how dimensional the character can be. And I'm not sure whether the script or the editing is to blame, but they botched the pacing. <br/><br/>For example, How do Will and Sylvia get dry after swimming in the ocean? How do they travel to the ghetto without crossing any borders? How do they hide in the pawn shop, did they have a key? How come the timekeeper takes so long to shoot Will? How does Will disguise himself as one of Weis' guards???<br/><br/>I know these might seem pedantic, but for me, it ruined the believability of this film. Just look at the hotel room scene where they ""arm wrestle"". This scene is so sinful. Firstly, Will's technique for winning seems stupid, and only works because Fortis doesn't look like he's trying. Secondly, how come they didn't find the gun on his leg, these gangsters are terrible gangsters. And lastly, why is the acting so poor? If I were Fortis, and I saw my men get killed, and know I was about to die I might emote some fear and shock, but Pettyfer gave us nothing.<br/><br/>Overall, and alright film that should have put more effort into its own illusion or the precious life lessons it teaches the audience will get lost. Really, it started well, but ultimately put action and regurgitate dialogue above the plot."

I guess that's a good sign of a good movie. <br/><br/>The effects worked well too, the numbers on the arms look great. The practical futuristic locations aren't exactly mind blowing, but they don't need to be for this story to work. <br/><br/>I would probably recommend waiting for this on DVD / VOD, rather than seeing it in the theater, but I certainly wouldn't tell anyone to avoid it.

","This science fiction thriller is set in the year 2169 and people are genetically engineered to stop aging at 25 with one year allotted after that. If they don't keep their time replenished, they are susceptible to ""time out"" after they use up all their time. Time is used as a means of currency for the world. The main character is Will Salas, played by Justin Timberlake, and he works in a factory as a way to earn a living in the ghetto, literally. He comes in contact with a girl named Sylvia Wise, played by Amanda Seyfried who lives in a rich neighborhood called New Greenwich, and they run off together. They are up against time and struggle to stay alive. Both have come to the understanding that the rich is stealing time from the poor. The basis of the movie becomes: only the strong will survive.<br/><br/>The theme for In Time focuses on ideas. Will and Sylvia represent figures from two different aspects of life but still, in time, come to trust, need, and help one another as well as others in the film. In a particular scene, Will asks Sylvia to give allow him to borrow some time and she refuses. Fast forward a few scenes, Sylvia becomes the one who is almost out of time and asks Will for some time and he obliges. The mood in the film which the director is trying to display is compassion and understanding for those around us who are from different social classes. The film also displays the struggle for human dignity because Will truly does believe that everyone should be given the opportunity to survive, regardless of their status in life. Through his determination to emphasize this he displays courage, sensitivity, intelligence, and strong individualism as mentioned in The Art of Watching Films written by Joseph M. Boggs and Dennis W. Petrie. (p. 27) The movie is similar to another sci-fi flick, After Earth. The main character was given a few skills to survive, but beyond those skills he had to figure it out to make sure that the rest of the world didn't die as a result of his mistake. He portrayed many of the same characteristics as Will Salas.<br/><br/>The movie had a few other plot points within the man plot. One in particular involves the fact that the ghetto is always being watched by video surveillance. This is true in modern day society. The ghetto represents people who will steal from one another which are represented by the Minutemen; they will kill each other, and go to great lengths to survive. Due to this fact there are always police, represented as Time Keepers, lurking around to catch criminals. The separation of time zones between the ghetto and New Greenwich is also a reality. Such as the rich are separated from those who are poor by different suburbs, housing communities, lifestyles, and social classes. Deep into the movie we come to an understanding of why prices are steadily increasing on a daily basis. The rich are trying to kill off the poor to make space for themselves. The movie also weaves in a romance between Sylvia and Will to show that they are human and have emotions that don't rely on the time they have allotted.<br/><br/>Two techniques that were used in the movie are motifs and lighting. Throughout the film we see each character look at a digital clock on their forearm. The clock represents how much time they have. We see and hear the clock as time adds up, is taken away, or is cleared off and becomes the end of a person's life. There is great emphasis put on the clock because it allows us to see what that person is worth and we see how precious it is to each character. The lighting in this film is great in the fact that there are great scenes when the low-key lighting helps us to understand the mood of the scene. During these moments there is usually a struggle or fight and we only see the defining moments needed to interpret what is happening."

","The first twenty minutes of this movie are amazing -- it looks like the beginning of a kick-ass, blue-collar remake of LOGAN'S RUN. Justin Timberlake IS Will Solace, a bad-ass rebel trying to take on a whole world full of ""beautiful people."" Ghetto hustler Will is used to living minute-to-minute on the street. And he is drawn to the rich at first. But their opulence hides a terrible secret! So far, so good, and I have to say that, contrary to most reviews you see here, Justin has NO trouble playing a street hustler who's seen it all and has the natural reflexes of a killer. He's brilliant at keeping his cool in the fight scenes and chase scenes, even going ""unbelievable"" in a totally bored tone when a time cop shoots right at him! No, what really sinks the movie (after a killer half hour) is when Will meets up with the little robot-chick who's supposed to be ""the rich man's daughter."" <br/><br/>Suddenly the kick-ass sci-fi film noir becomes a lame, MTV-flavored remake of BONNIE & CLYDE. Two crazy kids on the run -- can they take on The System? <br/><br/>Hell no!!!! <br/><br/>Justin and Amanda what's her name have no chemistry, no funk, no soul as a couple. Watch Michael York and Jennifer Agutter in the original LOGAN's RUN, or watch Natalie Portman and Hugo what's his face in V FOR VENDETTA, and you can see how real chemistry between the leads can overcome even the silliest sci-fi premise.<br/><br/>Here it's the opposite. The lifeless love scenes totally derail the chases and ruin the film's climax. Worse than that, as a tough guy Justin has much more ""chemistry"" with the Time Cops, the Minute Men, and all the other baddies, including Vincent Kartheiser as the Barbie Doll's father! (Is Vincent phoning this part in or what?) So anyway, this movie is worth watching once -- but after the first half hour it's all down hill."

","Yeah, Justin TImberlake can do it. He's talented and probably can do any of the related star turns in his general gestalt. Add him to a quality production where the writing takes a lesson from the cable model of writer-produced shows and it's a simple result—a movie worth watching, worth giving to. Not too many of these in cinema these days. The writer's touch is all over this with witty dialogue. Youth-market stuff is kept succinct and doesn't pander (too much). Craig Armstrong does good music, although not as good as his regular stuff. Really good electronic music is sooo powerful in film but rarely used. ""In The Valley of Elah"" is a good example with Mark Isham doing original stuff.<br/><br/>Andrew Niccol is the man here. I don't follow all the filmography (or discography), but as soon as I heard he wrote ""The Truman Show"" I (had to use IMDb... As Niccol is quoted Hollywood is reluctantly getting some real talent from abroad, esp the UK/empire. His earlier ""Lord of War"" was excellent, as was ""Gattaca"". <br/><br/>Enough can't be said of ""The Truman Show"". Masterpiece. As a metaphysician, this film plays with ""the only new show in town"". And gets it really right, not just partially like many Hollywood rewrittens. I guess they left his script alone or mostly. <br/><br/>""In TIme"" is nothing like Truman, but shows how 'easy' it can be to write intelligently (and film the f'er). A handy analog of today's Occupy/Leftist story done really well. A good stock of UKish actors (how many of these Western pretties have they got over there eating bad cooking and staying thin? This is another invasion we need in Ad-America. He started in non- American commercials like the Scott bros (excuse all my ignorance where it shows, I have no resume for the ""New Yorker"" et al).<br/><br/>Several good leftist (truth) points made as the conceit plays out. Could actually be a great one season TV series if we traced the origin of the genetic plot and the cabal behind it, etc. Cillian Murphy and whoever played the head of the 'Minutemen' stand out.<br/><br/>This Niccol cat (New Zealand) reminds me of Christopher and Jonathan Nolan—INTELLIGENT. How'd they get into LA w/o being mediocre? Is a 'revolution' of some sort going on? btw, there's no end to what smarts can do with audio/video—guess how many genius scripts (as Mort Sahl once said) are in drawers in LA?"
"jj_spicer","6","1","1","17 August 2012"," Nice idea. Not great execution
","In Time is actually a neat little idea for a movie. The idea that everyone on earth stops aging at the age of 25, and then from then on, money literally becomes the life force that keeps you going. You go to work to earn time. You pay your rent with time, you pay for coffee with time. People steal your time instead of your wallet. And yes, when your time runs out, then you die.<br/><br/>Will (Timberlake) is from the ghetto, where every day, he survives just enough to see the next one. However, one night, a stranger hands him over 100 years of time, enough to buy a nice car, move into the nice neighbourhood, and finally live like a free man. But, in a poorly explained intervention, the authorities don't like the poor getting time that easily, and Will soon is on the run with the daughter of a powerful banker, eager to make a change to this bleak world before his time runs out.<br/><br/>I have a problem watching these sort of movies, in that I could never envision a world where we would ever let ourselves come to this sort of situation. A bit like The Hunger Games, where I could never see us, as a civilisation, enjoying an event where teenagers kill each other. But that's one of the things with sci-fi. You need to accept what isn't currently possible. As Will kind of half-ass gets away with covering at the start, he can't explain why we got to this situation, but that's just the way it is.<br/><br/>The acting isn't great. Timberlake really is more suited to support roles. He was good in Alpha Dog, but clearly, leading roles maybe aren't his forte. It may not be entirely his fault, and his character is pretty-stock standard, but you can kind of tell he doesn't really have a great range of emotional acting to draw from. Amanda Seyfried, as Will's hostage-come-helper is equally flat. The usually excellent Cillian Murphy, as the dogged cop trying to track down the wrongly accused Will, is wasted in his 1-dimensional character. The script won't excite any scholars, and the action is decent but nothing special.<br/><br/>It's an OK movie. As I said, the idea is quite neat. But if this was going to be a great film, it needed something more, and better acting and a better script would've helped. The film is shot quite well, but it felt rushed, and that's probably why the characters seem weak and under- developed. Give it a go for the novelty of the idea, but don't expect too much."

","The Movie In Time is a good movie. Due to the youth of the lead actors I under estimated the quality of the movie. The movie was very entertaining and the story was good and it held up. The use of time to live as currency was very smart. The way short life fell on the poor and long life on the wealthy parrallels life today. In that hard time fall on the poor and the life of luxury falls on the rich. Also the way the wealthy feared danger because it was the only way to die. While the poor only had a Day at a time to live, very creative. Thus making the two lead actors bring down the system by taking back time from the many Time Banks established by the government. To reestablishing equality with the people of the time. P.S. Amanda your Eyes are Incredible, and by the way your legs are scandalously Sexy."

What an existence. Those who buy their way into life, they never age. When you run out of time, as shown on your hand, (you'd think that everyone in the film had been in a concentration camp by the numbers stamped on their hand)you simply drop dead.<br/><br/>Of course, our hero rescues our heroine and takes her away from her boring existence to start robbing banks, the main one owned by her father.

","Seyfried is very good, her character is credible; Timberlake's not so much, he is too detached. I would give her 9/10 and him 6/10. Murphy's cop is pretty good, too. I cannot decide on the banker, I keep seeing him as his character in Mad Men. The local bad guy and his gang need an upgrade to be more believable. The movie plot is good but some of the technological advances are far-fetched when compared to other aspects of the world these people live in.

It gives us a view of 'time' in a different angle, from one that we casually dismiss or take for granted in our daily lives - to one that means starvation, losing all the comforts in life even Death. From a luxury to a necessity. <br/><br/>The actors are apt for their roles and are well chosen.<br/><br/>I must admit though it had become like a futuristic 'Bonnie and Clyde' gig towards the end. <br/><br/>Other than that it is a very good movie to watch without making you feel you wasted time or money."

","I watched the trailer and automatically thought: this movie is going to suck. You just can't try to convey a serious topic and have Amanda Seyfried running around in perfect hair and high heels. <br/><br/>I think if you analyze each part of the movie individually things are not that bad (except for the screenplay, in which apparently, the character of Sylvia is designed to act as Will's inner voice asking a bunch of stupid questions and making a lot of useless remarks). Needless to say, I was right, the movie sucked (at least for me). I'll admit there were some good things to it: 1) It wasn't horribly made 2) The idea wasn't terrible 3) the world did make sense (mostly) ... which is actually one of the most important things in a sci-fi film. If you're world makes sense... you're half way there. But then, when you've got the world... you need the characters to fill it... and that my friends is where things went terribly wrong.<br/><br/>I'm not going to talk about the acting skills, because I don't really know a thing about acting (I still don't know why Sandra Bullock won that Oscar back in 2010 but I'm glad she did). I'm going to talk about characters, and how I was confused about the ones in this particular film. I mean, it was just weird the way Will went from being an all-American guy to this Bond/Hood hybrid running all around the place and stealing earrings from ""old"" ladies to give them to her new found girlfriend. <br/><br/>It was also weird to have two people teaming up to destroy a system they didn't really understand. I mean, sure, some ""old"" dude tells you you've been controlled your whole life and then kills himself by giving you all of his time(money) and suddenly the system should be overthrown; and yes, I know it also has something to do with her mother's death, but honestly... when they were actually robbing all those banks (it was like one bank...) I just kept thinking it was all (somehow) Sylvia's idea, and that she had been planning it with that rich guy from the beginning, and that Will was just a piece of a much bigger master plan... and all of the sudden, I was sitting in the movie theater thinking of a thousand ideas that would have made the movie better...<br/><br/>Go watch if you're out of options or a sci-fi fan... or better yet, rent GATTACA, that one is worth watching."

","What you will be handed is: A fresh spin on a dystopian-bound future featuring the concept of time--literally prolonging the expiration date of your life--replacing the value of money.<br/><br/>A good serving of drama; they don't just go all adrenaline on this concept. They focus on the reality of human struggle how there's almost no hope for the future if you're living on the edge of paycheck to paycheck. Or, on the other hand...what does life feel like when you're earning and freely enjoying all the coveted time and wealth in the world that the whole world is suffering over? Some moments in this movie will punch you cold-blooded and it hurts.<br/><br/>Great life-or-death situations. Since the clock is always ticking in this movie, the suspense never dies when someone's life is on the line and the suspense has been some of the most unnervingly close calls I have seen in a while. The accompanying action is decent, but nothing too impressive or never-before-seen.<br/><br/>Okay acting. Cillian Murphy and Vincent Kartheiser really had the best performances, the two leads were just okay, yet fell flat on an often basis.<br/><br/>A plot that can be steadier. The pacing works well, though the tone doesn't maintain it's level all the way through, it does in the beginning, but not the middle and end. Some humor is thrown in but it doesn't work well. Some scenes try to have that fun, pump-up-the-music bad-boy action style and that has no flow or belonging either.<br/><br/>A guarantee that you will do some of the thinking and drawing some of your own conclusions. Some motives/outcomes feel under-explained though. But most importantly, the writers didn't go through the hassle of explaining how the clock and all the complimentary commodities work with your body, but I commend them for skipping out on it. Don't worry about the past calculations, worry about the present effect. Go in preparing to accept a challenging concept, this is one for the thinkers.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a pretty solid sci-fi movie.

","This is another film trying to force-feed Marxist propaganda down our throats.<br/><br/>I imagine the creators of this film believed that the ""clever"" concept of time being using as currency relieved them of the need to concoct a decent story, or to at least be subtle about the political message they were trying to convey. They failed, and this movie is about as subtle as a train wreck. A child could see that by substituting the film's concept of time with money, this film was just a vehicle for the producer's message about money, capitalism, and the ""unequal distribution of wealth"". ""If all the time (cough, MONEY) was just divided equally, eeeeverything would be paradise""......oh, please.<br/><br/>Even if you don't care about, or agree with the film's political message, it is simply a bad movie.

","I have to admit, I had high hopes for this movie and wasn't completely disappointed. The basics, for those of you who don't like to read: <br/><br/>Interesting concept. Decent acting. Brilliant action sequences.<br/><br/>I'm sure a lot of us 70s geeks watched the trailer and had Logan's Run flashbacks, but I actually found a lot of this movie original. In a future where immortality is possible, very little has changed. ""In Time"" shows a world where time is currency and just like in our own lives-- where we never have enough money or time--many must suffer, so few can prosper. And if you have ever wondered at the human limit for digesting puns about time, this is a must see (we get it: word games make you clever!). <br/><br/>There's lot's of plot holes and un-sciencey stuff that I'm sure the sci- fi geeks have already picked a part, but ""In Time"" is a really good way to waste two hours of your life. If you can afford it. (Oh look, it's contagious.)<br/><br/>Like other reviewers have suggested, this movie was thinly veiled social commentary. Class warfare has taken to the big screens, and I hope no one in Occupy Wallstreet has the the cash to see it. The rich live forever, the poor die young and no one complains--supposedly, because those with time are greedy and those without it are stupid enough to think they have a shot at immortality. Apparently, only one world-weary immortal has the brains to put it together (but not the guts to do anything about it). <br/><br/>I really hope it was time constraints that made this movie so one- dimensional and filled with deterministic culture. (Where were the bleeding-heart liberal elites? The underground proletariat intelligentsia?) ""In Time"" might understand the injustices of a capitalist system, but it's failed to portray what we have always had in abundance: good intentions. <br/><br/>The acting was good, though not flawless. Somehow it's always surprising when pop-stars give passable performances, and Timberlake always does. Seyfried is adorable as the bored, over-protected socialite, but this role left no room for emotional depth like her parts in Big Love or Chloe. The leads' chemistry was awful and the romance left me cringing. Cillian Murphy stole every scene. Maybe it's because he played the only interesting character. He plays a justice-mad ""Time Keeper"", in charge of policing time thieves and anyone still naive enough to believe in upward mobility.<br/><br/>With wonderful world-building and a complete lack of depth, I'm sure this movie is begging for a franchise. And with a concept so beautiful, I really hope they get it."
"hotimpression7","9","4","10","1 November 2011"," Excellent Concept - Average Cast, WORTH WATCHING
","Every once in a while you come across with a movie/TV series where you feel that the story was weak the concept was stolen the idea was inspired by some other movie etc etc.... As I entered in the theater i was already 5mins late so I missed the opening however with in couple of minutes the movie got my full attention when I started to absorb the concept and the Laws of that concept. It struck me with in next 20 minutes that the concept is very original and I have not seen it in any other movie (and I've seen lots of movies). <br/><br/>CONCEPT: (Spoiler!!!) 1- Sometime in future; where Scientists have engineered Human body to 1) never to age & 2) never to die. However its has explained in the movie that the world is designed and meant by nature for people to come and go to keep the balance. hence to keep the world stable; the engineered humans have to be Time Bounded after age of 25 or so, where a DNA clock will tell how much time you have to live! and as you work, you will earn more time etc; and the cycle goes on! <br/><br/>2- Also what makes the concept more interesting is the fact that there is NO currency notes in this time and all the commodities are subject to TIME exchange between people & Entrepreneur. Stock Market(s) are running over the count of TIME available in the different zones. Also time can be exchanged between two humans with touch and twist of arms. which makes crime rate high as people kill each other even for few minutes of life time. <br/><br/>3- The world is divided into Zones where the upper zones' population are the RICHEST people having TIME up-to centuries on them. where the lower class people don't even have a week at given point. <br/><br/>STORY-LINE: The movie story is as follows (spoiler - (but not telling the climax)<br/><br/>Will Salas (Justin Tiberlake) is a working a$$ hard labor living in lower zone, fighting to LIVE forever on a daily basis with DNA clock having time not more than 1-2 days!!. He come across with this man Henry Hamilton ( played by Matt Bomer) who has been 25 years old for so long that he just don't want to live anymore!! before suicide he give a century to Will as gift and he commits suicide! <br/><br/>making story short! Will travels to higher zones by exchange years as fees given to him by henry as gift. Will is determined to take revenge from the upper classes' Playing gods who are controlling world and market for their own benefits and to live immortal life forever. Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) daughter of Philippe Weiss (Vincent Katheiser from Angel (tv series)) who is very powerful person and one of the richest and pioneer of Time system. she subsequently starts supporting Will's agenda to collapse this system. Her father controls TIME banks and have the first bar in safe having TIME of million which they want to steal and distribute to destroy/collapse the system.<br/><br/>However; the other side of movie is just amazing and add more thrill when TIME Inspector Raymond Leon (played by Cillian Murphy) who is so determine to justify his 50 years of service as protector of this system; chases Will & Sylvia to stop them and to arrest them at any cost! this chase has been thrilling thru out the movie! Raymond is almost of 100 years and knows all the in-s and out-s of zones and the TIME issues as well as the history of WILL and his Dead Father! which makes this chase more personal for both (Will and Raymond). Raymond keeps eye on the TIME allotments to all the zones in the country and any suspicious transfer of time between zones is highly unusual and rare.<br/><br/>One of the Thugs is played by Eric Balfour who is a gangster and a time stealer in the poor zone and also wants to catch Will as he rescued Henry that night who gave Will 100years as gift before he died. <br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>The over all CONCEPT of the MOVIE is JUST Amazing!!!!!! I enjoyed this movie so much! and the last one I remember enjoying this way, was Inception!. The movie is WORTH watching!<br/><br/>However you may or may not agree with me... I believe the Average star cast may have mellow the affect on the movie to become block buster of the year! i believe Angelina Jolie and Leonardo Dcaprio would be an excellent choices for this movie! or perhaps Tom Cruise (as we know he had been doing futuristic crime movies). butt the current star cast is also amazing and Justin Timberlake has acted just amazing! <br/><br/>overall I will give this movie 9/10 and perhaps watch it again!!!"

","Greetings again from the darkness. Now this is a terrific premise for a sci-fi story. You have surely heard the phrase: Time is Money. Well in this world, Time is not just money, it is Life itself. Time is everything ... and it's displayed for all to see via a neon green counter on everyone's forearm.<br/><br/>The film has an odd look. Vehicles look like modernized versions of 1970's classics, but fashion and other technology seems basically unchanged. Society is divided more severely than today. but the commentary is clear.<br/><br/>All people live until 25 at which time they stop aging and the clock starts. They are given ONE year and are free to earn, gamble or spend their time ... heck, some even gamble. When your clock hit Zero, you drop dead immediately. So, the working class is isolated in time zones, running from place to place and taking extra shifts at the plant to pay the rent. The rich live in Connecticut and try to find ways to leisurely spend their days that will never end.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake plays Will Salas, one of the poor ones. In a scene that will have you scratching your head, Olivia Wilde plays his mom (remember, you stop aging at 25). Will has a chance meeting with Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) who has lived more than 100 years and still has more than a century left. After a deep, philosophical conversation, Will ends up with Henry's time and is a suspect in his murder.<br/><br/>Will runs off to Connecticut and is pursued by the Timekeeper Police led by Cillian Murphy. Will ends up in the lavish home of Philippe Weiss (Vincent Katheiser from Mad Men) and falls for his daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried). They end up on the lam and turn into the ultimate Time Bandits ... Robin Hood who steals time from the rich and distributes to the poor.<br/><br/>While the premise is promising, some of the best stuff is left untouched. Henry Hamilton would have been a fascinating character to get a little more backstory on. Cillian Murphy's character is obviously talented and a bit burned out. It's a bit disconcerting to see most of the people in a movie to look all about the same age, but that's a very cool product of this society. As is the ""big board"" of time that looks eerily similar to the Stock Market boards we see that track movement every moment of the day. Time is precious and is of course watched over.<br/><br/>Writer/director Andrew Niccol also brought us Gattaca and Lord of War. I would have liked this one to go a bit deeper, but it's fun to watch Timberlake and Seyfried playing Bonnie and Clyde. Thinking about this from a monetary standpoint is pretty interesting, but it also reminds us that there's never enough time!"

At that time a green-glowing clock on their arms starts counting down Time - and when the Time gets to zero, you die. To get more Time you have to work in the factories. There is a wide gap between those who live day-to-day, earning just enough Time to get by, and those who live with thousands, even millions of years.<br/><br/>Will saves a man from getting killed because he is in the wrong part of town (Time zone) with too much ""Time on his hands"" (the movie is rife with these time-based clichés). The man, however, is really 150 years old and is ready to die. He gives his 105 remaining Tiime to will, and then publicly dies as his Time runs out. But not before revealing to Will that there is, in fact, plenty of Time to go around, if only those in high places would allow it.<br/><br/>The next day, Will's mother (Olivia Wilde ""House"") dies because her time runs out. This fills Will with a great resolve and he heads to the upper echelons of his world to find out how to set things right. He meets Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried ""Red Riding Hood"") who is the daughter of Time-millionaire Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser ""Mad Men""). Will kidnaps Sylvia and is then chased by Time-Keeper Leon (Cillian Murphy ""Tron: Legacy""). And we're off...<br/><br/>This movie starts out really strong and fritters away its opening, petering out into a confused ending. The concept of everyone aging only to 25 years is interesting. It also makes for a showcase of Hollywood's youngest and most exciting actors. The fact that people are constantly Timing-out makes for constant excitement as you have a multitude of ""ticking clocks"" running - so there should be lots of tension. And yet, the move drags awkwardly in several places. This movie seems like someone's great idea that simply didn't get thought through to completion.<br/><br/>(In fact, it could be someone else's idea as Harlen Ellison filed suit to have the movie held from release as it is similar to his short-story, """"Repent, Harlequin!"" Said the Ticktockman"" which concerns a dystopian future in which people have a set amount of time to live which can be revoked by a Timekeeper.)<br/><br/>The movie quickly devolves into a sort of ""Bonnie and Clyde"" story as Will and Amanda rip off Time-banks and give away the Time to the ""poor"". It's unclear exactly what Will's goal is in this film. He seems to want to have everyone share the wealth, and at the same time wants to destabilize the ""system"". But it isn't clear what the result of this stabilization would be and whether it is any better than the world he lives in.<br/><br/>All of this comes at a time in our history when the gap between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"" have never been wider. The movie paints the ""haves"" as oblivious and evil greedy meanies. They are so evil that they are non-characters. Rather, just cardboard cut-outs that are easy to take shots at. The movie seems to want to say that if the fat cats would just share, then everyone would be better off.<br/><br/>But the movie doesn't offer this reward. Instead, the result of all this Robin-Hood-like behavior is a rise in the cost of living. So the poor- cum-rich are now the poor again. There are even allusions to a reverse- Atlas-Shrugged as the workers stop working in the factories. Again, the results of this are not shared. If ""In Time"" was trying to make any sort of social commentary, it failed utterly.<br/><br/>The movie is nice to look at. Lots of pretty faces and taut bodies. Everyone seems to run everywhere in this universe. Will takes his shirt off and puts it on a lot. Amanda has nice bras to show off. The cars are cool yet understated. The green-glowing numbers are a cool effect. And yet, without a strong plot and a coherent set of goals for our heroes, I can only recommend you ""Don't waste your Time""."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","10","28 October 2011"," Lola and Clyde playing Robin Hood
","The best case of a young-looking old mother is in Gilbert and Sullivan's Iolanthe where the titular character, being a fairy, looks ""a maid of seventeen"" where she is in fact a 200-year-old mother of the hero. For looks, however, you can never beat Olivia Wilde who in this movie plays a 50-year-old mother to Will Salas (Justin Timberlake).<br/><br/>The rather ingenious plot perimeters of this science fiction are lucidly explained at the outset so that unlike in many other movies in this genre, the audience's mind is not led through a maze of twists and turns but rather left free to enjoy the story and action. Unexplained details are unimportant, and the clever souls labouring to pick plot holes are wasting their time and money.<br/><br/>It goes like this. In this brave new world everybody looks 25-years-old (and therefore Wilde can appear as gorgeous as she always is) although they may have already lived for a long, long time. The important thing is not how much time they have already had but how much is left, and this is clearly marked on your wrist in glowing digital numbers, which can in theory range from a million years (or more) to one second. The clock keeps running and when it shows zero, you drop dead. Nice and simple, isn't it? <br/><br/>But there's more and that's where the ingenuity comes in. Time serves a dual purpose, the other being the medium of exchange, i.e. currency. When you buy a burger at a fast food chain, you put your wrist against a device (they're all over the place) and they charge (i.e. take away from you) 6 days (or whatever). When you press your wrist against somebody else's, you are transferring time (which way it goes depends on which has the upper hand, literally). Again, nice and simple? But if you put the two together and ponder for a second, you see the ingenuity. Never in any fiction is poverty and death so closely linked – not through things like starvation or illness, but instant death when your clock winds down to zero. In the poor district in the movie, most people carry only a day or two's remaining time on their wrists and have to labour to refill it, or die. Never is ""living from day to day"" more literal. In one poker scene, the hero bets all he has, and watches his clock run down to 3, 2then 1 second when his life is saved in the nick of time when 100 years start pouring in upon his win.<br/><br/>Against this backdrop, however, is a familiar story.nay, several familiar stories. In essence, it starts as kidnapping a rich girl for ransom, continues through a predictable Stockholm Syndrome and ends up with Bonnie and Clyde playing Robin Hood. In form, it's ""Run Lola Run"" (1998) and it's an amazing sight to see rich girl Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) running in, what, 5-inch heels every 15 minutes throughout the movie. Here, she does not run alone though but with her dashingly handsome beau.<br/><br/>As the word ""chemistry"" has been so overused, let me just say that Timberlake and Seyfried look really well together (despite some disparity in height, hence perhaps the heels, even in running). The audience should well remember how with dashing charm and cocksure confidence Timberlake nailed the character flamboyant Sean Parker in ""The social network"" (2010). Seyfried moved on from sweet innocent Sophie in ""Mama Mia"" (2008) to challenging roles as titular ""Chloe"" (2009). They will both go far.<br/><br/>The other highlight in casting is Callian Murphy who, for movie lovers, needs no introduction. His character here as a ""Timekeeper"" is often misunderstood to be a villain. It has in fact been depicted sympathetically: a law enforcer who blindly follows his orders and living, unlike the poor, in a day-to-day existence through his daily ""per diem"". Reminds me of Javert in ""Les Miserables""."
"Polaris_DiB","7","3","7","4 November 2011"," Topical and blunt but people are still talking about the concept for a reason.
","The concept intrigued me immediately, as Niccol's concepts tend to do, and by now it is clear that audiences on this one are going to be divided in those who love the idea and those too turned off by the heavy-handedness of the message. The concept is time is money--literally. The message is that the rich 1% gain immortality off of the very brief and stressful lives of hundreds of thousands of poor. It's hard to watch this movie without Occupy Wall Street in mind.<br/><br/>Future generations removed from that context may have a lot more fun with it, in how the story is realized. Because it is in the way the characters think and deal with issues of time that this movie really flows, and Niccol handles it well. Phrases such as, ""Don't waste my time,"" ""We don't have time to just stand around,"" prostitutes: ""I'll give you ten minutes if you give me an hour,"" waitresses, ""You're not from around here, you're in too much of a hurry""... even stock quotes from movies rendered with a whole new meaning--that's where a lot of the beauty of this movie is.<br/><br/>Part of the issue is that Niccol didn't spend a whole lot of time on the type of background detail that would fill out an equivalent science fiction production like, say, _Soylent Green._ (I mean that pun about him not spending time, by the way. In places you can tell this movie's budget was spread really thin). Since there are no garbage men to pick up the bodies (say, for the pay of an hour per body), or traffic jam riots, or things like that, most of the realization of the concept of time is in the direct dialog and conflict of the characters. The dialog is a little audacious--in a way that's going to turn some audiences right off, whereas I think it was pretty wonderful, even in the places it got cheesy. There are a couple-few lines that are, however, completely groan-worthy: ""Do you even know HOW to drive?"" (Chicka, homeboy's just been driving for the last half-scene or so, so yes). Expect lines like those as fodder for those who couldn't stomach the more political ham-fistedness of the film.<br/><br/>Because, yeah, this movie is heavy-handed, in a way that is sort of disappointing considering Niccol's work on movies like Gattaca and The Truman Show. I think he gets kudos for embracing his concepts seriously, but could stand to work on his subtlety. So okay, Will's character and Weis' character are at opposing ends of the rich aristocrat social Darwinist/poor socially conscious hero dynamic. The two heroes are essentially Bonnie and Clyde in Logan's Run-land. That's fine. I think the biggest issue is that the ""system"" described isn't filled out enough for us to know how it's supposed to break down, and that the situations like the ""Minutemen"" and ""Timekeepers"" being entirely self-aware of their complicity in the system does not fit a verisimilitude with the mafias and police officers they stand in for.<br/><br/>Otherwise who cares? The movie still makes you think about things like whether the time you spend working is worth the time you gain from it, what the ""cost of living"" really is, and if the increased danger of death is worth the time saved by speeding--common-day questions rendered strictly of essence in this movie, showcased by common idioms turned significantly important to daily lives.<br/><br/>So all in all, good movie, potentially crippled by being a little too topical and a little less than subtle.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","On top of that the cinematography is just gorgeous to look at especially in digital theaters.

At the end of the movie I was so outraged for some reason because of how close to home the similarities were. <br/><br/>It's definitely a sociopolitical movie that doesn't pound you over the head with it. It just makes you see what's going on from an intelligent, inert and quite lyrical point of view.

"BlueCollarCritic","8","4","11","4 November 2011"," A great film that sadly many will not be able to follow
","IN TIME is a modern day spin on ROBIN HOOD in Orwells 1984. Director Andrew Niccol shows a future society in which literal time is the commodity of the age, used to pay for anything and everything. Want a cup of coffee, that will be 5 minutes; it was only 4 minutes just a few days ago.<br/><br/>IN TIME shows us just what our world might look like if everyone stopped aging at 25 and was able to live forever so long as they could afford it. For those with great wealth, time is a valued and guarded surplus; something to allow the lessers in society to have in small controllable amounts. For those in the ghetto who live day by day time is life and most would do anything get just a little more time.<br/><br/>While the acting is on par with what you'd expect there are a few let downs but mostly due to the direction of the character and not by any fault on the part of the actor. Cillian Murphy is awesome as a Timekeeper, the 'IN TIME' verse-esque equivalent of the current day detective. His job, to keep track of time and when necessary , re-posses it.<br/><br/>Justim Timberlak, the protagonist of the story does a wonderful job of portraying the ""live one day at a time"" Will Sallas. A 2 time 25 year old (will make sense when you seethe film) who lives life one day at a time literally. He also represents what we all would like to believe we would be if we were in his shoes, alway6s willing to give others a little more time, even those who would do harm.<br/><br/>In the end IN TIME makes one ask What is wealth? What is living? Do we miss life in the pursuit of wealth? Some will find IN TIME unbearable because its not the Mid-fall, mindless SciFi action flick they were hoping for. Others will find it offensive and preachy since the rich and wealthy are shown to be selfish and uncaring.<br/><br/>What IN TIME does, it does well and thats giving us a glimpse at just how precious time really is because in the real world you don;t know how much time you do have but you do know with certainty that you will not get any more if it so you better spend it wisely.<br/><br/>If your still in doubt about IN TIME then catch an early morning showing or the matinée and save your self a few bucks."
"TheMarwood","2","2","4","21 June 2014"," I smell a metaphor
","Class struggle is broken down into a simplistic metaphor that wouldn't tax the smarts of a 5 year old and just in case you missed the blunt force allegory you have plenty of visuals to remind you, such as a countdown clock on everyone's arm and time zones dividing the rich from the poor. Director Andrew Niccol takes an idea that isn't clever and is just high concept and wraps it up in a generic plot about taking down the system. Justin Timberlake who has already proved himself a more than competent actor, barely registers a pulse as our thinly written lead and Amanda Seyfried looks bored and annoyed to be apart of the production. For a society that doesn't age over 25, Cillian Murphy looks suspiciously 10 years older and Timberlake can barely pass as someone in their 20s. In Time does offer some very good unintended comedy, especially at the expense of Olivia Wilde's character running out of time and Timberlake being inexplicably blamed for killing and stealing the rich man's time who personally gave Timberlake his time, even though there's surveillance everywhere. This is a spectacularly stupid picture that entertains from collapsing under the weight of it's own clumsy premise. It's made by people who all should have known better and somehow even managed to attract cinematographer Roger Deakins who used In Time as his first foray into digital cinematography."

While people in the Greenwitch area can live for centuries.<br/><br/>The idea is a great idea for a movie but the execution is atrocious, Justin Timberlake should stick to music videos , his acting is stiff and he has about one face expression. The others actors are not much better except for the Cilian Murphy and Vincent Kartheisser who made an impression as respectively the incorruptible cop and the rich time mogul.<br/><br/>Given that the creators of the movie used a lot of time to set up an interesting universe with parallels to ours (lot of poor so a few rich can prosper...) The story is full of holes , why are time banks so easy to rob, the police (or timekeeper) so inefficient, the time ""armwrestling"" thing is just ridiculous...<br/><br/>The love story is not really believable or interesting for anyone but for the hormone induced teenagers who get a chance to watch Timberlake without a shirt on.<br/><br/>All in all the film is watchable but could have been much better with a better plot and better actors."

","In Time (2011) is one of the worst scifi films ever. The concept is interesting but not mind blowing: time is currency, which determines how much longer you live beyond 25 years old. The execution is dreadful. This is one of the few films that I had to stop watching because it was so awful; my partner lasted a bit longer than I did but dragged me along for that time. We quit about 2/3 to 3/4 of the way through. I regret seeing any more than the first 5 minutes. The acting was probably the best part, at least that of Timberlake, and I've loved Cillian Murphy in everything but this but he was still OK here. Script was derivative and predictable. Pacing and editing were mundane and too slow. Camera work was derivative and unimaginative. Female characters were mainly eye candy, and Amanda Seyfried brought nothing interesting to the character. I hated this movie so much that it might be worth 2/10 for the concept, but the execution put it in the negative zone. I resent having wasted my time on it.

","In Time (2011)<br/><br/>The idea here is clever on paper, but it's squandered and made ridiculous. <br/><br/>Here's a near future where everything is bought and sold in terms of the hours or minutes remaining in your life. Everyone is physically frozen at age 25, I guess at some kind of physical ideal. But most people are right at the end of their lives, literally, with just a few hours or days or sometimes seconds on their clocks, which are visible on their arms like glowing phosphorescent tattoos. Simple things like catching buses or getting paid for a day's work is sometimes down to a second or two. If your clock runs out, you're dead. You might think this is dramatic, cliffhangers after cliffhangers, but it's to contrived to work.<br/><br/>The writing is bland to the point of awkwardness. The big moments are timed (naturally) down to the second in a brinksmanship that is more silly than dramatic. There are shades of lots of dystopian movies, from ""Minority Report"" to ""Twelve Monkeys,"" and with maybe some ""Back to the Future"" with the retro-cool ""Men in Black"" edge. There are slicked out 60s cars and warmed over noir dialog. It's not supposed to be realist, of course, but it lacks some other kind of credibility to make you think any of it is reasonable even in its fictional world.<br/><br/>What's almost painful is the vision of this future where there are rich and poor and cops in black coats and bad guys in suits, that's fine. But the men are all hunks and the women traipse around in mini skirts and heels. All of them, all the time. Did I say dystopia? It's true that everyone is frozen at twenty-five years old, but youth is one thing and this thin, small minded cliché of a man's future world is thin at first and tiresome after the third scene.<br/><br/>You can see the influences here--call them references, homages--with some classic borrowed themes. Most of all, the two unlikely heroes, man and woman, end up being a futuristic Bonnie and Clyde on the run. It might seem entertaining. No, it IS entertaining, only if you don't give it too much credence. The light is terrific in a lot of scenes, and the photography is very fluid. The sets and scenery themselves are fun, lots of empty concrete bridges and night stuff and neon, and those beautiful big drainage canals in L.A..<br/><br/>It could have been terrific, but it's anything but timeless."

","You should know that this movie will never delve into deep psychological nor sociological studies. It will never satisfy anyone who wanted something deep and thoughtful. What is is, is an entertaining movie with a very good idea to back it up. While some may argue that Timberlake might not have been the best choice as lead actor, I think he does a good job with the role he has on hand here.<br/><br/>You also get Alex Pettyfer in a role that hints at him being more than a pretty face. Still not a real challenge of course, this may lead to more serious roles for the guy. While the film got quite a lot of momentum during the ""Occupy"" movement (you can see why, after you watched the movie), it will never be able to get close to movies like Blade Runner and others. But try not to judge it like that and you will have a good time watching this tension filled Sci-Fi Thriller."

","From the Director of sci-fi classic, Gattaca(1997), and The Truman Show(1998), Andrew Niccol creates a unique story about a world where everyone is genetically engineered to live only a year after their 25th birthday. Although the government controls the population, there is a way to live past 25. The way to do this is to do whatever you can to get enough currency to continue to live past that final year. What this does, is it creates a survival of the fittest, and only the strongest and smartest who can obtain enough currency to survive, leaving the weaker to stop living. Time has become the new currency, and if you become wealthy enough, you can theoretically become immortal. Niccol wrote a wonderful story, with an underlying tone of today's government, and how banks in our society today have way to much control and power, and ultimately credit is what has driven us to such lows. We live in a world where money controls everything, and if you have enough money, you can only get richer. I can definitely see this film becoming the topic of many essays in film classes, economic classes, and probably even some government courses. The film has a many messages throughout, for us to learn from.<br/><br/>Although some might say that the casting choices were not the best in the film, I believe that Justin Timberlake did a perfect job playing the main role in this film. He showed that he is worthy of playing serious roles, when he played Frankie in Alhpa Dog(2006), and he did a good job in Southland Tales(2006) as well. After seeing both of those movies, I figured he would be great in this film, and to my surprise he actually is improving; he has come a long way from the lead singer in Nsync. Another great actor is Cillian Murphy, who is what the film calls ""timekeepers"". He is in charge of making sure that all time is accounted for, and that no illegal time trading is going on. Although for me, Murphy always plays great villains, he does a good job of bringing his eeriness he has, and blends it well with this role.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the film was the use of the word immortal. There were a couple points in the film where a few characters had the chance to kill someone over how much time they had on their arm. The rich people with centuries on their arm, claim to be immortal and even tend to flaunt the fact that they are immortal. This makes no sense because the time on their arm, is simply how much time they have until their heart stops. That time has nothing do with the fact that you can still die from a stab wound, gunshot, etc. Everyone in the film is trying to get more time on their arm so they can feel immortal, but they can never be immortal, they are still human. Maybe I'm missing something here, but the scene where Will is holding the gun to Mr. Weis head, and he saying how he is immortal, Will should have just shot him right there, proving he is not immortal. I guess that was just the way the film shows that the rich people who had all the time in the world, were really blinded by the time on their arm. I guess they did this to compare to our society, where we are blinded by money constantly, when in reality we should just enjoy our daily lives, and not have to worry about money so much. Also the ending to me felt a little rushed, and seemed like nothing really got resolved. I don't want to spoil the ending here, but I feel like they could have come up with something a little more clever.<br/><br/>All in all, In Time is a fun sci-fi film that does not involve much thinking to watch. Still a great film to watch at least once, and I'll probably watch it again sometime down the road. If your on the fence about watching In Time, just give it a shot, its not to long either, just over 90 minutes, but I will say that this is not up to par with Niccol's other movies like The Truman Show(1998), or Gattaca(1997), in my opinion. <br/><br/>Rating: 5/10"
"Vartiainen","Null","2","4","17 January 2012"," Enjoyable style over substance
","This movie has a promising premise, if nothing else. The idea of using lifetime as currency has been done before, but it's still uncommon enough that the idea enough makes this movie intriguing. And at first the movie treats its premise well. The urban ghetto of those living one day at a time is portrayed well, making you to feel for its citizens. By the time the rich and immortals are introduced, you have begun to understand the blight of those less fortunate, which in turn causes you to side with them. There are some plot holes and questions about how such a economy can function and why don't the people rebel against it, but you'd need at least a full trilogy to fully delve into those questions, so I don't really blame this movie for not fully examining every little nuance about the world it tries to portray. It's full of stuff as it is.<br/><br/>So, the start is a promising one? So what goes wrong? Well, it stops examining the world and turns into an action film with car chases, gun battles, mooks, criminals and your basic Robin Hood wannabes. It's still not bad, per se, as most of the actors are rather enjoyable (Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried with those humongous eyes of hers were especially pleasant surprises), the cinematography and the score are both above average and the whole movie manages to look extremely stylish and easy on the eyes. But I would have liked to see more of this world. How it works? How it came to be? Why did it came to be? Some of those questions are hinted at, but never answered, while some of them are not even mentioned. I didn't expect the movie to answer all of the questions, but it should have tried to answer as many as it comfortably could. Now it stops way too early.<br/><br/>So, in the end, what did I think of the film? Well, it's intriguing and thought-provoking, yet it falls flat after the first third. It's well-made and enjoyable to watch, but it's also disappointing, there's no denying that. So... if you like scifi thrillers at all, you'll probably enjoy this one just fine. If you want an intellectual film, there's something here for you as well, but don't expect too much. And if you just want a good action film, I'd give this one a watch. It's entertaining all the way through, very much so in fact."

In today's world, are we anywhere even remotely within reach of the world depicted in ""In Time""?. No, hardly, but that does not suggest these exact questions have in fact been discussed quite seriously, in various academic and scientific circles.<br/><br/>So it was with this particular background that I wanted to see this film, to get a gander on what Hollywood would do with such a concept, extruded through the lens of early 21st century technopop culture.<br/><br/>Some aspects of the film were just plain silly, but that can be overlooked to a certain degree. Justin Timberlake does deliver his character well enough, but for me at least, Amanda Seyfried was the real sparkle in this production. <br/><br/>Was it entertaining? Yes indeed, I'll probably see it again with various comrades. Does it beckon some interesting questions? Yes it does, and that may be what makes this particular production so timely (please forgive the terrible pun). <br/><br/>The questions that have been raised in previous eras, encompassing the entire overarching arena of ethics in a biotech enhanced, genetically contrived reality preserved for the privileged few, the agony of overpopulation vs quality of life, ""genetic capitalism"" and so on, have been discussed many times, by very serious people.<br/><br/>But now, it is within some potential future timeline that the tools for crafting such a genotopia for privileged elite is actually being considered not as fiction, but rather as the next level of priceless possession, an outcome of artificially induced evolution as an acceptable ""norm"" in the eyes of some. I should know, having personally seen bits and pieces of this puzzle already being assembled.<br/><br/>If nothing else, if this entertainment platform inspires further thought into this realm, perhaps that is the real value of this film.<br/><br/>Even if all the potential viewer is looking for is an entertaining bit of fantasy filmcraft, I don't think many will be disappointed. As I said, I was initially more than a bit skeptical at first, this could have been much worse . . . but I will confess (perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure), it was quite fun to watch."

","Wealth is not a zero sum game. That's what every person in America should learn. Since the dawn of free market capitalism, for the first time in history we've seen people in the bottom 10% have mobility, so that they are not always in the bottom 10%. In fact, very few people stay in the same wealth bracket their whole lives. Tax statics prove this.<br/><br/>Robin Hood robbing from the rich to give to the poor, sure it all sounds great...as if the rich are only rich because they steal from the poor, and the poor are only poor because the rich steal from them. That's why we evolved away from the economic systems of the 11th century.<br/><br/>The movie Wisdom with Emilio Estevez and Demi Moore was the exact same movie - bank robbers helping out poor farmers. Unfortunately, it doesn't do anything to solve problems, only fight them and postpone the inevitable. But in America, there is no cabal of rich people wearing suits and ties who wish to keep poor people poor. The best way out of poverty is finish school, get a job, and don't have a baby before marriage."

This does make it feel more timeless, no pun intended, which aids the screenplay's obvious attempts at being a parable like i said. It's understandable why they did it, but something visceral was lost in achieving something cerebral and sorry brah, this is a Hollywood thriller. That don't fly. This would probably explain why the film did not do as well as expected.<br/><br/>In Time has decent if muted performances, fantastic cinematography and storytelling that is kind of hollow given the premise. It fits perfectly within the niche of a low key Hollywood sci-fi thriller."

","Now hold on. This is supposed to be sci-fi, but instead of futuristic computer generated images what you get is cars, clothes and buildings made no later than the 1970´s or the early 1980´s at latest. The film takes place in 23rd century so what do we see here? In all likelihood this is what the writer-director Andrew Niccol had in mind. While taking place in the future, the entire film is made as if it was made way back in the past. Shot digitally it doesn´t look it. Slightly grainy look and reddish-brown, sometimes bluish coloration is just as if the whole thing had been shot in the early or mid seventies 16 or 35 mm film now aged and discolored. Same goes for editing, camera angles, the chase scenes, acting style and so on as well. The clothes, furniture and even the cups the characters drink from are from the sixties. Significantly there are no computers, no electronic devices hand-held or otherwise and no electronic displays of any kind in the film. The exceptions are the silly fluorescent remaining lifetime displays everyone has on their arms. The cars are supposedly souped-up with electrical engines but they sound more like the electrical toy cars of the sixties. Stylistically, if this was a film from the early seventies by say Kubrick of the Clockwork Orange period or Michael Crichton of the Andromeda Strain period, the only unusual aspect would be the novel basic idea of using remaining lifetime used as currency instead of money. In 2011 terms the plot may be simplistic at times but in 1971 the whole thing would have been really far out, man, cutting edge sci-fi. Obvious homage is being paid to Arthur Penn´s Bonnie and Clyde, the major film of the period about people on borrowed time. I thoroughly enjoyed my two-way time trip and the core matter of the plot, thought-provoking, utterly brutal economics of time running out, more deadly than money. A good reminder of one´s mortality, too, and that is more than most films have to offer. A satisfying film for a long-time movie freak but I do understand that it would be baffling for the uninitiated who see the dots but do not register the connections."

"MihaiSorinToma","8","0","0","5 October 2017"," An unique idea
","This movie presents us a world in which money no longer exist. Instead, they have been replaced with time itself. People are genetically engineered to stop aging at 25 after which they get another year. This, of course, means that poor people have very short lives and rich people can live forever. In this world, Will struggles to live day after day, being supported only by his mother. After she dies and he gets over a century from a person who wanted to die, he decides to take revenge on the system. Shortly after, he finds Sylvia, daughter of a very rich person who hasn't enjoyed a single day of her life. She elects to betray her father, and join Will on his quest, but things aren't going to be very easy as The Timekeeper and local mafia are on their tail.<br/><br/>The whole concept is quite interesting although I have my doubts on how such a system could have been implemented when stealing or giving time is so simple. In some aspects, it's similar to ""Robin Hood"" but you don't end up feeling anything for the characters, which is a bit disappointing. Its plot is good but unfortunately too linear and has some flaws which can be spotted if you pay some attention to details. Overall, I can say it's a good movie but its rating has one or two points added just because of its action and its idea of time replacing money."

","In a future dystopia where people are genetically manipulated to not get older than 25, the currency is units of time, where literally ""time is money"". From the age of 25 people have to work to gain more lifetime or risk their time coming to an end, that is, dying. This means that the rich can live virtually eternally while the poor have to do whatever they can to earn just a few more hours of life.<br/><br/>The concept is interesting but poorly explored, because the film focuses more on action than on the philosophical and socio-cultural implications of the system, and of course, there are some flaws in the plot: why are there no mobile phones? How does someone who spends most of the day working in a factory his so proficient at martial arts? Being the currency a digital watch embedded in the arm, why is there no crypto-mechanism that prevents people from being so easily stolen from their time? And a few more things that only seen because it's hard to put it in words. Interesting concept barely delivered but good action entertainment with Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried and Cillian Murphy."

"The-Revenant-of-IMDb","7","0","0","11 January 2017"," Fun, flawed sci-fi flick
","The cast is pretty surprising. I've only seen ""JT"" in Black Snake Moan, but I thought he was adequate in this film. His acting skill might have been deficient with a heavier script, but that is another problem I had with the film. Amanda Seyfried is a hottie here before her Les Miserables fame, and her character was a cliché, but portrayed well. Again, the script I think failed to demonstrate her motivation and attitude change, but she did good with what she had. She and JT actually run a lot in this film and that kept me excited.<br/><br/>The action is good, no doubt. Cillian Murphy was the biggest surprise; I liked his character the most and his motivations. Lastly, Vincent Kartheiser I am fond of for his work in Larry Clark's Another Day in Paradise and he looks a lot like his Mad Men character, but his boyish face works.<br/><br/>The script: What did the father of ""Will Solace"" do as the Timekeeper (Cillian Murphy in a remarkable performance) alludes to? This felt unexplored to me. Nice symbolism with Will Salas (sp?), which I suppose plays to the theme of time and no rest for the wicked.<br/><br/>I felt there were some contrivances and unexplained ""BAMF"" moments like when JT outsmarts a room full of armed thugs or when he escapes the mansion in the beginning, or how they get through all the time-zone barriers after the escape, since the movie showed the process not being so easy and quite costly the first time and why JT runs his time down and I feel like most of the script wasn't fleshed out enough, and if elaborated would have made for a more satisfying experience. Most fans from what I gather like the concept more.<br/><br/>I would agree with that, but I did like the film a bit more, so I will be buying the Blu ray for my collection as it seems to have nice replay value for the creativity and brisk pace. The concept was neat, yet I would say I was bothered more by it than the film itself. Not much detail is given to why these people are being genetically engineered (cloning?) or why society has reached that point.<br/><br/>There is also a lack of cohesion with how the ""time is life"" system works. Is it just a visual aid for the viewer? I think not, since these people can physically see the timers on their arms, but maybe it is still just a metaphor? E.g. the rich and powerful have all the time they want, the poor and meek more of a struggle? Other minor issues like the time-arm-wrestling were vague and the actual process of how people exchange time. Sometimes people seem calm and mentally processing the transfers, like when JT gives his buddy ten years of time, but sometimes seem anxious to make sure the other person doesn't take too much time during the exchange.<br/><br/>The pacing: The run-time of the film is pretty short, and the pacing is a bit problematic for me. It makes sense to be quick-paced, but scene after scene felt robbed to me of tension and character development because one minute the protagonists are relaxed, the next on the run. Terminator I felt did much better, and this is no Terminator, but just an example of how you can keep tension and balance quick and slow moments better. The two lovebirds don't even get a proper love scene or any real relational development. One scene he's holding her at gunpoint, the next she's digging him. Like I mentioned, Seyfried isn't given much to work with then and I wondered why she would not make a break for it from this fellow. Overall, this movie was too short.<br/><br/>The themes: Robin Hood, poor vs rich, etc. It was interesting, and another reason why the movie should've been longer. The ending feels insignificant. This might just be a political message by Niccol, but all the more reason to keep it going. The ending felt very ""sequel-y"" to me, similar to the sci-fi flick 'Push.' The more worthwhile theme that is handled better was the aspect of time and vanity, how people get cosmetic surgery, are always in a rush, like old Brooks complains about in The Shawshank Redemption, and how the rich would ironically value time and wealth so much that they miss out on what it means to ""truly"" live and take some time to enjoy the world.<br/><br/>Production design: The guns and costumes are pretty neat. I think I saw some AUG rifles. Murphy's coat was cool, his car design too, almost Knight Rider-esque, and was that a Shelby Cobra? Not sure, very 007-looking. The scenery/locations are perfect for the movie, being LA and whatnot. The mansion scene is on-point, and the costumes were pretty dapper. Seyfried's outfits looked nice, but that was another issue too: Where was she getting these clothes? There seems to have maybe been some deleted scenes showing these in-between moments.<br/><br/>I'm interest in the Blu-ray version because I rented the standard definition, so wondering if the movie looks better and if I'll be able to see the color better. Nothing wowed me with the cinematography, but there wasn't too much ""shaky cam"" and nice overhead shots if I recall and a good chase scene.<br/><br/>Better than it was bad. I was thinking a 6, but this movie is fun and surprisingly substantial. Check it out if you're a sci-fi fan. I hear that Niccol took a lot of inspiration from other films, which might bother sci-fi fans as did Oblivion. I would say this is not nearly as good as Oblivion which I gave an 8/10 but it's still not bad. I was surprised that it was not a comic book."

","In Time (2011): Dir: Andrew Niccol / Cast: Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, Cillian Murphy, Olivia Wilde, Alex Pettyfer: Futuristic film about perception and reality. It presents a fictional account where everyone has a thirteen digit figure on their arm that indicates their lifespan. Everything costs so when anyone travels or makes a purchase and it subtracts digits or time off their life. This becomes tragic when the hero's mother dies when her time runs to zero seconds before he can rejuvenate it. The concept is interesting but the structure is reduced to a chase where the hero is on the run with the daughter of a rich tycoon who holds several outlets for lifespans. We know that they will grow close while the pursuing timekeeper sees it as a kidnapping. The ending carries a reference to Robin Hood but in a more honest and noble way. Directed by Andrew Niccol whose Gattaca is somewhat similar in its futuristic viewpoints, as well as containing similar visual style. Justin Timberlake holds strong as the hero who is given a century lifespan from someone he saves from certain death, and uses it to bring greater hope to others. Amanda Seyfried plays the daughter of his wealthy target who ends up a fugitive with Timberlake. Cillian Murphy plays the timekeeper who is subjected to generosity before bringing his own end. Olivia Wilde plays Timberlake's mother who remains young in appearance thanks to the digits. Alex Pettyfer heads a gang who is hunting them down, which will lead to a duel to the death. It presents an interesting view of surveying the quality of life. Score: 8 / 10"

","This movie starts from a new and fascinating idea: a world where there's no currency but time. If you want to learn more about the plot, read the summary above. The only thing I'm going to tell you is that, according to me, focusing on time (like this movie does) is very interesting: in our contemporary world what seems never to be enough is not just money but also time. We always think that things would be better if we had more time... and so time becomes a sort of challenge, sometimes even an enemy. It's something so huge and mysterious! Making a movie by focusing on this aspect of human life is a very nice idea, even though the movie could have been deeper in developing this theme and the characters. Unlike Inception, for example, there's not a clear message left by the story; and the characters are less developed (for example, why does the timekeeper behave like this? What does he earn from his job? Why should he want time to be distributed in such parts?). And this movie doesn't let many questions arise either (again, unlike Inception). However, despite this pity, I recommend it: a great idea should always be praised."

A persons age, or the time they have to live, becomes transferable, which can then be used to purchase life's essentials. No one can live past 26, that is unless they can get extra time, either legally or illegally. The rich of course, don't have the problems poorer people do and live in a different 'time zone'. Thats where the question, can someone poor escape their existence, is pondered! I won't add more, as it may spoil your viewing.<br/><br/>There is some fine acting from the cast in the movie, but unfortunately that doesn't include the lead.

They have to pay for everything using time out of their own life. They have a countdown timer on their arm which shows how much time they have left. Go to work, earn some hours, need some food, spend some hours.

","The movie explicitly portrays, through a critical view of society we live in today, the holocaust of the monetary system through segregation between rich and poor.<br/><br/>It's a portrayal of present days disguised as a futuristic vision of science fiction to soften the terrible impact on ourselves.<br/><br/>It's a masterpiece!<br/><br/>The capitalist system based on currency distorts all values of our society ​​based on a feudal socio-political system wrapped in wars for natural resources.<br/><br/>The logic behind this system adjusts prices according to supply and demand, just the smaller the supply, the higher the price. This mechanism encourages the industry to produce less for get more profit, producing scarcity. This is the reason behind the whole populations die of hunger in underdeveloped countries.<br/><br/>In advanced stage that are the science and technology, is perfectly possible to reverse this situation with robots and industrial automation and, instead of producing scarcity, producing abundance, supplying all the essential needs of human life on the planet.<br/><br/>The term ""economy"" would not be appropriate for the capitalist system because it gives the connotation that it is efficient. This is all that our current system is not.<br/><br/>Today, we're wasting drinking water and food like never before in history, and when marketing and advertising does not induces us to consumerism, discarding smart phones with only six months of use, the industry imposes us on the concept of ""planned obsolescence"" where products deteriorate and stop functioning and we are forced to replace them. Only then can the capitalist system ensure ""economic growth"". Through the wasting, not the economy.<br/><br/>The solution lies in a RBE - Resource-Based Economy, where the efficiency of the productive system is ensured by industrial automation through robotics without wasting the planet's natural resources. As the cost of production tends to zero, there is no more need for money because there will be no more none monetary system and the right to life is guaranteed by producing in abundance. Free access to university education for all is guaranteed. The population has free access to the Internet and possessing digital certificates, permits a political system without representatives, where we practice direct democracy, voting on the directions taken by our society through referendum and plebiscites.<br/><br/>To learn more about a positive futuristic vision for our society seek on the Internet by The Zeitgeist Movement."

","(56%) An outrageously plotted action flick that pushes even the boundaries sci- fi. In the future time has replaced currency, which is actually a good analogy for the capitalist system which has fooled millions of people and turned the pursuit of profit and ownership as life's most important asset rather than the much more valuable, and never retrievable passing of time. But I think they may have pushed things a little too far here in regards to people living almost forever if they are wealthy enough, as it's never explained how that's possible, coupled with the fact that people don't age after 25 which further adds to this mystery future ability that everyone is born with. The somewhat crazy plot aside, and the fact that time is added and taken away from the main characters almost constantly to distracting levels, this isn't a bad movie. It's fairly entertaining and well made, but it's really not a must watch."

The details are also incorporated quite seamlessly into the story; it makes quite difficult to follow on this movie if you watch it from half way or later. Yet the execution in the acting parts is not the satisfactory. For me honestly, the lead role should be given to anyone other than Justin Timberlake. He acts just below okay for this movie. Not that it's a bad acting, but with a great concept like this, it should be played by someone else with a better reputation for a sci-fi. Amanda Seyfried also didn't give a good performance here. Her use of facial expression is dominantly flat. Cillian Murphy and Olivia Wilde, on the other hand, id a very nice acting job to make this movie feel alive."

","In Time, a film set in the near future where the currency has been replaced with time. I didn't expect much from this film as seeing the posters with the leading actors didn't aspire much confidence. After watching the film, elements of the film did surprise me but some of it was disappointing as expected.<br/><br/>Andrew Niccol is a director who also writes his films. His films are at times a hit or miss but most of them are creative and imaginative, which is something I get excited for when I come into his films. What held my interest in this film is the concept of the currency of time and how it has divided the world to the rich and the poor. This idea, to me at least, is brilliant as it allows Niccol to create tension as time becomes more precious than ever. The first half an hour of the film, dealing with the life of the common man in the ghetto is so fascinating that if the film stuck with this direction then I would have appreciated the film much more. There is a particular scene involving Timberlake and Wilde which was one of the strongest moments of this film, the tension was high and it put me on the edge of my seat hoping. There is a storyline in this film about Will Salas' father and it just felt a little too forced and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Niccol's direction is an area where he has let me down. Niccol has changed the tone and direction of the film within 30 minutes of the film. It starts of as a day in the life of the common people using Timberlake's character as the example, making the film feel like a survival film with the villain being time. The film then changes it's direction to a Bonnie and Clyde mixed with a Robin Hood agenda, which is also interesting but suited for a sequel or a separate film of it's own. Also the climax is very similar to a moment that happened earlier in the film but the earlier sequence was executed with more flourish than the ending which was very disappointing. If Niccol just stuck with the tone of the first half hour then this would be much more appreciated from me.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if the budget has set the picture back but I felt the visuals was lacking, in the rich time zone in particular. This would have been a visually spectacular film, even the ghetto doesn't look very frightening. In Time has a setting that is very similar to a film like The Hunger Games, and yet Gary Ross was able to vision a beautiful and advanced city.<br/><br/>Oh Roger Deakins, why couldn't you make this film look spectacular. Deakins has done the cinematography of many films that I love but yet here, it feels like he's not even trying. Not sure if Niccol's vision held Deakins back but this film feels so generic and bland that it brings the film down. Dialogue driven scenes where characters are just inside a small room, Deakins at least get some great shots like for example when Timberlake and Bomer were sitting alone in a room with the light coming in from the window, sharing each other's lives.<br/><br/>Craig Armstrong's score was blended in within the scenes and doesn't become a force of it's own. As I watched the film, I didn't notice a lot of his score as I was too fascinated with the concept of the film and the life of the citizens in the ghetto.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is sub par and some casting choices were poor. Timberlake is the main example of poor casting as I felt he is too attractive and distracting. The chemistry between Timberlake and Seyfried was fine but Seyfried, being the better actor, shows more of her skills than her partner. When the partner in crime scenes started to roll, their chemistry became a little better. The supporting cast was also good in their roles, in particular Murphy and Kartheriser. Murphy can play a decent villain but the film's script, being filled with one-liners, makes him seem a little corny at times. Kartheiser is a great actor, I particularly enjoy his work in Mad Men and he pretty much plays almost the same person here. His acting feels classy and smooth, which makes his role entertaining to watch. Olivia Wilde and Timberlake had decent chemistry but I think it would have been a little more effective if they replaced Timberlake with a stronger emotional core.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is exciting and has ambition to become a sci-fi masterpiece but it is held back by Niccol's jagged direction, boring production design, and sub par chemistry between the leads. It is still worth a watch for the idea alone as it is a fresh take on the sci-fi genre and also the film's setting feels more relatable to the current conditions of our economy."

","A study on The World Distribution of Household Wealth by the Helsinki-based World Institute for Development Economics Research of the United Nations University from 2006 showed that 2% of world population hold more than 50% of global wealth. The inequality is staggering, but most of the people really don't think that much about it. But what if the wealth was measured by the years, months, days, hours, even minutes of our lives? It's an interesting idea examined by Andrew Niccol in his latest movie ""In Time"". In the movie, people are genetically engineered to stop aging at 25 and get one more year after that. But the time they get is also a currency. They have to work to get it more and pay bills with it. Of course, some things always remain the same, so there's small number of people who can practically live forever and a large number of those who don't know if they'll survive another day. It should be noted that the exchange of time between two people is fairly easy. They simply hold each other's forearms and the time flows from one to the other. The direction of the flow depends on whose forearm is up and whose down. It's obvious that it makes stealing a lot easier so the rich ones need even greater protection than they need in this world. So the world (we see only north America but it's safe to assume it applies to the whole world) is divided in time zones, from the ghettos to the zones where the ""immortals"" live. Traveling between zones isn't illegal but is extremely rare. Every zone has its border and the price you have to pay to enter and there aren't many who can afford it, and the rich ones don't travel but live in the safety of their time zone. Different currency asks for different control system and so we're introduced to the Timekeepers, some sort of police whose job is to keep track of time and make sure each time zone has the assigned amount of time. (Now thinking about it, definitely not the job for the White Rabbit.) <br/><br/>The movie follows Will Salas, a young man from the ghetto whose father was a sort of local Robin Hood, winning time in fights and distributing it to the poor. One evening Will has a chance encounter with Henry Hamilton, a man who came from New Greenwich, the city of rich people, with more than a hundred years on his clock. Henry thinks no one should live forever so he transfers his time to Will and goes on to time himself out, that is - kill himself. Will wakes up with more time that he could dream of and that's when things start to happen fast. After he fails to save his mother in a scene which is a pain to watch (seriously, it's the lowest point of the movie), he decides to take on the big guys and goes to New Greenwich. But the death of Henry Hamilton has been uncovered and Will is caught on security tape so the Timekeepers, led by enigmatic Raymond Leon, start sniffing on his trail. They find him in the house of Philippe Weis, one of the richest people in the world, but he manages to escape by holding hostage Philippe's spoiled daughter Sylvia. After that, not long is needed for Sylvia to realize who is the good guy and join Will in his quest to steal from rich and distribute to poor.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is very interesting. As I already pointed out, and as anyone who thinks a little about it can notice, it reflects the current situation in real world, but with a twist. The idea of paying bills and buying stuff with time makes you think about all sorts of things. Would people be more careful with their spending? Would they take more care of the quality of their time? Those kind of questions and all other thought directions that the premise opens are the best thing about this movie. The rest unfortunately isn't on par but it isn't that bad either. The greatest flaws are in the script. Some scenes are overly melodramatic, a lot of the dialogue is clichéd and predictable and the characters are overly simplified (with the exception of timekeeper Leon). Fortunately, in most scenes the acting makes it bearable. The movie benefits from strong performances by Justin Timberlake as Will Salas and Cillian Murphy as Raymond Leon, but the rest of the cast isn't that far behind either. I must point out Amanda Seyfried as Sylvia Weis, who maybe had better performances (""Chloe""), but never looked as stunning as she does here. Credits for that must also be given to Colleen Atwood, a multiple Oscar winner costume designer, as well as to all the crew from makeup department who've done a great job.<br/><br/>It's a good movie, but it could've been better. I'll never get over the fact Niccol left such an interesting character as Raymond Leon so underused and didn't let us in on his past. On the other hand, it has a thought provoking theme and it's fun to watch, which is a rare combination nowadays, so my recommendation would be to watch it. That is, if you have any spare time...<br/><br/>http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/"

","To start, In Time's idea is a good one it's original and cool. However,the film which could have been amazing ended up being good. Not bad but not fantastic. The plot is interesting enough and the action scenes are well done but the cast just doesn't seem to fit. Justin Timberlake gives a decent performance but at times his character just felt empty to me. Murphy does well as the bad guy but it's not the best performance I've seen. Amanda Seyfried is OK but didn't fit with Justin Timberlake as a couple. The film wasn't that suspenseful and some parts where boring. However, the ending was good and I liked the characters more then I did at first. What it lacked in cast it made up for in plot, action, and setting. I would definitely watch this again or suggest it to others who like imaginative sci-fi films."

","for this to work. In this movie, once a person turns 25, a clock starts on their arm, and that is how much time they have left. There is no money only time. You buy everything with time, from coffee to paying your rent.<br/><br/>Will, from the ghetto, meets a suicidal guy that has a century. The guy gives Will his time before killing himself. Will is angry because his mom timed out and he wants to make things more fair. So he goes to new grenwich, which costs a lot of time to get there. By this time, the time police are after him because they think he killed the guy whom gave him his time. Will wins big at poker and is invited to a rich guy's house where he hooks up with his daughter, Sylvia. The cops burst in and he takes Sylvia on the lam with him.<br/><br/>So the rest of the movie, the two become sort of like robin hood, stealing time and giving to the poor. I guess the big suspense is will they get caught or run out of time? <br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: OK, but there are always too many plot holes with sci-fi movies. Like where were all the cell phones, and why did the cop cars look like drag racers from the 70s. Anyways, I recommend it for a mindless popcorn flick."
"SeethingSage","4","0","0","16 July 2012"," Sort of like Gattaca rebooted, but nowhere near as good
","NO SPOILERS IN FIRST SECTION.<br/><br/>When I first saw the previews for this film, I thought the premise was interesting. But I was afraid the idea wouldn't be fleshed out and would end up being shallow. So I waited for the inevitable cable release before watching it. Unfortunately, my first impressions turned out to be correct. Sci-Fi and Fantasy revolves around the suspension of disbelief. In a good movie, this happens for the viewer without much conscious thought as the ""rules"" of the universe are set forth through the telling of the story. But throughout this film I kept having to mentally will myself not to think too hard about the lack of background for the story. If you're the type of person who watches a movie and you can't help thinking ""the characters wouldn't DO that in that situation"" or ""if X thing is possible in this future setting, then why would Y still be an issue,"" then I wouldn't recommend that you watch it.<br/><br/>The movie ended up reminding me a lot of Gattaca - except Gattaca was much better. It wasn't until reading another review that I realized that the same writer did both. That makes a lot of sense in hindsight! Well, re-hashing of ideas happens all of the time. This can be easily forgiven if the execution and presentation is good/dynamic. But this simply wasn't.<br/><br/>Here are a few other non-spoiler tidbits. Justin Timberlake was so-so in the movie. Amanda Seyfried is pure captivating eye candy, especially with red hair. She was one of the few tiny bright spots. But she wasn't given much to work with. None of the characters in the movie were very deep at all, so it was hard to empathize with their plight or their motivations.<br/><br/>SMALL SEMI-SPOILERS BELOW!!!<br/><br/>To expand on the generalizations I made above, here are a few things I kept thinking as I watched In Time.<br/><br/>There was almost NO background as to how/when/why the entire finite body-time mechanism came about. The level of genetic engineering that would be required to have a in-body time system functioning like that is astounding. With a simple thought and contact with the skin, people transferred exact seconds, minutes, days, etc. YET, there are zero safeguards built in to such a sophisticated system? I can see if someone is holding a gun to your head and makes you consciously transfer over your time. But they can just take it when you're asleep, with no effort? People can take it against your will, making it tick off your last digits and your conscious thought can't stop it even knowing you'll die in a couple of seconds if you don't? You'd also think that the time would be tagged somehow at the nano level, where at least law enforcement would know where the time came from. I mean, they have giant display screens that show them exactly how much time is in each zone. Basically, there were so many things that would require such a high level of technology to even make work at all, and yet there we so many other things that were super primitive even by today's standard of technology. The movie just wasn't consistent with things like that at all in my opinion. It didn't even try to offer any sort of explanations for those things either so I could attempt to keep my disbelief suspended.<br/><br/>Police cars straight out of the 70's eh? Security cameras and handguns that wouldn't be out of place today. But perfectly controlling the human aging process so you are 100% natural until the precise instant you turn 25 and then you freeze there FOREVER, no problem. Glowing bio-luminescent numbers on your arm that you could control with a mere thought and whose ending up on all zeroes INSTANTLY makes all of your bodily functions cease, sure thing. Bah, it just didn't mix or work well at all."

","How do you get a society completely ignorant of social injustice- at best, or enabling cheerleaders of it- at worst, to become aware? Perhaps by presenting an allegory of it. A society where money has been replaced by time. If time is money, then money is also time. In In Time, time is the new currency. Your work is paid in units of time. You pay for things in time units you have earned. If you run out of time, you die.<br/><br/>Just as in real life, in this movie, society is divided into classes, the haves and the have-nots. Those who don't have time are constantly facing death, having to fight for it, borrow it, steal it, pawn things for it. The ""rich"" have centuries to live, without aging past 25. They have so much time, they have nothing to do with it. They live leisurely, while those who come ""from time"" are constantly in a hurry, a life racing against the clock implanted in their arms. The poor are convinced that there isn't enough time to go around. Those who basically live in eternity, the bankers of time, so to speak, have rigged the system and allow only breadcrumbs of time to make it to the poor areas, while in reality, there is so much time, no one needs to die. They also constantly toy with the ""price"" of things so that the poor are always on the brink of dying. It's a world of hyperinflation, where prices double from one day to the next for no good reason- not unlike gas prices in our world.<br/><br/>Salas, our main character is from the lower class and lives with his mother. On the day of her birthday he wants to meet her after work but she runs out of time and dies. Salas then meets someone who has more than a century to live. He reveals to him the secrets of their world- the corruption of society that convinces them of the lie that they live in a zero-sum game, that for someone to get time, someone else has to lose it. Before he commits suicide, he gives Salas all his time, who then goes to the rich time zone. But he is pursued by law enforcement- the time keepers who ensure that not too much time escapes into the poor areas.<br/><br/>Unfortunately from there, In Time turns into something of a Robin-Hood type action movie, where Salas converts a rich girl into joining him in his fight against the evil time plutocrats (chronocrats?) and against the time keepers who are always on their tail.<br/><br/>In Time looks pretty neat, stylish and bleak. The cars are spectacular, combining classic design with futuristic features. Performances all around are OK. But it's the script that shines. It's astonishing how much our language uses the word ""time"" and once time becomes the currency, many common phrases take on a startling meaning. The premise is quite brilliant. It translates injustice and makes it so much more poignant, these days that we are downright anesthetized to the sickening corruption of banks and financial institutions."

","After many year reading IMDb reviews this is the first time I actually signed up - to register my disagreement with the majority on this film. During the first 20 mins or so I thought the premise for this film was plain silly. But I stuck with it (I was on a plane, jumping out was the other main option) and once the parallel with wealth had fully sunk in I started to really enjoy this film. Being old, I had heard of Justin Timberlake and thought he was some kind of boy band waster, but he was excellent. The film was full of power and warmth. Maybe I was swayed by watching The Zeitgeist Movie a couple of weeks earlier but the message was delivered brilliantly and I thoroughly enjoyed this! Will be recommending to like minded friends."

","In Time is based on a futuristic world where time has now become the new currency and people stop aging at 25 years old and have only one year to live and are required to earn ""time"" by working or die young.<br/><br/>The movie begins with 28 year old Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) and his mom Rachel Salas (Olivia Wilde) making plans to celebrate her 50th birthday; they live in the ghetto and barely make it from day to day. Will has a chance meeting with a New Greenwich (the wealthy town) resident 105-year-old Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) who is tired of living. He explains to Will that there is enough life for everyone to live a long life and that human are not meant to be immortal. Henry gives Will 116 years of time and ""times himself out"". Will becomes prime suspect in the murder of Henry and makes his way to New Greenwich where he is followed by the Timekeeper aka the police, Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) and his crew. Will meets time-loaning businessman Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser) and his daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) at a casino and is invited to Philippe's home, Will is then captured by the timekeepers, and he escapes and kidnaps Sylvia in the process.<br/><br/>The main theme of the movie is about getting equality for all no matter where you come from or where you live. Will was also on a mission of revenge he wanted the rich people to pay for his mom's death, Rachel died just seconds before Will was able to transfer some of his time to her. The people who controlled time made sure that the rich had lots of time by constantly increasing the cost of living in the ghetto to ensure that lots of people died. You see this as Will and his new partner Sylvia set out to upset the time zones by robbing mostly Philippe's Time Banks and giving away the time to needy people. Their efforts while appreciated seem unproductive because the cost of living keeps rising. Will and Sylvia however did not give up even with the constant threat of Raymond on their trail. Sylvia came up with a new plan to put a huge dent in the time zone; they steal one million years of time from Philippe.<br/><br/>The acting was somewhat mediocre. Timberlake and Wilde give a believable performance, however Seyfried performance was not as strong as it could have been. The theme of the movie was in reminiscent of Robin Hood Prince of thieves where the star Robin Hood robs from the rich and gives to the poor.<br/><br/>The lighting throughout the film was dismal adding to the suspense of the movie. The effects of the time clock on each persons' hand even babies that lit up when they were alive and go out when they died added to the importance of the theme it showed clearly who was privileged and who were not. The actors overall do a great job in representing the theme of the movie as in the end Will and Sylvia go after even bigger Time Banks in an effort to disrupt this corrupt system."

When I heard he was starring in this film, I thought it would be another great idea destroyed by a cast of good looking people who can't act, but I was wrong. Timberlake shows he's got definite potential to be a big action star and that his n'suck days are way behind him. Cillian Murphy is also terrific as the timekeeper. What I love about Murphy is even when he's a good guy, he's still the guy you're rooting against. His personality makes him the perfect adversary in just about everything he does. In Time, is original, unique, fast moving, and intense. In a Hollywood full of re-makes, sequels, and uninspiring ideas that mimic one another, In Time is a breath of fresh air and was one of the most enjoyable and original films I've seen all year."

","OK, so I'm sitting here reading through the average scores that people are giving this film with reviews like, 'May want your money back,' and 'Good idea Poorly executed,' and I for one have no idea why.<br/><br/>From my point of view this film really is worth the time to watch, set in a slightly futuristic but not unrecognisable America where everyone stops ageing at 25 years old and after this has only one more year to live unless they can earn more time, to make things harder time is the currency, you earn it, you spend it, when you run out, you die.<br/><br/>The actors are perfect for their roles playing each part brilliantly which when backed up with such a good plot means that this really is a movie that you will want to see. I urge you to give this film a go, you won't regret it."

","When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought to myself ""this looks kinda neat, I think I'll enjoy it."" So after that I promptly stopped watching any trailers for it and avoided all news media concerning it. Didn't even look on IMDb for the filmography. Yes, I review movies and remained willfully ignorant of as many of the pertinent details of the film as possible. Why you might ask? It's simple really, when I saw TRON, it was the same deal: I avoided being saturated by news media about the film like some of my friends and was thus able to enjoy the movie more than they did. I was actually really excited when Daft Punk showed up because I had no idea they were going to be in the movie.<br/><br/>Anyhow, what's this movie about? The simplest and fastest explanation is this: it's a dystopian future where time is quite literally money, and life. Everyone has been techno-organically wired with clocks that keep time, which they use as currency to purchase everything and also determines how long they will live. One of the side effects of the process is that no one ages past 25, which does make things kinda funny since you have no idea how old anyone really is.<br/><br/>When I started writing this review, I finally looked up the filmography and found out that the movie was directed by none other than Andrew Niccol. Now this name probably doesn't mean anything to you and I don't blame you if that's the case. However, Andrew directed at least one film that is very near and dear to my heart called Gattaca, which is a terrific sci-fi gem from that 90's that quite frankly deserves a review of its own even now (at least I know what my next review will be). Oh yeah, he also directed the Truman Show if you liked that, I thought it was interesting at any rate.<br/><br/>The two thing about Gattaca were that it didn't get a lot of attention at the time it came out and still doesn't have the kind of recognition I think it really deserves, the other thing was that it really got across an important message about bio-ethics without being heavy handed and preachy. This is reflected somewhat with In Time, where the message is about wealth and class. I feel it has some similarities to brave new world, but feel free to disagree.<br/><br/>So, the review proper: the acting is pretty good and the writing is solid enough for most discerning palettes I think. I've never really hated on Justin Timberlake too much, but I have to admit I was a bit incredulous about his skills as an actor until this realization dawned on me: he was able to fool entire hordes of teens into thinking his work was legitimate music for years; the man has definite experience in suspending disbelief. But seriously, he's a really solid lead in this and Amanda Seyfried is no slouch either (the fact that she's really hot doesn't hurt either). The action is not as intense as I would have liked, but it is serviceable and Timberlake's tongue-in-cheek attitude towards a lot of what happens is actually rather refreshing when compared with the usual smug self assured or dark archetypes of most action leads.<br/><br/>Final analysis: this movie is interesting and somewhat compelling, go see it and if you don't feel like there's an interesting message, just sit back and enjoy the eye candy anyway."

","I thought that In Time was an excellent movie. It gave me memories of a futuristic Robin Hood. Justin Timberlake's character Will Salas is given the opportunity to provide for the poor when a man rich in time passes his 116 years of life too him. With this Will tries to overrun the system and end the capitalistic society that has grown in the future. Will tries to end the system by stealing from the poor and give time to the poor. The movie ends leaving the question of how long can will keep stealing from the rich and get away with it? The question that arose in me was, are humans intended to live this an extended life past the one that has been given to us? I believe in a God that has given a limited time on this earth, an average of 80 years per person. Immortality is a false image that has been spread in the world today and even perhaps by this movie for the future. 1 Corinthians 15:22 states that ""In Adam, all die."" We are all descendants of Adam and through him we will all die. The illusion of living an extended life is impossible. We have been given a limited life in which we should seek the Lord for his guidance and make disciples in all nations."

","""The truth is, for a few to be immortal, many must die.""<br/><br/>In Time is a decent action movie, but nothing more. It's enjoyable for an afternoon, but never rises above disposable entertainment. <br/><br/>The cast is likable. Timberlake and Seyfried have good chemistry, even though Timberlake occasionally seems like a less than convincing fit. I like the guy as an actor, but he doesn't entirely match the character he's asked to play. To be fair, though, the character (Will) is like an amalgam of every positive protagonist trait in movie history. He's completely selfless, generous, smooth, charming, crafty, and seems to be able to transform into an invincible action hero any time the need arises. That would be tough for any actor to sell. Amanda Seyfried is here only to look hot running around in heels and be won over by the hero. She does a good job, but since those criteria are accomplished by her genetics, wardrobe and the script (in that order), that's only to be expected. <br/><br/>Cillian Murphy isn't given anything more than a generic ""tough and relentless, but fair"" detective/antagonist role to work with. Vincent Kartheiser, on the other hand, is the one actor in the movie that's absolutely perfectly cast. No one can play a rich d-bag like Vincent. <br/><br/>The main problem with In Time is that the script needed a lot more polish. The concept is cool (people are essentially immortal, but every moment after they turn 25 must be ""bought""), but the ""time is literally money"" angle could have worked a lot better if it was wielded with a bit more subtlety. Yes, we get that the rich and privileged few are ""living"" off of many.  The story hums along at first, but then seems to waver in tone and purpose. What's simple and straightforward at first eventually unravels to the point where even the characters themselves seem to not know what they're doing or why. Timberlake and Seyfried never seem to be in any real danger, and the climaxes are thoroughly anti- climatic (the fight scene between Timberlake and a bad guy in the third act is absolutely, though unintentionally, hilarious).<br/><br/>Still, I didn't dislike In Time. It has a lot of flaws and certainly didn't live up to its potential, but if you take it as a faintly ridiculous Bonnie & Clyde-lite action movie with a thick and cheap coat of social issues slapped on, then you can have a good time with it. The movie definitely wants to have substance and a message, though, and it fails at that."

","Being a student in school, i have created a opinion based on what i learn and what i view about the outside world. In our English course we have been discussing several topics which include Utopian society and dystopian society. This review is to describe how 'In Time' is relative to a dystopian society and how it portrays some realistic elements of the future. If you think about how the movie world relates to actual life, you will find similar aspects about how people choose to live their lives. In todays world there is about one percent of the population that run almost all the businesses and cash flow and about 60 percent live on or below the poverty line. This was exaggerated in the film by removing the involvement of money and replacing it with a given amount of time to live. i believe this movie is a very close comparison to what will happen in the future if the world is going down the same that it is today. We as people are so destructive by nature that eventually things are going to have to be controlled by a higher authority. The problem is that usually when people gain higher authority it becomes more about greed and less about what people as a whole want. I give this movie credit for being so realistic in the sense that this could very well happen in lets say 50-100 years. The use of technology in the actual world tends to put the progression of the human brain on hold and puts forth more energy to the advancement and replacement of new and improved technology. As my English teacher has said before, technology and the iphone might just be the end of the world as we know it. The quote ""many must die, for few to be immortal,"" is said throughout the movie to re-ensure that Justin Timberlake understands that nothing will change. The only thing that will ever remain constant is change itself. This reminds me of Brave New World because the future is already planned, with everyone dedicated to a certain class. It is very hard to break out of the classes you are born into but something must change for the world to continue. I think every Utopian society has undeniable flaws that make it simply a dystopian reality."

","How's this idea for a scary future: everybody who lives past 25 years gets one more year to live, and all their time can be earned and spent as currency. It can be quite interesting to see this scenario and how it's implemented; if nothing else, the film does a fine job of presenting its main concept and sticking with it. There is a fair amount of action (some fighting and car chases), but nothing that really stands out. Fortunately, the film never really bored me at all.<br/><br/>I found the story and concept to be quite interesting. Anybody who knows sci-fi inside-out may immediately draw some parallels to ""Logan's Run,"" and given the standard dystopian setup, they may find this film quite predictable (although throughout the last hour or so, I felt this was some kind of sci-fi version of ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" and I thought it was cool that way). With the premise, there are a lot of inherent implications that can be drawn (with some help from the script, which makes clever use of time-themed phraseologies); the film seems to occasionally hint at the audience that time is short, time is precious, and we gotta make the most out of what little time we have. It also goes on to underscore the dichotomy between the rich and the poor (as do most dystopian stories). At the core, the story has a serviceable set of characters; they're not mind-blowingly deep, but they aren't totally boring either.<br/><br/>The film is competently made, with decent photography and editing. Acting is a mixed bag; it can be hard to take Justin Timberlake seriously, but he does have his moments. Amanda Seyfried is gorgeous and I loved watching her in her role; Cillian Murphy was pretty darn cool as the Timekeeper. Writing shows a few good strengths and a few bad weaknesses. This production has decent-looking sets, props, and costumes. It's one of those movies that uses modern locales and props to show an ultramodern setting. Music is alright.<br/><br/>In the end, I didn't really see that much wrong with this film. I'd recommend it as a rental for anybody who's interested.<br/><br/>4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)"

","Gattaca is one of my all time favourite films, so I was naturally excited to see another scifi from Andrew Niccol. He's also a great writer. I think it's interesting to compare the two films, because thematically they are similar : a guy from the poor end of town gets his own back, by pretending to be someone he's not, essentially beating the system. In Gattaca we had an aspiring astronaut who was genetically inferior; here it's a guy from the (extremely tidy and unconvincing) ghetto, who plays Robin Hood to fix an unjust system. In Time is more of an action flick, aimed at a younger audience.<br/><br/>In both films, the protagonist is shadowed by a detective, which gives things a certain noirish feel; and Niccol's signature visual style, a kind of futuristic art deco, draws on past and future, which is disorienting, because it's partly familiar. Gattaca balanced this with warm, relatable characters, and a story that took its time; in the brothers who competed since birth, in the friendship between Vincent and Jerome, and a believable love interest. <br/><br/>In Time suffers from a lack of engaging characters, a subpar script, odd casting, and some rather confusing plot arcs. I was still struggling to understand why no one gets old (it's never explained) when the daughter of a wealthy aristocrat suddenly turns on her own society, and teams up with a guy from the cheap side of town, all in the space of a few frames. It could work, but too much detail is brushed aside, and Seyfried comes across as so blase about everything, I just wanted her daddy to ground her for a week.<br/><br/>In Gattaca, the emotion was visible, the risks palpable. Here, Timberlake throws himself into the action, but he is all good looks and no depth. It all feels too unreal - there's no emotion bubbling under the surface - nothing is really at stake.<br/><br/>The look and feel of the film is brilliant (car stunts aside) - Niccol came before the Matrix and its swathe of imitators, and he has a unique take on the future. But it all feels sterile. The central plot device is a little too gimmicky, and it gets monotonous seeing people checking the time over and over. It really needed a more convincing pair of leads. Cillian Murphy is great as the timekeeping detective, however."

","""In Time"" is a 2011 film directed and written by Andrel Nicoll, and which stars Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried in the lead roles.<br/><br/>The story is about a dystopian future where people live to 25 years, stopping the aging process by this age, but that is the limit age of life and they may live only another year after that. When they turn 25, by some means of biotechnology, a fluorescent green marker appears on the right wrist, that shows the remaining lifetime. In this future (which is similar in part to our own world), instead of money, the exchange of lifetime between the people is used to buy things, pay salaries and everything else.<br/><br/>There are a kind of police in this future, called Time Guardians who control everything, and investigate cases of theft of time: this is necessary, for the world and cities (in case a version of Los Angeles), are divided by time zones, which divide the poor citizens of the rich (and the amount of lifetime determines this).<br/><br/>Will Salas (Justin) is a resident of the city's poorest area, who lives with his mother (Olivia Wilde), and is always a altruistic person, giving time of life for those in need, remaining with 24 hours - he ends up meeting a stranger in a bar, with more than a century of life, which passes to him his lifetime... from these point and other events, the story unfolds.<br/><br/>Raymond's mother dies and he wants revenge for it, going to the richest district, to try to change the system, where he get to know Sylvia Weiss (Amanda) - but the claims of life gained by him are being investigated, and he is suspected of murder and chased by Raymond Leon (Gillian Murphy).<br/><br/>The film presents an interesting approach to the plot, which has appeared in other films by the way, but the future of this film is different: it is interesting to see how everything has a price advertising that is marked in minutes or hours instead of money, a very nice feature that the production did well.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is set in suburban neighborhoods and some locations in the center, with large buildings, but everything else has a ""clean"" and artificial look - the vehicles of the future, are modernized versions of classic cars like Mustangs and Shelby Cobras. Also the streets are generally very empty, and is even stranger in a dystopia future.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is very good, but only by the protagonists.<br/><br/>The great problem of the movie is that from two-fifths of it forward, the story fades, and begins not have much logic basis, dealing only with the consequence of the initial events, without other repercussions, in addition, the ""Bone and Clyde"" duet that main actors become do not have much logic... for example, banks in the future has no security at all?<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie contains an interesting plot in the beginning that promised a interesting movie, but it dissipates during it, which is partially saved by the performance of Justin Timberlake. I finished the movie disappointed, hoping that would have been different in the way it was conducted. My score: 5.5 / 10.0."

I also liked how the people with no time ran and those with all the time in the world strolled everywhere. <br/><br/>More of these subtleties of society could have been added without detracting from the action. Instead the filmmaker cheaped out by creating a 'futuristic' world where he could have easily set it in the present day without CGI.

","The thought behind 'In Time' made me want to see this movie. I usually do not find action movies worth my time (hahaha) but I found that living in a world that values time as currency was interesting enough for me to pick it up.<br/><br/>This is the first movie that I have seen with Justin Timberlake and while he was likable as Will Salas, there was no real hook- he looked good in his tux, played the rags to riches man well and the romantic, but it came across as generic or robotic. Maybe there is room to grow here but it seemed that as the main character he failed to pull me in to his world, yes he displayed some emotion and that was what saved him in the end. He appeared tough when he needed to be, sweet and angry, sad even but all the while I was thinking, Will could have been so much more. <br/><br/>I am not a fan of Amanda Seyfried and here she was a spoiled little annoying rich girl. One thing that really drove me crazy was something that she probably had no direct control over and that was her make-up and hair, not to mention the dresses and heals. I am sorry but do not expect me to believe that she (or anyone) for that matter can run over roofs, down dark alleys, up fire escapes in four inch heals and be okay. I mean I know this is a fantasy film, but that was just pushing it. The story between Seyfried, who plays Sylvia Weis, and Timberlake is so predictable it was ridiculous. Make an assumption in your head about what happens between the poor cute boy and the rich hot girl and there you go.<br/><br/>It was the performances of the minor characters that held it together, though for the life of me I cannot believe that Cillian Murohy agreed to some of the dialog that came out of his mouth. I like him as villain and he did well, but it not the best performance I have seen from him. <br/><br/>I do not really know much about Matt Bommer, but I really liked his character and the role that he played in the film and he was easy on the eyes thats for sure. <br/><br/>Alex Pettyfer was a confusing addition but once I started looking at him like a slum lord, his character made sense. <br/><br/>The action was well placed throughout the film and was not over done. I found the romance element annoying and on a side note it was frustrating how every romantic scene was preceded by music- a couple times I thought I was watching a bad Lifetime movie or something. <br/><br/>The film no doubt is a message about the 'half and half not' of the universe. Time is the currency and so the more one has the more powerful and longer one lives. There is a feeling that people beg, barrow and steal time in order to live forever and that is the driving force behind the mission that Will takes upon his shoulders. Its a metaphor for out current situation and the financial crisis that his happening across the globe, but I did not feel as though I was being preached too, which is rare. There was one speech that I rolled my eyes at, but I get what the writer was getting at, it was not necessary, but then again I do not think the target audience were adult, college graduates. I knew what they were selling before the movie was half way over, I did not need the rhetoric, but I did expect it. <br/><br/>Overall it was a descent film. The music and the make-up department was a bit over the top- do not even get me started on the makeup of Vincent Kartheiser (who played Seyfried's father). The premise was excellent, the actors mediocre and the production over the top. 'In Time' also laid the foundation for a sequel, which I may check out it I have the time."

The film has an interesting concept, and the production spend is good, but it feels like an interesting concept that has been 'dumbed down' and not properly explored, in order to fit into a big-budget action flick.<br/><br/>However, the day later, the more I thought about it, the more the concept grew on me. I realised that while the movie didn't really explore the concept of time as a currency as much as, say, an independent movie might, it did at least present them.... And with them, the underlying social inequalities present in today's society.<br/><br/>If you read the film in this way - as a metaphor for current social and political challenges, such as the fact that billions of people in poverty do live day-to-day, with a bad day meaning death from malnutrition - then it's a powerful film. There are also lots of time- money set piece situations that range from fun to thought-provoking.

","This movie owes a more than a small nod to ""Logan's Run"". It may point the way towards a solution to the exponential population explosion that we are currently witnessing globally. Over the centuries, there have been many disasters, natural or man-made, that have culled world populations, the most recent being WWII. However, disease control and good health services tend to legislate against another plague and, despite the current situation across the Middle-East, it seems unlikely that a catastrophic world conflict will break out in the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>The premise of ""In Time"" and indeed ""Logan's Run"" is at once both interesting and terrifying.

"XanderDevil","6","0","0","28 January 2012"," It's an OK Futuristic Dystopian Movie with generic messages
","In this movie, time is money. Due to genetic engineering, people require time (i.e. money) in order to continue to live past the age of 25. When the clock starts ticking at age 25, they stop ageing and they automatically get 1 year of free credit. The amount of time they each have is tracked by a tracker in their left forearm, and they earn more the same way people do in real life: they work, steal, gamble, etc.<br/><br/>In general, I liked the idea of the movie, but there are a certain flaws introduced in the movie, and there is one fatal flaw that I didn't like about this movie.<br/><br/>That fatal flaw is that people can get time from man-made devices, and nobody has been able to reverse engineer them. If these devices are made by people in factories, then someone out there certainly has the knowledge to find a method of recreating these devices. This would lead to a black market of devices, and would therefore change the economics, the ethics, and the social ethics of having a time-based currency.<br/><br/>There are a couple more flaws. One being that the time (i.e. money) can be taken so easily without any security measures, especially when it has to do with somebody's life. Another being that the Timekeepers (police) were able to monitor the movement of time from one place to another and from person to person, which lacked explanation and needed to be explored.<br/><br/>Now onto the good things. Two of the better aspects of this movie, although not explored in depth, include the economy of time, and the willingness of people to live to a certain age before they pass away. I did not find the acting exceptional or horrendous. I also thought that the cast was a good fit. <br/><br/>Overall, I think the movie was a low rental in terms of quality. The movie was trying to send out grandiose messages without having substance itself. Had there been more depth to the social, economic, and ethical aspects of the premise, then the movie would have been better."

","The idea of a perfect socio-political society has been a driving theme in countless sci-fi movies, many of which take place in a futuristic utopia. While sci-fi classics like ""Total Recall"" and ""Blade Runner"" not only raised the bar for its time, these movies have also stood the test of time as benchmarks; even for this day and age. As such, there will always be movies that try to top the sci-fi genre by any means possible. ""Gatacca"" was one such film that looked at genetic discrimination and individuality, when comparing the weakness of humans with the strengths of clones. Writer-director Andrew Niccol had a lot of things going for him with the Academy Award nominated ""Gatacca"". This time around, Niccol returns as writer, director and producer, but fails on almost every aspect of this film.<br/><br/>It is the year 2161 and humans are genetically engineered to live up to the age of 25. As this is just the early part of the plot, it is safe to assume that this must be a drastic but necessary step to curb (the current) population crisis. To sit through the remaining part of the movie, you have to suspend reality and everything thing else you may know about what makes the world tick. Taking the age old idiom that 'time is money', time is literally currency in this movie. The more time a person has, in units of hours, years, or decades, entitles that person to live that much longer beyond the age of 25. Surprised? Wait, there's more. An implant on the hand of a person displays just how much time they have left and time can also be transferred from one person to another. Salaries or loans increase (extends) time, while purchases decrease time .When a person ""times-out"", that person dies instantly. With less than two hours remaining, Rachel Salas (Olivia Wilde) discovers to her horror, that she cannot board a bus home due to an unexpected price hike from one hour to two hours. Not finding his mother on the bus, Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) runs down the street to find her. She times-out just before falling into his arms. From here on, the plot goes from ridiculous to ludicrous. Will learns that time is imbalanced, where rich people live longer and poor people die every day (who would have guessed!). To avenge his mother's death, Will does the most sensible thing- he kidnaps the daughter of Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser) a wealthy banker, and demands a million years as ransom. As it turns out, Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) is not too fond of her father either, and becomes Will's accomplice in a series of bank robberies aimed at distributing time to people in the ghettos. In hot pursuit are mobsters known as the 'Minutemen' and a police force run by the 'Timekeeper' (Cillian Murphy).<br/><br/>What I find unbelievable is the fact that Nicool also wrote the scripts for ""The Truman Show"" and ""The Terminal"", both critically acclaimed movies that placed lead characters in the middle of an identity crisis. Having said this, it is a big mystery as to what was going through Nicool's mind while scripting the screenplay here. I get real world comparisons that the rich will get richer as the poor get poorer, or that all the money in the world can't buy happiness or even save a loved one's life. What I don't get is how hard this movie tries to vindicate its inbuilt philosophy that only through the sacrifice of many, can a few claim the right to immorality. As that ideology is never really justified, that pillar of thought crumbles under its own weight. Then there are the plot holes. The most obvious is that if everyone is supposed to stop ageing at 25, why do most characters look well over 30? Plot holes and loose ends aside, this movie is also the mother of all clichés. Its bad enough that the very few scenes that are actually worth watching ends up as the most predictable moments in the film, corny dialogue, misplaced humor and a slight case of Robin Hood comes with it part and parcel as well. Moving on from bad to worse, Justin Timberlake is not the least bit convincing and Amanda Seyfried is eye candy as usual. Together, there is no chemistry between the two leads, so don't expect anything along the likes of Bonnie and Clyde. JT, stick to singing dude!"

","Very nice sci-fi thriller starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried. The plot is quite unique, you age clock is the currency. You can earn it and spent it very quickly. Simple to follow and although this seem a fairly low budget affair, the whole thing always seem fairly plausible apart from people wandering the street in almost zombie like fashion.. With interest in the plot the rest of the film seems to fall into place very well - there are parts however that may have been improved by the script or simple editing..

","""In Time"" (2011), Rated ""PG-13"" for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Brief Partial Nudity, Violence & Mild Gore. Running Time: 1hr&49mn - Three Stars (out of Four) <br/><br/>As I watched ""In Time,"" I was reminded of Ray Bradbury stories of yesteryear, the kind you were assigned to read in junior high and/or high school. All those sci-fi ""moral of the story"" tales were similar in theme: an outlandish premise about a dystopian future which is really a social commentary on caste cultures and the human condition. This latest Justin Timberlake vehicle succeeds in taking those ingredients and borrowing contemporary social dilemmas straight from headlines to tell its story.<br/><br/>The film opens in the year 2161, where the human aging process has been stopped at age 25 for everyone. Each person has a glowing digital ""lifeclock"" visible in their left forearm tracking the time they have left before ""timing out"" to death. Time is distributed via tactile contact from person to person and from time boxes. Starting at age 25, people automatically have their clocks are turned on with only one year to live. For a price you are able to live indefinitely. The well-to-do don't give this a second (pun) thought, as their wealth enables them to live years and centuries. They can even accrue and grow more time. The impoverished must work as drones in factories to earn minutes and days to add to their lifeclocks. The urgency of earning more time to maintain your life is crucial. As one character puts it best: ""You generally don't sleep in."" <br/><br/>This makes for an attractive-looking society. People over the age of 100 are indistinguishable from people in their mid-twenties. Based on what I saw on the silver screen, I suspect the physical appearance of humans has been altered too. After all, everyone's mother and daughter all look like supermodels straight out of Victoria's Secret while the men all look like they should be on the cover of GQ Magazine.<br/><br/>Will Salas (Timberlake) is a working class joe who lives with his mother (Olivia Wilde) in the ghettos of Dayton. A personal tragedy sets Will's crusade in motion to bring down the system to change the status quo for all those in the lower class ""time zones."" Will's cause is further aided when he is inadvertently helped by a suicidal wealthy benefactor, who transfers over 100 years of life to Will before timing out.<br/><br/>Time is the only currency in their world. With it, people can buy whatever they can afford in days, weeks and years. Whether it is a hotel suite or high performance automobile, they pay with time. Will's newfound fortune raises the suspicions of Timekeeper Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy, ""Inception"") who believes Will is a thief and murderer.<br/><br/>Will escapes from his ghetto time zone to the wealthy time zone of New Greenwich in pursuit of a wealthy businessman (Vincent Kartheiser, TV's ""Mad Men"") who built his fortune by holding the keys to immortality. After romancing his daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried, ""Big Love"") and eventually kidnapping her, Will returns to the ghetto to show Sylvia the plight of those less fortunate than her. Soon, Will and Sylvia are robbing timebanks and sharing hundreds of years with the working-class all while being pursued by Timekeepers with decade-long bounties on each of their heads.<br/><br/>""In Time"" isn't astonishing or great cinema, but it is a fun sci-fi popcorn thriller. The present day messages about social inequity ring true. In reality we have people in various social classes, in some cultures even castes, around the world struggling to make ends meet on a daily basis. These themes are as old as time. Does the movie clamor on the edge in the political arenas debating the redistribution of wealth? Is it designed to generate awareness of global poverty? I'll leave that for the viewer to discern.<br/><br/>Originally, the release for ""In Time"" was nearly blocked by sci-fi author Harlan Ellison who alleged it was stolen from one of his short stories. Upon seeing this film, Ellison backed off, though he did receive a screen credit for ""The Terminator"" (1984) when he made a similar claim on that film. Like I said, ""In Time"" felt like those grade school dystopian fables we grew up with, so maybe there is no reinventing the wheel on how to dress up a message and make social statement. I'm sure Ellison or Bradbury were not the first writers to do so. Look at Shakespeare, he did it before those guys. Going further back, how about that story about Oedipus? Shocking what Sigmund Freud said what that was really about! <br/><br/>""In Time"" is a nice evening at the movies. Not amazing, but pleasant and likable enough to carry you through to its conclusion. There's some convincing acting, good action and it also works as a chase movie too. The film makes some relevant observations and is highly timely (pun). You can never have too many films that entertain you and make you think a little bit in the process. ""In Time"" does those things well."

"linaskk","6","0","0","18 December 2011"," Review of In Time
","Justin Timberlake is quickly becoming one of the most popular Hollywood actors of 2011. After performing in two romantic comedies (Friends with Benefits, Bad Teacher), he finally got leading role in Andrew Niccol's sci-fi movie In Time, where he has to do a bit more than just be handsome. In In Time Andrew Niccol (writer of great movies like The Terminal and The Truman Show) presents the idea of people stop aging at the age of 25 (50 years old woman is played by Olivia Wilde, God bless this technology). But everything is not as idyllic as it sounds, after reaching 25, your time is limited to only one more year, after your time expires you are simply shut down because there is no space left on the Earth. Time is a currency, a key to get everything from cup of coffee to couple of prostitutes, so logic is simple – the less you spend, the longer you live.<br/><br/>The story is quite simple: Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) was ordinary, but exceptionally honorable Ghetto boy counting his last days and one night he accidentally got rich, at the same being accused of murder. He runs away from Ghetto, becomes a rebellious fugitive and tries to make world a better place. Oh, he also grabs attractive rich man's daughter as hostage on his way.<br/><br/>In Time tries to be action thriller and has enough elements to be considered as such – racing cars (ugly modified, weird sounds making American muscles, I must mention), hiding, running, chasing, shooting scenes – but its social aspect rises above them all. Relationship between rich and poor, drama of both sides, different views to life (immortality and 25 years long insecure life; living free and living surrounded by bodyguards and high walls), finally, an allusion to importance of time and money in our real lives.<br/><br/>The main idea of not aging after 25 made whole cast choice a bit limited; all the actors had to be really young, sometimes lack of experience can be felt, especially when the lead actor is not a real professional. However, J.T.'s acting was not bad, so as it was not very impressive. Age restrictions didn't prevent Cillian Murphy from showing good performance, even though he is a whole decade older than his bad guy character – Time Keeper.<br/><br/>Besides really unique main idea, In Time sometimes might feel like a sci-fi flavored Romeo and Juliet's love story, with Robin Hood'ish elements at second half. It has interesting and believable environment, scenes are filled with catchy dialogues, which only improves atmosphere (""Will: Four minutes for a cup of coffee? Will's Friend: Yesterday it was three! Coffee worker: You want coffee or you want to reminisce?""). Sadly, this movie manages to keep interest only for the first half, later on it becomes chaotic and predictable at the same time.<br/><br/>To end with, In Time is not a bad movie, but it probably won't make people who do not like sci-fi change their opinion. Unique ideas like this do not come very often, it had a lot of potential, but, I believe, not all of it was used. Anyway, it still remains pretty interesting new experience, when everything in cinemas starts to give sense of repeating."
"DarthPaul85","8","3","8","4 November 2011"," Awesomely Bad! Or maybe just awesome?
","I had no expectations for the quality of this film. I was hoping for a science fiction film that delivered on its premise- time equals money- and the implications of that world.<br/><br/>I'll start with the negatives. The dialog is very thin and clichéd. The plot is a by-the-numbers fugitive story. The ""message"" of the movie is overstated and oversimplified. The characters are stereotypical, and this movie probably has one of the ""worst"" special effects I've seen on the big screen (you'll know it when you see it).<br/><br/>And now the positive. Everything!!! I don't know they did it...everything I said above is true...and somehow none of it matters. The dialog? Oddly believable (good performances all around). The story? Oddly captivating and fun! Also well paced. The message? Actually, it's SO relevant to today's political climate that making it completely obvious and cheesy is somehow the only way to go. The film has an agenda, and it makes you root for it. The characters show a good mix of sincerity and humor...although they never invoked my empathy, I believed them. The bad special effect?...OK, that I can't defend, but it was hilarious (everyone in the theater laughed)...it was almost as if it was meant to look fake.<br/><br/>Simply put, either the person making this film was a hack who got really lucky, or he's a satirical genius. This film is either a brilliant mock-up of every ""film like this"" that exists, or it succeeds by emulating their ""best"" qualities. Awesomely bad or just awesome, it's fun either way. If you're not laughing by the end of Act II, you're taking it too seriously."

So many movies are full of action and/or have a sappy love story that you watch and forget. This movie has that and more.

I also really loved Matt Bomer who should be in more movies cause he is talented and beyond handsome. I also fond myself very surprise to even like Alex, who was pretty OK in this.<br/><br/>Justin and Amanda did nothing for me. Justin needs to go back to singing or whatever else he does.

So there is no such thing as money.<br/><br/>The idea is so stupid, transferring time from one person to another by touching one another's arms, or by using special devices that store time.

","Another future/past movie where nothing is ever explained as to why the current situation is what it is and when this is supposed to take place or how people stay young. As has been done in several other movies in the future we supposedly drive cars from the past for some inexplicable reason other than the fact that they look cool on camera. There are no cell phones evident but pay phones are back in style for some reason and the device on you that holds time can be hacked by anyone even when you are sleeping, which would stop no one from just murdering you for your time. Every woman is of super model quality even in the poorest neighborhoods when it would have been much more realistic if the hotties were only with the rich. And they are telling me an Olivia Wilde of the future couldn't get someone to give her time for some favors?<br/><br/>As for the story if you can call it that, it is full of holes some of which are blatant. In the beginning we see Will get time from the guy who wants to end his life giving him 116 years. Then he gives his friend a decade leaving him 106 years. He gives up about 1.3 years with the tolls leaving him 104.7 when he arrives in New Greenwich (we never see him pay for the limo). He then pays for the hotel (a standard room was 2 months so lets guess a suite is 6 months) so he is now at about 104.1 years.<br/><br/>He pays for breakfast (9.5 weeks) a new tux($?) and 1 year for entrance to the casino so the most he could have when he sits down to play poker is around 103 years. Yet he calls on a 50 year bet (leaving him with 53 years) and a then another 200 years which would give him a negative -147 years yet after the bet he still has time left??? ALL IN means ALL IN.<br/><br/>I stopped caring at that point, in a movie that is all about numbers and countdowns how could they make such a huge mistake?<br/><br/>Then in the water we see the girl has 1040 years but after the car accident the thugs say she has a decade and make a big deal out of it.<br/><br/>This was a silly waste of time."

The connection of that simple truth when you allow it to trickle through the movie and into the real world is so profound that every thing else is just a dust jacket. <br/><br/>There is a character early in the movie who leaves a message to us written in dust on a window, that I am having tattooed on my soul.<br/><br/>See through this movie for what it means, not just for what it looks like.

","Wow. For being 100s (or more) of years in the future, it sure looks like barely anything has changed 'In Time' (3/10 Stars.) Okay, the biggest difference is now people are ""engineered"" to stop aging at 25 years old (ALTHOUGH, HALF THE CAST LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE IN THEIR 30s) and have to ""earn"" their years following that by either A: Be Wealthy in Years or B: Working minimal jobs for eternity. It's a tad bit confusing at first, but after you get the somewhat original concept of currency now being ""time"" everything else is either bland, boring or both. Good-hearted, and expert sprinter, Will (Justin Timberlake) suddenly gains a hundred years when he's told the system is only in place to help the rich, and when his mother quickly ""runs out of time"" i.e. dies, he's hell-bent on bringing down the system. But, then he's hell-bent on a new girl. But, then he's hell-bent on helping the less-fortunate. But, then he's hell-bent on...you get the picture that this picture is all over the place. Suffice to say, it's a boring future with a plot that's been around for centuries. It's a Twilight Zone episode that's stretched four times too long and contains far too many (UN-FUNNY) puns on the ""time"" word.

Seriously. Why time? I could have been okay with it if in this world this is the way it had always been, but the story is such that SOMEONE started this time-as-money system. But why? <br/><br/>You have the same effect if everyone is immortal anyway and you just kept money as the currency. If you want some people to live in the lap of luxury and some to be poor, just keep money and have everyone live forever. If it's for population control, why not just have everyone who wants to live forever give up the right to reproduce? What was the point in creating this very unsecure (no PIN numbers or anything?) way to judge wealth and value that actually allows someone to kill me in the night by putting their wrist up against mine? If you have the technology to engineer bodies that never age and never die, you can do it without the time limit currency. They keep mentioning that ""in order for a few to be immortal, many must die"", but I don't buy it. The fact that this was never explained and had no place in any society where this wasn't a natural fact of evolution or whatever, prevented me from getting immersed in the movie. Not that would have been easy even if they had backstoried it in somewhere.<br/><br/>Which leads me to a summary of the other problems:<br/><br/>* Said many times on IMDb so far, but seriously; why is it so easy to rob a bank and escape ""time keepers"" and why are JT and AS the only people who've ever thought of it.<br/><br/>* Except in Post-Apocalyptic movies, A society set in the future should have technology that is greater or equal to the technology of the present. Why were cell phones, cb radios, stun guns (the cop seems hesitant to shoot cause it might kill someone, and there is a point where it's mentioned ""shoot on sight is against policy""), and many other technologies uninvented. <br/><br/>* Has the art of providing security/policing a city died in the future? Why is the 20 strong group of ""Agent Smith's from the Matrix"" security guys infiltrated by JT just because he put on some shades?<br/><br/>*Also, the film doesn't really go into the behind the scenes workings of the conspiracy they allude to. Maybe they were trying to set it up for sequels, but if you're going to put a shitty movie out there that makes it impossible to do a sequel, at least give us the meat of the story.<br/><br/>*There are obviously those mistakes that any movie inevitably makes that are actually kinda fun to spot, such as the fact the driver went through zone 8 to get to zone 4 from the ghetto, which based on the map of the zones from the time keepers headquater is a long detour, or instances where someone should have run out of time because they weren't filled up.<br/><br/>So, overall....it's hard to disappoint me on these futuristic movies. I'm very forgiving, but this one just missed in two many areas. I'd rather you be great in one aspect and fall short in all the others, as long as you stuck that one point. Here it's all kind of thrown together and corners are cut everywhere.<br/><br/>ps - when JT's car flies off the road it looks like a 70s movie."
"TroyeEvans","4","2","5","2 November 2011"," In Time
","Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried star in this sci-fi thriller which takes place in the future where everyone on the planet only lives up to 25 for free and have to earn their time afterward. I would have to say the trailer of this movie excited me more than the movie itself did. Still, it is an overall decent movie.<br/><br/>The concept of this movie is great, and that was why I decided to watch it. The plot, however, is not as great. Basically it is just an ordinary cops-chase-thieves piece throughout, only this time there may not a a clear line between the good and the bad. The sci-fi elements do not really stand out at all. People are divided into different zones according to the time they own and we get to see ghetto areas in which the poor live and big cities in which the rich live. Nothing really gives you that science fiction feeling, so this is just like an usual modern day crime film.<br/><br/>The good thing about this movie is that it keeps itself exciting from very start to finish, and Cillian Murphy plays quite a bad-ass cop. All in all, ""In Time"" may be not well loved by hardcore sci-fi fans because they will not get a very strong sci-fi sense, but it is still a exciting thriller with action and a well-written plot."

","With just a little sf concept — time is money, becomes money is time — this movie highlights income inequality and global disparity between the haves and have-nots in different zones.<br/><br/>Perfect timing, this film hits the zeitgeist.<br/><br/>It's also time to rewatch writer, director Andrew Niccol's other high concept sf film ""Gattaca"" with Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke.<br/><br/>""In Time,"" is notable for casting and costuming and an sf film that focuses on faces and film angles over special effects.<br/><br/>Vincent Kartheiser plays an intriguing Philippe Weis, an 85-year-old, 25-year-old time millionaire who expects to remain immortal. Kartheiser nails this with perfect stillness, those ""from time"" do everything slow, and an eerie, older than his appearance, demeanor.<br/><br/>Don't get what the Occupy protests are about? Philippe Weis could spare his first million to ransom his daughter. ""It's nothing to us,"" his wife says. But Weis refuses. It would break the system that holds him in a bubble at the top.<br/><br/>Speaking of bubbles, Amanda Seyfried could be cast in the film version of Scott Westerfeld's ""Pretties"" — no CGI required. Funniest line: ""We make a cute couple,"" Sylvia Weis says upon seeing her wanted poster. True! Pairs well with these reads: Victor Hugo's ""Les Misérables"" (intrigued or confused by Cillian Murphy's dedicated timekeeper character? Look for Javier the fanatic police inspector in ""Les Misérables"".), Marta Randall's ""Islands"" (which also explores how humanity would be effected by immortality), and Harlan Ellison's short story anthology ""Paingod and Other Delusions"" (Ellison said ""In Time"" was too similar to his short story ""Repent, Harlequin! said the Ticktockman"" — the time as money idea is unique, but ""In Time"" is a much more linear take — still, its a good excuse to read the story and also ""Wanted in Surgery"" from Ellison's collection).<br/><br/>Aside from the sf conceit that places clocks on our arms, ""In Time,"" captures the harshness of institutionalized, systematic income inequality. The most fictional element of the film: how Sylvia Weis ran in those shoes."

","what can i say. it is amazing! Andrew did such a great job filming this movie. it was action packed, a bit of romance.... it was good. if i had to critise about anything about the movie i would say that the casting could have been a little different. Cillian Murphys role as Timekeeper Raymond Leon was spot on! it was perfect! He pulled the role off so well and he was strong, confident and looks good in a leather jacket. Give him any role and he does it well. Well Done Cillian. Your an awesome actor! Amanda Seyfried role as Sylvia Weis was really good. she portrayed he character well and did a very good job. she was always strong and confident throughout the film and it was exiting to watch Justin Timberlakes role as Will Salas was OK but he could have portrayed the character better. Most people say that it was a weak performance from him and it was. he could have done so much better.<br/><br/>All up, this was a great film to watch. very entertaining and i absolutely loved it. This movie will go so far in the movie world. It will be a hit because it is just simply amazing."
"phd_travel","7","3","11","27 October 2011"," Better than expected - good casting
","This movie is better than I thought it would be. It is stylishly made with an attractive cast and has some good points. This is a dramatic science fiction story about time left to live being the currency of the future. The premise is quite interesting and isn't too ridiculous. There is tension from wondering if some characters will die when they run out of time. The casino segment makes use of this. The casting is good. Justin Timberlake is the Robin Hood type character trying to redistribute time. He has matured a bit as an actor. He is less teeny bopper than usual and his voice is a few registers lower here. The supporting cast is good especially Cillian Murphy as the cop or time keeper - his obsessive look is quite convincing. Vincent Kartheiser of Mad Men has an eerie preserved look and is well cast as Amanda's father. A lot of the humor comes from the ""science fiction young"" characters like the slim Olivia Wilde as Justin's 50 years young mother. One of the scariest things is seeing Amanda Seyfried run around in very high heels. Don't get her hair style and color. Johnny Galecki of Big Bang Theory has a small but against type role. Matthew Bomer plays a suicidal man who doesn't want to live any more and gives Justin a present of time. Alex Pettyfer plays a villain thug with a British accent - something he is quite suited for. Liked the use of vintage cars but the city scenes were a bit science fiction drab. A couple of weak points. The story has Justin and Amanda running around a lot and it gets a bit repetitive. It drags a bit in the middle to last quarter. Overall still worth watching if you have the time."
"shamsuzzohan","1","2","6","7 January 2012"," Poor storyline
","The dumbest science fiction ever. The story line tried to replace money with the time. Everyone has an allocated amount of time for their living. They can earn, lend or borrow times from and to others. That is the whole idea of the film. The second half of the film tried to develop a concept of digital robin hood. However, the idea that totally failed in this film is that the time transaction cannot be compared with that of the money. Because, in real life, money is being safely protected everywhere but in this film, anyone could have stolen money from others without any effort. Bank robbery was so easy that just one truck could have broken a whole bank vault and stolen all the money kept. The core sci-fi base of this film along with the concept of establishing a robin hood are total failures. Except Amanda Seyfried, everyone was pathetic in their acting. Nevertheless, I have written here about my opinion, hope mass viewers will like the film as a whole."
"pefrss","4","2","6","13 December 2011"," Brainless future or brainless writers?
","Before the movie starts, they show an ad now in my local movie theater suggesting that it is so much better to see a movie on a big screen, than on a small TV at home and I agree. Unfortunately I do not want to see explosions, car crashes and chases or gory mutilations. While I used to go to the movies all the time, I am lucky if I find four or five movies a year I want to see.<br/><br/>I just want to join the chorus of the people who went to see the movie because they liked the idea behind it and came out disappointed. I am a big fan of Aldous Huxley's ""Brave, New World"" where he created a world of perfect young people who would not age and would die at a predetermined age. In his book the class system is solved by sleep schooling people into being happy with the place in life they have been assigned. The age idea brought me into the movie; the change of currency from money to time did not seem to make such a big difference to me. And I thought that the age idea was the only thing well done in the movie. The rest did not convince me. This was to be some kind of future? It looked more retro. Like always I was disturbed by the obligatory need for car chases and extensive use of guns. Can nobody envision a future less violent? And the time currency was so unprotected, that it was just unthinkable that people would not constantly rob each other all the time of time. Is there nobody in Hollywood to produce something a little bit more intelligent? Are they just counting on getting certain uncritical young people into the movies, who want to see certain stars. Apropos stars, I was happy to see Johnny Galecki {Big Bang Theory) in a small role, he should get bigger roles in movies. He is an excellent actor."
"zardoz-13","5","2","6","26 November 2011"," Time Out for Exposition
","Good science fiction films can get away with virtually anything except for shoddy storytelling. Okay, fantasy and horror movies can get away with just as many things. Indeed, sci-fi, fantasy, and horror movies aren't subject to the same laws of gravity as crime thrillers, war epics, westerns, soap operas, and similar films. Indeed, most movies must toe the line where realism is concerned, but realism largely optional in bad movies. The exception to the rule for all movies is credibility. If a movie is going to qualify as exemplary, it must possess credibility. Good sci-fi can create worlds beyond our own, but only if the filmmakers can make everything believable. Good sci-fi can contrive a race of entities which may share few human similarities. Consider the ""Planet of the Apes"" film franchise as an example of good sci-fi. Often, however, these hybrid human and alien epics turn into mash-ups: humans working with or against extraterrestrials. Of course, the thematic as well as allegorical possibilities in these sci-fi films surpass anything that a regular film can conjure up. The point is that good sci-fi must strive even harder to make an imaginary environment with a laundry list of do's and don'ts seen credible so that the writers can justify getting their heroes and heroines in and out of life and death predicaments.<br/><br/>""Gattaca"" writer & director Alex Niccol has dreamed up a compelling premise for ""In Time,"" starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried as a ""Bonnie & Clyde"" couple on the lam from the law in the year 2161 where time is money. Unfortunately, Niccol fails to forge an aura of credibility for his ""Twilight Zone"" tale. Specifically, Niccol neglects to provide enough information about the future. Mind you, nothing about ""In Time"" seems far-fetched except for the rules that govern the economy of this enigmatic society. Nevertheless, this fascinating but flawed actioneer looks incredibly cool thanks to the stark looking widescreen cinematography of ""Brazil"" lenser Roger Deakins, Alex McDowell's atmospheric production designs, and the minimalist art direction of Priscilla Elliot who designed ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" Of course, Niccol and company have taken advantage of the historic Depression era architecture of Los Angeles with its art deco bridges, storefronts, and concrete river to supplement the film's mystique.<br/><br/>Scientists have engineered a procedure--which Niccol never adequately explains--to genetically alter humans so they cease aging after age 25. Essentially, a man's wife, daughter, sister, mother, or aunt may be twice as old or young, but they never look a day over 25. Meanwhile, they are born with a thirteen-digit, Day-Glo green clock on the outside of their left forearm which counts down the time they have left. After reaching the age of 25, they have one year to live. Anybody who can acquire enough time can live to be immortal. Few, however, manage this feat. Once a person runs out of time, they fall dead on the spot. Meantime, everything is purchased according to time. For example, a cup of coffee costs four minutes, while an exotic convertible may cost 59 months. A phone call costs one minute. Interestingly, cell phones are non-existent. By this time, you must have figured out that the wealthy people are those with time to burn, while the poor folks spend their days toiling in dead-end jobs so they can earn time. Society has been stratified and rarified into the rich, the not-as rich, and the proletarian poor. People live in different time zones, and the least fortunate live in ghettos. Crossing from one time zone to another can be incredibly expensive. Things really get complicated because the economy keeps changing so that the poor have to work twice as hard to stay alive for the next 24 hours. This is the way this society deals with the threat of overpopulation. In this respect, ""In Time"" mirrors contemporary society where prices escalate at the whim of greedy Wall Street traders who have no compassion.<br/><br/>Our blue-collar protagonist, Will Salas (Justin Timberlake of ""The Social Network""), is just another face in an overcrowded ghetto. As a factory worker, he struggles to make his quota. One day, he encounters a suicidal guy in a neighborhood bar, Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomber of ""Flightplan""), and saves him from the villainous Fortis (Alex Pettyfer of ""Beastly"") and his gun-toting henchmen. Fortis and company cruise the ghetto searching for easy prey. Everybody keeps the clock on their forearms covered for safety reasons. Hamilton neither dresses nor behaves like the poor, and Fortis targets him. Will helps Hamilton to elude Fortis. Ironically, Hamilton has lived over a thousand years but has grown weary of life. He wants to die. While Salas and he are hiding out, Hamilton gives him a century of free time. Hamilton sneaks away and dives off a bridge. A squad of Timekeepers clad in long, leather coats, led by gimlet-eyed Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy of ""Batman Begins""), suspect Will may have murdered Hamilton.<br/><br/>Eventually, the Timekeepers catch up with Will after he has crossed over several time zones. He has met and gambled with a wealthy citizen, Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser of ""Alpha Dog""), and won a fortune in time from him. Philippe's beautiful daughter Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried of ""Momma Mia!""), invites Will to their palatial residence to so her father can win back his lost time. Leon shows up and arrests Will, but our hero escapes and takes Sylvia as his hostage. Before long, Sylvia rebels against not only her wealthy father but also the injustice of the system. She joins Will on a crime spree stealing time. Basically, Will and she behave like ""Robin Hood"" bandits. They threaten to destabilize the economy because they are giving time away to the less fortunate.<br/><br/>Sadly, despite its provocative premise, ""In Time"" generates little suspense and few surprises. Altogether, the scarcity of expository information about the future is enough to tick anybody off who demands a modicum of credibility."

","This film starts with a great premise, sort of Logan's Run meets any film about ""fighting the system"".<br/><br/>Unfortunately, despite some reasonable acting performances, this film entirely falters on its script.<br/><br/>Full of cliché, predictability and the occasional plot-hole, I'm afraid I was left disappointed. Like many underwhelming films from Hollywood, it just feels like a film-by-numbers.<br/><br/>I usually judge a film by whether I'd keep watching if it came on TV late at night.

","Watching this movie is another one of those things where you go away feeling a little different. The ideas projected by this film strike a chord with many people, especially when you make the comparison between time in this movie and money. It really does make you think.<br/><br/>Instead of money, people earn and pay in time, but, as with any movie this style, there's a crime going on. The rich are living forever and the poor are dying young. So out to change he system and saved thousands of lives is...Justin Timberlake, as Will along with Sylvia, portrayed by Amanda Seyfried.<br/><br/>Surprisingly Seyfried and Timberlake make quite a dynamic couple and it's always refreshing seeing actors in different genres for a change. The two main characters come across surprisingly well, Will (Timberlake) making an almost instant emotional connection. Sylvia (Seyfried) is a little more clichéd character, but adds beautifully to the film none the less. Although her heels were practically sellotaped to her feet through the whole film....you never actually see her with any normal shoes...<br/><br/>Overall the film is quite jumpy at the start, a little bit rushed and then a little too slow, but it really comes into its own in the middle and towards the end, even some comedy is unearthed here and there.<br/><br/>The addition of the talented Cillian Murphy, gives the film that little extra glamour that adds to the list of reasons of why you have to see it. And the touching moments really do tug at your heartstrings. The music, composed by none other than Craig Armstrong, emphasises the gravity and power of the scenes, creating, at times, quite a tense atmosphere.<br/><br/>Watch this movie if you liked Contaigon, or just generally any action/adventurey type movie."
"3xHCCH","7","2","6","7 November 2011"," Great Look, Interesting Concept
","When I first heard about this movie entitled ""In Time"" and its sci-fi concept of humans live to the age of 25, I sort of imagined a story sort of like ""Logan's Run."". This made me want to catch it. After watching the film, that it wasn't really quite the ""Logan's Run"" scenario that I expected it to be. I was amazed at how innovatively the writer and director Andrew Niccol (he of ""Gattaca"" and ""The Truman Show"") presented his highly original concept of how our future may be. <br/><br/>""In Time"" presents a very interesting world of the future where human aging stops at 25 years old. After that, you can survive only with the amount of extra time you have earned and saved from your daily livelihood and other activities. Time is therefore their currency, and one's remaining time is marked on a glowing digital clock on one's forearm. When you are very rich in time, you can certainly live forever. When you run out of time, you die that very instant. Ingenious!<br/><br/>Will Salas is a guy from the poor side of town. His mom (played by younger actress Olivia Wilde) dies out because her clock ran out before she and Will were able to get together on the night of her birthday. Will resolves to avenge her death by fighting the very system that their society runs on. Taking with him the daughter of a rich banker named Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) as his lover and partner-in-crime, the pair goes on a spree to steal deposited time in banks and in turn give it away to those poor in time. The Time Police led by dedicated officer Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) and a gang of time extortionists led by Fortis (Alex Pettyfer) provide the exciting conflicts and consequent cat-and-mouse chases that propel the story forward.<br/><br/>The movie looks very slick and polished in terms of its overall look, camera work and colors. As the cast members are ALL young, it was certainly a very handsome-looking world indeed that they have created. It was obvious that Niccol had fun in showing people from different generations all portrayed by actors in their twenties, such that you really could not guess how one character was related to the other. In my opinion though, Justin Timberlake looked miscast as the hero Will Salas. I was thinking that maybe it could have been better if JT and Alex Pettyfer traded roles. JT could probably have played the antagonist role more credibly. Cillian Murphy though was perfect in his role, especially with his characteristically intense face. Amanda Seyfried has really gone a long way from ""Mamma Mia.""<br/><br/>Save for some quibbles about how easy it seemed to take time away from a person and how careless some characters are about their time, I was nonetheless thoroughly entertained by this stylish Bonnie and Clyde meet Robin Hood story in a futuristic Logan's Run setting. The imaginative creativity of Andrew Niccol is very commendable. His incisive social commentary about the gap between rich and poor in the script would also not be lost on the audience."
"ticket_for_one","Null","2","6","4 November 2011"," completely falls off a cliff
","Interesting concept. Time is the new currency. We all live and die by time. Human beings are genetically altered to have stop watches embedded on their arms and each person is given a minimum of 25 years to live. To live past that time you'll have to earn your time by working for it. On top of that you no longer begin to age after you've reached the age of 25. The poor have to work extremely hard to earn their time to live and the rich do not and they have all the time in the world. Transactions are done using the time you have as currency. So a simple cup of coffee could cost 5 mins of time which shortens your life as a result. It's a society where almost everyone works to live. This is more or less the same way we all live our lives. The difference is that we age quicker and our clock is more biological. This film works for about half an hour then it completely falls off a cliff. Timberlake's character Will is a blue collar worker making ends meet in a poor neighbourhood. He runs into a man named Henry, who has over 100 years on his clock. But Henry decides he doesn't want to live forever. He gives Will the 100 years of life he has left and kills himself. Gangsters known as Minute Men find out Will has a hundred years and start pursuing him so they can kill him and take the 100 years for themselves. The authorities also known as Timekeepers are also after Will, thinking he's killed his newly deceased friend Henry. To make matters worse, Will then loses his mother. She dies or times out as it's referred to in the film. Will feeling angered after losing his dear mum (gorgeous Olivia Wilde), plans to avenge her death by going to the rich side of town and stealing all the time he can get his hands on. There he meets Sylvia daughter of some tycoon, she likes him he likes her, coppers find Will. Will takes Sylvia hostage and then Sylvia hates Will for about two minutes until Will gives his sob story about what he's trying to do for his dead mum and the neighbourhood he lives in. Will wins Sylvia over and the two become the Bonnie and Clyde of the future and decide to rebel against the system by stealing all the time from the rich to give to the poor. So you have Bonnie and Clyde meets The Getaway meets Robin Hood with a dash of Equilibrium thrown in. The concept is original, the story however isn't. It's a mess and I had to explain the overall premise in the hope you don't go and see this film. Performances: Timberlake is OK, but he's been better. Social Network, Alpha Dog has shown the man can act when called upon. This was a decent performance at best. At times looking like a rabbit in the headlights when saying dialogue that consists of more than 3 words. Syfried is better and plays a character who displays very little emotion. Sometimes less is more. I was impressed with her. Cillian Murphy as the antagonist Timekeeper does well as does Vincent Kartheiser (Pete Campbell from Mad Men) as Sylvia's father. The rest of the performances, range from bad to terrible. Alex Pettyfer for example is the leader of the Minute Men. He's probably one of the worse villains ever in film. His lines were awful, the character has nothing special about him and on top of that his performance was probably the worst. Hated the way he played the character and hated his performance. Set pieces were filmed well, but the dialogue was awful and unimaginative. Also scenes between Timberlake and Seyfried were tedious and long. Some sort of character development going on there. This film looks like Niccol's futuristic take on America's current economic situation. My head is already hurting from working out how beneficial a referendum would be for Greece. I don't need a similar storyline embedded in this film. It would've been better if Timberlake walked up to the camera holding a placard saying LIFE IS SHORT! Andrew Niccol is a good director. Truman Show and Gattaca are amongst his best work. This looked like something he cared little about. And it's rubbed off on me, because I can't I wasted almost 2 hours of my life on this. I almost timed out watching this. Take my advice, there are only 8/9 more weeks till 2012. Use the rest of your TIME this year wisely, by avoiding this and watching something else instead."

","Really enjoyed this Sci Fi gem from Andrew Niccol, and amazed at the total transformation of Justin Timberlake from boyband singer to actor. As good as he was in The Social Network, he's even better in In Time.<br/><br/>The basic theme of the movie - where everyone stops aging at 25, however, after that you are only given one year and time is now the currency; in order to keep living you need to acquire and save up more time - is an interesting one. If someone were to compile enough time, one could be immortal. But, oh, there are serious and deadly consequences.<br/><br/>Just as in our current day and age, ""this future,"" has a tough economy and times are tough. Most people are living day-to-day ... literally. You run out of time, you run out of time.<br/><br/>Our hero played by Justin Timberlake is just one of those suffering out the tough economy. Much like Niccol's Gattaca, this too is a cautionary tale. And, the way the rich seem to hord their fortune of time, seems to be a metaphor for the way the less fortunate are treated in our current day and age.<br/><br/>Packed with action scenes and suspense, I really enjoyed the film .... and the chemistry between Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried.

After that they have one year left on a clock which displays how much time they have left. They can earn more time but everything they need to buy costs time. This means that the rich can live forever if they avoid danger but the poor don't live long at all. It is also frighteningly easy to steal time some any ghetto-dweller with more than a few days on their clock is likely to be robbed.<br/><br/>The story starts with a wealthy man, with over a century left, going into a bar in a poor area and buying everybody a drink. Local man Will Salas warns him that he is likely to attract the wrong sort of attention and have all his remaining time stolen. It turns out that was his plan; not everybody wants to live forever. The two escape together and later on, as Will sleeps, he gives him almost all of his time before heading off to die. Will wakes but as he when he goes to share some of his luck with his mother he is too late; her clock runs out just before they meet. He determines to overthrow the system so uses his new found time to head to the rich area. Here he gains much more time in a poker game. The authorities have noticed his sudden increase in wealth, and suspect he must have stolen it, so the 'Time Keepers' are sent to arrest him. He manages to escape, taking Sylvia Weis, the daughter of one of the wealthiest men, with him. With the Time Keepers in pursuit they flee to the ghetto where most of their time is soon stolen. They must find a way to gain more before Will, with his new accessory, can set about destabilising the system. There are unexpected consequences though; as he gives time away thefts rise and not everybody can deal with their newfound wealth.<br/><br/>This is an unusual thing; a dystopian sci-fi that is more thrilling that depressing. That isn't to say that the central premise isn't quite dark. The idea of time literally being money is quite dark; the poor are literally living day to day; if they don't get more they will die. Also they aren't depicted as the 'noble poor'; they are desperate and many will resort to theft or can't deal with unexpected wealth. Of course the rich come across as worse as they live potentially endless but boring lives at the expense of the poor. In this setting we get an exciting thriller; Justin Timberlake does a solid job as Will Salas and Amanda Seyfried is fun as Sylvia; the rich girl who joins his cause faster than you can say 'Patty Hearst'; they have a good chemistry. Cillian Murphy also impresses as the Time Keeper leading the operation to catch Salas. There is a fair amount of impressive action and there is plenty of tension as we can literally see peoples' final seconds ticking away. Overall I enjoyed this far more than I expected and would definitely recommend it to fans of the genre."

","IN TIME bears some similarities to LOGAN'S RUN in its depiction of a youthful society who never outwardly age and who are consigned to oblivion at the age of 25. However, the narrative then takes on an extra twist and runs with it (literally, as it happens) in its depiction of time being treated as a currency; you can buy, sell, and steal it, and when it runs out (which you know thanks to a handy tracker on your wrist) you die. It's as simple as that.<br/><br/>I actually like the premise, which has the potential for lots and lots of suspense; it's like having a ticking bomb strapped to your wrist. What could go wrong, right? Well, the answer is most things. IN TIME is an insipid, soulless Hollywood blockbuster, happy to copy the look and style of recent films like JUMPER without ever bringing anything new to the table. Kiwi director Andrew Niccol once made the excellent GATTACA so it comes as a surprise he made a film so unoriginal and uninteresting.<br/><br/>One of the worst things about this film lies in the central casting of Justin Timberlake as the hero. He's wooden, never less than wooden, and merely cast due to his popularity with audiences. I hated his protagonist throughout, so that made the film as a whole hard to sit through. Amanda Seyfried is better, and Cillian Murphy is always a pleasure to watch on screen, but when you have such a vacuum of acting talent in the central role then your film's going to be flawed. It doesn't help that the family-friendly rating means that there's nothing contentious or powerful here, or that for a film with a chase-focused storyline there aren't really any good action or suspense scenes to enjoy."

The economics of the world are downright absurd. But even if you don't care about that, it features an endless parade of actors doing their darnedest to be non-emotive and devoid of personality.<br/><br/>The premise seems to have been used as an excuse to put together an ensemble of pretty 20-somethings, who are working hard in every single scene to be sultry and jaded. Sultry and jaded are okay for a 30-second perfume ad, but they don't work so well to keep us involved through two hours of sci-fi clichés.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy's relentless policeman is perhaps the most inadequately explained character. We're never provided with any motive for his determination to prop up an outrageously inhumane and plainly unsustainable regime -- except perhaps that, well, he's been doing it for a long time now, so, I guess he, like, feels some sort of force of habit or something.<br/><br/>Timberlake and Seyfried have shown signs of real talent in other productions. But any such talent has been carefully hidden under wraps here. Like everyone else, they come across as sullen, slow-witted and drab.<br/><br/>The second star was awarded only because the movie makes some amusing use of various locations in Los Angeles -- with a weird cameo from the casino in Monte Carlo -- and because I liked the way the production designer enjoyed remaking ugly cars from the '70s as high-style vehicles of the future."

In that way, society has divided into people who live day to day and people who are basically immortal. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) lives day to day in the ghetto. Rachel Salas (Olivia Wilde) is his mother. One day he rescues a rich Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) who is tired of life and leaves him 116 years of time.<br/><br/>This is a great sci-fi concept. It's awkward to try to keep track who are older and everybody's relationships. However I feel there's something missing. The concept wasn't exploited enough. Half the time it's trying to explain the world rather than showing you the world. And the 'ghetto' isn't as rough as it ought to be.

And who produced and directed 'Interview With the Vampire?' I suspect some sort of ego scenario here.

All people have neon green time clocks embedded into their forearms indicating how long they have left to live. The visual on this could have been done way better.<br/><br/>So but possibly it's not an ego scenario.

","It amazes me how many people think this film is original. I can think of quite a few films (All better) than this: ""Bonnie Clyde"", ""Logan's Run"" and Les Miserables"" are obvious, but you also see ""The Chase"" with Charlie Sheen and Kristy Swanson (The poor outlaw (Sheen) kidnaps rich daddy's girl (Swanson), and she becomes an outlaw herself), ""V For Vendetta"" and even ""Son of Dracula"" ( Where Katherine Caldwell (Louise Allbritton) was willing do anything (Including sacrificing her sweetie, Frank Stanley (Robert Paige)), in order to get immortality. This theme was also shown in ""Death Becomes Her"" (With Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn & Bruce Willis). That said, there were only three ways to make the film work none of which were the theme this film: 1: A comedy. 2: An action film. 3: Suspense. What was also needed was an enemy that is really evil like Damon Killian (Richard Dawson) in ""The Running Man."" Although Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) was the antagonist of the film, he was not really bad. The father (Phillipe Weis), could have been, but he showed himself to be a quitter (Unlike say, Dalton Voss (Ray Wise), Swanson's evil father in ""The Chase"")), which is true like just about everyone else except (Leon (The best one in the film), Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried), and of course, Will Sales (Justin Timberlake)). Spoilers: The ending of the film with Timekeeper Jaeger (Collins Pennie), telling everyone to ""Just go home"" after Leon dies, is like the poor accepting death throughout the film, basically accepting things the way they are instead of fighting back. I admit just before this film, I watched ""Snow White and The Huntsman"", another film that dealt with others dying so a chosen few can live, so I could make a fair comparison. Basically, ""Snow White & the Huntsman"" (Although it has a quite different theme and setting), was a superior film. More action, more humor, a much better villain (The Queen (Charlize Theron)), and everything else (Particularly the lack of thought into the environment of the film: The ""Casino Royale"" ripoff card game, the bland cop cars, and failure to use proper colors in the movie are just a few). There is one exception: Amanda is hotter than Kristen Stewart ""Snow White""). You get the point, this is not my favorite film, and a waste of time. 2 of 10 stars"

","If all you understand is the sci-fi thriller part of this, you should still enjoy it; there are car chases and bullets flying and action-y music and people climbing fire escapes in the night: all that thriller stuff. It's done well. <br/><br/>Plot: In the future, longevity science has reached its pinnacle, and everybody is given to age 25, physically frozen there, plus given one ""gratis"" year to set up an adult life, which counts down on a readout on your wrist...and as a consequence, time--your own time left to death-- becomes the commodity that we work for, trade for, spend, and that rich people horde by using up poor people. Poor people, running madly from one job to another, pushed harder and harder by inflation and rising work quotas, living in dangerous conditions with their peers, always at risk of having their few remaining hours stolen, fight the countdown. Endlessly they fight it. Many lose the race, get ""timed out,"" their clock stops, and they fall dead on the street. (But they sure look good when they do.) Poor people inexplicably waste their precious minutes on booze and low-level gambling. Our hero, a ghetto wage-worker, rebels against this and becomes Robin Hood, stealing time from the wealthy and returning it to the poor, whence it came.<br/><br/>What's so clever here is that, of course, this is the world we already inhabit. We sell our precious limited moments to corporations in order to buy stuff we don't need that they advertise to us on their corporate television programs (both in the programs and via commercials) and we don't say ""no"" or use our critical minds to see what's going on. We buy lottery tickets and stuff on credit. And so they eat up our lives and we keel over dead before they do. (in the US, if you are poor, you can actually do that on the steps of a hospital and if you have no insurance, well, good riddance to ya, is the attitude of the plutocrats and the hospital administrators who work for them.) I found myself laughing and nodding through this as clever points of similarity arose.<br/><br/>And this is what s-f does well, when it works. It says, here, let me tell you this wholly imaginary tale about the future or another planet, but it's really holding up a mirror about today for those who have the wits to see themselves in it.

","I admit I am the type of person who doesn't always see the flaws in a movie, especially if I am taken in by such things as metaphors or deeper meanings beneath the surface. I was really taken in in this movie. Imagine a world where living day to day is literal and not a metaphor. In the world of ""In Time"" if you are poor then you are literally watching your own personal clock and should that clock run out then your life ends. In this world time is the currency and if you are poor then there is no time for leisure because you are literally spending the time you have left. In comparison if you are rich then you have nothing but time to spare. The richest could potentially have millions of years and could potentially live forever without a single moment's fear that their life might suddenly end. I think this really added a poignant emphasis on the problems of capitalist society and the differences between the haves and the have-nots. In the real world not having enough money might mean you don't eat regularly but in the world of this movie it literally means that the next day may be your last day.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was fairly well executed. The writers took common phrases, ""time out"", ""upper hand"", ""spare some time"", ""spending time"" and worked them into the world and the way these meanings could change if it was time and not money that was the currency. There were feelings, very vague feelings, of Les Miserable (the ""time keeper"" who was almost like a kind of police force, living for the job and rather than for justice and ""keeping order"") and Bonny and Clyde (the male and female partners robbing banks though there is also a robin hood feel to these characters as well). I am not sure if these similarities were deliberate or simply what I picked up on.<br/><br/>I did not feel that one had to follow the movie too closely or pay attention as much as some movies in order to follow the story. I though it was well told and had some undertones that are perhaps easily missed under the action and more blunt aspects. As it is though, it was a movie I think deserved higher ratings than it got."

And just as money is key in our society - time is currency in this one. And just like money, it can be earnt, stolen, bought or given easily. <br/><br/>So why would you want to live forever? Because you will always look, and feel, 25. And who doesn't want that? (Unless your mid-20s were pretty crappy)<br/><br/>Pretty good concept, right? Enough material in there for plenty of social comment, right? Don't worry – that does come along later<br/><br/>But the first question your mind is probably spluttering at this point is - 'wellhow did this HAPPEN?'<br/><br/>And therein lies the first, and biggest, problem. <br/><br/>That is never explained. <br/><br/>Ever. <br/><br/>And the movie is quite brazen about the fact – Justin Timberlake's voice over says so –"" I don't have time. I don't have time to worry about how it happened. It is what it is."" <br/><br/>I thought – 'Oh Justin – we're BOUND to find this out later, surely?!' <br/><br/>'No Andrew, you're not', said Justin, improvising brilliantly from the script.<br/><br/>'Okay', I thought – 'No matter – I'm in. I learnt not to question too much with LOOPER. Let's see how this goes'.<br/><br/>And the first half does – at quite a pace, but not so quick that you don't understand what is at stake here. You have a certain amount of time – if you run out – you fall down dead. High stakes indeed. So – two things happen to Justin that makes him angry enough to tackle 'the man'. 'The man' is actually an entire community – barricading themselves in the centre of the city – New Greenwich – with a constant reference to how 'expensive' everything is. 3 days for a cup of coffee? It's not even Starbucks All of this is quite entertaining, and Timberlake – now back on script – manages to be charming, but also willing to take a risk with his own life – it seems – at the flick of a card. (I know that's not the phrase – but when you see the movie, it will make sense.) Then Justin meets Sylvia – played by Amanda Seyfried. The second half then chooses to almost ignore what makes this film interesting – and instead encourages you to care what happens to Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried as they go on a Bonnie & Clyde/Robin Hood adventure purely because they are NICE PEOPLE. And you'll sit and enjoy it because – hey – everyone loves NICE people, right? <br/><br/>Ultimately, this is not a bad movie. But it could have been great."

Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried give acceptable performances and work well together to become a believable, futuristic ""Robin Hood"" couple. The story seemed to drag on a little long. However, it takes an unexpected twist, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The color schemes worked well.

So, it is a beautiful cast. For me, Justin Timberlake does a more than adequate job as the leading man: our Jack Dawson with an ankle holster. Amanda Seyfriend is supposed to look pretty and pout a lot and she is good at that. The wig does nothing for her and the chemistry between her and JT is lacking, but it all works for the most part.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy as the bloodless, but in his own way honorable, Timekeeper Raymond Leon is the stand out, must watch, performance of the movie. Even though he's stolen Neo's attire, Murphy has logged another great turn as the bad guy. Or is he the bad guy? Arguable, but he is under-utilized in the movie, unfortunately.<br/><br/>I also dug Alex Pettyfer's gleeful turn as the fancy-boy gang leader who embodies the complete opposite of the movie's real antagonist- apathy. The writers blew his fight scene with JT by providing the back-story to JT's father. If that scene weren't terribly predictable, it would actually be a great scene. <br/><br/>Besides pretty faces, the movie also has a creative hook- time is money. From that rather easy analogy, all sorts of comparisons with real life can be readily made, and the movie does SOME of that, though it isn't heavy-handed about it. And that is a GOOD thing since have we not seen it 100 times before? Class warfare 101. The rich are evil and trying to kill the poor, or at the very least, monopolize the world for themselves. Yada, yada, yada.... zzzzzzzz<br/><br/>The problem with all this is that the world the movie is set in is so illogical that it is difficult to logically draw any conclusions from it. In this world, death has been conquered, and yet, there are no cellphones. There are no cops, and few weapons; this in spite of the fact that your life can be stolen with a simple turn of your arm! <br/><br/>When the unfortunate Bonnie and Clyde portion of the movie begins, JT and Amanda only need to stroll into a vault to steal time. Why the crowd that was there didn't steal it in the first place remains a mystery. They could have. There was nothing to stop them. <br/><br/>Plus, death has been otherwise conquered, but you can die, by your arm being turned. Sorry, but medically try to figure that one out once.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is next to preposterous, a culmination of the off-track final 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Still, it isn't the least entertaining thing you could choose to see.

","One of the two main problem of this film is the marxist excrement that resides within its veins. The fact is that the main factor that drives the plot makes no sense at all: people are able to be healthy and young forever, however, society has developed in such a way to make people die due to the fact that ""people must die"" and the film also assumes that ""many must die for a few to live forever"", why? It makes no sense at all. Healthy people that don't age would make the world economically much richer than anything we could imagine: that would essentially mean that the near totality of the population would be in the labor force, therefore maximizing per capita economic output. Also, economists understand that there is no such thing as a problem of overpopulation.<br/><br/>The other main problem of this film is the fact that Justin Timberlake doesn't know how to act.

"jonathanruano","7","1","2","17 October 2012"," In Time
","""In Time"" is a quintessential left-wing film which shrewdly exploits the Occupy Wall Street movement phenomena which gripped the United States at that time. This film finds a clever way to underscore how close the poor are to dying of poverty by creating characters with biological clocks who die once they run out of hours and minutes on those clocks. The only way not to run out of time and avoid death is to take out loans or work for low wages. So the strong impression one gets throughout this film is that the poor are always on the edge of subsistence.<br/><br/>As for the plot of the film, it's essentially a simple version of Robin Hood. Without giving too much of the plot away, the hero Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) eventually joins forces with Sylvia Weiss (Amanda Seyfried) in order to steal from the rich in order to give to the poor. Yet strangely enough, ""In Time"" ends up playing much better than it should largely because of the charismatic screen presence of Justin Timberlake. Timberlake is much more than just an appealing pop singer; he's also a talented actor. Although he is not given much to work with, Timberlake succeeds in making Will Salas an entertaining bad boy with a heart of gold who takes to the Robin Hood lifestyle like a fish to water. Another actor who injects some life into this formulaic film is the much under-appreciated Cillian Murphy. Murphy does not play a cardboard villain, but instead reveals something insightful about the psychology of an extremist. Like many extremes, Murphy's Raymond Leon (which reminds me of the police officer in Les Miserables) believes unquestioningly in the righteousness of his cause -- which is to make sure that the existing social hierarchy is preserved and that time never enters into the wrong hands."
"colemanhines","7","1","2","15 October 2012"," Truthful, but understated
","The movie was done rather well, even though it could've been longer and more thought out, especially towards the end. The premise is set sometime in the future, but obviously portrays a world that is similar to our reality. Ie: The rich control too much of the wealth (time/life/money) while the poor starve and suffer thanks to the immoral social rationality and misguided idealism this/that world chooses to poison itself with. Will Salas (J. Timberlake) is a normal young man from a very poverty stricken part of the world who happens upon a fortune (great amount of time) by saving a stranger's life. A man seeking to end his time on Earth (simply because he is tired of living) gives his remaining time to Will, seeing that he will put it to better use than he can. This sets off a chain of events where Will meets the Weis family (most notably Sylvia- the female lead) and then begins to understand, firsthand, the ways in which the rich flaunt and hoard the wealth that could so easily save millions (ie: the ways the rich rationalize their situation/s to ease their conscience so as to block out the atrocities they indirectly cause). The rest of the movie is somewhat underwhelming with a good love story and a great moral message. The main point the directors try to convey (speaking directly to the world we live in), is that while money is infinite, wealth is finite. At a certain point if you have to much of it, you are stealing, albeit indirectly, from the rest of the population. Who, by the way, have just as much right to exist as anyone else, including the rich (most of whom were born into it). No matter what your last name is, who your parents are, how smart you are, where you were born, what color you are, etc.... if you are born of good circumstance, it is a position of responsibility and not of power. Therefore, taking advantage of it is, in fact, immoral. Honestly, the movie was bland and the acting so-so. But, the message of this movie is vastly understated. It is one that this world should heed before it's own greed suffocates the very freedom our ancestors fought to preserve: That those who were born with everything have an innate responsibility to share with those who were born with nothing. That, in our current system, all of us no longer have a right to life, liberty, and THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS."

","Most individuals, at least in the USA, will, at some age, get into the capitalistic market looking for to sustain their life: where else is there to go? Decades ago, man had his position. He could provide for himself and his family. Children would obtain their father's position and have to provide for themselves and themselves. Somewhere, man staying his position. Maybe the assurance of an easier way to make a residing with assures of amazing earnings, benefits, and old age benefits drawn them to provide their own indicates of creating a residing. Children no more had their fathers place; they now completed up with in and began their way of way of lifestyle on another individual's position. I think the factor that put me off this film initially was Justin Timberlake. I usually think twice at films that celebrity the newest 'hot body' that usually does not display much in the way of doing abilities. Anyway, since there wasn't much else on at the films I established that I would actually give this film ago, particularly since it exposed up to drop into one of the 'Philip K Dick' groups of films. Changes out that it is not really depending on anything. It was really complex to get an analysis on this film while you're placed there viewing it. You can usually get to the aspect where you're familiar with the projects certain celebrities choose and whether you're a fan of their performance or not. There was a meeting all over the place. Olivia Wilde was the first indication that this probably wasn't going to go well. As I've described before, Wilde is awesome on ""House MD"" and is very knowledgeable but her broad variety seems so restricted in the films she selects to be a factor of. Alex Pettyfer was another name I wasn't satisfied to see. His holiday in I Am Large variety Four wasn't really anything to be amazingly satisfied of. Now that I think about it, I Am Large variety Four and In Time are quite similar; shine in the black arms/hands, an exciting idea resulting in a frustrating outcome, and both films being in the sci-fi category among other factors. However though, Timberlake is a quite cost-effective doing professional. As a big fan of The Group System, I was seeking to see Timberlake improve his doing feet a bit more. He's quickly the most wonderful personality of In Time by displaying the greatest broad variety of feelings. Amanda-b Seyfried progressively smashes out of her invest, but she usually spends 50 % the movie being too rich to really have any need for emotions or do anything a little bit well-known. I was thrilled to see Cillian Murphy as he's usually very unforgettable, frightening, and/or getting in some way with his performance but he was just as boring and smooth as nearly everyone else around him. If nothing else, if this entertainment groundwork encourages further considered into this globe, perhaps that is the real value of this film. Even if all the potential viewers are looking for is an exciting bit of wish film art, I don't think many will be dissatisfied. As I said, I was originally more than a bit not sure at first, this could have been much more extreme . . . but I will recognize (perhaps it's a bit of a responsible pleasure), it was quite fun to look at."

He then proceed in taking a hostage, and in true Stockholm- syndrome they go on a Bonny and Clyde rampage believing to be Robin Hood distributing time to who ever they feel deserve it. <br/><br/>This movie made me feel like I was watching a sci-fi from the 70's, with the same plot line regarding society as ""bad"" and changing it's core structure is the solution to all problems. (Even though the large amount of people left dead in their trails should indicate otherwise) And with a character gallery that is so transparent and one dimensional you start to wonder if the script was written by a high-school student.<br/><br/>As for the rating: Cillian Murphy is a great actor, and the clock-effect was nicely done.

Sometimes, when the rest of the movie is done well enough, I'm willing to overlook the lack of subtlety. Unfortunately, this movie isn't really done as well as I'd like, but it's still enjoyable for what it is.<br/><br/>The concept, as many people have said, is quite good: in the future, a corrupt system is put in place, where genetically engineered humans stop aging at 25, yet have only one year to live after that. Everything they buy reduces their lifespan, so most people end up living desperate lives in a near-panic, constantly attempting to find enough work to survive another day. The wealthy and powerful, on the other hand, live for centuries, with no worries.<br/><br/>The execution is a bit heavy-handed and clichéd. The plot is predictable, and most of the points raised are a bit simplistic. Of course, the antagonist is a mean, old, wealthy capitalist whose philosophy basically amounts to ""screw the poor"", while the protagonist is an idealistic young man whose charisma and daring acts of valor threaten to topple an entrenched totalitarian system that's been stable for over a century.<br/><br/>Still, I like Niccol's work, even if it does get a bit didactic and heavy-handed at times.

","This movie could have been great. The idea is very original-- set in a dystopian future where people live forever as long as they have ""time"", this world's currency. But lack of a coherent plot/storyline, bad script, and no character development really keeps this movie back.<br/><br/>When I first started this movie, I had almost no expectations (having not even seen the trailer). After about 10 minutes, I was pleasantly surprised. The world that it was set in was a very refreshing idea. However, soon after that, I began to saw the many flaws. It seemed that each of the main characters had a complete lack of fluid character development-- they were almost all completely one dimensional (With the characters that ""changed"", it did not feel like a natural progression-- it seemed forced).<br/><br/>The blame isn't fully on the actors, however, as the script dialogue seemed awkward at times and choppy at others. It really kept the movie from being believable. Especially the cliché ""time"" related one liners that one or another character would say. What were they thinking?<br/><br/>The plot, too, had massive holes that kept me from losing myself in the movie. A lot of the times it didn't really make sense. And many parts of the story brought up, but not expanded upon. It almost seemed like the director added those scenes in as an afterthought.<br/><br/>Overall, if you have a couple hours with nothing to do, ""In Time"" is worth watching if just for the interesting concept. It really is a shame because I think this could have been done much better."

","Usually I don't like, don't watch sci-fi. But the reviews here & elsewhere were intriguing, transcending the genre. And Amanda Seyfried usually is watchable no matter what. Dropping a dollar in the red vending machine turned-out to be rewarding cinematically.<br/><br/>This film has been called an ""action movie,"" a ""sci-fi"" flick. What it is is an ingenious ""morality play."" Congratulations to the writer/director and Fox for greenlighting it, no pun intended relative to the embedded arm timer(s).<br/><br/>We've all heard, ad nauseum, that ""time is money."" And that's the poetry of this production, to take that which is ordinary, known, obvious maybe, oft stated, and overlooked, and restate it in a way that captures and captivates. In this film time IS money, and therein also is its genius of concept and revelation.<br/><br/>Is the plot perfect in every regard about which some reviewers are nitpicking? Not sure; probably not. It's not important though. It's close enough to be sufficiently provoking. And it's original, creatively so.<br/><br/>TIME also is LIFE itself, stating the obvious. Without it, money does not matter, the old ""you can't take it with you."" And by flipping the time-is-money thing used mostly by bosses of the world as a people-prod - those who have plenty of money that others often are making for them - it hits close enough to human nature to make one think sitting there in the cinema seat, on the couch, commenting on how we value what we have, or don't have - and those who are greedy hoarders. Those who have TIME have LIFE. And since time is currency in the film's world, it shows us ourselves in an original, clever, and even poetic way - in today's cinema vernacular of guns, action, and violence.<br/><br/>The one-day-at-a-time sub-theme was interesting & stimulating.<br/><br/>This film is an intelligent concept staffed with actors good enough to make it really interesting. Timberlake was fine, even well cast; Seyfriend is nearly always totally watchable, and is here, too. Her make-up and hair was effective, almost subduing the Seyfriend look, while emphasizing it for a futuro effect. Good job.<br/><br/>The '70's retro-techno-non-piston (I think) cars were a warpish concept, interesting for some kind of future world & alternate universe environment. ('70's Detroit product was America's ugly automotive nadir, opening the door for the Japanese.) However, as other reviewers have noted, the Jag car crash early in the film looks like '50's model not-so-special effects. It's so bad it seems out-of-place in a film that otherwise is slick. The money must've run out here in the real world ...<br/><br/>Filmed with the ARRI Alexa, the digital capture uses a lot of the ugly fluorescent green and sodium orange available practicals of our real world. But it's effective, especially for the grittier parts of the action. To see how digital and available light can look superb, see Soderbergh's ""Contagion.""<br/><br/>As for ""In Time,"" it's that rare original concept where the Hollywoodie stars & production make it work effectively & provocatively. Bravo."

What really holds In Time together is the intriguing story. I think it is a good Sci-Fi story that is entertaining throughout.The writing is a bit eh, there are cheesy lines and action clichés. In Time has pretty good cast with: Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, Olivia Wilde, Cillian Murphy, & Vincent Kartheiser. The performances are what you expect; they're good, but nothing special. Timberlake has always stood out as a good actor and I really enjoy seeing him as an actor. Seyfried still sucks as an actress and I don't think she'll ever be good. The best performance in In Time is by, Vincent Kartheiser. Kartheiser is an extremely talented actor and his talent shows in this film. In Time may lack in many aspects to be a good film, but it didn't stop me from being entertained. Overall In Time is an OK film and can be a skip for some."

","I wanted to love this movie, I really did. I enjoy the sci-fi genre so much, that I even bought Sucker Punch and Battlefield Earth, and haven't gotten tired of watching either one of those movies yet. It's pretty hard to find a sci-fi movie I don't love.<br/><br/>This movie had everything going for it; intriguing concept, incredible cast, and the action-adventure scenes certainly weren't lacking, in any way whatsoever.<br/><br/>What was missing from this movie was the entire back story, and at least for me, that's the most important part. I have no problem enjoying B, or even C rate sci-fis, with cardboard cutouts space ships, just as long as it has a decent back story.<br/><br/>The entire point of sci-fi is to explore the possibilities, to answer the question ""What if....?"" Well, this movie explored possibilities, but to what? That question is critical, it's the entire basis for the story. It simply doesn't make any sense to create an answer, for a ""what if?"" question that the movie never even formulated.<br/><br/>What I mean by this is how did the conditions created in this world come about? Obviously, medical science found a way to prevent disease, and stop the aging process, but fear of overpopulation alone is not enough of a reason for those ""time"" devices. There are other ways to prevent overpopulation, including simply sterilizing the population at birth, which certainly would be far more humane. A civilization with the technology to halt the aging process surely has the technology make ""test tube"" babies when replacements are needed, so why not? This alternative solution is so horrifying, who could possibly have come up with it, and why would anyone ever agree to it? <br/><br/>Exactly how did those time clocks get on their arms? Was it genetically engineered into human beings? Or is it implanted in the hospital at birth, and if so, no one's figured out that they could save their children from suffering this fate by giving birth at home? If not, why? <br/><br/>Seeing how ""stealing"" time was just fine, why wouldn't most, if not all, big strong men with 30 seconds left on their clocks, just turn around and find the closest, smaller weaker person and take some of their time by force? After all, if your only other choice is to die, it's self-defense. Who wouldn't defend themselves against certain death? <br/><br/>Developing and incorporating a back story to explain the circumstances under which the conditions in this world were created, would have made the movie more interesting and enjoyable. For example, ""WHAT IF... there had been an impending disaster of such magnitude, that it threatened the very existence of the entire human race? One so dire, the only possibility of survival, was by having 95% of the adult population work 10 hour days, 7 days a week, keeping them young and strong to ensure they could maintain 100% production levels that were absolutely necessary to survive, etc...<br/><br/>Instead, there's no back story, nothing to explain how or why those in power are anything other than evil despicable, single dimensional, selfish monsters, who see nothing wrong with not only letting others die, but deliberating creating circumstances to ensure they do. All just they can live forever, in the lap of luxury. They have no qualms admitting to it either.<br/><br/>Even the evilest of villains can usually come up with better rationalizations to justify their actions than that."

It's written and directed by Andrew Niccol, who also helmed the similar themed 'GATTACA' which was quite good. Niccol also wrote 'THE TRUMAN SHOW' which was a very good film as well so it's a little surprising that he handled this one so ham-handedly. The film stars Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried and Cillian Murphy and Murphy is the only one who brings anything to the table. The film as a whole is very clunky and disappointing.<br/><br/>It's set in a world where people stop aging at 25 and will die a year later if they don't earn enough currency to prolong their lives. Time is traded as money and the rich live as immortals while the poor scrape by what ever they can just to make it another day. Your remaining time is worn on your arm, in a digital readout, and scanned to pay all monetary transactions. Prices and taxes are raised all the time without warning in order to keep the weak majority at bay. Timberlake plays Will Salas, who lives with his mother (Olivia Wilde) in the ghettos and never has a full day's worth of hours. One night he helps a rich man, Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), from being mugged and killed in a bar by gangsters known as the Minutemen. Hamiltion repays Salas by giving him all his remaining time, 116 years before committing suicide. He passes on some words of wisdom and lets Will know that everyone could and should live a happy natural life and then die. Will is then suspected of murdering Hamilton and goes on the run with a millionaire's daughter, Sylvia (Seyfried), he meets while flaunting his new money. The two begin robbing from the rich and giving to the poor while trying to disrupt the system and avoiding the Timekeeper (Murphy), who polices time.<br/><br/>The idea behind the film is the perfect social commentary and is especially relevant to our times and modern economy. Life in the film isn't really that much different from modern reality. It's a shame that such a great idea was wasted though. It could have been the perfect Philip K. Dick type sci-fi film and instead we get a weak action film starring Justin Timberlake! His casting was the first way the movie went wrong but there's a lot more at fault to it than just that. Every word of dialogue seems forced and every scene seems like nothing more than the plot and action formula just pushing itself forward. There's no heart or character to it at all.

","""For a few to be immortal, many must die"" Philippe Weis, ""In Time""<br/><br/>It is with mixed feelings that I am starting to write this review. On one hand, ""In Time"" is a fun to watch, engaging movie with an original, thought provoking concept. On the other hand, and this is a phrase that I unfortunately have to repeat in too many reviews, uneven, lacking depth story did not allow the movie to fully realize its potential.<br/><br/>As much as Andrew Niccol, who wrote and directed ""In Time"" should be satisfied with the commercial success of the movie, he should be dissatisfied its overall quality. We expected a better script from the author of the smart and conceptually creative screenplay for the famous ""The Truman Show"". We expected more depth and insight into a human nature from the writer and director of the stylish, atmospheric, and mind bending ""Gattaka"".<br/><br/>While ""In Time"" never reaches the heights of ""Gattaka"" or ""The Truman Show"", the movie still worth watching as it bears some signature features of a typical Andrew Niccol's work: an original concept that touches various philosophical, moral, and ethics issues, a compelling mix of action, suspense, thrill, and strong emotions, a great cinematography (Roger Deakins), and a stylish directing. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, a delicate balance between the deep and thought provoking and the light and purely entertaining components of the movie is heavily tipped in favor of the latter, which makes ""In Time"" significantly ""dumber"" than it could have been. <br/><br/>The acting is a mixed bag, just as the movie as a whole. While Justin Timberlake's performance is solid, his action hero Will Salas still lacks the charisma, drive, and charm of the unforgettable Sean Parker from David Fincher's ""The Social Network"". <br/><br/>Similarly, Cillian Murphy is quite convincing as a merciless, relentless, driven Timekeeper, a police-like authority in the dystopian future of the Earth, sketchily portrayed in the movie. However, he is not as good, as he was in Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" where he played a smaller, but more professionally significant role of Robert Fischer – a multi-billion dollar oil company heir with a difficult relationship with his father. <br/><br/>While Cillian Murphy and Justin Timberlake were solid but arguably underachieved, Amanda Seyfried (Sylvia Weis) expectedly performed on her usual level – quite unexciting and unimpressive.<br/><br/>The true star of the movie turned out to be a less known actor Vincent Kartheiser who managed to accomplish a very challenging task – remaining believable while playing a century old man with an appearance of a young adult - magnificently well.<br/><br/>Of course, it helped that the Kartheiser's character, one of the richest men in the world Phillipe Weis, had the most interesting and complex personality in the otherwise bland and stereotyped character mix of ""In Time"". It is not a coincidence that he was the one whom Andrew Niccol entrusted with saying the least conventional, the most controversial, thought-provoking and emotionally charged statements.<br/><br/>The strongest of these statements is a statement of a fundamental, pervasive greed that almost uniformly affects both rich and poor. In the dystopian reality of ""In Time"", the society as a whole silently agreed to daily sacrifice the lives of the vast majority of its members in order to secure an eternal youth for a very small minority. ""For a few to be immortal, many must die,"" says Philippe Weis in the movie.<br/><br/>The sad irony of his words is that those who must die whole-heartedly support the order of things that is so deadly for them. Blinded by their greed more than by anything else they easily trade an opportunity for a normal, but finite live, for an ephemeral chance to join the small minority that possesses a key to an eternal youth - an ephemeral chance that surely brings a premature death instead.<br/><br/>Overall, despite the obvious flaws plaguing the movie, recommending watching ""In Time"" is almost a zero-risk game: those interested in exploring a peculiar web of intricate weaknesses and defects of the human nature should be more or less satisfied, those simply looking for a thoughtless Sci-Fi thrill should not be too much disappointed.<br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"

This is one of those unfortunate cases where an intriguing idea is utterly destroyed by a childish story.<br/><br/>Imagine Bonnie and Clyde in an overly capitalistic world that looks a lot like Equilibrium. People are immortal, biologically frozen at 25 years, but they have this ridiculous green glowing clock on their arms, counting down to a moment when they die. They use time as a currency, earning it, stealing it, buying with it. A very interesting concept, an abstractisation of reality. But they botch it up!<br/><br/>A society that can genetically engineer humans with a glowing clock on their hands can also insure some cryptographic safety in the mechanism, so that people don't steal it away. The cars sound electric, but they are normal looking. People work in factories doing meaningless tasks, computers seem to do only voices and almost anything can be done with a single gun and a bit of determination. It makes no sense.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are so bad that it makes teeth ache. Such an interesting idea and such a poor job implementing it. This is barely a 6 movie and I was very close to a 5. One should avoid it."
"antoniotierno","7","1","2","23 February 2012"," interesting and unsettling
","A science-fiction movie set in a future where people could live forever, if they didn't have a time limit on their lives. It shows a very good plot and continues having a lot to say. Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried are the futuristic Bonnie and Clyde, whose destinies are crossed with Robin Hood, stealing from the rich and giving it to the poor. The movie is decent, acting-wise, and soon turns into a chase film examining all the possible moral quandaries. Cillian Murphy as well, playing a Timekeeper — cop charged with making sure people stay where their place in society — is an interesting character. In Time has its rhythm in the right place, it's not a masterpiece but certainly clever and original."
"queeniete-299-402348","8","1","2","22 February 2012"," Excellent movie!
","A very excellent movie, In Time is just as good as other popular sci-fi movies like Inception, Star Trek, Star Wars and a lot more. Not only did this movie make the watchers tingle on their seats but also teach them some life lessons. I personally recommend this movie to those who love the world of technology. I really liked this movie and it has blown me off from the very beginning of the story.<br/><br/>I could prove that this is an excellent movie for three reasons. First, it has very captivating effects. Every sci-fi movie needs to have good effects, or else they wouldn't be called sci-fi. This movie has succeeded in capturing the eyes of many watchers. Second, the concept of the movie is unique. Whoever thought of the plot has a very creative mind. True, it may seem unrealistic but still, the plot was very appealing and definitely worth watching. Lastly, the morals watchers could get from this movie. It shows us that discrimination between the rich and poor still exists, even in the future. Watchers can relate to this since that discrimination is still evident in the present. It also implies that not all the wealthy succeed in the end.<br/><br/>I hope that the movie industry would make movies like this one. It will surely bring success to the entertainment industry and perhaps, change the world of technology."
"e_newman","Null","1","2","17 February 2012"," Time really IS money...
","I found this movie to not only be engaging, but refreshing in its originality. In an era where remakes and comic book story lines have been exhausted, it's nice to sit and watch something original. I was surprised at the number of negative reviews on this movie. I feel as though everything this movie attempted to address, it nailed. From the lack of balance and equality among the haves and have-nots, to the credible depiction of an age-old comparison of time and money- they do a fantastic job of taking something we've all thought about, and making into an entertaining, action packed, thought provoking movie.<br/><br/>I also think Timberlake brought the intensity that the role deserved and required, and I can't think of any actor that would have served the role better. He left nothing to be desired when it comes to bringing his character to life. The notion that for a few to be immortal, many must die is the crux of the film, and it subtly addresses that reality in our society using an imaginative story line. Great movie, and kudos for originality."
"JohnRayPeterson","6","1","2","6 February 2012"," A very smart metaphor
","Don't let the storyline dissuade you from watching this movie. You will come quickly to realize that the story is a beautiful metaphor for the timeless (no pun intended) class battles, ruling rich versus everyone else. It does a splendid job of showing us how the ruling rich perpetuate their dominance over the masses. The truth is as true today, and especially today, as it was in ancient times. The more knowledgeable you are about history and about economic systems, the quicker you will get the metaphor. For the less knowledgeable viewers, the movie should help clarify these facts.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of Timberlake, as I have no doubt written a few times in past reviews, but He has had a string of good parts, roles, characters, which he more than adequately delivered. So, again I find a way to recommend a movie in which he stars, despite myself. Andrew Nicol wrote and directed this movie; his recent list of credits shows he is worth paying attention to. I have no great fondness for many of the details of the production, but the underlying story and message is so smart that it surprised me and impressed me enough I will happily recommend it for that value alone."
"Robert_duder","7","1","2","3 February 2012"," Genius concept falls into the gaping plot holes
","I think In Time would have made a genius TV Series where they could have spent a lot of time making sure details were covered. Instead In Time takes an absolutely brilliant premise, a potentially strong social message, and delivers it to the specific teen genre and loses itself into some major plot holes. You could spend hours trolling the boards on IMDb to discover just how many plot holes the film has. A sci-fi movie/action movie is bound to have significant plot holes. It has to make you suspend belief and not even notice it but the problem with In Time is you do notice the plot holes. You will stop numerous times and think to yourself...wait that doesn't work...and why would that be the case. Fortunately for the movie the premise is just really cool and the world they create is significant enough that the film is redeemable and watchable. It disappoints me perhaps even more that the idea is so good but the delivery is flawed.<br/><br/>I adore Justin Timberlake. I think he has a BIG career ahead of him in film. He seems to absolutely shine in comedy (SNL, Friends With Benefits and even the deplorable Love Guru.) As an action star he is decent, his character is good, the film is sort of a futuristic Robin Hood story. He has solid chemistry on screen and carries the film well but sadly it won't be his break out role I think. Amanda Seyfried is bizarre in this movie. That's the only way I can describe her. She has a sexy vibe in the movie but her character is almost purposely robotic. She has this strange look about her and her behavior is robotic but its almost as though she is supposed to be that way. Cillian Murphy is a terrific villain and he is good in this movie but he isn't great. His villainous character almost feels like its held back in some way and he doesn't get to open up enough. He's a strong actor but the script seems to hold him back. Seyfriend and Timberlake's chemistry is okay but isn't as hot as they try to make it out to be. The lack of really strong chemistry between the lead cast holds back the film as well.<br/><br/>Writer and director Andrew Niccol has come up with a phenomenal take on sci-fi that also tells a very real version of the way the world is becoming. Unfortunately I think the studios expected him to dumb this down to get it into the minds of pre-teens and teens instead of making it a smart, savvy, thriller. All that complaining aside it isn't a bad movie. It has moments of being really entertaining, thrilling, some great car chases, and shoot outs and some unique style to it. It isn't beyond redemption, it simply doesn't live up to the original concept. 7.5/10"

","The most interesting thing about this movie was the idea, in one phrase, time is money and money is time. Sadly, the story wasn't fascinating and were many characters that don't belong in the story: the love story between the main characters wasn't believable - it was a kind of Bonnie and Clyde couple, but with no chemistry at all, all that chasing and robbing it was just to give the blockbuster touch, the timekeeper - an state employer that cannot be corrupted, but dies when he tries to bring justice, a gang that makes the law in a bad neighborhood, a rich man that gives away a fortune in time currency and dies, fortune that will end being confiscated by the police after a short time. I thought that Will (Justin) will discover some kind of conspiracy made by the world leaders and becomes a hero, revenging the poor, but all was resumed into stealing a fortune. I had some expectations from this movie, but I was totally disappointed."
"eve_dolluk","4","2","7","3 November 2011"," Complete Mess
","I will start by saying that this film is mildly entertaining so don't be totally put off.<br/><br/>Basically in the future people live until 25 any TIME after that needs to be earn't through work. Essentially TIME = MONEY, except in this case if your run out of time your dead. We don't know why or how that's just the way things are in this future world.<br/><br/>There is too many things to mention that make this film a mess and it mainly revolves around the plot holes and sequences that make no sense. Basically for the film to move on to the next scene a character has to do something that makes no sense for the film to move on. This happens over and over and over until you just get annoyed that your wasting your PRECIOUS TIME watching this film. When I say time I mean money or do I.....<br/><br/>There are some good points, the premise for the film is interesting and grabs your attention very quickly.<br/><br/>The acting is OK, JT is the likable hero and Amanda Seyfreid is the likable Heroine. Cillian Murphy plays the Over enthusiastic can't be bought cop and Vincent Kartheiser plays the rich Father who is only interested in Time ( Money ). Not exactly deep characters but hey who cares at least the popcorn tastes good.<br/><br/>The action is decent although they missed out on suspense, things happen to quickly for you to be worried or care that time may run out. This is where the film fell down, one minute its a mad rush to find time next its all relaxed and they act like they have all the time in the world, why... because that's the way the film rolls. A character will do something that beggars belief so that these things happen for the film to progress but hey who cares, hows that popcorn tasting.<br/><br/>The FX and scenery are average so there is no wow factor on that front, in fact I think to save money they kept things as they are today which saves building a futuristic world. Cars, clothes, buildings were all same as today. I'm not sure how far in the future this film is set but I'm guessing over 150 years. We are never given this information but I guessed by going off some of the characters actual ages.<br/><br/>Overall its a silly popcorn (yum) flick with a great concept that could have been very good, instead its just a mess from start to finish albeit a mildly entertaining mess !!!"

","first of all, what's the purpose of making this lukewarm movie stand out among those already played older but definitely much better sci-fi movies? there's nothing excited about this movie and the scenario simply failed to get people connected during the viewing. a ridiculous storyline and horrible formulaic gesture by asking all the actors kept watching their arms to verify how many years, days or minutes they gained or lost. the screenplay was just awful and boring. the scenes they arranged to shot this film were just overly used bridge, storm drain canal in los angeles, or the curvy pacific coast highway. cars looked extremely antique, old models but all electric, but when the guy rushed on the pacific coast highway, the engine sounds still gave off combustion noise that could only generate from a gasoline piston engine. the sound effect guy(s) should be fired. there were so many better movies in such genre, maybe hundred times better than this bore-to-death, brainless, sleepy movie. actors in this movie also performed mindlessly due to a spiritless screenplay and a non-talented director. a big yawn to lure the people who got insomnia to finally have heavy eyelids.

","In Time was an interesting and entertaining movie set in the distant future where humans were genetically altered to stop aging at 25, at which point they receive one year of time. Then, they must earn more time to live, and, when they run out, they die.<br/><br/>The movie did a great job of highlighting the different classes. The poor lived day-by-day and hour-by-hour. They watched their time closely and always lived near death. The rich, however, had unlimited time and resources, but they lived in fear of someone killing them for time. The movie had great social commentary - using time instead of money.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake did a great job as the main character who is given a century of time then becomes a future day Robin Hood, stealing time from the rich and giving to the poor. I loved Timberlake in Social Network, and he shines here as well, dominating the film with a captivating performance.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried did a good job as Justin's love interest, who lived a trapped, sheltered life in a wealthy family. After being held captive by Justin, she falls for him and they face their future fighting the system together.<br/><br/>In another excellent performance, Cillian Murphy shines as the Timekeeper trying to stop Justin's character. Although I still picture him as the creepy Sandman from Batman, he does a great job as a timekeeper living day-by-day but committed to protecting the system.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was entertaining, had engaging actors, and made you think about what it would be like to constantly figure out how you would survive day-by-day collecting time to survive."

","In the future ""time is money."" Literally. People live to 25 years old, after which time they have one year left, then they die. The good news is that you can buy time and live forever, but only the rich can do that. Everyone else is struggling to stay alive. Currency is done in time, transferred by computer chips installed in the forearm. A cup of coffee will cost you 4 minutes of your life. I kept thinking about ""Logan's Run"" as I watched this film.<br/><br/>The cliche possibilities are endless and they are not shy about using them. ""All the time in world."" ""Got a minute."" ""Too much time on my hands"" ""Who's got the time?"" ""You must come from time."" ""Taken years off my life."" ""Drank his life away."" ""Too much time in the wrong hands..."" ""I had the time to buy one of these."" ""Thank you for your time."" ""The time he has taken."" ""It would take a million years."" Ouch!<br/><br/>""Hey big spender, spend a little time with me."" ""I'd give a year of my life just to spend an hour with her."" These didn't make the cut.<br/><br/>Timberlake plays Will Salas, a man struggling to pay the bills and stay alive along with his mother Rachel (Olivia Wilde). Will saves the life of a rich man who was 108. He wanted to die. From him we get the class warfare speech of the movie. Many must die so a few might live. Taxes and prices are raised to make sure the poor die. Like most science fiction features, they have a social commentary.<br/><br/>While Will was asleep, the rich man gives him his time so he can die. Rich people literally live in a different ""time zone"" so they don't get mugged by those who work for the weekend.<br/><br/>Timberlake is 5 stars in comedies, but as a dramatic actor, he was unconvincing in this role, which may have been the director's fault. Will is supposed to have passion to distinguish himself from the cautious rich. He lacks, he should have never been in that role (Keanu Reeves spoiled us). Timberlake would have been more convincing as a rich tycoon. Much of the acting was stiff by design, but that made for a bad movie. Other than the time devices, the technology was circa 1985 with no pay phones, 80's automobiles, and no cell phones.<br/><br/>No real sex or nudity. One f-bomb."

But do not watch this movie if you have any critical sense what so ever."
"chris-bushwacker","2","1","3","15 December 2013"," Laughably awful
","As many have said already, this is a great idea but poorly executed. There is zero tension or excitement, and only a few minutes in when JT's mother is down to her last few seconds of life and racing towards him as fast as she can, she might as well be running in a vacuum because no-one cares if she makes it or not and JT's unbelievable ""crying"" when she drops dead in his arms was so hard to believe in I laughed out loud. There are countless movies with stirring scenes when the main character is stripped of everything and kneels, tears streaming, in pouring rain/desert dust/ruined landscape, vowing NEVER to be put down again (Scarlett O'Hara for one) but ""In Time"" takes a time-honoured device, uses it too soon, messes it up and throws it away.<br/><br/>And so it begins on its relentless downward spiral, with the googly-eyed Amanda Seyfried, as vacant as a plastic doll, playing the role of stupid pointless bimbo being dragged along by the hero. Even Replicants have more personality. Nobody here seemed as though they were trying, and don't get me started on the super-wooden Alex Pettyfer with his London bloke accent. Maybe it was a deliberate decision to have the desperate masses with their lives running out before their eyes seem mechanical and unreal, while the villains (the rich, the timekeeper) are infinitely more real. Perhaps they alone can afford the time to develop a real character.<br/><br/>Vincent Kartheiser gives a slightly detached performance (having clearly placed his feelings in a bank vault along with his centuries) but where we might reasonably expect some menace we get very little. He is even quite amiable for someone who must by now have seen it all and has the economic freedom not to have to suffer fools gladly. He has been more chilling in certain episodes of Mad Men, so blame must be placed on the script and the careless flabby direction.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy does a good job with stupid dialogue, giving his performance a world-weary spin that indicates he just can't believe what he is being asked to spout. Occasionally he wanders around with his hands clasped behind his back thinking deeply, but this unfortunately does not result in him questioning the power of those he represents, nor the system he upholds on their behalf. And really he needs to, because it is so precariously designed a criminal five year old could see opportunity in the yawning gaps.<br/><br/>For an elite group of people to apparently rely on only one timekeeper to keep things ticking along in the various time zones (and he constantly operating on dwindling minutes - when do we ever see him with more than about 45 minutes between life and oblivion?) they must have the utmost faith in his ability when he is little more than a time gambler himself. Every step he takes away from his car is tempting fate, and I would not sit easily at my boardroom table in the rich district if he was the only guarantee of my safety and continuing time-wealthy existence.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake is just OK, but then he isn't really asked to give more than that, with a storyline and silly script that doesn't stretch his abilities, other than the ability to take his shirt off and peer through dirty windows in between bouts of running and driving. My criticism is reserved for the writer/director (whose name I have already forgotten and cannot be bothered to check) and for whichever individual did not dispense some well-needed discipline in his direction.<br/><br/>Other than that, the truly terrible Amanda Seyfried needs singling out for her empty one-dimensional ""performance"", which was so bad I will make a point of avoiding her in anything else she ever appears in. Sorry."

I was disappointed.<br/><br/>I really enjoy clever films that on the face of it are simplistic, but if you put thought into it, it's a clever comment on society. District 13 is a great example of this, sadly In Time isn't.<br/><br/>From the beginning, the film comes at you straight on with no subtly at all. They are living day to day as many in the world do and near the end of the film they even say ""there's enough to go around..."". Also everything that you expect to happen does: mum doesn't quite make it to son, bad guy loses the fight, girl and guy survive etc.<br/><br/>I'm being very critical though. There were some interesting moments that draw you in and at some points you do care about the fate of the characters.<br/><br/>Altogether, I'd say watch it if you want to watch something that doesn't require any thought, but don't watch it if you enjoy something with a bit of substance."

To make it worse, he's playing a guy from the Gheto, he just doesn't have it in him, those eyes are just too bright with privilege. To be fair on him though, he didn't have much to work with script-wise, it's awash with nonsense. I actually gave a genuine comedy laugh near the end...I won't supply a spoiler, but there's a stand-off between JT and a timekeeper, it would have been parody gold, if it had been intended to be a parody. The rest of the cast do a decent job given the cringe-worthy dialogue they were supplied with, but the whole thing is just confused. The moral direction of JT's character has zero substance or continuity and the shift in his girlfriend's character comes out of nowhere.

But I must say it does make me understand the medium much better than most people. I doubt, seriously doubt that even 1% of the reviewers on here have seen movies from the entire 134 years which moving pictures have been made. Of course I haven't seen all of them. That would be ludicrous to claim. But I know what movies are, and what they can be...<br/><br/>And this movie was a truly good one. It was engaging, thought-provoking, took you in, you care for the characters, you ever so curiously found your way around a plot and there was action, suspense, intrigue and solid Hollywood ending. I challenge anyone to explain away the contrary.<br/><br/>Science fiction is a thoughtful medium. In movies, it cannot ever be what we read in a book. That is nearly impossible. This science fiction movie, while dystopian in nature, managed to have a heart, a premise and a plausible resolution. Was it perfect? I dare say, no movie has really come close - not even the greatest of them. After all, we imperfect beings are the creators of them. And because of this imperfection, our intrinsic realities will come to surface in them all.<br/><br/>This movie was no exception.

I guess they were just trying to make some political class warfare message, but even with that they could have done a heck of a better job.

Amanda Seyfried's performance was disappointing and really didn't feel like she was a correct cast choice for the role she played. However, the story of the movie is different and keeps you thinking about how the world they exist in works. This is where the frustrating part enters as you start to find plot holes in your mind and certain stupid decisions characters make.

","Contrary to many of the other reviews I have read regarding this movie, and indeed contrary to my accompanying movie buddy, I thought it was awesome. The plot is pure genius, the time-as-currency metaphor is a clever social observation and the interplay of the two is written real well into the dialogue. Before heading to the movie theatre I took a few minutes to acclimate myself with the plot; which was well worth doing as the movie itself jumps quite quickly into the main story without explaining the premise in much detail, which adds to the confusion a little, and means you don't truly appreciate how smartly conceived this movie is until maybe the next day, having thought more about it. In terms of execution I enjoyed the future-meets-retro styling (i'm calling it Futro because i'm creative like that). This is most evident in the vehicles, but also in the costumes, hairstyling and architecture. Often it's easy to imagine the future as a blank canvas of high technology and spaceship-esque style, but the future imagined here is much more realistic of our repeating retro trends, which I guess adds to the movie's ""this could actually happen in our lifetime"" feeling; with the added bonus that it looks cool! The 3 main characters were well played, although Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried did not have the greatest chemistry, it never felt that they were truly working together either in or out of character. The Timekeeper character could have perhaps had a little more screen time, Cillian Murphy's role was limited mostly to looking moody while chasing after Timberlake and Seyfried. Toward the end the character seemed to show potential for a lot more depth that was not realised. Once again it is an example of where this movie lets the audience work things out for themselves rather than ram the plot down their throats. So in conclusion, if you have the time to truly involve yourself in the movie and understand the underlying messages and plot twists then it is well worth the admission, otherwise, for the more casual viewer it can understandably leave you confused. I say, take the time."

It isn't a direct lift of the plot but certainly of the premise of Lee Falk's ""Time is Money"", published in 1975. Lee Falk died in 1999, so probably there is a reason why there hasn't been a challenge to this from his quarter. Since he wrote The Phantom and Mandrake the Magician comics, he is well known enough to not be just laughed off. Couple that with the publish of the short story in Playboy in 1975 should be enough evidence to at least get a writing credit as prior art. His estate would have to challenge it though. Great that the story I remembered fondly got a good treatment never the less. Hopefully he will get credit where it is due.<br/><br/>http://tinyurl.com/cowbxvz"

As the trailers and such tell you, a person gets 25 years, plus one, that one is the one they can spend, starting at age 25. So if time is just a commodity, why would the poor bother having kids? To even feed one kid in this world would cost too much to get your kid to it's first birthday. The only time work for pay is mentioned and one can do the easy math that one doesn't even make enough to sleep a whole night in the worst motel.<br/><br/>Another case in point.

The point is pure silliness, as the best option for any logical human, would be to find doctors and such, that would stop the arm clocks!

","The plot deals with a ""future"" where ""time is literally, money"" and people drive 1963 Lincolns and Cadillac Sevilles. Almost all the driving incidentally is
not on I-5 but constantly in and around that tried-and-true holllywood set: The Lost Angeles River and a couple of the mandatory bridges. (I say mandatory because I think in the City Charter someplace it must have a clause that requires every third film to include a chase along the river and/or on the bridges).
The story isn't terrible, but it comes close. And the entire film reeks of a film made on pocket change. Unless there's a mistake in some of the details, this film cost about $40,000.000.00. Maybe they meant $40,000.00.
I absolutely can't believe it cost anywhere near that amount.
That wondful film ""Jessie' cost less than a million dollars to produce. It didn't look at all like a shoestring budget film except that the only thing we ever saw about police headquarters, was the office of Jessie's boss.
That may have been an oversight because it couldn't have cost much to get a couple of shots of a busy police headquarters. Good old stock footage should have covered that adding a mit more realism to the film.
$40,000,000.00??? Either that was a big type or there's a lot of fancy accounting going on there and like Desi used to say: ""They got a lot of 'splainin' to do""."

The idea of this is certainly interesting, but In Time fails to deliver. the entire movie gave off a very ""student film project"" vibe. None of the characters are likable, everyone is about as wooden as Keanu Reeves in the Matrix, and on top of that people show an entire lack of compassion for their fellow man (such as seeing a dead body in the street, ""look there's another one"" remarks Borel, but no one cares they just walk by like there's no body there), even people who have nothing to lose by showing compassion (such as the bus driver who pretty much condemned Will's mother to death by not letting her ride the bus, which is of no cost to him to let her on the bus, KNOWING FULL WELL THAT SHE WILL DIE BEFORE SHE CAN MAKE IT TO HER DESTINATION. this is the equivalent of you trying to hop on a bus to get to the hospital while bleeding to death and the bus driver tells you, ""no fare? no ride."")<br/><br/>nothing is explained in this film at all. why were people genetically engineered to stop aging? why is time used as currency? why are there ""time zones"" and what are their purpose? what stops a person from simply walking past the time zone? a car barrier thats 3 feet high isn't going to stop someone from simply hoping over it without paying the toll. at what point in time did humanity switch to running on time? why has civilization not advanced at all in what appears to be at least 100 years, especially if some people are apparently immortal? more specific things are not explained at all as well.<br/><br/>when Time Keeper Raymond exclaims ""doesn't he know hes hurting the people hes trying to save?"" why is it never explained how this hurt people when Will gives them free stolen time? if it is so dangerous to give out free time, then why the happy ending when a million years are given to the ghetto? who did Will's father take time from when he was a ""fighter""? why is he made out to be some sort of folk hero? if he was fighting other people in the ghetto and giving away free time as it is implied in the film, why bother killing someone to redistribute their time (which should only be a few hours anyway since people in the ghetto apparently live day to day) if Will's father was such a good fighter, then how did he die? who is the organization that Philippe Weis is conspiring with? what is their purpose and why? why do the Time Keepers need the Minute Men to handle business in the ghetto? there is no apparent gain for them to do this.<br/><br/>if Henry Hamilton was so eager to die, then why didn't he just go give his time away to the Mission anonymously? why go through all the trouble of trying to attract attention so you can get killed? if Will was a fugitive with a hostage from the Time Keepers, why would he then go home? wouldn't you think that would be the first place they would look for him? and there is so much more thats not explained.<br/><br/>all in all, the film was as i previously stated, simply not very good. don't waste your time or money, wait for this one to hit cable TV and watch it if you want to see a sub-mediocre film that feels like it was made by a college sophomore."
"the_rattlesnake25","5","1","4","20 December 2011"," 'In Time' is a few seconds off....
","According to statistics from the United Nations, there are now seven billion people inhabiting this planet and with this figure the issue of overpopulation is once again reignited. Andrew Niccol's latest feature explores this concept of a dystopian future where the population is curbed by the time you are allowed to live for, and while it is a simple, yet innovative concept, it doesn't quite live up to expectations. 'In Time' is the typical cinematic case of having a really interesting and promising concept, but being unable to capitalize on any of its potential, leading to a disjointed plot and a poorly paced narrative which ends up simply recycling the same old sequences again and again.<br/><br/>It is sometime into the future where time has replaced currency as the fruitful commodity of civilisation. Once every human being reaches the ripe old age of twenty-five years old, a clock begins on their arm which counts down the time until their death. Death can be postponed and time added to any civilian's clock through the completion of work and other related day-to-day tasks within society. But with the cost of living continually rising, time starts to become an increasingly valuable commodity which thrives with the rich and desecrates upon the poor. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is just another patron of the ghetto; he lives his life from day-to-day with his bodyclock constantly teetering on the edge of expulsion, but after a chance meeting with a seemingly immortal wealthy socialite Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), Salas is given the opportunity to experience the other side of the divide. Prosperity, bodyguards, and luxury await him in New Greenwich, a place where immortality is no longer a myth, but with his new found life comes new and dangerous obstacles for him to overcome.<br/><br/>Salas's narration opens the picture by announcing that there isn't enough time for him to explain why society is time-centric and biased heavily towards the wealthy, and initially this doesn't provide any distraction from the narrative. But once the third act begins, plot holes begin to originate due to the lack of information being relayed to the audience. With a constant lack of engaging material to keep the audience hooked on the plot, the film becomes somewhat stale and formulaic. Also, instead of intertwining the plot with a deep-seated moral and financial message aimed primarily at those who are at the centre of the current economic recession, Niccol's script fails to dutifully act upon the message it wishes to convey and stops short. This is no more evident than in the final concluding sequences of the picture, which contain some ambiguous socio-political sentiments regarding the nature and solidarity of the human race when it comes to change, difference and revolution. Despite gearing up to make a resounding point during its conclusion, 'In Time' instead decides to take the safe, Hollywood and financially friendly studio route instead.<br/><br/>Following on from its constant lack of engaging material, the nature of 'In Time's' formulaic plot creates a repetitive sequence of events which becomes very old, very quickly. Once Salas has teamed up with a rebellious, yet incredibly wealthy socialite Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried), they attempt to repair their imbalanced society through a crime spree. Coming off as a futuristic Bonnie and Clyde, bank-robbing, hold-ups and Robin Hood-esque deliveries of time to people who are less fortunate becomes their mission. However, while this aspect initially provides moments of exhilarating action, the repetition of each sequence, almost down to a tee, quickly takes away from its impending impact. Essentially for the entire second act, and the beginning of the third, Salas and Weis relatively easily break into banks, steal time, distribute the time among the poor, and then hide in a downtrodden motel where they don't expect to be found, until the street-smart Time Detective Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) deduces where they are and initiates an attack upon their location.<br/><br/>This repetition becomes increasingly tedious as the remaining running time of the film dwindles by, resulting in a rushed and poorly crafted final act in which each character's own stories are tied up quickly to give the appearance of some form of a conclusion as the final credits roll. Unfortunately 'In Time' has a very interesting premise, but Niccol's failure to create an engaging narrative beyond the first act leads to a film which ends up regurgitating the same sequences over and over again as the characters motivations become devalued in the face of lacklustre set-pieces."

","Will(Timberlake) lives in a different world than us. Since it's barely futuristic at all, I'd say it's more appropriate to refer to it as an alternate reality than merely something set years from now. In it, time is the only currency(and this point is hammered home... one thing is that the word replaces the word ""money"", but there are painful puns on that, where the meaning of common phrases are turned into something else, such as how here, ""do you have a minute"" is the equivalent to ""spare some change"". The points made are great, the communication could sometimes use some work. Niccol's biggest flaw is that he tends to overwrite scripts when he has something to say, and the conveying gradually loses subtlety... with that said, there are bits where it is spot-on, and the ending of this is fantastic), you do not age beyond 25(leading to a world where most people are supermodels... to be fair, the film itself does poke fun at this aspect) at which moment your life will only have one additional year, and you can now earn more by labor(and don't expect to be able to pay debts, taxes and the like and have much at all left for yourself or your family). The metaphor is entirely clear, and not only does this this fit nearly perfectly with the current Occupy movement, some of the better of the plenty of good, quotable dialog in this lends itself to slogans for it. Our hero does go on to fight the wealthy elite, who do not enjoy their lives because they're worried about losing what they have, so they take no chances. Some of the logic and consistency is a tad iffy. He is joined by rich girl wanting to break free from her sheltered existence, Sylvia(Seyfried), and they do the Robin Hood thing. While the inclusion of a romance between the two is predictable, the execution isn't bad. The characters are memorable and their arcs tend to be convincing. This has some of the shallow Hollywood standards going, with the poor being largely honorable and doing little wrong(if it does admit that a lot of crime happens in the ghetto... however, this feels like it's blaming those in power for creating that situation, which is true a lot of the way... still, no one is that black and white), and, well, you can guess how the other side is portrayed. I like that our main cop, Leon(Murphy), is clearly a person of integrity, he's not drunk on power. The acting is impressive. This is the first thing I see Justin in, and I would like to see other movies starring him. Though the action is somewhat derivative and uninspired not to mention in very brief stints(Andrew is not comfortable with the genre, and I support him sticking with what he does well, see what immediately follows this parenthesis), this gets quite intense. There is a little moderate language(one strong, as per what the PG-13 rating allows... and it's placed so well), mild violence and somewhat disturbing sights(when your clock runs out, you collapse from a heart attack) in this. I recommend this to anyone who cares about the current political and financial situation, as well as fans of thought-provoking thrillers. 7/10"

The 2nd thing that annoyed me is that Timberlake character's plan was stupid and short term oriented. His idea of bringing the system down was to steal time from the rich and give it to the poor, so basically: provoking on the long term inflation (the rich classes are still well off then!), collapsing the economic system and not solving anything because they would still have those frigging timers on their arms! As everyone is still dependent on time when they use up all the time Justin Timberlake's gives them, what's next? The movie never questions who is behind the timers, who controls them, how they are implemented on babies, how to get rid/hack them. All the characters accept their fate and the ""solution"" of Timberlake's and Seyfried's character are reinforcing this behavior and messing up the whole economic system without proposing an alternative. <br/><br/>i get that in the future there is a necessity to control resources, by increasing the death ratio of people from the poor social classes... but in any case, i think that Timberlake's character is not changing anything in the society portrayed in the movie."

Imagine: ""live quick, die young"" could be literal: you can spend your allocated life-time for a luxury but short life; another example: earn/spend ratio, the ratio between the time your earn for doing a job and the time you spend on that job; a job with earn/spend ratio more than 1 is an ""immortal job"", in theory you can live forever because your time will never decrease... I can go on forever.<br/><br/>However, few of these interesting topics about time currency is interpolated in the film. It is a shame to see such good concept wasted; In Time is nothing more than a cliché boy-girl- run-away-fall-in-love and car-chase-gun-fire movie. The time-as-currency concept is merely elaborated as a count-down-to-zero-and-you-die mechanism to create feel of intense. It works for a few times in the beginning. And then it is used a lot.

","Andrew Niccol has a knack for taking his time. He's a writer/director, so I guess that's part of it. He also takes great care in worldbuilding, creating some of the most interesting universes I've ever seen. Gattaca's world spurned imperfection, The Truman Show's planet was obsessed with one man's life, and The Terminal reduced the world to an airport for a lonely man. All in all, he's a clever Kiwi.<br/><br/>I sat through In Time and I'm done praising Niccol.<br/><br/>In Time paints a picture not so unlike our own. The poor struggle to make ends meet while the rich live in their walled off sections of the city. The currency is time and the clock starts when you're 25, giving you just one year for free and ample opportunity for time-based jokes. I just don't have the time to tell any right now. BAM! Also just like in our world, when you run out of money, you just drop dead. The poor can't get to the rich parts of town because it takes too muchtime. Enter into the picture pauper factory worker Will Salas ( and his creepily young mother (Olivia Wilde). He has a chance meeting with a wealthy (timely?) man who transfers 100 years into his arm/bank. All heck (heck I tell ya!) breaks loose when he starts getting more time (takes time to make time!) and gives it out, upsetting the balance. The wealthy cannot STAND for this time-rage and time sends time cops to time arrest Time Salas and bring him to time justice. In time.<br/><br/>Niccol's previous works were subtle, with a very well-defined world. This one seemed haphazard. How did humanity get to a point where they agree to only live to 26 for free and let the wealthiest live forever? The rich might have power, but there's a heck of a lot of everybody else to violently overthrow that idea. Why did everybody display their personal worth in big, bright letters on their forearm? You'd think if you could be killed for having too much time (liberal arts majors died off quickly), you'd have that little tidbit hidden. Maybe a futuristic HUD so you can tell where you stand without prying eyes craving your goodies. Everything else in the world seemed lazy as well – 50s looking electric retro cars, everybody looking young, no changes in buildings, roads, or restaurants, on and on.<br/><br/>Story-wise, it was equally sloppy. It intertwines with the huge logic gaps in the world, but the plot seemed to be an afterthought fueled by a reaction to the financial situations in the world. Less commentary on the human condition (like Niccol's previous films), In Time seemed like an ""if I had my way.."" exercise. Neat! We should rob banks and give all the money away. That's totally how the financial system works and won't result in massive inflation or instability. I don't care if you want to take a stance against capitalism or whatever, just don't make it sooo heavy handed. It's like watching a Morgan Spurlock movie, something I rarely enjoy.<br/><br/>Top off the suck cake with icing called casting. Justin Timberlake as a poor working stiff? Really? They would have had to try pretty hard to find someone less qualified. I thoroughly enjoy Vincent Kartheiser in Mad Men, but I don't want Pete Campbell in my future sci-fi film. Cillian Murphy, however, was the biggest tragedy of all. I love this man in the not-queerest way possible and I will watch anything he does (also on the list: Jason Statham and Joseph Gordon-Levitt), but he came off as an incomplete character. He seemed confused, as an actor, as to why he was there, what he was doing. The answer to ""what's my motivation?"" apparently didn't give him anything to work with. Maybe the answer was ""Time! You're there for time! To stop time!""<br/><br/>I shouldn't be so irritated by a movie, but I am. The trailer said ""No, no"", but my love of Niccol's past work said ""Yes, maybe."" A waste of film, a waste of time."

","Critics these days have gotten pretty stupid, and clearly do not understand this movie. It's as if they read the book ""Animal Farm"" and started nitpicking things like ""Animals can't talk! Animal's don't know how to cooperate! Animals can't wear clothes! This book sucks! Huge plot holes!"" without realizing that it was actually a metaphor/criticism of communism. Similarly, In Time is a metaphor/criticism of capitalism, but instead of animals we have good-looking 25-year-olds. There, I explained the movie for you dumb critics and I hope you can enjoy it now.<br/><br/>The movie is an extremely good criticism of capitalism. It hits all the main points, and is pretty relevant for 2011 considering the recession and the OWS protests. Besides the intellectual goodness, it looks good as well. All the actors are good looking and sharply dressed. The sets and props are retro-futuristic. The special effects are good. Dumb critics seem to nitpick one scene (which I won't mention), but what they should be paying attention to was the glowing green tattoos that appeared all over, because I'm pretty sure those were all CGI, which was probably complex due to all the green light scattered.<br/><br/>So overall a pretty good movie. Compared to recent movies I have scene, I would say that this was much better than Transformers DotM or The Adjustment Bureau, both of which sucked terribly, but not as good a X-Men First class, which was very good."

","This movie is based on a great science fiction concept of a futuristic society which uses ""life time"" as money. This idea could have resulted in a superb movie, an intelligent critique of the Darwinian nature of the capitalist system which is very relevant to today's artificial financial crisis. This is something that only science fiction can accomplish so effectively and in a manner that shocks the viewer, in this case exposing the absurdity of the monetary system by linking it with the fundamental concept of life itself. One can see how successful this approach can be with other science fiction books/movies like ""1984"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"". A thinking director and script writer would have taken advantage of such a brilliant basic idea and they would have created a great science fiction movie. Instead we get the typical Hollywood treatment of a Bonnie & Clyde action flick, with gangsters, car chases, shooting and running, all under an uninspiring direction and no substance.

I am sure those who know in this life that lives deeper and many-sided than it seems and it seems the overwhelming number of people - this film sink into my soul. Thanks for the story and acting. <br/><br/>P.s. Some actors look much older than 25 years, although in reality, someone even younger than 25."
"classicalsteve","7","1","5","6 November 2011"," If You Can Buy the Premise an Enjoyble Dystopian Story, 2 Hours Possibly Worth the Time
","What if our bodies never aged passed 25, and we could conceivably live forever? Obviously, this is a situation most people would probably desire. Except, what if there was one hitch: that at the age of 25 we are given only one additional year to live, and the only means of extending our lifetimes beyond that one year, passed the age of 26, is to trade time like money which is in turn used to trade for other goods and services. A cup of coffee costs 4 minutes. A room in a sleazy hotel costs two weeks, while one night in a luxury hotel costs 5 months. A luxury car costs 50 years. A day's wage at a factory might give you a few days while working at a higher-end job can give you more. Rich people can make hundreds if not thousands of years, while poor people are often scrabbling to add a few days, hours, sometimes a few minutes, trying to extend their lifetimes long enough to allow them to get ""more time"". This is the premise of ""In Time"", in which commodities are not traded with money but with lifetime.<br/><br/>In this world, people can give their lifetime freely or may be forced to give up their time by the government or thieves known as minute men who mug people for their time. Time is usually not wasted but stored on devices which can be transferred to others. The amount of time each individual has is shown on their left forearm through 13 digits. Some people have literally hundreds of years while others are continually scrambling to add days. Once the clock on the arm reaches 13 0's, the person expires immediately. People can give time to each other by engaging in a kind of hand shake, although this can be done by force as well.<br/><br/>On the outset, it seems like a level playing field. But in this dystopia, it isn't. The world is divided into Time Zones. The lower numbered time zones are where people with thousands of years reside, while those in the higher time zones are in the equivalent of a ghetto where people are constantly fighting for time. To keep the lower classes in their place, it costs a hefty toll to pass between time zones. Will Salas lives in Time Zone 12. His mother, who doesn't look a day passed 25, is celebrating her 50th birthday. Over the course of 25 years, she's been able to add time, but like most people living on the edge, she has to take menial jobs to add time. On her 50th birthday, she doesn't have much time left according to her arm.<br/><br/>Will goes to work, and upon check-out receives his pay, an increase in time reflected on his arm, although he complains his pay was lower that day. After work, he goes to a bar and meets someone from one of the lower-numbered time zones. The new-comber shows his arm which indicates he has over a century left. Will warns him he will be the target of muggers called minute men who will try to steal his time. He helps him escape, and later learns the man is 105 years old in real time, although this man says he's ready for his life to be over. They fall asleep, and the stranger gives Will a century of new life, leaves the premises and dies shortly thereafter.<br/><br/>Will now has over a century of life, but doesn't realize that there are governmental forces in place to keep ""time"" out of the hands of the lower classes. Using his gift, he enters into another time zone where the wealthy reside. He begins to mingle with the elite, some of whom have hundreds if not thousands of years to spend on luxury cars, luxury mansions, and casino gambling. As one character put it ""Many must die for a few to be immortal"". He meets an older gentleman Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser of ""Mad Men"" fame) who is 75 years old, again who looks very young. Weis owns time banks which loans out time at inflated prices in the other time zones allowing him to be a kind of Donald Trump of time. Weis invites Will into his circle and introduces him to his daughter Sylvia Weis; unbeknownst to them Will is from the lower classes and wanted by the time police.<br/><br/>The only aspect I felt was missing from ""In Time"" is a further explanation of the nature of time itself and how it came to be traded to buy commodities. We learn how the world works but are never told how the technology came into being and if there was a time before when lifetime wasn't traded. I expected a scene where maybe the two leads would find out the inner workings of how this came to be. I also wondered if there was a means of ""turing off the clock"" but the story never questions its own premise.<br/><br/>Still a very interesting idea and works if you buy into the premise. The analogy is maybe a little obvious, in the sense that we are all constantly trying to buy time to some degree. The constant references of the prices of goods in terms of ""time"" are quite amusing, and done naturally and tastefully. One of the best scenes is when Will engages in a poker game in which the ""time"" stakes become very high."

Are they using mind control to transfer credits or what! The acting is pretty appalling. Justin Timberlake is not going to be the next Matt Damon, that is for sure. Cillian Murphy just does what Cillian Murphy does and stares and scowls.

The movie tries to be a social commentary on the wall street protesters and the message is similar: banks are bad, anyone who have money are bad, those who don't have money deserve more and all good.

I just saw Real Steel in the cinema, ran downstairs to buy a ticket for In Time and I did not regret it.<br/><br/>In this movie, people live until they reach the age of 26. After 26 years they just die. So every people has a limit of time he or she can spend. In their arm is written how much time they have left. If you want to buy something, you can buy it with time. In this way you have less time to spend. But if you work and get paid, you get paid in time. Great story right? It doesn't stop there! The story writers got everything out of this concept to give you a great action movie what you would have expected.<br/><br/>There are different people; people who live day by day and who don't have much time and rich people who have all the time of the world and who want more time, even over the backs of the poor people.<br/><br/>Will Salas (JT) wants to get more time for the poor people (like a modern Robin Hood) and meets this rich girl Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried). They steel time from the rich people and are being chased by the minute men (people who steel time from poor people) and Raymond Leon (CM). The chase of CM and JT reminded me about the cat and mouse hunt of Freejack (1992) where Jagger was chasing Estevez and even this hunt was very exciting. I was waiting for CM to count his one Missisippi and two Missisippi, but in his head CM was counting backwards when he was left with only a few seconds on his arm.<br/><br/>Left all the realism aside, the story is not bulletproof. Sylvia Weis is living her life in the rich world, has never been in the poor area, and still she knows how people live in the poor area. I laughed when JT and SW kissed each other in the limo.

If some don't know what I'm talking about, JT is not a flat actor, but he is not an actor who knows to reach your heart by acting with a lot of emotions, like an actor as Russel Crowe can do.

","Let's see.. a film where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. What does that remind me of? Oh yea, the government. Instead of the currency being money, it is time. But in this film it all translates the same. The film illustrated that sometimes if you get too much too soon, it can lead you down a self-destructive path. It also illustrates that the less time you have, the faster you move. There is a lot of running in this film. I kept thinking that if that was me, I would have been caught by now. It also reminded me that I need to hit the gym. I think that writer/director Andrew Niccol did a really good job incorporating the Robin Hood / Bonnie and Clyde theme throughout the film. And although there was some explanation about how things work at the beginning of the film, it really did leave a lot of questions that were not answered. I guess the director did not want to waste our time (smile). I guess that I should talk about Justin Timberlake (Will Salas) a bit. Is there anything that this guy cannot do? He has jumped around film genres like a rabbit in heat. He has gone from bio-pic (Social Network), to comedy (Bad Teacher) and now a full out action star (and a headliner to boot). You go Justin!!! I still want to know when the next album drops (smile). Amanda Seyfried (Sylvia Weis) as the poor little rich girl became more likable as the film progressed. I thought that the chemistry between her and Will was well developed and portrayed. Every time I saw Cillian Murphy (The Timekeeper) on screen, it always reminded me of the nut-job he played in the Batman films. He was one dedicated cop. I think that this film did a good job in showcasing the class warfare that occurs in the future (or is that now I forget). It's really not too different from what is happening today. I do think that some of the editing was a little choppy, but that being said, I thought that the film is definitely worth the time. Although the characters spend a lot of time looking at their watches, you will not be looking at yours. The film was entertaining and I think it is definitely worth spending a little of your time. I give this film a green light (tick tock)."
"jburtroald95","8","1","10","31 October 2011"," One of the better science fiction movies to attempt to be political
","Fourteen years after the well-received Gattaca (1997) Oscar-nominated director Andrew Niccol has made a triumphant return to futuristic science fiction to show the countless other filmmakers who have tried their hand at this notorious genre how it should be done. Once again, he manages to create both a highly fascinating world as well as some engaging characters to populate it and a stimulating plot on which its fine conception is not wasted. <br/><br/>In this vision of the future, it appears that scientists may have finally discovered the age-old secret of eternal life, and have been putting it into practice on globally. People now theoretically have the power to control the duration of one's bodily existence down to the very last second, being able to continue topping up lifespans for as long as they please. What's more, the aging process has been genetically engineered to stop in everyone at the the age of 25. However, happy dreams of being forever young are but a fairytale: ""for a few to be immortal, many must die"" or overpopulation would ensue. The government's solution has been to make time the new currency, with people walking around with a luminescent countdown on their forearm showing them exactly how much of it they have left, and minutes, hours, days, months or even years being talked about as casually as if they were soulless pieces of metal and paper. It also ensures that longevity will be exclusive to the rich in this cutthroat economy where it's quite literally ""survival of the fittest"". ""Darwinian capitalism"" is what they call it, ""the next stage in human evolution"". <br/><br/>It certainly isn't fair, and it doesn't work either. Some members of the upper-class have been living for over a century, with still many more centuries under their belt, and one in particular, named has learnt the hard way that the mind may continue to rot and deteriorate even if the body remains fit and healthy. Therefore, being completely psychologically spent, he transfers all of his years to a spirited but struggling youth from the slums, after being assured that he would put it to good use. Initially he plans to use it to fulfill the well-deserved desires of his dear mother, but after she tragically dies as a result of the corrupt economy raising the price of daily living once again, he instead decides to pose as a wealthy citizen and infiltrate the mansion of a spinelessly immoral billionaire and whisk his daughter away on a righteous crusade to raid the time banks and hand out to the poor all the time that has been kept from them by merciless government agents known as ""time keepers"".<br/><br/>As is the case with many celebrated futuristic films and novels, many parallels can be drawn to societies at the other end of the time scale. This gives the story a dual sense of the retrospective and the ultra- modern both being present at once, like the ""future noir"" cinematic style introduced by Blade Runner (1982) and may even extend to highlighting historical patterns or cycles such as the book within the book in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Watching the dynamic duo fearlessly break into government institutions and return with something to provide the less fortunate with hope and stability, bringing balance to the uneven and unjustly feudalistic distribution of wealth and power, one is reminded of timeless idolised rebellious figures such as the fabled Robin Hood, the suave John Dillinger and the enigmatic Ned Kelly who engaged in similar activities and whose stories have given valuable inspiration to filmmakers. If not on the outset, then definitely at the slick and stylish ending, the political message is made loud and clear, with the film still managing to be engaging and inviting throughout whilst diminishing none of its thematic power. Some films depicting a dystopian future are so static and depressing that they fail to capture the audience's attention, with the perfectly valid underlying meaning being lost to miscommunication and poor execution, but the frivolous and refreshing tone of this film generously allows the audience to have some fun as they absorb the message, making it more likely for it to be understood and retained. After all ""a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down"". A world populated only by twenty-five-year-olds is bursting with liveliness and adventure despite the misery, and our very likable heroes have a winsome aura of invincibility about them that comforts the audience and fills them with optimism, just as they do for all those citizens who have been unfairly treated.<br/><br/>The design of the characters works splendidly well. The role of our spunky lead hero, Will Sallas, is handled very competently by Justin Timberlake, who it seems is on his way to becoming a full-time actor. A barely recognisable Amanday Seyfried just as capably takes on her role as Sylvia Weis, the plucky rich girl who has been living a very sheltered life, but is very quick to realise the reality of the world's situation and embrace the hard life that she and Will must lead. Inevitably, the two characters share an impulsive romance, but Niccol wisely doesn't let this get in the way of the main plot and keeps the focus on their connection as rogues rather than lovers.<br/><br/>In addition to these major aspects, the film is also peppered with countless delightful quips and memorable quirky moments that enjoy the potential humour of this world. Perhaps the most notable of these is an early scene in which Sylvia's father (a perfectly cast Vincent Kartheiser) introduces Will to his mother-in-law, his wife and his daughter, who all look exactly the same age.<br/><br/>Also featuring fine supporting performances from Olivia Wilde, Matt Bomer, Cillian Murphy, Alex Pettyfer, Yaya DaCosta, and Johnny Galecki, In Time makes for stupendously entertaining and very rewarding viewing."

"davidmvining","2","0","2","1 June 2020"," An embarrassment
","There are two major things to think about when trying to parse In Time. The first is the basic building blocks of story, the plot, characters, and structure. The second is the metaphor. Normally something like a metaphor wouldn't take a huge spot in analysis because it's usually not that prominent, but with In Time, there's just so much attention given to the metaphor that there's little space left for any of the other elements of storytelling.<br/><br/>This movie is really, really stupid. It's a surprise to me to write that even ten years after the movie's release and its reputation of a dumb, thin action movie metaphor has been solidified by time, but Andre Niccol is still the man who wrote and directed Gattaca, one of the great science fiction films that maturely approached the idea of genetic engineering in humans as a vehicle through which to look at prejudice. In Time feels like it was written by a guy who watched Gattaca once, felt like it needed a more obvious message and a lot more out of nowhere action heroics.<br/><br/>I will say, the early conception of how the world works is kind of neat. Time has replaced all currency after genetic engineering has won and everyone is kept at the age of twenty-five for the rest of their lives. It's the sort of concept that can support a short film pretty easily, but by stretching the idea out to feature length, Niccol took it past the breaking point. It simply stops making literal sense after a certain point, really once he tries to expand the world. A lot of what makes the concept stop gelling is the metaphor.<br/><br/>You see, Andrew Niccol doesn't like capitalism, but he doesn't seem to understand what it is. Instead of a creating a science fiction society where the economic system is one where free trade between willing individuals is the norm, he created one where an elite control a top down economy with extreme regulations around the basic transfer of wealth including simply moving from one area to another. You know...not capitalism. It doesn't help that the main bad guy, Phillipe Weis, says that the game of poker he plays with Justin Timberlake's Will is pure capitalism, the world of dog eat dog. A game of poker.<br/><br/>Fine, let's just give it its poorly thought out metaphor that doesn't mean what it think it means, and let's talk about the rest of the film. First things, first, the world makes no sense. It reminded me of Panem in The Hunger Games, but it felt significantly smaller, like the entire map shown in the office of the police was about the size of Los Angeles. That's an entire command economy ruled by an elite in a few hundred square miles. It's the sort of size that makes sense, again, in a short film format but makes less sense once pulled out to feature length. It makes the world feel small. The other thing is that, apparently, there's no industry in the world other than the creation of the little metal things people carry around to store extra time. Late in the film, all work stops when everyone gets a bunch of time, but what are people doing with that time? What are they spending it on because suddenly no one's making anything. Also, banks are shockingly poorly defended to the point that over the course of a week, Will and Phillipe's daughter Sylvia can ram vans through all of their glass fronts to steal all the time and hand them out to anyone gathering around. This world makes no sense.<br/><br/>Did you know there's a story in this movie? I mean, it's hard to tell with all the piss poor world building and thin and stupid metaphor, but it's there. Well, sort of. It's also stupid especially in its moments of ""high drama"". Will gets a hundred years from a rich guy tired of living, and as he goes to meet with his mother, she runs out of time as she's flying through the air to grab hold of her son in her final seconds. The sight is kind of hilarious. From there, Will decides to take his anger out on the system, so he goes into the rich part of town and...immediately goes to a casino. Where he wins a few centuries from a rich guy (Phillipe). It almost feels like this guy with a dead set purpose is just wandering around in an effort to accommodate world building, because that's exactly what's going on. He gets found out on suspicion of the rich guy's death (with police who are entirely uninterested in investigating a death) and immediately becomes an action hero, pulling guns from police holsters and firing perfect shots to escape, kidnapping Sylvia along the way. They become a Bonnie and Clyde type pair and Sylvia instantly falls in love with him (because they are both the leads, you know). It's all thin and stops constantly so that people can make the metaphor clear just one more time in case you missed the thirteen other times it's been made clear in the last fifteen minutes.<br/><br/>The movie looks pretty good, though. Props to Roger Deakins for keeping things in focus while probably wondering why he had accepted the job at all for weeks.<br/><br/>The more I think about the movie, the less I think of it. I'm happy to accept metaphor in film, but it'd be nice if it made sense and wasn't constantly repeated again and again and again. There are a lot of storytellers who have one good film in them. Niccol managed two: Gattaca and Lord of War. This movie is an embarrassment and Niccol should be ashamed of it."

","""In Time"" is American science fiction action film produced by Andrew Niccol. I have good impression about this movie and themes presented there. It is future dystopia where time is the most crucial value for everyone. Each person has a clock on his/her arm which shows how long they have to live. Society is stratified and there are times zones within a society. Time replaces usual money and it is presented as universal currency. In this dystopia rich can live forever, the poor must earn for more time.
The main protagonist Will belongs to the poorest zone where all live in poor conditions and have usually no more than 24 hours. People work for time and even take loans for time. They just try to survive and live as long as it is possible because every second counts. This zone considered to be a ghetto. There is also New Greenwich zone where people possess enough amount of time and able to live without worries for decades. When Will understands that there is enough time for everyone he aims to break this system.
In the movie it is presented as a norm to stop aging at 25, to use time as an exchange value for food, facilities, etc. The whole system builds on the basis of time. In my opinion, time represented as everything. We can see the strong stratification based on time resources. Societies divides on those who have time and those who do not have. When protagonist enters New Greenwich with high class inhabitants he tries to live their life. However, waitress understands that he is a stranger/outsider when Will eat very fast. In New Greenwich it is a norm that no one rushes because they have a lot of time whereas in his ghetto zone every second counts.
In my opinion, author wanted to show what is relevant to our modern capitalist society that we have enough money for all people, however only certain groups of elites/bourgeoisie own means of production and exploit others. The movie questions about what value we place on time at the time of neoliberalism. It is also demonstrates greed of New Greenwich inhabitants. They do not want to share with others because they want to live as long as possible. They want to live forever at the expense of others."

","This, ladies and gentlemen, is the most frustrating film I've seen. Not once. Not twice. Oh no, I have witnessed this approximately ten times, in an attempt to ascertain what exactly is wrong with it. Safe to say, several aspects are incorrect. The ultimate example of ""great concept, bad execution"". Set in a dystopian future where time is currency, a low paid worker is given over a century and plans to disrupt the system by giving time to poorer communities. The sheer utter brilliance of the idea, the conceptual amalgamation of immortality and wealth, is worth your time. A commentary on modern socioeconomic societies where the poor die and the rich live forever. Life comes at a price, and the cost of living just keeps on increasing so that the world does not become overpopulated. Culling the helpless. There are details within this future that bring the world to life and fully commit to its concept. Time Zones, ""timing out"", time capsules, Timekeepers and heck, even time itself. So much world building, so little time. The script cannot balance interesting characters whilst explaining the intricacies of the plot's concept. It just can't. The focus on explanations and heavy-handed storytelling results in dull characters that are unable to perpetuate the desperation for survival. Then you have the beautiful cast who must all look the age of 25. Aside from Murphy and Wilde, no one could act convincingly. Timberlake and Seyfried were horrific. Monotonous, boring and, dare I say, atrocious. The romance was so rushed and forced, that it came across as unbelievable. Honestly, after five minutes their in love and robbing time banks? Come on! Their snooze inducing performances are a result of an overpoweringly blunt script that feels like a knockoff Rolex. And it hurts me, it really does. I despise seeing good films go to waste. I tried ten times to find some justification in classing this as ""good"". But even Deakins' cinematography and Armstrong's mesmerising score just couldn't keep In Time from ""timing out"".

","This movie is fine if you don't think too much. First of all, there is the fundamental premise that one can use time as currency. Who decided that at 25 years of age the denizens of the future, would die unless the begged, borrowed, or stole time. We are never given that explanation but all people have a sort of countdown clock on their forearms. Those who have accumulated time become hunted by those who wish to steal it. There is also a set of sectors where people have as much time as they want. Everyone stops aging at 25 and either dies or maintains that age (hence mothers may be 100 years old and look just like their 25 year old children). Also, a grasp of the wrist of another person can transfer time. Justin Timberlake is given a huge cache of time by a suicidal man and sets out to avenge the death of his mother, who has succumbed before she can get ""reloaded."" He takes a spoiled young woman with him and they go around blowing up the system. They are pursued by a sort of latter day Javert, who has dedicated his miserable life to being a timekeeper, arresting those poor souls who are just trying to live. Anyway, it's all pretty absurd, unless you look at it as a parody of our own grasping society and our social classes. Pretty far fetched, even if disbelief is suspended."

That is just one of the things that In Time does not execute well.

I am a fan of science fiction and I can tell you that ""In Time"" is one of the best written films I've seen in a long time. A lot of care and detail went to making sure all the references about time, that went into the script, would keep a balance of plausibility of what the future would look like if there was no currency, but only time to trade. All the little jitters of humor were good, the sound track was excellent, Justin Timberlake is an up and coming actor who I think does an excellent job in anything he does, the pasty mannequin makeup look of people who have been alive too long was good, the upper class drove mostly 1960 & 61 Lincoln Continental's, and a host of other unique features people tend to over look.

I enjoyed watching how much a cup of coffee went for (a few minutes) as opposed to the price of a new car (such a purchase would put the purchaser back a good number of months).<br/><br/>Todd McCarthy writes in the Hollywood Reporter that the film suffers at the outset from a lack of a back story: ""As cleverly conceived as it is, the time-for-money substitution leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Other than for Leon and a few flunkies, there are no authority figures visible or alluded to. Who runs the country, the city? Is the rest of the world like this? How did the aging process get halted? Given so remarkable an achievement, why are there no other comparable technological advances? Why are all the cars customized early 1960s Lincoln Continentals, Jags and Cadillacs?""<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake plays the protagonist, Will Salas, who lives in the economically depressed time zone, Dayton, where the population scrounges day to day, attempting to add precious minutes to their time clock, just to stay alive. The film's break into act two occurs when Salas meets up with a man, Hamilton, who's willing to give him a century of time for nothing in exchange. It's a scene which reminds me of the Twilight Zone episode, 'Long live Walter Jameson', where a man sips a magic motion two thousand years ago and discovers that he never ages. Unlike Twilight Zone, where the man is afraid to die, in this case, Hamilton is tired of living. <br/><br/>This leads to the melodramatic scene where Salas' mother (played by Olivia Wilder who is younger than Timberlake in real life) doesn't have enough time to get on a bus as the normal fare has been raised due to inflation. She's reduced to attempting to run home before the clock runs out but doesn't make it, falling into Will's arms, just as her counter lands on zero. It feels odd that she didn't prepare for this contingency but the whole idea is to emphasize the great divide between the haves and the haves-not. Salas blames the affluent who hoard time in the richest time zone, ""New Greenwich,"" for his mother's death. The zone is run by a time hoarding mogul, Phillipe Weis, who is basically your stereotypical 'robber baron', a stock villain. <br/><br/>Salas' plan is to somehow institute his own brand of class warfare by getting his hands on Weis' 'eons' and redistribute it to the people. When he arrives in New Greenwich, Weis introduces him to his extended family. Nick Schager of Slant Magazine notes the problem in having everyone the same age in the film: "" A bit more background on the origins of this genetics-predicated social structure would have better fleshed out his narrative, especially with regard to the confounding reality that—since everyone is physically stuck at 25 years old, as epitomized by a hilariously creepy lineup of Philippe's mother-in-law, wife, and daughter—people's romantic and sexual attractions to others must be hopelessly confused by the disconnect between their appearances and age.""<br/><br/>In the second half, 'In Time' devolves into your basic crime caper flick replete with foot chases and car crashes. With Will now hooked up with Phillipe's daughter, Sylvia, the two play a futuristic Bonnie & Clyde attempting to elude both the police in the guise of Timekeeper Leon as well as the nasty 'Minuteman' gang member, Fortis. There's a very awkward and unconvincing scene toward the end where Will and Sylvia take Sylvia's father hostage and in the end, make good on their goal of grabbing his 1,000,000 years and redistributing all that time to the common people. <br/><br/>The worst part of 'In Time is the clumsy climax. Dana Stevens of Slate Magazine, sums it up best: ""And though there's a vaguely socialist theme of wealth redistribution running through the film, it's never clear what the final goal is for the two time bandits in love: Are they looking to abolish the time-is-money system altogether, or just eke out a few more years for the downtrodden?""<br/><br/>Perhaps the most critical and perhaps enjoyable critique is from Kyle Smith in The NY Post. Part of his criticism involves the narrative's lack of verisimilitude: ""Chunks of time (which look like Atari video- game cartridges from 1978 that have been dipped in aluminum) sit barely guarded in vaults that can be breached simply by driving a truck into them,"" as well as a lack of an explanation as to how Leon the Timekeeper is able to confiscate all of Will's time, when he has no evidence that he was guilty of stealing from the 105 year old man. Smith's main criticism comes back to the theme of class warfare: ""The allegory nullifies itself in inviting comparison to reality. Life is more egalitarian than it is in this movie, because while rich people may have more toys, their wealth doesn't buy them the most precious resource. Warren Buffett won't outlive his secretary by centuries.""<br/><br/>In the end this is a film that has a clever premise which will keep you watching pretty much to the end. Nonetheless, the plot is awkwardly constructed, leading to a climax which is hardly what I would call thrilling. The lack of thrills perhaps can be attributed to a lack of high stakes as Salas is merely redistributing the wealth and not saving the population from imminent annihilation."

","In Time is an interesting premise - set in an Orwellian, dystopian future where everyone only ages up until they're twenty-five then stays that way (why? We don't know). Also, once they hit the big two-five they only have a single year left to live! (why? We don't know that either). Anyway, the year you have left is displayed on everyone's left arm by a green digital clock that's constantly ticking downwards. Instead of earning money from your job etc, you earn time for your arm-clock (why? No idea. You just do).<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake is an average Joe who works hard in the poor area where everyone is earthy and noble, while at the same time being horrible exploited and put-upon by the evil rich people, who have years worth of time on their arms in a different district (some of the evil rich are so evil that they're also British, making them doubly evil).<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake saves the only rich man on the planet's life and he gives Justin a load of time on his rich before he kills himself for no real reason at all. Now Justin has enough time to head to the rich zone and get back at all those nasty rich people who like nothing more than watching poor people run out of time and die.<br/><br/>Luckily, Justin doesn't have to do it alone. No sooner does he arrive in Richland (or whatever it's called) does he bump into Amanda Seyfried, who happens to be the only woman in Richville who also believes that poor people shouldn't be made to work until they drop and then laughed at as their corpses rot in the street. Throw into the mix Cillian Murphy's cop trying to hunt them and you have a chase movie where Justin continually gets away from the authorities because he can beat everyone up at once (he just can). Also, he can drive a car better than the police force (or 'Time Keepers' as apparently they're known), so he does have the edge.<br/><br/>The idea behind 'In Time' is nice, but sadly it's poorly executed, with a clunky script and riddled with one-dimensional characters and clichés. Lots of things don't really make sense (like the way you can 'steal' someone else's time by basically just going near their arm (?). The good characters are amazingly good and the bad ones are bad (because they're rich).<br/><br/>The film tries to be really hip by replacing all words that should be 'money' for 'time;' it thinks it's being clever by putting these sorts of things in, in an attempt to appear really deep and meaningful. Sadly, unless you're a massive fan of that working class hero, Justin Timberlake, it's actually pretty shallow. You've seen it all before and you've seen it better.<br/><br/>Just remember - all rich people are bad. Justin Timberlake is good.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

","Before bypassing this movie, please bear in mind that most of the negative reviews have inaccurate information. Based on what I've read, the naysayers had trouble understanding what happened beyond the first 30 minutes of the movie. Their failure to follow the plot does not mean that the movie was poorly executed, it means that the plot was too complex for those without vivid imaginations. There were no plot holes. Many events and circumstances in this movie can be explained by sociology and common sense. In example, a vacant room with 2 seats was not necessarily staged, it was likely the hiding space for someone in a similar situation. Does the director really have to explain something so basic? Does the screenwriter really need to think for the viewer? The characters explained their motives throughout the movie. So those with complaints about fairness to the rich should simply rewind or watch it again. There is no viable excuse for rating this movie below a 7 for the plot alone. Then points should be added for artistic design, realism, and intensity."

","In the future, time is the new currency. People live to the age of 25, and then get to live one more year. The rich keep decades and centuries in time banks, while the poor pay more time for less goods and have to scramble to live longer than 25. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is a poor young man from Dayton, who has struggled, to live to age 28. His mother, Rachel (Olivia Wilde) has somehow lived to 50, but she is running out of time. Will, down to his last day, meets a rich man named Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) who doesn't want to live anymore. Henry gives Will a century of time, and timekeeper Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) immediately suspects Will of robbing Henry and killing him. At the same time, Rachel gives all her time to Weis Time Lending to pay her debts. She doesn't have enough time to buy a bus ride home and dies on the street.<br/><br/>Will escapes to New Greenwich , bastion of the rich, to seek revenge from Philippe Weiss (Vincent Kartheiser )for his mother's death. Will kidnaps Philippe's daughter, Sylvia, (Amanda Seyfried) in hopes to get more time from Philippe, but the two fall in love. Will is now being followed by Philippe's goons and Timekeeper Leon. Does he live long enough to find happiness with Sylvia? Sometimes it's fun to review a bad movie, a movie so bad it's good. This is not one of those times. I like dystopian movies and books, but not this one. The plot is unintelligible for the first fifteen minutes, it's as if the plot didn't matter, the producers had what they thought was a cool sci-fi concept and hip young stars, who needs a plot? Here's how dumb this movie is, Olivia Wilde plays Justin Timberlake's MOTHER. Are you kidding me? And they rob from other movies relentlessly. They borrow the star-crossed lovers bit from Romeo and Juliet, they steal several scenes from James Bond movies, and they rehash the one percent versus 99 percent theme that has already become overused.<br/><br/>The acting is horrid. Justin Timberlake as an actor, is a good singer. Maybe he should sing his lines. When Timberlake starts to cry, I start to cry, not because it's sincere and heartfelt, but because I want him to stop trying to act. It's like he's reading his lines off a cue card, dry, emotionless, monotone delivery. Why does he keep getting offered these roles? And frankly, Amanda Seyfried was worse, after what I thought was a promising start to her career in Mamma Mia, she's made some real stinkers, like Chloe, Jennifer's Body, Letters to Juliet, Red Riding Hood, and now In Time. She was underwhelming in a great film, Les Miserables, so my opinion of her has slipped mightily. What is Cillian Murphy doing in this movie, after making the really good Red Eye, appearing in two Batman movies and Inception, he should know better. The smartest actor in this movie is Olivia Wilde, she dies about 20 minutes in, not that her acting could have helped this movie be any better.<br/><br/>Andrew Niccol wrote this movie, he's written such great movies like The Truman Show and Gattica, but this movie is insipid and strains credulity. He also wrote The Host, so his talent seems to be escaping him.<br/><br/>For more timely reviews, visit my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com."

"freemantle_uk","5","0","1","1 September 2013"," Marxist sci-fi
","Back in 1997 writer-director Andrew Niccol had a great debut with the sci-fi film Gattaca, an ambition, intelligent sci-fi drama. He set out to return to the sci-fi genre with a slightly more mainstream effort, In Time with Justin Timberlake getting the starring role.<br/><br/>In the future scientists are able to stop the aging process to 25-year- old over and after that they have a digital timer that gives them an extra year. Time has become currency with the poor living day by day whilst the rich could live forever. Will Salas (Timberlake) is a 28- year-old factory worker who meets Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), a suicidal rich man who tells Will the truth about the system and gives Will all his time. Soon Will goes to the wealthy district and teams up Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) and the pair end up becoming Robin Hood figures who rob from the rich to give to the poor. But on their trial are Timekeeper Ray Leon (Cillian Murphy), a police officer for the society and Sylvia's banker father Philippe (Vincent Kartheiser).<br/><br/>Niccol clearly been reading his Marxist philosophy and highly influenced by the narrative of the post banking crisis world. We get the usual left wing arguments and world building with society being split between the rich and poor with the rich living in a gated community, living off the back of the poor as they live in luxury and few caring about the poor/the ghetto. The ghetto is left to its own devices as people literally die on the street and it is a dog eat dog world where if anyone shows any sort of wealth end up getting themselves killed by a local crime lord played by Alex Pettyfer and the police ignore crime in the poor district. This is even a film that advocate that the rich and banks are the real thefts and criminals, wants the redistribute wealth and goes for the easiest target, the banks. Surprising considering this is a film made by Fox.<br/><br/>In Time was meant to be a starring vehicle for Justin Timberlake and sadly he does not impress. He is solid in the few action scenes but he was a little stiff and unconvincing. He is capable of more having seen what he can do in The Social Network. But the whole cast was lacklustre, even Murphy, an actor I normally like, seemed disinterested. Whoever thought that casting Pettyfer was a good idea really needs to consider their career.<br/><br/>In Time does have a strong concept and Niccol does have some good ideas likes that Will is discovered that he is from a poor background because he runs and rushes when people in the rich district where no one needs to rush and the effect of the timers on people's arm was nicely done. But visually In Time is a bland film and its look of the world is no different to what it is today, compared to Gattaca had a retro-futurism to it. None does In Time have the complex themes that Gattaca had.<br/><br/>In Time had some solid ideas but overall it would have worked better as a short film and takes a very basic view of Marxism. It does not success as a sci-fi drama or as an actioner."

","I was really surprised when I just discovered this was the same director as Gattaca. I love that film and would never have guessed this was the same director. It's not that this was bad - I really like the idea - just felt the execution lacked something. It needed more imaginative cinematography, sharper style, and a better story to my mind.<br/><br/>While I normally like Timberlake, I found him a little awkward in this part. I don't find him convincing in tough guy/action roles somehow. Some of the action scenes felt like watching kids playing at James Bond. Cillian Murphy's obviously a great actor, though his part just wasn't big enough to let him shine. The other actors were mostly OK, though didn't care for the bad guy much. I think casting was maybe this film's Achilles' heal.<br/><br/>Also, when the film started I thought it was a real breath of fresh air that the 2 people on the run were both men, thus avoiding the tediously overdone, romance-on-the-run cliché. Of course I was wrong and they ended up totally embracing the age-old cliché. I'm so sick of certain Hollywood clichés like that. It's just lazy and cowardly IMHO. And that's not a sexuality thing by the way - purely an interest in intelligent film-making.<br/><br/>Oh and I had a bit of a problem with the big digital clock display on everyone's forearm - seemed like a rather clumsy in-your-face solution to a delicate problem to me! Yeah I know - ""shut up, it's just a movie"".<br/><br/>Like I say this is by *no means* a bad movie, I just felt they could have done *much* more with the idea, and I personally expected better from that director. Some of the acting brought it down too."

You stop ageing at 25 but only have one year to live, the main character Will lives in Dayton which is branded as the Ghetto. He saves a man called Henry from Minutemen who steal your money and leave you to die. Henry eventually gives Will all of his time which clocks at over 116 years and Henry commits suicide. I don't want to dive to much into the plot but it is a decent one apart from when a camera only catches Will running from the scene of Henry's death but doesn't see him commit suicide.<br/><br/>The writing isn't the strongest point of the film but I thought it was bearable although the whole vigilante premise wasn't something I was a big fan of. This was however the first time I had ever seen a Justin Timberlake film and although I was a little sceptical at first I enjoyed his performance and was pleasantly surprised. The other performance I enjoyed was that of Alex Pettyfer even for his short appearance it was interesting to see him play the villain and maybe it was the British accent but I thought he played it very well indeed. The whole fighting for time premise seems a bit silly and I wasn't a fan of the concept.<br/><br/>Overall the film has good and strong points, I thought Amanda Seyfried was rather frustrating in her role and couldn't really relate to her.<br/><br/>All in all In Time is an average film, it is packed with cheesy one- liners that will make you cringe. I would give this a 5 but my enjoyment of Timberlake made me give it a 6. This film is certainly worth watching but you won't remember much of it. I'd recommend a rental. 6/10"

I thought Michael William Freeman who had a small role as bad guy Nardin did a good job of playing a very believable loathsome thug. With virtually everyone on screen being around the same age (25), barring the occasional kid, I found this one quite odd to look at (even a bit ageist! – just a joke, honest). It's pretty well made with some great ideas behind the plot and even some great dialogue thrown in here and there but at the end of the day it just failed to get over that mark.

","Set in the future outlook, In Time, replaces money as a source of living, authority and prestige with time. Niccol's alternate perspective on life reveals how from your 25th birthday, everything you do, every step you take and every decision you implement takes time, time which results in life or death. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) struggles through life in Dayton, waking up looking at his left forearm knowing that sacrifice or a life of stealing is his only way of staying alive. A drop of fortune, after rescuing a feeble Henry Hamilton, a man of many years who donates his digits to Will after revealing his ennui of immortality takes Salas on a small, expensive excursion to the fortuitous side of the city. Hamilton's death draws the attention of The Timekeepers led by Cillian Murphy, as Raymond Leon, who attempt to blame Will for the bereavement of 105 years of life. After passing through the zones know for being the neighbourhoods of time, Salas finds himself in the elegance of New Greenwich, a place where people walk through life without urgency as they have all the time in the world as Niccol emphasises in an artistic fashion. Here, Will catches the attention of Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) a doll-like figure, whose father plays a major role in implementing the global time market. After a short confrontation with The Timekeepers at a graceful house revelry, Will grabs the girl and makes a run for it in an attempt to even out the costs, or in this case, time.<br/><br/>The purpose of Niccol's stylish alternative outlook on life gives the film urgency, freedom and also lucrative tones of darkness once the truth of greed is revealed as the film's progression moves along quite convincingly. The film employs countless themes as we pass through the neighbourhoods which reflect concerns of class and honour in today's global financial climate. Although Timberlake and Seyfried's impressive growth and transformations on the big screen continues, the film does endure a repetitive nature as expected due to characters trading, stealing, begging and surveying of time and the constant lack of it in most cases. One way of looking at it is to reflect how much the price of a ticket for the cinema is and to determine whether you would trade in your ""time"" for the Niccol experience."
"dfranzen70","4","0","1","15 September 2012"," Yawner for a sci-fi movie
","In Time is one of those sci-fi movies that takes a preposterous premise and spends its time trying desperately to make it seem reasonable. When a movie begins with an out-there plot (here, in that people use time as currency in order to live past age 25), it must support that storyline with something that makes the viewer forget how illogical it all is. In Time doesn't quite do that.<br/><br/>Thanks to a helpful plot device called genetic modification, in the future everyone lives to be exactly 25 years old, and then they have one year left (without aging), during which time they must barter, beg, borrow, steal in order to live longer. Weird premise (why would they genetically modify themselves to this end?), but okay. It is what it is, to use a cliché. Also, the world (city?) has been divided into districts, each well guarded, and each of course set up according to one's class. It's kind of interesting to see one district paying for a bus fare of ten minutes and another one betting one million years in a poker game.<br/><br/>Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is from the slums and lives day to day with his mom, played briefly by Olivia Wilde. Will helps a stranger who happens to have a century stored up in him (don't ask how) out of danger in a seedy bar, only to watch helplessly as the same stranger, having donated almost all of his time to Will while the former slept, jump to his death. Naturally, a public camera recorded this, and just as naturally Will is suspected of murder.<br/><br/>The rest of the plot is just as simple, really. Will, who's running out of time in more ways than one, kidnaps the daughter of a rich businessman in order to, you know, buy more time. They meet cute, she helps him, and so on. Sure, it's implausible, but don't you know she's a rebel who's been chafing under the constant surveillance from her father? She even has guards in her hoity-toity district!<br/><br/>Yes, it's another fight-the-system-that-keeps-the-proles-in-line movie. It might remind you of The Island, which (despite being directed by Michael Bay) wasn't too bad. It, too, involved genetics and the morality of messing with them. But it's not an altogether favorable comparison. The Island had strong leads (Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson) and strong support from guys like Michael Clarke Duncan and Djimon Hounsou. In Time has Timberlake and, as the kidnapped daughter, Amanda Seyfreid. Seyfried usually plays blondes, leading me to believe she IS blonde, and here she is brunette. Trouble is, she looks like she's wearing a wig. She's not supposed to look like that, is she? Only if you're a hooker should you LOOK like you're wearing a wig. Just my opinion.<br/><br/>Timberlake is quite good, really, but he's up against what's really a dopey plot under a veneer of sci-fi creativity. The genetics angle is almost absent from the movie - the focus is on how much time people have, how they can get more, time lenders, time stealers, time keepers (like Cillian Murphy, here). Some people desperately want to live forever, hence the wagering of huge durations of time, whereas some, like Will Salas, just want to have enough time to get them through a day. Apparently this makes life more interesting.<br/><br/>Had this movie any real depth, it would have examined not only the moral implications of generically engineering humans to live only so long (while still allowing for extensions) but also the idea of literally wasting time. Live life to the fullest, make the most of your opportunities, stuff like that. But I didn't get any of that from this film at all. What I got was a lot of running, car chases, gunplay, sexual tension - you know, what you'd find in a typical Hollywood action movie anyway. <br/><br/>But this one didn't even reach its low standards. In Time may sound intriguing (ooh! genetic modification!), but it's nothing more than a garden-variety action movie set in yet another dystopian future, pitting the haves versus the have-nots. It's derivative, bereft of twists of any nature. It's, yes, I'll say it, a waste of time."

Amanda Seyfried's character made her seem like she was trying too hard to act all sexy. Her hairstyle was ridiculous and the eye make made it seem like they wanted her eyes to be as big as people from the Middle East. This user (derekblake) commented here saying something about Europeans having big eyes as portrayed by the Japanese or whatever. Big eyes aren't associated with white people. They are associated with Arabs and Southern Asians. Anyway.. my friend told me that this film is 'amazing' so I decided to watch it. I wasn't really that interested at the beginning but when Cilian Murphy showed up.. I decided to watch it. If you want to watch it then expect some typical falling in love between a pretty little, spoilt rich girl and a poor boy like like in a Disney film. Like I said.. the idea was a good one but they didn't work it out properly. For example, Sylvia seems to love her father but in a second she goes against him and points a gun at him. Also, time seems to go ridiculously slow because it seems as if in one hour it becomes day from night and in a few seconds you can run 500 yards and find the nearest pawn shop. The last thing that I thought was the worst was the ending. How stupid? Two people with guns are going to rob a HUGE bank. With all its security you can assume that at the end they were killed. I'll give credit to Cilian Murphy for his acting though and I thought I saw Kris Lemche too.."

","The ending is excellent. When Will Salas and Weis's daughter approach the Federal Reserve bank, it's the movie claiming that fiat currency is not real money.<br/><br/>This isn't a liberal mealy-mouthed tale of illogical self-sacrificial altruism, it's a tale of rebellion against the state. Moreover, like ""The Matrix"" it's a tale that accounts for false ""limited"" capitalism, corporatism AKA ""fascism,"" ""protectionism,"" being pawned off on the working poor as ""capitalism."" Leonard Peikoff and Ayn Rand would be happy with this movie. As I said: the final scene makes the entire movie.<br/><br/>When Ayn Rand criticized the ""Robin Hood"" meme, she identified the evil element of that meme as ""robbing from the self-made rich to give to the thieving poor."" But she noted that the popular misconception of the story, ignored the injustices perpetrated by the Sheriff of Nottingham.<br/><br/>""In Time"" identifies those injustices. Where time is money, false money allows its makers and unlimited license to steal. This knowledge permeates the entire movie.<br/><br/>Those who are ignorant will see a Robin Hood tale, the opposite of the objectivist ethic. Those who comprehend the ending of ""Atlas Shrugged,"" where Galt is offered gold for compensation if he sells out his revolution, will greatly enjoy this movie."

And how can he raise two more centuries in the poker game, when he only had a little over a century to begin with? In a casino?? And how could he have 44 minutes, or what it was, run away in the evening/night and still be alive the next day?? In the sunlight? AND on top of it all - fall asleep for a few hours..

","Writer/director Andrew Niccol had a good idea - having time be the trading commodity for a future time when everything is bought and sold with a person's inherent time on earth. But is it is a one-note song and that note gets so overused that monotony sets in.<br/><br/>The official description of the story is as follows: in a future where people stop aging at 25, but are engineered to live only one more year, having the means to buy your way out of the situation is a shot at immortal youth. Here, Will Salas finds himself accused of murder and on the run with a hostage - a connection that becomes an important part of the way against the system.' Plug into this simplistic explanation the fact that Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) lives in a time zone equivalent to living on the wrong side of the tracks. He decides to go for the gold and with the help of his buddy Borel (Johnny Galecki) he sets out to cross through all the barriers (using his allotted stored time to buy passage) to get to the wealthy part of town - an area run by the Timekeeper (Cillian Murphy) and his staff (Alex Pettyfer et at). Will gains entry into the gambling casinos, bets his hours on Timekeeper at the table, wins, and meets the beautiful Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried), daughter of the richest man in the city. From there on it is a 'catch me if you can' chase as Will and Sylvia try to outwit the Timekeeper and of course we know who is going to survive.<br/><br/>The dialogue is plebeian, the characters, with the possible exception of Will, are only given to us in outline form, so we end up not really caring about anyone. There are some interesting bits of surrealism tossed in but even those can't alter the fact that there is very little to work with in this little star turn for Timberlake. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"chaugnurfaugn-269-83012","8","0","1","16 July 2012"," A topical commentary on the nature of modern global economics
","A unique social critique on the current economic crisis, seen from the perspective of both the super rich and the super poor, with no particular resolution on either side of the coin, but plenty of spills and thrills in the process of toying with the metaphor.<br/><br/>In the future, time is currency and when your time runs out, you die. In order for this to work a dystopian federation of zones house the various classes, ranging from poverty stricken ghettos where people live each day as if it were their last (literally) to the mecca of the rich and powerful where possession of hundreds, maybe even thousands of years of lovely long life are the norm.<br/><br/>In reality, it wouldn't work, of course. But it's important, going into this film, to understand the importance of the analogy being made. The dystopia is our own world, rendered in a way we can understand without delving into the mind numbing complexities of global economic logistics. The time-as-currency idea allows director and writer Andrew Niccols to explore the effects of inflation, derivative bloating and hoarding of wealth to show how such concepts affect everyday folk in real life.<br/><br/>The lack of any solid resolution is understandable. There really is no resolution, either within the fictional world of Niccol's screenplay or our own ailing international community where pieces of paper create the same miseries as Timberlake and his fellow bottom feeders are forced to suffer.<br/><br/>Breaking the loop is no solution. The loop describes itself. Pumping our own economy with more cash only increases the problems we face. The problem is not the paper currency, any more than the problem within the fictional In Time world is lifespan. There is plenty of both to go round. The problem is management of a system, choices that are not just difficult but impossible to make from a human standpoint and ethically beyond any decision maker save the cold and cruel logic of a computer.<br/><br/>In Time shows the paranoid, guarded and insular lifestyles of the super rich where wealth is relative to the price of comfort and the comfort wealth affords is undermined by fear of losing that wealth. In turn it shows us the endless struggle of the have-nots, tempered by the idea that suffering and hardship may actually define the experience of living. Something the super rich cannot enjoy within their ivory tower.<br/><br/>Seen from the confusing perspective of the 'Time Keepers', quassi-cops charged with moderating the distribution of life-span, are themselves beset by their own subjective humanity. Missing from the equation, then, and barely explored or even touched upon by Niccol, is the presence of the technology and science that ensures the continuation of the system by sidestepping subjectivity and determining who lives, dies, suffers or lives in comfort without much care for the human condition. This is the only aspect missing, in my opinion, but doesn't reduce the quality either of the movie nor the message Niccol is trying to express. That the system we use to manage the human experience is, in itself, inhuman."

","I was recommended to watch ""In Time"", so I sat down and watched it, though I must admit I am not particularly much fan of Justin Timberlake (neither his movies or music).<br/><br/>However, I did find ""In Time"" to be rather good entertainment. The story was easy to follow, though you knew from the first minute exactly how the movie would end. Yeah, it was just that predictable. But still, the movie managed to keep me thoroughly entertained from start till end. The story is basically that people stop aging at 25, and then have this green digital marking on their arm to indicate how much time they have left to live before they are 'timed out'. The rich have lots of time, while the poor struggle from day to day. So basically this is turned out to be a high-tech Robin Hood tale, of sorts.<br/><br/>Now, the concept of people living on limited time and being able to extend this lifespan by adding time to the counter was really interesting. However, I would have assumed that with such technology, that the rest of the world would be more upscale high-tech, such as the cars, utilities, etc. I didn't really find the whole setting of the movie that believable, because I would have assumed that it would require more high-tech stuff to work.<br/><br/>As for the characters in the movie, well then you have Will Salas (played by Justin Timberlake) and Sylvia Weis (played by Amanda Seyfried) who are basically your time-stealing Bonnie and Clyde, trying to steal time from Sylvia's father Philippe Weis (played by Vincent Kartheiser). Will and Sylvia distribute the stolen time to the poor - can you say Robin Hood here? - and they are trying to elude the Time Keepers that are chasing them, lead by Raymond Leon (played by Cillian Murphy).<br/><br/>The acting in the movie was actually quite alright, and I must say that this is one of the better movies I have seen Justin Timberlake in, he was actually putting on a fair performance here. However, the movie was carried by Cillian Murphy's performance. He was simple so amazingly cast for that role.<br/><br/>""In Time"" is a good thriller with just the right amount of action and drama in it. It is driven by solid characters and a fairly good story, despite some flaws in the lack of high-tech stuff. However, personally, I don't think that this movie has enough value for a second watching, though."

","From Andrew Niccol (writer/director of Gattaca, writer of The Truman Show), I was happy to see the singer who made a great impression in The Social Network in a leading role, and from the trailer it looked like a cool concept. Those common phrases ""If only I had more time on my hands"", ""Spend your time wisely"", ""Time is of the essence"" and especially ""Time is money"", all those give you the idea of what you can expect from this terrific film. Basically in a futuristic society, the human race has been genetically altered, so that the ageing process will stop when a person reaches the age of twenty five, and then this starts a time clock of one year, seen in green counting down on their wrist, and everyone has to work to earn time, like earning money, time is what you spend, and you will die when your time runs out. Twenty eight year old factory worker Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) lives with at home with his fifty year old mother Rachel (Olivia Wilde), and they are barely getting by trying to earn the time that they need. Being in a ghetto environment people do anything to get the time they need, whether it be borrowing or stealing from others, and the timekeepers do everything possible to track down those guilty of the big time crimes, only the rich people are immortal and can live forever. One rich man though has had enough of his long life, Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) has become tired of life, and after being rescued from thieves by Will, while sleeping the wealthy man passes his time to him, before dying and falling off a bridge, with Will at the scene. Timekeeper Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) and his colleagues see the footage on CCTV, but they only see Will, and they could not tell whether Hamilton jumped or was pushed. Will meanwhile was racing to stop his mother Rachel from running out of time with his newfound wealth, but he was too late, and she died in his arms, so he heads to New Greenwich to seek revenge against the system. While he gambles his time in a casino against time-loaning businessman Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser), and flirts with Weis's spoilt daughter Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried), Raymond has concluded (wrongly) that Will killed Hamilton for his century's worth of clock time, and as punishment he takes Will's time away, and gives him only two hours left, in order to get out of town. Will decides in order to get his point across, and for some kind of protection, he kidnaps Sylvia, who has feelings for as well, but they are both running out of time, so they have to scrimp and steal in order to keep getting away from those chasing them. By the end of the film, after so many chases and near misses in their clocks counting down, and a point when they crash open a bank for others to steal time capsules, they manage to break the system, giving everyone all over the country all the time they will ever need, and Will and Sylvia stay on the run stealing theirs. Also starring Shyloh Oostwald as Maya, Johnny Galecki as Borel and Aaron Perilo as Bell. Timberlake was really good as the frantic young man trying to use his time wisely, Seyfried is also good as the woman trying to find what side to be on, and Murphy is lightly sinister as the man trying to keep those who apparently don't deserve time from gaining more of it. It is a really clever concept, that time is the ultimate currency, because it is the thing we most rely on in the world, besides money time is crucial and it surrounds everything we do, and that idea is used perfectly in this most watchable science-fiction thriller. Very good!"
"andie-katschthaler","4","0","1","16 March 2012"," ""In Time"" remains a brilliant sci-fi concept that just doesn't deliver
","I am torn about this. I like the original idea which could've made for epic sci-fi cinema with some decent language puns thrown in. However, the plot is seriously anemic and a lot of the language puns don't work out and end up being horribly corny.<br/><br/>The action sequences seem a bit contrived, the romance somewhat unmotivated, the main character nauseatingly goody two-shoes. And then there's the random number of bad guys thrown into the mix to keep things interesting – until you don't need them anymore and can dispose of them equally randomly. And sometimes things just happen because they're convenient that way, explanations be damned, as if they're just the ramp needed for more action scenes.<br/><br/>Better writing could've also coaxed better performances out of all the actors. Both Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried seem at times completely oblivious as to what they're supposed to act. They barely have any chemistry together.<br/><br/>As for Seyfried's character: Is she the rebellious daughter or rather the clueless, wide-eyed girl that falls for a guy from the other side of the tracks? Is she both? Who knows? In any case Sylvia isn't even remotely as three-dimensional as she could be and despite showing some initiative she ends up being merely a doe-eyed damsel in distress.<br/><br/>Of course the movie does not pass the Bechdel test. In fact, it's infuriatingly white male- focused with the women mostly intended as eye candy. Every single person in this film is either male or if female clearly in the damsel/mother/sister/daughter trope corner.<br/><br/>Who is indeed wonderful is Cillian Murphy. Granted, I will watch that man run in a black leather coat any day, but quite besides my personal preference Murphy does prove once again that he really can play anything. The underlying maturity he infuses into his role as Timekeeper is a joy to watch. This is the same guy who was a vulnerable Kitten in ""Breakfast on Pluto"" and a considerably scary Scarecrow in ""Batman Begins"" - and again he immerses himself deeply in his character who actually ends up being the only one in ""In time"" who resembles a three-dimensional person.<br/><br/>At the end of the day ""In Time"" is just a brilliant sci-fi concept that could have made for a much better movie if only for a better script and some decent direction."

","Imagine a future time where we cut out currency as a ""middle man"" & just exchange time for goods & services. Isn't this in essence what we do anyway? Every dollar you have represents time you worked. But if the correlation was more direct, would life seem more important? Would we be less likely to waste time if you used it to pay for everything? As it turns out this movie seems to have an underlying agenda of warming your heart to what I call ""Robin Hood"" politics, i.e. redistribution of wealth. This could really get me off point into talking about why simply being rich doesn't make you a bad person (though there are plenty greedy rich people out there) and that stealing from the rich & giving to the poor does nothing to help the poor learn to sustain themselves, but I'll try to stick to this movie. Justin Timberlake's bad acting aside, the plot felt forced & unbelievable. Will's motivation was having a hard life in the ghetto, & when he his gifted a century by a stranger, he sees his chance to go take down those he sees responsible for his poverty: the rich (& I bet the Occupy Wall Street people loved this one). A weak point in the plot is that our unlikely hero happens to be really good at gambling & turns his hundred years into thousands. Another weak point is the Time Keepers' (cops) desperation for taking Will down. Maybe I missed the depth of the Will's father's connection, but it seemed like the Time Keepers were over zealous to catch a man they *think* killed someone. It was kind of interesting, though irrelevant, that all the future cars seemed to be ""futurized"" 1960's vehicles. However, turning a Barracuda into an electric car short-circuits the ""bad ass"" quality of the Time Keeper's fleet (pun intended). Here is a good place to note some of the low quality in this film: in order to give a futuristic feel, the producers borrowed some Star Trek door sounds for the cars & stole Back to the Future's DeLorean engine sounds for them. To top it off, at one point Will & Sylvia are forced off the road & the crash scene looks like they pushed a Hot Wheel over a dirt berm. I have always felt like a story written from the heart, a story the writer really believes in, will almost always turn out well even if production isn't great. I feel as though this movie was written just to be a blockbuster & engineered to make money. Those are my least favorite types of movies."

Timberlake and his co-star, Ms. Seyfried, have the requisite charisma and, in Mr. Timberlake's case, a growing acting ability, but the other twenty-somethings all tend to blend into each other with only Cillian Murphy's latter-day ""Javert"" and (thanks to his TV personality) Matt Bomer as a suicidal ""century holder"" making much of an impression - and the film's extremely cold heart has too weak a beat to sustain interest even when it leaves its original concept and enters ""Bonnie & Clyde"" territory.<br/><br/>When you can't care about the characters and you give up on any hope of a ""happy ending"" near mid-film (having failed to say how ""the system"" came into being, they can't make us believe in the financial principles it would take to bring it down - let alone return the leads to a safe life) and worst of all, when the journey ceases to strike the viewer as credible, the film which pretends to concentrate on time as a metaphor for money risks leaving the audience resenting the time it's taken from IT - and at movie prices these days, that's a pretty fair parallel - long before the silly ending.<br/><br/>What a pity.

He has been doing it for 50 years and it is not at all clear how old he actually is, but it certainly is at least 75. But he looks 25. He chases down those suspected of gaining time by criminal activity.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake is arguably in the lead role as Will Salas. He lives in Time Zone 12 which is their ghetto. When he comes upon a man who is over 100 years old (he looks 25) and with over 100 years of ""time"", and just tired of living any longer, when they both fall asleep gives Will all his time except 5 minutes, which allows him to walk across the street to a bridge over the Los Angeles River and when his time counts down to zero he falls dead into the river. This leads authorities to a manhunt and a convenient street camera identifies Will as a suspect.<br/><br/>The movie is novel and entertaining, we enjoyed it. As I watched fictional characters trying to figure out how they would get their next time increment, I naturally thought of all those people in our real world not knowing for sure how they would get money for next month's rent or for food. It really is an issue, the small % of very wealthy people having more than they will ever need while so many are starving and homeless.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried is Sylvia Weis, the daughter of a time-wealthy man who owns a number of businesses. She and Will become unlikely fugitives and eventually love interests.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: After overcoming the time-keeper's hunt, and almost running out of time, Will and Sylvia bond emotionally and become a team. A sort of Bonnie and Clyde, destined to knock off all the big time-keeping banks and redistribute time to those who don't have much left."
"skynclouds","2","0","3","23 February 2012"," One of the worst Movies I've seen in a long time...
","Justin Timberlake as an actor - i knew it couldn't fit. This movie sucks , everything is made awefully mainstream and obvious. Time used as a symbol for money - oh lord, how ""creative"" (/ironie). Poor Boy who gets rich by accident and meets rich girl, but gets hunted by government. Seen this plot in different ways about 100 times - and still bores me like hell. But the worst situations are like these obvious dramatic scenes like the one where his mother can't pay the bus for meeting her son , so shes trying' by running to reach him but in the final seconds, when she almost reaches him (like 2 steps ahead) her time runs out and she dies in his arms. Justin crys like hell (yet another situation in which is shown that Justin is NO born actor!) and actually, in good movies these scenes activate the same emotions as seen in the film, i'd got this feeling to laugh. Laughing about this amateur-acting and obvious stupidity. Please, no more Timberlake Movies! My advice: Don't WATCH IT!<br/><br/>sincerely,<br/><br/>Kim<br/><br/>P.s. once again: Excuse my English"

","The movie was mildly entertaining at best. I thought the idea was original but the film lacked many things. I would have liked to hear how the time keeping system got started and more about it. It seems like the whole film crew was just lazy. The script was boring a predictable, and in actuality nothing really happened in the movie. Yes, the rebellious daughter runs away, cliché. Yes, she falls in love with her kidnapper, cliché and yes they steal some time and became outlaws. In summary this movie was one predictable cliché after the other. Also I usually really like Amanda Seyfreid and Justin Timberlake but this movie didn't do anything in the way of using their talents. I can usually be entertained by any movie because I love them, but I think if they put more effort into this movie it could have been really good."
"edie_collins","6","0","1","14 February 2012"," Continuity
","Sometimes the movie lacked continuity. The chase scene back to Dayton from New Greenwich left a question for me. They have what looks like large concrete barriers on both sides of the road to avoid someone just running through to another time zone. Will had to give up a whole year to get into New Greenwich, but in the chase scene back to Dayton doesn't encounter even one barrier. Gaping hole for me. Also the crash scene is not believable. I don't believe anyone would survive that let alone get up and run away. I did like the movie though. Great premise and I found it entertaining. I love the stars. It won't win an Oscar but it will entertain. I only paid $2.00 to see the movie but it was not good enough to pay $10 to $12 to see it. Best to rent it from Red Box."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","5","0","2","13 February 2012"," The concept is so thoughtful and elaborate that it affects the storytelling
","They say ""time is money,"" and so it seems filmmaker Andrew Niccol took them too seriously. ""In Time"" imagines a dystopia in which humans have been genetically modified to stop aging at 25 and at that point receive a year to live as indicated by timers on their forearms. The only way they can prolong their life is by acquiring more time. As a result, the poor live day to day and the rich can live forever.<br/><br/>""In Time"" is Niccol's most extensive imagining of an alternative future. He steeped ""The Truman Show"" and ""Gattaca"" in something tangible (reality entertainment, genetic engineering). Those films emphasize the science; ""In Time"" emphasizes the fiction.<br/><br/>This high concept goes higher then most, and it ends up running the show. The idea of tying your internal body clock to your wallet would create such a drastic overhaul of society (think of the economic, social and emotional after effects and the way they would be intertwined) that Niccol's script becomes slave to explanation and simply feeling out what life is like for these characters. It's a cool exploration if you love this kind of science fiction, but because Niccol indulges all these facets of what their life is like, the core story suffers.<br/><br/>I am always the first to admit my bias for high-concept dystopian sci fi, so these nerd-tastic indulgences make a film entertaining enough for the likes of me and certainly others, but I also have a soft spot for good storytelling (imagine that). So it's a problem that Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) serves as a vehicle for the story's substance rather than being a part of said substance.<br/><br/>Will lives in the one of the poorest time zones (socio-economic classes remain strictly divided) and works in a factory so that he and his mother (Olivia Wilde) can survive each day. But a trip to a bar one night changes his life when he meets a man named Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) who has more than a century. <br/><br/>After Will saves Hamilton from a ""Minuteman"" (code for ""gangster"") named Fortis (Alex Pettyfer), the two exchange some philosophical words and Will wakes up the next day to find that Hamilton has transferred all but five minutes to Will. Knowing that kind of time is dangerous in his zone, he makes plans to flee for wealthy country and plots how he can make the most of his recently acquired time/capital.<br/><br/>Will has a lot of options of what to do with his newfound wealth, so one has to wonder how ""upset the system"" becomes one of them. Hamilton does impart some knowledge of the system's unfairness before offing himself, but Will's journey from blue-collar guy who just cares about family to Robin Hood-like action hero with vengeance in his heart never quite comes across. Slipping in tidbits about Will's father halfway through the movie don't count either. Chalk all this up to the beginning, which spends more time establishing the rules of this universe than Will's character. We're smitten with this at the time, but it costs the film later on.<br/><br/>As emotionless as the story gets, ""In Time"" still boasts some extremely clever moments and examples of effective filmmaking. Niccol has spent a great deal of time (coincidentally) thinking up this universe, that much is clear. A poker game has Will betting his life down to seconds and on countless occasions you will find yourself understanding the stakes involved as life clocks dwindle. When Will has little time left, the film gets extremely tense, and when he has centuries, you'll find yourself unusually more relaxed. The issue is that as much as Niccol has spent time drawing up the parameters of his world in impressive fashion, he doesn't understand the way it inhibits him from telling a good overall story.<br/><br/>Much of the film consists of cat-and-mouse chases after Will kidnaps Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried), the daughter of a man with time to spare (to say the least). He's pursued by a timekeeper (an law enforcement officer tasked with keeping the system in place) named Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy), easily the film's best character. Murphy transcends the dutiful villain archetype with his performance. Seyfried starts strong as Sylvia, but as her character arc gives way to Stockholm Syndrome, she loses her flair—and so does the film.<br/><br/>""In Time"" creates an unparalleled dystopia in terms of sheer complexity, but it boxes out any chance for emotional depth. The ""Robin Hood"" meets ""Bonnie & Clyde"" meets a Jane Austen novel love story (set in the future) hardly connects to the ""fight the system"" motif for which Niccol aims. Having them hold hands every time they run somewhere (and they run a lot) doesn't make it better. Timberlake and Seyfried possess many strong characteristics, but Niccol shortchanges them. For all the interesting questions and philosophy that this ""time is money"" scenario poses, the rest simply doesn't measure up.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","I kept my expectations low for this film, but obviously not low enough. It really is a great concept and this movie should be an example of what happens when you take a great idea and spend two hours not treating that idea with any respect. Because the movie is based in a world where the economy is time, the pacing of the film is tantamount to its success or failure. And that's why it's such a letdown, because the pacing is so off, characters die before they even take one step in development. <br/><br/>If the plot is tight, you expect that sort of stuff. But the plot is meandering and the rules of time appear to be broken on a whim. The characters seem to have only minutes left in some scenes and then they proceed on, as if time doesn't really matter to them. Maybe a director's cut can restore some of the obviously cut scenes and correct the balance, but I don't know, this movie is just a mess. It seems like it's meant to bring the Occupy movement to the cinema. If you think redistribution of wealth is the path to prosperity, heck, you'll probably love this film, despite all its shortcomings and abuse of age-old story conventions. In Time is a cotton candy reverie for simple minded anarchists and for everyone else, a bad drawing of a great looking model."

","As stated in my summary, great idea and metaphor but one question... If time is currency and currency is mortality/lifespan and you get one year that starts dropping at age 25. wouldn't you either have to live off of another persons time who is over the 25 year mark, or be able to buy all you want... though if the later was the fact then that would make sense in the questioning of where the massive funds come from for the rich, otherwise wouldn't there have to be a lot of murders of people in the first bit of year 25? or can the government produce time, much like our funds, but that would make it worthless... The only reason our funds had reasonable value is because it was backed by gold, though that's gone and so our economy is dropping.Retrospect: how do the funds get into circulation in such high quantities?<br/><br/>Also... bad directing. when he asks for an hour and she refuses, they drive of... still nite and just over an hour left... next scene, day time and around 20 minuets left."

","This movie's premise, and style were phenomenal. The acting however, was good except for the romance between Justins, and Amandas characters. Their relationship seemed almost forced, and lacked depth. It's similar to those cookie cutter relationships fed into the movie so females will like it. The logic behind having romance in action movies is stupid, unless done right. Despite this, the interactions with other characters is extraordinary. You can feel the tension between Seyfried and her father when they meet up again. You can feel it yourself during the scene. Another part is when Wills mother dies as they were sprinting towards each other. Wilds distraught and Wills helplessness echoed throughout the theater.<br/><br/>After observing the reviews I noticed most people were just nitpicking and I thought I could do the film justice. Some people complain about it not being ""futuristic"" or ""Why don't they have cell phones"". I think I remember a few phones being used. However, I will not condone the low security and lack of police intervention. It was strange how effortlessly the, Bonnie and Clyde/ Robin Hood, duo was able to rob banks. Overall I'd give it a fair 7/10 for being innovative but not flawless."

","I was totally disappointed by this movie. I had very high expectations, same director of one of my favorite movies (Gattaca) with an awesome and philosophical main idea for a script. <br/><br/>But this didn't work...at all. The script was terrible, the acting was terrible and the plot holes were terrible. It even seemed they tried to save this using some of Gattaca's main ideas and film looks (the yellowish color on some scenes, the water scene, the 50's/future mix, the persecution of someone who is supposed to be inferior by someone he knows directly/indirectly). Not only this did not work but it emphasized the comparisons with Gattaca, making this movie look what like it is....a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>http://bestflashwebsites.blogspot.com"

","...for me to digest the fact that this misfire sprang from the brainpan of writer/director, Andrew ""Gattaca"" Niccol, who has also blessed us with the likes of ""Simone,""""Lords of War,"" and (script only) ""The Truman Show."" I am unsurprised to discover that ""In Time"" essentially tanked domestically, and somewhat saddened to see it did rather well internationally. For all its topicality and production value, it's still pretty much a polished bolus of a film.<br/><br/>Threadbare storyline to the side (amply detailed elsewhere on this board), ""In Time"" falls apart primarily due to its failure to adequately justify/explain its fantastical premise, and in particular ruined itself for me in the poker game sequence, in which our ostensible hero (Justin ""NSYNC"" Timberlake) providentially beats the temporal tycoon father (Vincent ""Mad Men"" Kartheiser) of his lovely soon-to-be partner-in-timecrime (Amanda ""Chloe"" Seyfried) in a game of Texas Hold'em. Not only does our boy stupidly call a long-odds bet, staying on the turn in hopes of filling an inside straight, he then fails to raise when he achieves the lock hand, and to top it off has the temerity to tell his opponent, ""I knew I was going to win."" Right. When stories hinge on such unlikelihoods, credibility falls by the wayside, and ""In Time"" simply doesn't offer enough to make up for it.<br/><br/>Otherwise well shot by ace lensman, Roger ""pick one"" Deakins, and well produced/designed/costumed, etc., etc., etc., ""In Time"" proves itself to be little more than a high-rent ""The Twilight Zone"" episode that fails to validate its thematic conceits, preferring to indulge in various low-rent witticisms (""99 Second"" stores) and unsubtle ""time is money"" social commentary emphasizing topical rich vs. poor concerns. Beyond that, it's a simple chase film owing its time-wasting debt to the likes of ""Logan's Run"" and ""Bonnie & Clyde,"" as many have noted elsewhere (I'd add ""Thelma & Louise,"" too). Support from the likes of Cillian ""28 Days Later"" Murphy, Olivia ""Turistas"" Wilde, and Alex ""I Am Number Four"" Pettyfer is small comfort.<br/><br/>Sadly, ""In Time"" is one of those movies that makes you wonder, once it's over, how much better it might have been had more attention been paid to the scripting. Vaguely worth a watch, but only if you have time on your hands (and nothing better to do)."

Why does Hollywood always turn movies into chases and gun play. They could have taken this idea and gone in a hundred different ways, but instead turned it into your typical action movie. Once you get past the innovative idea, you could plop these characters into any number of films that follow this plot device. What a shame!<br/><br/>There are some excellent actors in this film but unfortunately the two weakest are the two leads. I think Amanda Seyfried can carry a film, but I do not think that Justin Timerlake is a strong enough actor to play the leading man.

","Spending my hard earned money at the movies is usually not my first choice for entertainment. Especially with some of the turkeys that Hollywood is prone to produce. That being said, I actually had the opportunity to see In Time at a discount theater (it was a friend's choice for his birthday). There was a part of me that really wanted to enjoy this film simply because of the occasion.<br/><br/>I must admit, I really knew very little about it going into the theater. Which was a good thing. Had I known it was Justin Timberlake who had the lead role, I might have lobbied hard for Puss In Boots or some other mindless offering. At least with a movie like that you know what you are getting into. That being said, I was actually quite surprised at Timberlake's performance. Ah, the joys of living with no expectations...<br/><br/>*** Spoiler Alert *** The one thing I couldn't help shake throughout the movie was this nasty relationship Hollywood has with Big Business being the bad guy. In this story, like SOOO many stories you'll see in the theaters, Big Business is the monster, and the poverty stricken and the down trodden are the poor, helpless, mindless masses that need a savior. Listen, I have a heart, I feel the need... but I also have a brain and I know when I'm being spoon fed this pabulum... yet again.<br/><br/>Everyone knows for a good plot you need a villain and a hero. Whether it's a love story or a spy remake, there will always be the good guy and the bad. But for the life of me, I can't understand why the rich and powerful, (i.e. Hollywood), love making the rich and powerful the bad guys ALL THE TIME.<br/><br/>I will say there was one very insightful moment in the movie ***Spoiler Again *** where as soon as all the people that live in the ghetto get all the time they need... they all stop working! There was actually a voice over commentary about the ""Factories lying dormant"" or something to that effect. This is one of the things my brain can't shut off. No matter how hard I try, I can't turn this off. I would love to see a movie at face value and walk away thinking, I just spent 15 - 30 dollars and I'm in a better mood, or more relaxed, or filled with energy, or whatever. Nevertheless there is one redeeming aspect to this movie which I will get into shortly.<br/><br/>But here the truth sneaks out. Hollywood's socialistic movers and shakers let their diamond studded, silken slips show - if but for a moment. THE POINT: If the president or king promises free housing, free health care, free food stamps, free clothing, and jobs for everybody... the question is, What do we need JOBS for? If you are getting everything you need, what more do you need to do? You get the point, right? I just thought it was a very INSIGHTFUL point that the factories were all shut down once the ""redistribution"" of time commenced.<br/><br/>Oh well. I suppose if you want to see the exciting gymnastics of a chase seen or the heady dialogue of a seasoned actor, you are just going to have to kiss a lot of frogs as a movie goer.(Sorry frogs, I didn't mean to compare you so harshly!) It's a shame too. Because there are so many good stories that have yet to be told. Why is it that Hollywood gets it wrong with the majority of Americans TIME AND TIME AGAIN?! I just don't get it. They just love catering to the left, or to the mindless, (which are not mutually exclusive), and when the movie fails to bring in the gross revenues they anticipate, they scratch their heads as if to say, ""Gee, I didn't see that coming."" <br/><br/>To end it on a brighter note, the movie did offer one unbending nugget of truth that we all must yield to... Time Is Short. We must all be aware of the fact that our time is limited- and we should make every effort in this life to live honorably and with gusto! I certainly don't have a hard time with that."

","This movie had a intriguing and interesting concept going for it but it just wasn't executed that well.

The ending is what really irritated me, the movie builds and builds and goes in a very cliché and stupid direction at the end. Some parts just doesn't make any sense and there is some obvious plot holes that is just so noticeable. Movies like this can have a far-fetched premise but it should at least have somewhat of a believable direction which this does not. Again it's a wasted potential and could have been better, maybe if they at least made it a bit more believable and had better dialogue. Still it isn't a terrible movie and I didn't really regret seeing it and it isn't a complete waste of time.

","The story was great, concept was great. This could have been a cult, a legend. This was such a great concept. But what we get is a great vision poorly executed. Casts were poor. Justin Timberlake just couldn't do the justice for the role. And the script was terrible, terribly poor. No character development whatsoever, no explanation why Justin could fight like Jason Bourne, with utmost confidence, no development of story, and no character development on the villain played by Cillian Murphy, when i saw him persistently and passionately chasing Justin, i was just waiting and waiting for him to step-up to the story where he turned into such a character, till i found him dying an UN glorified death. Pathetic. Throughout the movie i was just thinking, what if, the role was played by Tom Cruise or Denzel Washington, trying to chase down the established system and bring it down on fury. But what i was seeing? A cute boy Justin Timberlake focusing all of his energy on stylish run and poor acting executing one of a great concept, he couldn't just present the fury, the action, the revenge, the charm. Throughout the movie he seemed subdued by the supporting casts. Cinematography was awesome, sets were awesome, all of the original ideas of 'different time zone', witty dialogs like ""out of time"", ""i need some more time"", ""i need some of your time"", ""time is all i need"". Such a beautiful allegory, wasted just like that. <br/><br/>A must watch, to see how a poor caste and poor script can ruin a great vision."

Both the writing and the production choices were seriously lacking. Example - the totally ridiculous notion of a woman running (over and over again) in seven inch heels was just too jarring!

","In my view, the concept of In Time was brilliant! This idea that we physically live around time (which we do in real life), the way the rich and poor (Ghetto) was structered and how time is organised around the rich and poor, altogether was fantastic, a real eyecatcher. However, Timberlakes presence and false acting really ruined it for me, I dislike him as a singer and think he is a rubbish actor. The scene when he explains when his time 'started', the dramatic pound he felt, was over exaggerated. Even though Olivia Wilde wasn't in it for long, I felt she upstaged him completely. I wasn't a fan on the little woman (Amanda Seyfried) either, but that's the Hollywood narrative for you. Saying this, the casting of the time keeper Cillian Murphy was fab! Overall the Film had such an interesting concept, but the star casting over who would fit the role let it down. It's just a shame Hollywood got a hold of the script before an independent company."

","This movie deals with something we all want in our daily lives: more time. People bet minutes, hours, and even years of their lives in the same manner in which we wager various amounts of money. The premise is very unique, but the execution is terrible.<br/><br/>Young Hollywood has a lot of talent, but they are all miscast in this film. Timberlake is quite good in his portrayal: street/poor kid suddenly faced with wealth/time. The rest of the cast though looks like children playing dress-up. The actors in the film have no sophistication or polish. The film looks thrown together as if it were finished as quickly as possible. There is simply no star power to be found. <br/><br/>From scene change to scene change, I could not have cared less what was happening. A good film could be made with a young cast, but this is not one of them. Think of a modern classic with Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson, and then recast it with the likes of Zac Efron and Hilary Duff. There is simply no compelling reason to continue watching or caring. One of the pivotal plot points of this movie is the pursuit of youth, but the reasoning behind it feels weak. If you want to bored, then you should watch this film. Ask yourself afterward how it could have been fixed, if only the production company had more........time."
"blacklist-1","3","0","5","25 December 2011"," A great concept, which potential was wasted as my time was in watching this.
","In Time directed by Andrew Niccol has a marvellous premise. The idea is that in a future society time is actually currency where the whole economy, in terms of work and day to day living is based on paying a time allocation each individual has (that is somehow etched in/onto their skin) which is normally 25 years. However if someone has the means of wealth they can extend their life indefinitely and live for centuries. There is a class divide whereas the working class would only typically live to twenty five years. Somehow time can be exchanged between people as well. Eventually when your time is up, you are terminated. <br/><br/>The concept is original and interesting. As the film started I was asking all these questions, like why is the age you can only normally live to 25? Why and how was this society created? Is it based on time due to overpopulation? There are timekeepers throughout the film that manage and control time to keep the system working, but if people are allowed to exchange time, how is it policed? And how did this society based on a time society end up in a class divide? And why do those who live past twenty five not age?<br/><br/>I was looking forward to the film exploring this idea in depth, in what I thought would be a intelligent and thought-provoking movie. Instead Niccol stupidly decides to skim over these important questions as though it is background noise and is obsessed with bringing to the forefront two main characters Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) who when his mum dies (Olivia Wilde) ends up gaining centuries of time given to him by a suicidal stranger. Mistakenly identified as murdering the man timekeeper Raymond (Cillian Murphy) goes after him. Will kidnaps a rich daughter of a man Slyvia (Amanda Seyfried) where they go on the run to try and bring down the capitalist system. The problem is these two characters are boring and are not worth the screen time to pay for watching. We don't come to care about these characters or root for them in anyway. Both Timberlake and Seyfried give awful performances, which is a pity from her as she has given some good ones in Mamma Mia, Chloe, Jennifer's Body and Letters to Juliet. Timberlake though is even worse, particularly in the pathetic scene, which he horrifically overacts when his mum dies. Niccol is intent on making us agonise over watching the ""romance"" develop between him and Seyfried, which has no chemistry whatsoever. Even the action sequences, which is very little of is surprisingly boring and nothing we haven't seen before. <br/><br/>I will admit it is stylish looking with some great special effects and cinematography. I did particularly like one scene where Will and Slyvia are in a room and arm wrestle with a guy for time, which was cleverly written and skillfully executed (that is the only scene by the way) and Cillian Murphy gives a good performance as does Olivia Wilde in her cameo role, but they cannot do much with a flat and poorly structured script. In the end we are left with a film that looks like it will deliver the goods in first class except it doesn't arrive at all. This film might look cool at first glance and looks like it will have a lot to say, but underneath it is just a hollow empty shell, which is more concerned with showing off babes and guns (I wouldn't have minded had the concept been explored). This film shamefully manipulates it's audience into wasting their time viewing this rubbish. I did mildly enjoy a few parts as it does have a few saving graces. By far it isn't the worst film I have seen this year. I would certainly grant it that reprieve. However it is the most disappointing, with a great concept that had potential ending up criminally wasted."
"lotus_chief","3","0","4","24 December 2011"," Great premise, failed to deliver...
","From the first time I saw the trailer I was intrigued. Seemed like a new twist on things; GREAT premise. That was until I saw Justin Timberlake as the lead actor. Immediate doubt. The end result was the letdown I expected; maybe a bit more. Timberlake is tolerable in this, just not the best choice in my opinion. Quite frankly, the makers of this movie somehow failed to capitalize on a wonderful opportunity. <br/><br/>As an example, I felt it was a much more harrowing experience witnessing the powers that be ridding society of emotion in the movie 'Equilibrium' than the dilemma of having enough time in 'In Time'. I felt nothing for anyone in this film. They just skimmed over the very real and supposedly horrible fact that everyday people were dying simply because they didn't have the means (wealth) to afford more of it...so much so that I couldn't feel anything for anyone. Even the scene with the mother and the bus, which was supposed to be a heart-wrenching scene, had little effect.<br/><br/>I'm more amazed at the failure to really nail this concept home than anything else. The makers really had a chance to do something special. In the end, 'In Time' was just another sci-fi flick that implied its desire to separate itself from the pack, but in the end made no effort to do so. Could've been so much more....<br/><br/>3/10 - for the concept alone"
"achyutaghosh","6","0","2","24 December 2011"," good, could have been great!
","Time is money- our parents used to say, and in an era of declining personalization and increasing digitization some of us still bow in reverence to that farsighted thought. In Time takes this concept a step further, to a cacotopian earth, where time IS everything indeed, including money. And it is this subsumption that makes the movie distinct, and watchable.<br/><br/>In this world, through genetic technology, everyone stops aging at 25, and from that moment they have 1 year to live. Their life henceforth can be extended if they are able to conjure up deals, trade-offs or of course, crime. And this earth too like ours can provide for everyone's need but not everyone's greed (Gandhi). Hence this presumably utopian society has similar set of problems- an even deeper rich-poor divide where the poor live in ghettos, amid a life of crime and misery, and on borrowed time, while the rich live in opulent mansions, ride swanky cars, and have literally, all the time in the world. <br/><br/>The first scene in the movie presents one of the biggest fallouts of this theory- that a 30 something Olivia Wilde playing mother to, well, a 30 something Justin Timberlake. The people here are born with a digital clock in their hands which tells them exactly how much time they have left to live, which, when over, leads to sudden death. This is all a ploy to maintain balance in the world- ""for a few immortals, many people must die""- as one protagonist explains. In this carefully orchestrated world of orderly chaos, Justin Timberlake is Will Salas, who when falsely accused of stealing time from someone rich, starts a chain reaction which ultimately brings down the system. <br/><br/>It would be foolish to read between the lines in this type of an alternate world movie- just how does one keep track of global time supply? How can exchange of time, and in essence life, happen just by holding someone's hand without putting into play the intent of the person (which means a criminal doesn't need a gun to kill you, just hold your hand)? And it is fairly obvious that there wasn't a lot of budget to play with in this movie. <br/><br/>But what matters here is the amount of thought and detail that the director has been able to put into the story, which is good when it starts, mediocre in the second half, when the film resembles a version of Bonnie and Clyde, with Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried turning modern day Robin Hoods. And while there is not an iota of doubt that both of them look pretty all the time, there is a shocking lack of chemistry and interest in the movie on their part. In other words, they mostly sleepwalk through their role- begs the question, were they paid money for this, or time :P<br/><br/>This year has given us some grand movies- superheroes, aliens, superspys, witches and warriors, all with mega budgets, 3D renditions and little thought. But In Time is perhaps the years first science fiction movie that has some originality, and makes you sit up and cogitate, and in that, the movie is just IN TIME, before the year ends :)"

","At some point in your early years the phrase 'time is money' begins to make real world sense. You've had your first job, you've been through your first romance, you've started to realize why adults take things so seriously. The concept is new, and, similar to how I assume a teenage girl feels when she first starts getting boob attention, you feel like it's a game changing realization. You feel wise beyond your years. For a while. Then you get over it because there's so much more to figure out. This film takes that simple cliché and all the time related clichés that go with it, tries to blow it up into a full fledged concept and then beats you over the head with it over and over, and over.... WE GET IT!! There isn't any thing deeper to your message. Don't keep referring to it, just move on with a decent storyline. But the movie doesn't move on, it doesn't build on the stated premise, it just tries again and again to repeat it from a different angle or point of view. <br/><br/>And to make matters worse, the editing drags and has no rhythm which makes the actors look like they're doing a terrible job. They deliver lines like amateurs because the beats don't match up. Most of the actresses with speaking lines seem like they got the job after a stint on the casting couch, and lastly, in no reality should a grown man's mom look that hot. The viewers mind is going to go someplace uncomfortable every time they kiss, and it's not because of a dirty mind it's because she's a ridiculously hot 25 year old! It seriously doesn't work.<br/><br/>Bottom line, it needed to be better written, better directed and obviously better produced. Next time, Nicol, let people help you because we definitely now know you can screw up a good idea all by yourself.<br/><br/>4 stars for simply getting decent stars to play the leads even though it was a wasted opportunity."

","I've been wanting to see the movie from the time it was released, but somehow never found the time (ironic :)) Finally, the big day came, and ... I was disappointed :( Not totally, though. The idea is fantastic. It was the idea which made me want to watch the movie from the very beginning: money replaced by time as the main commodity seemed something extremely interesting... But the plot is not that catchy and I was expecting a more (how shall I put it) definitive ending? Somehow, you expect that the main character will change the world, destroy the system, make everybody happy etc etc etc... Here, what you get is a conditional happy ending where the two newly born Robin Hoods continue to rob time banks and distribute time to the ""poor""... Does it mean the system survived? What happens if they come to the Bonnie-and-Clyde finale? I really hoped for a more definitive ending, or - if not that - for something that could be interpreted as a hint that a sequel was coming?? All in all, it was not a total waste of time, but it was a pity that such an interesting idea got to be presented in such an average way :("
"philip-wrangberg","6","0","1","16 December 2011"," Interesting vision, moderately fulfilled
","I don't know why but i'm always intrigued by a movie starring Justin Timberlake. Though he is not the finest actor I find him amusing and entertaining to watch, in romantic comedies. Unfortunately ""In Time"" is not a romantic comedy, but a sci-fi action movie. <br/><br/>Time has always been a factor in human life and has and always will be a vital consideration in our day to day lives. Because of this the idea of replacing money with time is deeply interesting and a fascinating thought to just philosophize about. One must quickly focus and understand how the system and structure of society functions with the new currency and understand the importance of the ""time zones"" as it is not fully explained in a coherent matter but rather puzzled together, in which the only problem is that all the pieces aren't supplied. This causes the movie to drift away from the concept of time, currency and society and focus more on the relationship between the protagonist and the multiple antagonists and their battle for perceived justice. As mentioned, the multiple antagonists complicate the storyline further. This is because some roles aren't fully explained and the (three) separate story lines never really join to produce a final conclusion. <br/><br/>Though I have mentioned several faults this is nonetheless a very interesting movie, just because the vision that is produced in the audience is powerful and thoughtful. If you can accept the moderate acting by Justin Timberlake and some movie clichés you will enjoy this movie, if not for pleasure then at least for curiosity."
"ws-dm","Null","0","1","14 December 2011"," ...Takes Away the Life.
","I thought ""In Time"" had a subliminal capitalism theme.<br/><br/>Most people in the USA are born into the capitalistic market.<br/><br/>Most people, at least in the USA, will, at some age, enter the capitalistic market seeking to sustain their life: where else is there to go? Years ago, man had his land. He could provide for himself and his family. Sons would inherit their father's land and have to provide for themselves and their families. Somewhere, man left his land. Maybe the promise of an easier way to make a living with promises of good wages, benefits, and pensions lured them to sell their own means of making a livelihood. Sons no longer had their fathers land, they now entered in and began their lives on another man's land.<br/><br/>Some may say, ""Where is the promise?"" ""Where is my good wage, my benefits, my pension, and early retirement?"" Some may be living the promise; others may be living the promise only to find the promise not as promising as they thought it would be. And others find the promise only for the promise to break its promise.<br/><br/>The market system can be like playing ""Monopoly."" You start off with $200.00 (at least when we played, newer versions may start you off with more). Every time you pass go, you get $200.00. Right off the bat, you may have to pay taxes. You might have to pay doctor's fees, or you may get assessed a certain amount for repairs. If you're lucky, you might receive money: a stock dividend pays out, you get an income tax refund, or some miscellaneous money is given to you.<br/><br/>Most people play with the aim to buy property, put houses on them, trade the houses up and put hotels on the property - and make money!!! I tried playing ""Monopoly"" without buying up all the land and putting hotels on them. I received my wage, I bought some land, I put a house on it, then, I just wanted to get around the board. It got difficult. It was becoming extremely difficult to get around the board without landing on properties that had hotels that charged me extremely much for landing on their property. Favor helped at times, I received the ""pot"" in the middle, or I received from a ""community chest."" Going to jail seemed to be a blessing; at least I didn't have to land on someone's property.<br/><br/>In the movie, there was a quote, something like, ""The poor die, and the rich don't live."" In our game of ""Monopoly,"" those who bought all the land and were putting hotels on them and trying to make money and win, also, had to avoid each others land. They were sweating it. They were counting their money and trying to determine where the roll of the die would put them. They were gaining money, and losing money, and trying to make deals to get themselves ahead - and even at times, looking at my little piece of land and wanting it so they could add it to there's and make more money.<br/><br/>Friendships can be made, not only the poor looking to the rich, but the rich looking to the poor. ""If you sell me your property, and you land on my property, I won't make you pay."" That sounds like a deal, that sounds like I get to stay alive. I would have to give up my property, they now can establish a monopoly, but they promise I don't have to pay if I land on anything that belongs to them.<br/><br/>I played till I died.<br/><br/>The market does not within itself have to be evil. It's not the market, it's man. Ezekiel 7:11 says, ""Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness."" The word violence translates into ""unjust gain."" Proverbs 1:19 says, ""So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof."" Greed takes away the life. Unjust gain is violent.<br/><br/>I saw at the market the other day, a bag of potatoes costing over $7.00. Someone making minimum wage will have to work one hour for one bag of potatoes.<br/><br/>There was another quote in the movie, something like, ""Many have to die, so a few can live forever."" Greed takes way the life.<br/><br/>In ""In Time,"" people lived, died, timed-out, expired, killed, loved, gave and stole seeking to sustain their life.<br/><br/>Revelation 13:16-18 says, ""...And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."" ""In Time"" and ""End Time"" reveal to what and whom man belongs."

","This movie left me with so many questions. Not questions about the plot, because the plot was very clear; nothing was confusing or hard to understand. It left me only with questions like: ""Why is 25 the age they stop at?"" ""Who the heck authorized this system of currency?"" ""How in the heck does it even work? They just drop dead once they're time's up?!"" <br/><br/>In Time really ticked me off. The gaping holes in it's back story left you assuming things left and right. It was agonizing to watch, because it was interactive; but not interactive like Inception, where you had to pay attention to every single detail. It was interactive because you were forced to guess things. To fill in the obvious blanks that the script and plot-line left sitting there like a duck waiting to be fed. The movie sincerely wanted to be what we would call ""a smart thriller. You know, like Inception, the Matrix, Alien? That kind of thing. However, the bad writing and unabridged amateurism displayed by all of the young actors and actresses, left the movie gasping for breath, but still caught under the avalanche of atrocity that it was desperately trying to run away from. <br/><br/>I wish I could say that the acting was on par with what you'd expect from ""A-List"" actors like Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried. Sadly, it wasn't. Becoming an A- lister clearly doesn't take talent any more. Just a pretty young face, and an agent good enough to get you a part in the latest teen-friendly melo-thriller, focused on brining joy to those who aren't that adequate when it comes to things like... well, thinking or speaking or anything that involves using their brain.<br/><br/>It's sad really....

","I'm not going to give a synopsis of this film as I hate reviews that give away too much about the plot and characters; if you looking for that there are plenty of review already doing this. I've ticked the spoiler's box to be safe. There are no real plot spoilers but there are setting and background spoilers.<br/><br/>The idea's in this film and the way that they are represented is innovative and unique, but the cultural, political, social, ethical and moral ideas expressed in this film are very current and very relevant. I'm always a big fan of Orwellian styled fiction and this one is the first I've seen in a long time that confront issues that are directly relevant to our own. The film is one big metaphor of the injustice and absurdity of capitalism. This is something I've not really seen in a film since the film adaptation(s) of Gorge Orwell's 1984. You have films like Equilibrium, Blade Runner, and Minority Report etc. that are Orwellian in content/style but none of these really touched on contemporary matters that had direct reference to our own society and the current direction in which it is heading.<br/><br/>Money/Currency in the film is represented by time, when you run out of time (money) you die. Everyone stop aging at 25 and their clock start with just one year on the counter (credit/debit card), and it start counting down (cost of living). This means people living in the slums live a rat race against time to keep their clocks active, while the rich live calm relaxed life of almost immortality (they can still be killed by normal means).<br/><br/>Throughout the film the cost of services and goods keeps going up (a direct correlation to inflation) this in turn means that the slums start filling up with the dead quicker as people 'time out' (die). For the few to be immortal someone else has to die. This is the simple truth of the system as quoted form the film which has a direct correlation to our society where bankruptcy and poverty are a necessity so that a few can be rich.<br/><br/>The film used 'timing out' (death) as a very blunt and clear message; allowing people to die so you can live longer and have a better life is wrong! I don't think any self-respecting individual would say otherwise. It exaggerates the moral ambiguity that capitalism and money have brought on society, and 10 stars to the film for that fantastic visual metaphor of how messed up our own society truly is. When you look at it like that; being rich means you live longer, you have a better quality of life, and spend more of it doing what you want. While the rest of society works them self's into an early grave so the rich can have their privileged life. Well guess what that's right where we are right now! Unfortunately the dialog, acting, and pacing of the film leave a lot to be desired and unfortunately this means that the impact of the metaphoric idea's expressed in this film will land on bored, deaf ears/eyes. Which is a shame as it could have truly been the next 1984 alas it just falls very short."

Even though it is yet another George Orwell 1984 spin off, these stories never fail to entertain me.<br/><br/>The whole concept of the film is that due to overpopulation, everyone has a countdown which starts at the age of 25. All currency is now time, and you have to pay for everything with your life essentially. For instance, to make a phone call you have to deposit one minute of your life. It is a good idea, and a fascinating world in which to place our two heroes.<br/><br/>I cant be bothered to check what the budget of this film was, but it seems fairly low. Its like they used all the money to pay for the digitally created 'clocks' on the arms (probably after effects) and a few rich expensive sets and then when it comes to big things like explosions etc they had to really cut back. There was one scene when a car tumbled down into a river bed and immediately it was noticeable that it was simply a toy car being pushed over. It was pretty bad for a 2011 sci fi film. <br/><br/>But all that aside, Timberlake does rather well for his acting ability and the story is good fun. It is on par with the likes of Equilibrium, however Christian Bale is a far superior actor. <br/><br/>I gave it a seven because the concept was what carried the movie. There are many bad things to say about this movie really, the ending was drab, the father did not convince you at all that he was one of the richest men on earth, the chief of police was a slimy un-likable character that was very poorly casted. The 'ghettos' in the film are hardly ghetto's whatsoever. But all that didn't matter, because in this world Time is a currency and that's more than enough fun to keep me entertained."

","""In Time"" is the type of film that transcends grip onto the audience and never let go till the final minutes. It is what you call an effective science fiction thriller that is both original and interesting. It is one of those chase movie that never stops. What makes ""In Time"" so effective is because the underlying theme talks about time and money. There is a line in the film, ""the rich can only be immortal, if the poor are dying"". Imagine living in a world where time is literally money. It other words, the time you spend alive depends on how rich you are. It all sets up an interesting premises and the casting is pitch perfect, with Justin Timberlake impresses this time around as a poor person who wants to put the wrong things right and the ever sexy and dependable Amanda Seyfried as daughter of the richest man in the world. Although all these does not sound groundbreaking, the film doesn't have to be. It is entertainment with a hint of originality and a bit about life. In the real world, when time is limited, ""In Time"" is exactly what you want to ask for <br/><br/>Neo rates it 7/10."

Amanda Seyfried as beautiful she is, she looks kinda weird with that red-hair look and his performance was a little weak and not very credible. Also I would wish more from Olivia Wilde, her performance was way too short. A good surprise was watching Johnny Galecki in a role completely different And Cillian Murphy as the corrupted cop Raymond Leon was good, that role fits him really well. The movie rhythm is way too slow and repetitive. Resuming, the idea of the film is quite interesting and original, but poorly developed by director Andrew Niccol. It's a shame because I really expected good thing about this movie"

How is that safe? <br/><br/>4. The cop was shot in the arm and in the next scene was fine.

","Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried both did good job when it comes to acting, more credits to Timberlake than Seyfried since his role demanded more skills than Seyfried. As for the story, it was new, interesting, and could be related to especially with the recession going on, the uprisings that's going on in different places around the world, and the whole occupy wall-street movement that's happening around the US. However, the movie as a whole was not well connected, the stars did a good job but not the others as well. The fact there is no concrete ending to the movie is also disappointing since the movie came through as missing a solid conclusion. Also, the relationship that both stars got to share and develop had to be worked on a little bit more, they seemed to fall in love without working on the reasons. The conclusion hinted that there might be a second part, which is not bad, and it should be more interesting. Last but not least, the movie is male dominant, with all people that have power are men, no powerful female character. The movie clearly portrayed the reality of life where men rule everything."

"gradivus-214-906025","Null","0","2","15 November 2011"," A poor remake of a 1987 film.
","IN TIME is an unimaginative, formulaic, unacknowledged remake of a 1987 short film, THE PRICE OF LIFE, which itself took its premise from a 1975 short story entitled TIME IS MONEY. In a dystopian future human mortality and disease have been conquered and time has replaced money as currency. Everyone is given a certain amount of time at birth, their bodies equipped with a mechanism that ends their lives when their ""time account"" runs out. The philosophical implications of this were beautifully explored in the earlier, 1987 short film, which started with the protagonist as a young boy, hustling minutes and hours by buying valuables from people and selling them to visiting tourists from the rich enclave. After his sister dies after gambling away her time, the protagonist (now a young man) sets out on a journey to the enclave of ""immortals"" in order to save the life of his mother, who is (literally) running out of time. He gets there and meets a beautiful older woman who gradually co-opts him into the immortal lifestyle. The current film, IN TIME, copies the basic premise and plot line, contributing nothing new or imaginative to it, only Hollywood's current preachy class-envy message by way of a cliché-ridden ""rich living at the expense of the poor conspiracy"" plot element. The young, handsome protagonist predictably meets a young, beautiful woman who is (no surprise) the spoiled daughter of a major time-rich fat cat at the heart of the conspiracy, and who inexplicably joins the protagonist in a hot rod fueled, car chase filled, Bonnie and Clyde style crime spree to bring down the evil, corrupt time-hoarding establishment. The acting is second-rate, the effects all predictable and uninspiring. Adding insult to injury is that there is no acknowledgment of the previous film or short story, thereby fooling a number of ignorant film critics into thinking this film at least had an original, interesting premise. They are wrong."

","I was first told of this film by my brother. I was very intrigued by the concept and after finding Justin Timberlake is the protagonist, I was sold, based on his heart-wrenching performance in Alpha Dog. I went in to the theatre with expectations of a ""good watch"", I wasn't at all prepared for how epic the films was due to the fact I had not seen a single trailer or TV spot for it. Timberlake and Seyfried are a great team and Cillian Murphy is as gloriously stone-hearted as ever. It's a very surreal world, given that everyone in the movie looks 25 or under and you are really pulled into it. The sympathy I felt for these people in the 'ghetto' who had to borrow minutes of a friend's time just to stay alive long enough to get paid was massive. Without babbling on, I'll leave you with the notion that the film has a similar atmospheric feel to Inception. Enjoy!"
"gardoma","7","0","1","13 November 2011"," Weak screen writing but stylish look and directing
","I have been a fan of Niccol since I saw ""Gattaca"". In fact, I have been waiting for him to make a new ""Gattaca"" ever since. ""In time"" keeps up to enough of my expectations to keep me engaged until the end, but it is still a far cry from the feeling I got from ""Gattaca"".<br/><br/>As it is typical in Niccol's screen writing (Gattaca, The Truman Show, Nicole...), the premise is clever: imagine a world where you stop aging at 25, but you have to keep buying time ever since- --and you literally die when you run out. In this world, time has become the only existing currency (eg you pay coffee in minutes), poor people live in ghettos and refill their clock every day, you might be killed just to have a few hours stolen from you, and rich people live in isolated areas and have centuries at their disposals. Niccol cleverly makes the most of this premise, and creates a beautifully uncanny world of dystopian social separation, where familial relationships (grandmothers, mothers, and daughters) are flattened and made ambiguous by the uniformly young look that everybody has.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the great premise is not followed by an equally well-developed plot, which basically amounts to an underdog of the poor class (Justin Timberlake) being framed for murder, discovering the hugeness of the social divide between the rich and the poor, fighting for social equality, and convincing the rich daughter (Amanday Seyfred) of a time-bank lord to join him in a path of social revenge Bonnie & Clyde style. The plot hints metaphorically at the current social protests, but its simplistic conspiracy scheme (i.e. rich people keep the others poor to make sure the earth is not overpopulated) and its solutions (revolt and rob banks) do not compare to the originality of the premise. Even the crucial elements in the plot (like Sylvia falling in love with Will) are poorly developed. Even more surprisingly for Andrew Niccol, some subplots are entirely messed up---for instance, Will's father's fate is never explained although several characters hint at its importance and Raymond's connections to Will's father remains obscure and unnecessary. Some other characters talk too much and deliver too many philosophical one-liners that explain the director's point of view, but sound unrelated to the character (ie, the gangster's monologue on its role to keep the poor in their condition, or the confrontation between Will and Sylvia's father).<br/><br/>On the good side, Niccol delivers his usually uncanny and stylishly retro look on the future dystopia, unsettling and unnatural beauty, and cold and detached beautiful actors that deliver their lines in a minor mode. The visual of the movie are, in fact, refreshing and beautiful, and I appreciated how Niccol can take a prototypical action movie scene, like the escape on the roofs, and easily adapt it to his own, personal, ghostly style. In fact, the movie was absolutely fun to watch, and Niccol's directorial skills provide the necessary emotional depth where the plot lacks. For instance, the death of Will's mom, which would have been pure trash in the hands of other directors, is intense and dramatic in Niccol's rendition. The line between lyrical poetry and teenage trash can be a fine line, and Niccol's style always veers away from trash and into art. In fact, the scene of Will's mom's death conveys much more social criticism and depth of argument that many useless lines given by the characters. And, in fact, the movie would have been so much better if Andrew Niccol had trusted his message of social criticism to the Niccol-director instead of the Niccol-screenwriter, letting the script free to develop as a story without explaining the metaphor from within."

","In Time is very ambitious and perhaps tries to accomplish too much. The basic premise - where time replaces money as the medium of exchange is very cool. The director is holding up a mirror to our society - in which so many of us are living week to week - paycheck to paycheck - always in fear of what will happen if the paychecks stop. And who controls this system ??? The ultra-wealthy. It may be a coincidence but the parallels between this movie and Occupy Wall Street are quite amazing. The basic premise of the story and the logistics of the system could have been engineered better - but the overall effect of the story is to make the viewer very cautious about the future of humanity --- very much like the stories of Phillip K. Dick. The acting, music, and sound were well done - significantly better than what is usually found in lower budget sci-fi movies."
"The-Sarkologist","7","0","1","12 November 2011"," In the future, Time is a currency
","I guess the thing that put me off this movie initially was Justin Timberlake. I tend to balk at movies that star the latest 'hot bod' that generally does not show much in the way of acting skills (which is unlike Brad Pitt, who not only is one of those 'hot bods' but also knows how to act). Anyway, since there wasn't much else on at the cinema I decided that I would actually give this film ago, particularly since it appeared to fall into one of the 'Philip K Dick' categories of films. Turns out that it is not really based on anything (though there is talk of a law suit due to the theft of an idea from an earlier book).<br/><br/>I mention the 'Philip K Dick' category in that it is one of those science fiction films where there has been some major breakthrough which has changed the world, usually for the worst, however as mentioned, it is not directly based on any book, but seems somewhat similar to what one would expect from Dick.<br/><br/>In the future there has been a breakthrough in that nobody ages past the age of 25 however the catch is that after 25 people can only live for a year and then they die. They are born with a clock, and once you hit 25 the clock starts counting down until it hits 0 and then you die. Between those two times, the countdown and death, you can add to and subject from that clock as much as you like, as long as it does not hit 0 because once that happens it is game over. Thus time has become a currency and the world is divided into time zones, where the poor are separated by impassible barriers and the world has developed a much more rigid class structure. The lucky ones, the rich, can live forever while the poor go from day to day hoping that they can keep enough time to be able to make it to the next day.<br/><br/>This is scary this concept because granted money in our day is a bit like this, where the rich live without a care in the world while the poor struggle from day to day. Money is about control. When one holds the money and can hand it out as they see fit then there is control. We need money to survive, and without money we will eventually die (unless of course we turn to crime to support ourselves). So much more in this world where money isn't external but internal. When we run out of money we die, and right from when the clock begins to count down our time is slowly taken away from us. Will says that when his clock began to countdown he had pretty much spent his year in a month, whereas his rich friend was given 10 years as a birthday gift.<br/><br/>It is two different worlds, and people are not meant to cross. While the poor are struggling to keep themselves alive there is no way that they can rise up against the rich. The rich will take their time from them, and horde it among themselves while the poor are more concerned about getting that extra-minute, that extra day, so that they can have more time on the earth. However, they have to keep on spending it, so it is running about, living each day as it comes, as inflation (which is entirely artificial) slowly squeezes them ever more.<br/><br/>This reminds me of the Upton Sinclair's The Jungle where he talks about the squeeze. The immigrant comes to the US and gets himself a job, and is even paid reasonably well, however despite having the money, it is slowly squeezed out of him and his family keeping them poor and in the ghettos. It is interesting here that there are tolls at the exits from the various districts, and it costs time to get through. Obviously if the most you ever have on you is a month, you will never be able to afford the toll to escape. At least with money you can still survive despite not having any. Here when you run out that is it, you are dead.<br/><br/>Like in our world, this society is run on a delicate economic balance. As long as they keep needing time they must work and they cannot fight. However in between they drink their sorrows away (but must always be careful not to drink too much). Having too much time in the ghettos is almost as bad as having too little because you become the target of thugs and bullies, or moreso, you simply did not know how to use the time and you end up drinking yourself to death. Then you see the time banks, where you can take out loans. This reflects heavily on the current state of affairs where people need money to live, and go into hock to get that money, and as the interest on the loan expands the more of a slave you become to the system. They have the money, and they will give you the money, but if you take it then you are no longer your own person, but a slave to the one who has lent to you."

","The old adage that says 'Time is Money' is literally brought to life in the Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried starrer 'In Time' that is set in a dystopian future where all human beings have been genetically altered to stop aging after turning 25.<br/><br/>While the idea of staying young forever could be alluring, it comes at a cost. As soon as one turns 25, the timer on the arm starts counting backwards giving them just a year to live. Any more longevity needs to be earned. Since time is literally money, people pay in time, like four minutes for a cup of coffee and earn wages in time.<br/><br/>The poor live in ghettos and always have few hours or minutes left to live and they battle for survival against rising costs and taxes. Anyone having more time is robbed by gangsters called Minutemen. Meanwhile, the rich live in elitist New Greenwich and have thousands of years in their account. The barriers between them are justified by Darwinism and are guarded by futuristic police called Timekeepers. <br/><br/>Set in such conditions, 'In Time' is somewhat based on Robin Hood's story where the protagonist Will Salas (Timberlake) believes that there is time for everyone to live and no one should really live forever. When someone rich donates his years to Will and times himself out to die, Will heads towards New Greenwich. Meanwhile, Will is suspected of murder and is chased by timekeeper Raymond (Cillian Murphy).<br/><br/>If our hero with a deadpan expression has to keep his audience interested, he needs an arm-candy; enter Sylvia Weis (Seyfried), the daughter of a wealthy time-lender whom Will eventually steals from. The film also has some action and special effects, some of which are especially tacky like the car crash which is a case in point.<br/><br/>The whole idea of idea of casting everyone as 25 year olds in the film seems to be done mostly with a view to bring younger audiences to the movies. This was exactly what the 'Twilight' franchise played on. Now do you notice the connection? For the starcast, Timberlake is not entirely convincing, Amanda Seyfriend isn't glamor material. Cillian Murphy's performance as the antagonist is an exception.<br/><br/>In a way the movie is a take on immortal youth and its flipside. While the idea itself is not bad, it leaves gaping plot-holes as to how every single human is genetically engineered and there is not a single person living normally without the countdown timer on his hand. Meanwhile the future world is portrayed with a retro touch.<br/><br/>Coming from director Andrew Niccol who has made films like 'Gattaca', 'The Terminal' and 'The Truman Show', 'In Time' is a let down. Contrary to the usual cinematic theme of the protagonist always being right, here, Will Salas is misguided. Not worthwhile!"

Justin Timberlake as Will Sallas couldn't get into the skin of an action star , he couldn't get me excited about the movie like I would in an Arnold or a Jason Stathom movie. Amanda Seyfried as Sylvia Weis was decent in the role of a rebellious daughter. There was no chemistry between the lead pair. The best part about the movie was Cillian Murphy who was brilliant as the timekeeper Raymond Leon. The rest of the cast did a good job and a special nod of appreciation to Alex Pettyfer for the role of Fortis - the minute man.<br/><br/>When it came to the story, I thought it lacked depth in characters and should have been a bit more detailed when it came to the life story of each character in the movie. The concept was brilliant but had a number of flaws which people will catch considering the acting is not that strong from the lead pair.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is worth a watch for people who have time on their hands but nothing better to do.

Near the end, Rudger Hauer (playing a Nexxus 6 replicant) runs out of time and says to Harrison Ford's character, ""Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it means to be a slave.""<br/><br/>This movie is about mercy vs. justice, Christianity vs. capitalism - this is true. But mostly it's about slavery and what people will do to hurt others in order to free themselves. This movie is about how you can be free and not hurt others! How do you do it? Keep reading!<br/><br/>I loved Gattica. Great movie. Which movie is better? On the whole I'll go out on a limb and say - this movie is better. Gattica makes you think about genetics and social prejudice - which is wonderful - but this movie makes you think about mercy and freedom. As a libertarian this movie come across as a powerful reminder as to what life is about. Live free or die. Free from seeing your brothers suffer and free from having to close your eyes from selfishness and contempt.<br/><br/>Flaws? Sure, there were a few. I don't this it's a spoiler when I tell you near the end when ""freedom"" is starting to take a foot hold the great irony rears its head... yet this elephant in the room is somewhat ignored by the movie! We see the factories are not running and product for survival is no longer being produced! Are you a fan of ""Fight Club"" like I am? Well, the slaves make society run and the saying ""when everybody's special - nobody is"" comes to mind! (damn, I watch way too many movies) So what happens when everyone wins the lottery and nobody needs to work? Sadly, this movie does not move into THAT territory. I think maybe -- if you read between the lines -- you'll see it does not have to.<br/><br/>This movie is well worth watch - maybe even the money. It will make you think. If you are afraid of death and fear pain and believe the purpose to your life is to avoid pain or if you subscribe to the philosophy that ""whoever dies with the most toys wins!"" then you will HATE his movie. This movie is not made for the greedy, simple minded, Caligula type of capitalist.<br/><br/>Do we have slaves today? Of course we do. Whatever shall we do without Mexicans and illegals, the poor who work for nothing, people who subject themselves to labor in order to pay debt or obligations? Oh, and what a favor we 1% do for them! -- so says the rich man who is capitalizing on their fear and slavery.<br/><br/>Mostly, this movie is wonderfully confusing for those like me who admire the Justine Timberlake character. In ""Christmas Carol"" Dickens doesn't tell us what happens when Bob Cratchet doesn't do his job anymore, and in this movie we aren't told how society continues on without slaves like Bob Cratchet. Bob married and had more kids than he could afford. He created his reality and should suffer, IMHO, for his decisions. This movie whispers to the watcher the words of Paul --- DON'T DO THAT! Don't get into any sort of debt you can't justify. Sadly, we Americans mostly feel entitled to marriage, kids, a house and disposable income just for being born in the USA! This movie goes beyond that selfish, greedy, anti-Christ attitude.<br/><br/>As a Christian Capitalist myself I loved how this movie made me think and, once again, attempt to make me come to terms with the hypocrisy that surrounds us and forces us to realize the tragedy life really can become for the entitled selfish in the lower classes.<br/><br/>Remember when you watch this one thing and I think you will enjoy it much more, as I did. Justin Timberlake, playing the Christlike role, is not afraid. Not of death, not of being single, not of living alone, not of having no children... fear does not play a role in his life. The secret is thereby revealed in the movie - how do you live a good life of clear conscious? You simply stop fearing death or anything you would deem as failure and expect from your life nothing but serving others and seeking peace.<br/><br/>Time is money - but it doesn't have to be... because fear makes slaves and slavery makes power : but faith is (think Braveheart here) FREEEEEEEDOOOOOOM!"

","Our lead is Will Salas, portrayed affably by Justin Timberlake. His life is on the ghetto side of the time-line and one day in a bar, Salas rescues a man in the wrong side of town with over a hundred years left of his time. It turns out the rich kid is very old, no longer wants to live and commits suicide by 'timing out' and giving all his time to Salas. From here, the flip-side of the difference between lives from both sides of the spectrum begins and although this is possibly commentary on a current economic climate and the massive gap that still exists between class in society, it doesn't really embed that question into the mind as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Once Will has all this time on his side, he wants to take down the people at the top and quickly finds a way to New Greenwich, where all the money is and people live forever. On his journey he encounters Timekeeper Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy), a man out to keep the status quo in humanity because he believes it all needs to balance. Murphy is a definite bright spark in a muddled film, his time-cop persona breathes life into many scenes as does Vincent Kartheiser (MAD MEN'S Pete Campbell) who plays Philippe Weis, the man who owns New Greenwich and this seemingly eternal life.<br/><br/>In this world, we're also introduced to Weis's daughter, Slyvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) who gets involved with Will Salas because she believes she wants to feel what life is without any safety net or in her words ""The poor die and the rich don't live."" Timberlake and Seyfried do have flashes of chemistry but the script falters in plot discrepancies and doesn't really allow for much character development beyond what you work out early on from their characters.<br/><br/>There are cars chases, an extreme amount of 'time' puns - to the point of groaning – throughout and although it has a lot of interesting ideas and possibilities, it doesn't quite merge into a cohesive, confident film that really believes in what it's saying.<br/><br/>However, In Time does have flickers of enjoyable moments and could well be considered an entertaining time-heist film with echoes of Enemy of the State and the faint ideology of Bonnie & Clyde. So, if that's what you're looking for, then this should hit the spot."

","I can't remember the last time I watched a movie THIS bad in cinema. I saw some of the trailers and expected some sci-fi action movie between some P. K. Dick stories and Logan's Run, but what you actually get here is some cheap teenage entertainment TV-series pilot only with no entertainment part. The script is the worst part here and the entire story can be told in a few sentences. Any deeper social messages it tries to push are so contrived and shallow that they bring tears to your eyes (but in the good way). The dialog is bad and clichéd and definitely is somewhat to be blamed for the allover atrocious acting in the movie as the characters are thinner than in Marvel comics. With such few and lousy lines and amateur directing, all traces of any character developments depend solely on the charisma of the particular actor. All this makes this pile of garbage very painful to watch till the end and if there was ever a movie I should walk out from, this would be it. Fortunately, the cinema was empty so some beers and commenting with a friend who found his only interest in watching the main actress in mini skirts and high heels. Oh, the dressing of all the characters was very slick so I'm starting to think if the movie was not sponsored by some brand of clothing and all this is nothing more but a bad commercial gone worse.."

","Just watched this futuristic thriller with my movie theatre-working friend. It has people wearing a ""watch"" on their arms which digitally gives them a certain number of time that they use to pay for whatever means they need for survival. It stars people like Justin Timberlake, Olivia Wilde, Amanda Seyfried, and Cillian Murphy. Oh, and also Johnny Galecki from ""The Big Bang Theory"". The writer/director is Andrew Niccol who also penned the screenplay for another movie I liked called The Truman Show. This was almost as good as that with many expositions in the dialogue that explain whatever plot points you may be a little confused by. So on that note, In Time is a worthy thriller that makes you think about how precious time really is."
"Troy_Campbell","Null","0","2","1 November 2011"," Worthy of your time.
","Justin Timberlake's first foray into the action genre is a largely successful attempt; his natural charisma contributing to his believable 'every-man' character who seeks to take down the system. He chose wisely too, hitting sci-fi jackpot with Gattaca filmmaker Andrew Niccol not only at the helm but on scripting duties as well. In Time is intelligent without being pompous, although the unsubtle dig at the extremes in society's class system would've hit harder had it not been signposted at every turn. The intriguing plot – in the not-so-distant future you stop aging after turning 25 and must buy time to continue living – offers a neat concept and despite some obvious holes in logic, is a thought-provoker to boot. Along with Mr Sexyback, Amanda Seyfried hots up the screen as the wealthy rebel who plays Bonnie to JT's Clyde, however the standout is unsurprisingly Cillian Murphy who brings untold depth to his morally ambiguous ""Timekeeper"". Although it may not reach Inception-levels of sci-fi action awesomeness – what does? – this is worthy of your time nevertheless."
"info-130-288696","Null","0","3","31 October 2011"," A picture that explodes with creativity, excites with its relentless energy and presents a collection of strong and rounded performances
","Writer-director Andrew Niccol is a fairly absent talent: he takes prolonged breaks in-between projects in order to really flesh out and mould a picture. After a 7 year hiatus, he is back with In Time, a high-concept Sci-Fi Thriller which he claims to be a ""companion piece"" to his sensational Gattaca (1997).<br/><br/>In the near future, people stop aging at 25 and are granted another year of life moderated by a digital clock embedded in their skin. In order to prolong life, they must work to earn time, as well as trade and share it. Time is the planet's currency and with that comes responsibilities, power and sadly corruption. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is a poor industry worker from Dayton who soon finds himself pursued by timekeeper Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) after being accused of murder. Salas heads to New Greenwich and takes the rich and beautiful Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) hostage, but their relationship soon changes and the pair realise they share a connection which could change the face of the vicious monopolised system they find themselves a part of.<br/><br/>Despite the new world Niccol has created, what lies under In Time is something many of us have seen before – this is a bandit tale, part Robin Hood part Bonnie and Clyde. Salas and Weis are two people from different worlds who share a redeeming feature: they both wish for equality. In Niccol's future, the poor die young and the rich can live forever. Yet the planet is aware that there is not enough space for everyone and with so many living longer than ""they should"", prices of living are dramatically increasing in order to bump off those who plead poverty. It would be right to think the current financial and ecological climate had a profound effect on this picture's scripting process because fundamentally, this is ""Blade Runner: The Recession Cut"".<br/><br/>However, despite the movie's moral values (helping the poor and tackling the wealthy), it is clear a healthy investment aided this picture because it looks astonishing. Sets and props outweigh CGI and pyrotechnics. Every detail is supremely crafted and the world in which the film is set looks fantastic. Every single use of money in the real world is mirrored with time investments here, whether this is during a game of poker, having a quick coffee before work or advancing through a toll point at a bridge – what Niccol has done here to create authenticity is undeniable and consequently forces audiences into this spookily realistic space.<br/><br/>Although the film's principal narrative has been tweaked from timeless stories and folklore, In Time feels modern, singular and unique – it does not play upon the screen like a carbon copy of a past features: it is built with a great deal of creativity and substance, so it is easy to forget its nostalgic undertones. ""High-concept"" is an overused terminology in the cinematic world but it is a perfect signature stamp here. That, and ""postmodern"".<br/><br/>In Time is littered with action sequences, dynamic car chases and on-foot frenzies which keep the adrenaline pumping and the audience engaged in the drama which surrounds our two ""heroes"" – a term one uses very lightly. In fact, although Salas and Weis' behaviour is for the better good, their own morals and ideals are questionable – something fairly unusual in big-budget Hollywood releases. Granted the film does have clear villains: Sylvia's filthy-rich father Philippe (played by Mad Men star Vincent Kartheiser who quite frankly is playing a futuristic extension of his character in the show), and Alex Pettyfer's ""Minuteman"" Fortis who runs the local gang in the ghetto stealing the others' time.<br/><br/>In regard to this being a companion piece to Gattaca, it is quite obvious that Niccol has convinced himself of that fact because these two pictures share no similarities at all. However this is not a criticism, In Time is a breathless and extremely exciting movie that whirlwinds through its 109 minute running time, whilst Gattaca remains his most acclaimed and intelligent piece.<br/><br/>In Time boasts a heap of stars that all bring strong performances – Timberlake makes a great leading man here, who boasts presence and charisma as well as handling the action and emotional sequences. Many critics will say that he was better in The Social Network, but what they risk to forget is that a supporting role is very different from a leading one, and Justine is still trying hard to be competitive in both roles. Seyfried is also excellent and able to balance her snooty high-maintenance background with her new rebellious streak making Sylvia an unpredictable and interesting character. Murphy is strong support, Pettyfer is perfectly fine in his role and other names popping up immerse themselves in Niccol's world, including Johnny Galecki, most noted for his role in The Big Band Theory – which one happens to detest, but he performs capably and naturalistically here.<br/><br/>Verdict:  <br/><br/>The film has the odd silly dialogue slip and its primary tale is moderately recycled but these are minor quibbles in a picture that explodes with creativity, excites with its relentless energy and presents a collection of strong and rounded performances.<br/><br/>Read more reviews on The Upcoming http://www.theupcoming.co.uk/category/culture/cinema"

A special mention is needed for Justin Timberlake who played the role with integrity. I will forward to his next movie. Directing was fast paced, exciting, and no obvious CGI effects and spot on with character and actor choices. A movie needs a good story and this is where I think most of the credit should go.

"EmmaDinkins","Null","0","4","30 October 2011"," Chix Chat on Film review: Time is Money.
","This film gave me the impression that the term 'time is money' was very inspiring to Andrew Niccol, who wrote and directed this very creative take on a society that uses time as the most valuable currency. There was practically never a dull moment for Will Salas (Justine Timberlake) throughout the story or for me. The trailer gives great insight into the premise of the story and reveals that Will acquires a great deal of time per chance meeting with Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer). Will sets out on a journey delving into the lives of the time wealthy and this leads him to Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried), where the adventure begins. There was enough attention to detail in explaining the class warfare in this time society that you understood what was going on, but no explanation as to how it came to be. When the film was over it left me with questions about the body clock, how does it work, who put them on people, was it genetic testing that could stop the physical aging process at twenty-five, did the genome experiments lend way to a method that allows feigned immortality? These are questions I wanted to know, but I'm probably giving this whole convoluted idea too much thought, which then made me think about how talented Justine Timberlake is. As Will he's athletic what with all the running to save time, he was able to leap from a building in a single bound, he could dance and he shows he's an amazing driver. The only thing left to do to showcase his star power was to take a page from the Elvis play book and let him serenade Silvia. Too cheesy? Yeah, I thought so too. How 'bout them Timekeepers? Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) was one dedicated time cop, and of course his young protégé Timekeeper Jaegar (Collins Pennie) was more apathetic towards the time crimes and a bit too sympathetic to the perpetrators. The policing of time in this film is not to be confused with Jean Claude Van Dam's Time Cops, this story fortunately had nothing to do with time travel, but it did show that in any society it doesn't matter what the circumstances the people in the ghetto do not like the Po-po's. Although, this film took elements from the well known Bonnie and Clyde story and meshed it with Robin Hood, it was still fresh and new. I wouldn't say that it's a timeless masterpiece in storytelling, but I am glad that I took the time to see it. I give it a bright neon green light."

","Never has one writer had such a powerful influence on the movies, and one that keeps on going and going. And this influence has been fabulous for those of us who adore the genre or science fiction, and who find the spate of low budget, rather simple sci-fi films of the past year or two a thrill like no other. We live in a scary world, and with the future so uncertain and strange in real life, what better way to celebrate than to watch a movie exactly like this. Fear has no better brother than the imaginative mind, and this movie looks this emotion squarely in the face. Essentially a futuristic version of Bonnie and Clyde, Amanda and Justin are a sexy, sultry couple, on the run and on the make in a world where everyone can be seconds away from their demise and wear time has replaced money in a race for survival. This is not only a clever conceit but a modern world truism. And it leads to an element of surprise and drama that is shocking in its simplicity and depth. On top of all this, Justin is now a very charismatic star ala early Sean Penn, and has a chance to show his muscular acting style in a major role for the very first time. Amanda is the perfect sexy,and at the same time robotic foil,as well. This movie also has a fabulous use of LA as a futuristic world, almost as good as in Blade Runner. And let's hear it for a deep and perfect secondary cast that is so good in ever way (who is Johnny Galecki-wow!!). So see this soon, because it is like a hot butterscotch sundae on a Saturday afternoon. Or better, like seeing a new Dick novel appear in the paperback book store of your dreams."
"dreamflix","Null","0","4","29 October 2011"," No Logan's Run
","Seeing the previews of this, I totally expected there to be comparisons to the 1976 Sci-Fi movie, Logan's Run. After all, when you see that people will die at age 25, you get the zing of ""oh, I've heard that before"". So going to see this allowed for time to see how different this movie would be. And it was. Then I realized that there's going to be a re-make of Logan's Run set to open in 2014. Why? Can't we get some creativity here Hollywood? In Time has similarities to Logan's Run though, such as the obvious: you die at age 25. In Logan's Run, you had some type of gem on your arm that turned red when you turned 25. Then it was time to go to ""carousel"" where your under 25 homies cheered you into oblivion. There's the futuristic city where the young are living a ruse that there can be no existence after age 25. But Logan is sent on a mission to catch a ""runner"". He and his buddy work as enforcers that track and kill runners (those who's gem has turned red, but didn't go to carousel). But, of course, Logan ends up being chased by his enforcer buddy, who thinks he's a runner. Along the way, Logan meets a girl and the two run off. Then they find that there is life after age 25. So what's different about In Time? Well, Timberlake's character, Will Salas is actually given a bunch of extra time by someone who had become disillusioned by society. This society has a caste system. Those who have (time) are the posh elite, and live in a different time zone. Those who have not, live in the ghetto. The have nots move fast. They run. Because they don't have a lot of time. They pay for food, drinks, transportation, everything, with minutes. Their time clock is on their arms. They can look at their arms to see how much time they have left. Then there's the timekeepers. Something like Logan's friend, who chase people whom they think have stolen time. But Salas was given the extra time. Doesn't matter. Timekeeper Leon thinks he has stolen it and so begins the running. Along the way, we get to see the posh society. Enter the girl, Sylvia Weis, played well by Amanda Seyfried. The two end up on the run. Weis' father, is like a master timekeeper. Seyfried adds some comic relief in this movie. As Sylvia, she finds a way to steal time from her father, and then Salas and Sylvia change society by giving the have nots some extra time. The have nots can actually slow down. There are themes that tell the audience that Leon knew Salas' father. He possibly tracked him for giving away time. Something Timberlake's character, Salas ends up doing. Leon seems to be a lot like Salas. There's even the feeling that he could have been his father. If you like the Hollywood happy ending, then you'll find Salas and Weis becoming more of a Bonnie and Cylde type couple who steal time from the haves in order to give it to the have nots. Would I buy this on DVD? No. It was an interesting journey. Wonder if the casting director consciously cast main actors with blue eyes. Also, the cars - were they fuel efficient in the future? They didn't have door handles. Yet there were today-like bridges and roads. And there was the convenience of someone leaving their door open during the action scenes that allowed for their car to be taken. The tick-tock of time can be felt in the movie. The wall sized maps showing time zones and the people whose purpose is to track time and keep it under control. If you want an action movie where you can root for the underdog, then you'd like this one. If you're a Timberlake, or Olivia Wilde fan, then you won't be disappointed."

","In this age of Producers and Directors finding old stories, and re-done stories, and anything and everything under the sun that already has an audience, it was nice to go to the movie theater and gamble with my money for once. I think Woody Allen once put it in one of his scripts, when he has Joe Mantegna utter, ""Tom ""so-and-so"", HUGE star...he's in town doing a sequel of an adaptation of a remake."" And, then we get to the real and very delightful fact that there are STILL great minds in Hollywood that can give us something new to look at, and something else to hold our imagination while they dump a load of Social Drama all over us, and take another social engineering, soap-box position, even when that position (contrary to how Hollywood normally does it) stands in direct, middle finger up, f-you status. No 'smuggled' messages here. <br/><br/>IN this FILM. TIME is MONEY. Literally.<br/><br/>Everyone pays for everything with time, and time is what they earn when they work and even when they gamble. And, it is all recorded in a glowing bank account right on your arm, with checks and balances constantly shifting to the whims of whatever events bring about the next turning point in the film. <br/><br/>I was surprised about just how intelligent and able Timberlake has become as an actor. This film is basically a movie for teenagers, but there is some of that Penny Marshall, Tom Hanks ""Big"" type wisdom in this film, and I think in the hands of a better screenwriter and art director, this could have been as big of a movie franchise as the Matrix, and the jury is still out on that. The story left much to be desired, because most of it was cliché. But, I couldn't help soaking up this new world, which was funny, because there wasn't much IN IT. No lavish sets. All the cars appeared to be the same, except for JTs sequence with a James Bond car, and there was a lot of kissing in the film, which we don't see that much anymore, and not quite in this way. Amanda Seyfried was, eh, so-so, and Vincent Kartheiser and Cillian Murphy proved yet again WHY they are actors working in Hollywood: They sell the role. See it, but don't get too hung up on it. It is a movie that could have done so much more in the hands of the right Producer, and still, it made it out to the audience."
