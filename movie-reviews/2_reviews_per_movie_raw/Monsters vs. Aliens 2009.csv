"Apemangalore","7","118","156","27 March 2009"," A pleasant surprise
","Let's get this out of the way first: I'm not a huge fan of DreamWorks Animation. Usually consisting of nothing more than unfunny pop culture gags, I think the majority of their films are mediocre at best, with the only ones that I really enjoyed being the first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. The trailers for Monsters vs. Aliens did get me interested, though, and the voice cast seemed pretty impressive. Even so, I was still fairly skeptical about how it would finally turn out. Now, having seen the film, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot in the way of story and character development, but suffice it to say, it serves its purpose. What makes Monsters vs. Aliens such an enjoyable film is how it works as a comedy. The pop culture references are still present, but I found them to be more clever and funny this time around, and in much smaller amounts. I was smiling through virtually the entire film, and had about 5 or 6 hard laugh-out-loud moments throughout. As expected, I was also very impressed by the voice cast in this movie. Hugh Laurie does a fantastic job as the voice of the sophisticated (though mildly insane) Dr. Cockroach, and most of the laughs are generated by Seth Rogen's performance as B.O.B.. Even Reese Witherspoon helps you feel some sympathy for her character near the beginning of the film, and Stephen Colbert does a surprisingly solid job as President Hathaway.<br/><br/>The 3D, while not used as effectively as it was in Coraline, is still one of the more impressive showcasings that I've seen, and that's largely due to the film's incredible action sequences. Seriously, this is some of the best action that I've seen in an animated film; as far as I'm concerned, it's right up there with that of The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Overall, I found Monsters vs. Aliens to be a surprisingly entertaining film, with clever and witty dialogue, as well as terrific action. I'm not usually in favor of sequels, but if they're able to keep it as balanced and charming, I would honestly like to see this become a successful, long-running franchise. Nice job, folks at DreamWorks Animation."
"johnnymacbest","7","32","43","6 April 2009"," A little underwhelming, but still good fun.
","Okay, I'll admit I'm not big on CG movies as I always find 2D animation much more convincing and involving but I had a good time with this (along with a some relatives) and it's a pretty cool movie. However, I kinda felt a little underwhelmed; the story is good, but there's just wasn't enough substance along with the characters and action. I just felt it needed more. But it's a treat to see all the nods to '50s classic era of films that Monsters Vs Aliens pays homage to along with some good messages about being true to yourself and looking beyond one's appearance in order to know someone. Seeing the film with 3D glasses was a cool idea but in my view, 2D will suffice but still, it's good family entertainment for an afternoon. Hopefully the next film will have more ooomph, more ""Monstrosity""."

","I honestly don't know what some of these people who've reviewed this film were expecting.<br/><br/>Sure, it's called ""Monsters Vs. Aliens."" No, that DOES NOT mean that it HAS to be about five thousand monsters fighting five thousand aliens. You people watch too much Predator vs. Aliens.<br/><br/>What this was was a story about one girl, what happens to her and the challenges she faces.<br/><br/>And it's funny. Very funny, in an adult, dry and quirky way. It's not trying to be generic, which seems to be what some reviewers want. It's not trying to be a spectacle, like other reviewers expected it to be.<br/><br/>It's a well told comedy about this girl Susan.<br/><br/>My three year old has seen this movie somewhere in the range of 40 times. I've had to sit through it at least half of that and, quite honestly, it doesn't grow old for me like A Bug's Life or something in that vein might.<br/><br/>Too many people with too specific expectations - and no concept of what's good. Must be why Transformers made so much money."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","42","61","5 October 2009"," Pretty Innocent, And Fun To Watch
","This was a pleasant surprise: a nice, feel-good film that is pretty innocent and sports the usual beautiful Dreamworks art. The artwork and colors are magnificent. I say ""surprise"" because it did not get great reviews. Thus, I wasn't expecting the quality film I got.<br/><br/>The good guys - the ""monsters"" are typically-likable as you see in other animated films of today. They are pretty funny, too, diverse ""monsters"" like ""Dr. Cockroach, B.O.B and The Missing Link. They, along with ""Ginormica,"" who does her impression of the 1950s sci-fi character, ""The F-Foot Woman,"" are appealing and fun to watch. <br/><br/>I'm tempted to describe this movie as ""innocent,"" because it's such a nice story that doesn't have all the innuendos some other animated films have, yet still will make most adults laugh in many spots because there is some good humor that kids wouldn't get. ""Monsters Versus Aliens"" shows one doesn't need ""edginess"" in every movie to have adults enjoy the kids' film, too.<br/><br/>Chances are you'll find this movie a lot better than you thought. Give it a shot."
"pberko","7","120","196","14 March 2009"," Doesn't live up to the promise.
","When I first heard of Monsters vs. Aliens I literally went giddy. A 50's B-movie revival! Stephen Colbert as the President! Hugh Laurie as a cockroach! I mean, it's called Monsters vs. Aliens!!!<br/><br/>What I got was a mildly good movie. I mean, there were some nice gags in the Strangelove- lite War Room, and some great lines from BOB, but it really left me wanting more. As a whole, the film never got to the comical heights of Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, or even Shrek 2. There are times in the movie where you know that they are going completely random to try and get some laughs, but fail pretty badly. <br/><br/>Besides comedy, the story itself is pretty predictable. From the moment you meet the monsters you know what the moral of the story, and you know pretty much how the whole film will play out. <br/><br/>But it is not a bad film. Not at all. It's good, but not great. What IS great is the 3D. Me, I've never really warmed to 3D, but they use it here in a completely different sense. Monster's vs Alien's 3D is not about shouting ""OMG I CAN TOUCH HIS BEARD!!"", but more about perspective. And hair. I'm sorry but it's worth seeing just for Ginormica's (Susan's) hair alone. <br/><br/>So basically, it's fun - but not as fun as it should have been. And take it from me: even if you're cynical about 3D; see it in 3D. It's worth the ticket price alone."
"jdesando","Null","73","120","22 March 2009"," DreamWorks can be proud.
","The President of the United States (Stephen Colbert): ""Boys, set the terror level at code brown, 'cause I need to change my pants."" <br/><br/>Monsters vs. Aliens is my first 3-D movienot really, but it is the first time I have felt the process worked within a film as an integral part of the artistic process. It supports the science fiction, titillates at times, but most of all gives the illusion of reality. DreamWorks can be proud of this addition to the pantheon of excellent contemporary animations (dominated by Pixar) that use its Shrek as a touchstone for memorable characters wedded to mature themes and superior techniques.<br/><br/>Monsters vs. Aliens is also a family film in the truest sense: Elders to tots can enjoy the visual delights of 3-D outer space and observe a young bride-to-be Susan Murphy (voice of Reese Witherspoon) grow by a radiation accident into the heroic role of Ginormica, a woman literally too big for her britches. She must assert her independence from a self-centered fiancé and convince family, friends, and the world that an out-sized woman (read overachieving feminist) has a place in the male world, a superior place at that.<br/><br/>A strength of this sweet film is its use of ironic, sometimes sardonic, language to satirize just about everyone, from the president (see the opening quotation, not great humor but entertaining) to the makers of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, whose feel good '70's glow is ripe for 21st-century cynicism, to memories of such chestnuts as The Blob and The Creature from the Black Lagoon.<br/><br/>The hip,loving mood of the film is exemplified by the alien's proclamation at invasion time, ""Humans of Earth, my quest has led me to your planet. Give it to me now! You should, in no way, take any of this personally. It's just business."""
"Vic_max","Null","44","71","30 March 2009"," Wonderful summertime treat (even though it's still spring) ...
","If you're going to see this movie, make sure it's the 3D version - not all showings are in 3D. If you have the opportunity to see it in IMAX - it's definitely a 'bigger' treat ... but FWIW, know this: it was ""converted"" to IMAX from normal print - not created in the IMAX format.<br/><br/>OK - that said, the movie IS worth seeing. I'd say it was somewhere between ""really good"" and great. It's a fun story with fast pacing, entertaining characters and nice 3D effects.<br/><br/>It's basically about a group of 5 likable ""monsters"" that are pitted up against an alien attack. The main character is a new ""monster"" - Ginormica. She's a young lady that was recently hit by a meteorite with a special composition ... one that made her grow to gigantic size.<br/><br/>It's a fun story told in an imaginative way. The visuals are very nicely done - the backgrounds, characters and scope of detail are great. The movie also moves along at brisk pace - something that grabs your attention is always happening (this makes it work well for kids in the audience). Add to that the fun and oddball personalities of the monster characters and you have a winning combination.<br/><br/>The 3D effects were good, although like most other mainstream animated movies - they start out strong and then get recessed into background. Still - make sure you see it in 3D! You'll be missing part of the key experience offered by the movie if you don't.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a fun movie for adults as well as kids. It's kind of a summer movie that you get to watch in the spring. Grab some popcorn and check out this flick!"
"kentro21","7","86","162","5 March 2009"," Good, not great (unless you see it in 3D)
","Monster versus Aliens is a sometimes funny and sometimes interesting, but mostly the story is dull and the plot is nearly a non-entity.<br/><br/>However, this movie does take 3D to a new level at times. There's really only one obvious 3D ""gag"" very early in the movie, but other than that, you are just in awe of seeing these animated characters truly come to life like never before.<br/><br/>The character that steals the show is of course BOB (voiced by Seth Rogen) He is incredibly dumb but also fantastically funny and the most interesting of all the monsters. <br/><br/>The main character Susan (Reese Witherspoon) has this whole back story, but really we never care about it. Much of her story is just recycled from 100 movies that have come before and very predictable.<br/><br/>Still, the action and the 3D are top notch and this is a movie definitely worth seeing if you can see it in the 3D form. In 2D, I only give it a very lukewarm recommendation."
"cherold","7","6","8","13 January 2011"," Cute and often very funny
","After a rather slow beginning in which a girl gets proposed to, the movie picks up when she gets turned into a giant on her wedding day and from that on the film is frenetically comic. Like most Dreamworks cartoons, this one can feel like it's trying too hard (Dreamworks has a Looney-Tunes-on-speed approach that can be a little exhausting), but at its best the movie is wildly funny.<br/><br/>The story and characters are admittedly generic, but pleasantly so. But there is a certain annoying laziness to the plotting. The death of one character is treated as sad even though the audience is given no reason to care, and the female empowerment angle is a bit on the silly side. The plot is at a kid's movie level, even though the humor is funniest enough for this adult.<br/><br/>Not a great cartoon, but a very enjoyable one."
"singwaileung-1","5","13","21","21 April 2009"," Dreamworks needs some new originality
","Monsters and Aliens was a poor clichéd animated outing from Dreamworks. I found some of the pop culture and repetition in an attempt to get cheap laughs were embarrassingly bad. In particular the part where the President tries to make peace with the alien invaders by playing the Beverley Hills Cop theme on an electric piano made me cringe. Another scene where the general was showing images of the monsters to the cabinet with the secretary hysterically screaming on a number of occasions, leading to the president screaming also left me cold.<br/><br/>The characters were charming, yet I did not feel that the bond between the female lead and the alien characters were all that strong for her to want to stay as the heroine Ginormica - and yes, what an original nickname, eh? Whilst Pixar and Disney are still coming out with great original flicks such as Wall-E and Bolt, Dreamworks are really hitting a downer with unoriginal narratives, and they need to find a new formula to get their franchise going again. Shrek 3 was also unimpressive. Maybe they should get out of their monsters theme and find some new kind of characters to play on."
"erv-7","3","15","26","11 January 2010"," Clearly it is not for me
","Watched it, didn't enjoy it. To me it looked like a waste of time.<br/><br/>The Good: <br/><br/>1) Have a few good jokes in the movie. <br/><br/>2) Relatively high quality CG.<br/><br/>The Bad: <br/><br/>1) Predictable plot. It many places it is obvious what will happen in say, next 15..30 minutes, and it is possible to correctly guess key events at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>2) There are less than 5 good jokes in the movie. <br/><br/>3) Nearly no character development - only main character change a little, others remain unchanged. <br/><br/>4) Unrealistic character development and behavior. Not really logical story. Weak plot.<br/><br/>5) In some scenes it almost look like creators were running either out of time or out of budget - while some scenes are interesting, and filled with many objects and different characters, most of the other scenes use pretty bland sets that doesn't look ""alive"" (In my opinion) enough. In fact with exception of one or two scenes nearly every set looks more like decoration, than a something even remotely realistic. <br/><br/>6) Absolutely horrible design of giant butterfly at the end. <br/><br/>Bottom line: Someone obviously had too much cash to spent. This movie could be much better. There are maybe 2 or 3 good jokes that could make me smile a bit, but story weak and predictable, and the movie doesn't offer enough in graphic department to watch it only because of graphics or CG."
"jhmocha","6","28","55","2 April 2009"," Good, but not quite as good as expected.
","Monsters Vs. Aliens has some really funny moments, but by the time you get to see them on the big screen you've already seen them plenty of times on the small one. So there's not too much left to offer by buying a ticket. I thought the 3D was OK. They have a couple of moments specifically designed around flexing the 3d capabilities, but again nothing mind-blowing.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the gigantic Susan (Reese Witherspoon) while pushing all the more interesting characters out of the spotlight. Susan is someone we've all seen in movies before. The victim of an unfortunate mishap leading her down a path she would rather not go down. So the plot follows the same course from there, feels pretty routine. Focusing more on the three other monsters would have made this a better movie. They're much more interesting and only get a small handful of moments to shine throughout the picture.<br/><br/>That was probably the biggest letdown. Having some great comedic potential in the characters voiced by Hugh Laurie, and Will Arnett take a back seat ride. No complaints about Seth Rogen's B.O.B. though, he was great. Kiefer Sutherland was surprisingly good as the General. I underestimated his vocal range.<br/><br/>Finally they made a big deal about Stephen Colbert playing the President, and there wasn't enough of him. All of his funny moments, except for the scene after some of the credits, saturated the coming attractions and commercials. I would have liked to see more of his character.<br/><br/>Overall, its enjoyable. I like to see elements of classic old genres (like the classic monster movies of the 50's and 60's) brought to life in modern day CGI. I just thought this movie had more up its sleeve than it was showing me."
"DICK STEEL","4","31","62","17 May 2009"," Å Nutshell Review: Monsters vs Aliens
","I'm beginning to wonder whether the 3D novelty is wearing out already, especially if slapped on films that think the beauty of visual effects and animation take precedence over a solid story. Everything here worked to a perfect T, from the very key component of animation, to voice casting, and sound, but what the film ultimately lacked, was a compelling narrative, and soul.<br/><br/>The premise for success is all there, and as seen in the trailer, there's a pretty good balance of comedy, action, and homage to the 50s and 60s horror and sci-fi genres. But as the adage goes, too many cooks, in this case, screenplay writers (5 of them no less) will spoil the broth, and as a result, the trailer contains the best bits from within the movie, and everything else just plain boring, which to me too is a surprise.<br/><br/>Directed by Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon who brought us Shark Tale and Shrek 2 respectively, you would have thought that the combination of their strengths would result in one heck of an entertaining ride, not. It's about time animated films pull a stop to lampooning all that's pop culture. Sure it's funny for a while, but it gets on your nerves pretty much faster than you can roll your eyes at the next joke from the same joke book. <br/><br/>While the film has plenty of monsters and well, just one alien and a giant robot which form the adversarial core, it's not about teamwork but the celebration of the strength of individuality. It's the story of a wistful bride Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) whose only goal in life is to go to Paris with her husband-to-be Derek (Paul Rudd), a news weatherman whom you know is actually the jerk that he is. Cue huge falling debris onto Susan on her wedding day, and she becomes Ginormica, captured by General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) who puts her in a top-secret pet ""zoo"" of sorts with his other trophies Insectosaurous, Dr. Cockroach Ph.D. (Hugh Laurie), a merman creature known as The Missing Link (Will Arnet) and the crowd favourite, the nonsensical B.O.B (Seth Rogen), a blob of jello goo with no brain who serves as the punching bag and the source of all things funny here.<br/><br/>Speaking of funny, the laughs unfortunately don't come hard and fast. Attempts are made to be funny from the get go, but more often than not the effort fell flat on its face. It tried to emulate the Zucker brothers style of slapstick wit, and to a certain degree, when it worked it worked wonders, but you can sense an audience disconnect here when everyone fell silent most of the time. Even kids aren't tickled by the usual juvenile antics of the characters anymore, which now calls for a shift in sophistication.<br/><br/>A whole host of stars join the lineup, such as Rainn Wilson as the villainous alien Gallaxhar, Stephen Colbert as the dim-witted President Hathaway, Amy Poehler as a computer voice and even Renee Zellweger, but despite the star power going all round in flesh out the carefully designed and crafted animated characters, ultimately everyone was one-dimensional and playing to their stereotypical tendencies. 3D-wise, there are only a handful (pardon the pun) of scenes that are specifically designed with that kind of interaction in mind, otherwise the visuals only provide that depth of view, and nothing much that will make you reach out or duck.<br/><br/>Technically, you cannot fault Monsters vs Aliens. But essentially there's no heart in this film at all, and that proved to be its ultimate downfall that no novelty factor can redeem on its behalf."
"Tweekums","7","4","5","9 January 2013"," Enjoyable retro sci-fi animation
","When a meteorite made of quantonium strikes Susan Murphy on the day of her wedding it doesn't kill her; it causes something strange to happen though... just as the service is getting underway she starts glowing slightly green then starts to grow. She doesn't stop growing till she is fifty feet tall! Understandably everybody flees in terror and the army turns up, tranquilises her and takes her to a secret facility where they keep monsters. These include Dr. Cockroach; BOB, a gelatinous blob; (Missing) Link, a strange fish/ape and Insectosaurus an enormous caterpillar like creature. It looks as if Susan will have to spend the rest of her life in captivity with these creatures until evil alien Gallaxhar sends a giant robot probe to Earth to recover the quantonium. The military is powerless to stop the robot so they use the monsters; they manage to defeat it but Gallaxhar realises that Susan has his quantonium so comes to Earth to recover it himself. If Earth is to survive his plans Susan and her monster friends will have to defeat Gallaxhar and his army of clones.<br/><br/>This Dreamworks animation has quite a lot going for it; the animation looks good, the characters are fun, the story is exciting enough without being too scary for younger viewers and the numerous references to older films are done in a way that people who haven't seen those films won't feel like they are missing a joke. The voice work was done well with none of the characters sounding overly cartoony. On the downside there are a few jokes which seemed out of place in a film aimed at children... do we really need a joke about the president soiling his trousers? I think not. The opening scene suggested that we were going to be reminded that this was filmed in 3D at every opportunity but thankfully that was the only moment that I thought was gratuitously 3D, which was good as I was watching on television. When compared to the works of Pixar or Dreamworks own 'How to Train Your Dragon' this looks distinctly second best; however it is still pretty good; it might not be essential viewing but it is well worth watching if you are a fan of animated films."
"arc_a2007","4","15","28","7 April 2009"," The tagline of this movie should be ""Eh...""
","Because that's exactly what you get. Monsters vs. Aliens isn't a TERRIBLE movie, but it's not very good either. The plot is predictable. That's something that you should expect from movies of this type. But a certain other animation studio (I think you know the one) makes the journey itself so enjoyable, and the scope of adventure so vast that it doesn't matter. Monsters vs. Aliens feels at times like a bunch of action scenes strung together by completely unfunny jokes. There's also a message of female independence here, one that gives the film a chick-flick flair. If that sounds bad, stick around. It gets worse.<br/><br/>This movie is just not funny. It spouts pop culture references (a dirty habit of Dreamworks animation), one of which is embarrassing to watch even by oneself. The action scenes are... well, they're Incredibles-ish. At least they try to be. They attempt to be frantic and energetic, but it doesn't really turn out that way. The movie reaches its absolute lowpoint when we're supposed to mourn a character who's come off like one big joke the whole film. This eye-rolling moments leaves us wondering why we should care.<br/><br/>But it's not all bad. In one particular scene, the main character Susan gets imprisoned. What happens next is surprising and exciting. You just don't expect that to happen. The celebrity presence in a Dreamworks film is always a certainty. They always put flash-in-the-pan idiots in lead roles. But in their defense, at least Hugh Laurie is subdued. You don't know that it's him, and that's something these big personalities should learn to make a convincing role. Still, Monsters vs. Aliens is quite mediocre. We know where it's going within ten minutes of the film and the rest is fleshed out by action scenes and dumbed-down comedy."

","Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) is a woman who got upsized by a meteorite on her wedding day. B.O.B. (Seth Rogen) is a gelatinous, brainless creation after an experiment on a tomato went wrong. Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie) is a scientist who turned himself into a hybrid. The Missing Link (Will Arnett) is a creature found frozen and revived. And giant mutant larva Insectosaurus is a product of nuclear testing. The government has secretly collected these monster and now they need them to fight alien Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson).<br/><br/>DreamWorks has gathered all the iconic 50s sci-fi B-movie creations, and formed a pretty cohesive team. It's surprising that the limited backstory allowed the characters to gel so well right off the bat. It's probably due the fact that these characters seem so familiar to us. It also helps that the actors do some great voice work.<br/><br/>The story itself has one major problem. The movie is basically split in two parts. The pacing slows down dramatically in the middle after a high intensity fight at the start. However the comedy works well especially the brainless BOB. I think this team has good potential."

","As far as the artistry and imagery, I was wowed let me tell you! And the plot was even great on the surface! As a mindless 'Overcoming the Monster' plot, it was superb. But...and this is a BIG but...if I see one more movie that portrays the woman as the selfless leading alpha-hero overcoming men and saving the day, and the men as (a) selfish egotists victimizing the poor hapless female, or (b) as a bunch of bumbling idiots following a woman's lead, I think I am seriously going to boycott this society. This seems to be an alarming trend in popular culture that I could really get on a soapbox about, but I'm not. At least not nearly as much as I'd like. The part that really bothers me is that men seem completely complacent in it. Completely unconscious! It would be against my conscience not to at least mention it. This is a pattern, not an anomaly. However, if you are not one to care about underlying ethical concerns such as the subtle systematic emasculation and/or vilification of men, this is a really great movie! It was one big thrill ride that really put me in awe of the creative ability of the human race."

","I was excited to see this movie, especially since I had never seen a 3D animated feature before. However, I ended up walking out of the theater when the movie was about two-thirds over. <br/><br/>The plot was entirely cliché (wow, Derrick is a selfish jerk who rejects Susan once she's a monster? But Susan actually enjoys being a monster? Didn't see that coming!) and the characters were just as one-dimensional (Susan herself was a stereotypical ""sweet"" female protagonist who--after being predictably rejected by her love--finds new power and independence in herself, hurray! And her friends all fit into the typical, ""sidekick"" frames; you have the mad scientist, the arrogant tough guy, and the dumb, likable comic relief.) <br/><br/>Nothing pushed the boundaries here; it was all based on tired clichés and poor, lazy executions of them, including the humor: trite, contrived, unfunny, and failed attempts at being hip and modern and unexpected, catering to that weird demographic of people that most animated movies tend to cater to nowadays...not sure quite what it is, average American parents that they know will be dragged to the movie? <br/><br/>It's as if they are trying to find the most ""adult"" gags that they can place in a kid-oriented film to get adults laughing ""in spite of themselves"", even though the gags are aimed towards them in the first place, instead of finding gags that are natural, flow with the story and characters, and appeal to a broad range of ages. And supposedly the 3D animation was innovative for its field, but I found it underwhelming...only a few parts were enhanced by the 3D animation.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not the worst animated film I've seen, but it has barely any (if any) redeeming factors, so it still gets a rating of 1/10 from me."
"Digory","4","16","32","23 May 2009"," Nothing new here
","Just because there are monsters and aliens in this film (which are CGI) doesn't give any assurance of a good film. What happened here was that they were too dependent on the concept of monsters and aliens that they gave little attention to the story. Development was limited to 4 not-so-interesting characters and the theme was very common (friendship, teamwork, etc.). A positive theme but they can always think of another, even better, one. Other animated movies seem to do it well.<br/><br/>The characters I really liked only made an appearance in the first half of the movie, the other half focused on the friendship the ""monsters"" were starting to have. A waste of a good idea.<br/><br/>Maybe kids will enjoy this generic CGI film, but even my siblings (ages 6, 10, and 13) didn't like this movie. It was forgettable."

","The thing is.. it's just not entirely entertaining. Maybe I expected more and had my hopes up so it's probably partly my fault but MONSTERS Vs. ALIENS is just an average family movie. It's got some amusing moments, a few scenes that will get you to chuckle a bit, Kids will love it, parents will love it, but the rest of us however will be saying 'okay, next!' Thank God it has the 3D because otherwise I'd be staring at my wristwatch from beginning to the end.<br/><br/>I'm okay with 3D movie, I welcome any awesomeness that could enhance our movie watching experience but if the movie has humor that misses the target and a story way too easy for our intelligence, not even 3D could fully save the day. I respect the MONSTERS Vs. ALIENS trying to teach our young viewers the lesson of not looking at people like freaks or different because you never know, they might be the ones to keep the world from getting blown up by aliens. The movie uses the blue character BOB as its poster boy because all the marketing indicates that he's the comic relief but I find the president to be the most hilarious, for some reason I don't know why, but Stephen Colbert gets the best lines in the movie.<br/><br/>The action 'roller coaster ride' sequences are just OK, your typical scenes that you've felt in other movies before, it doesn't have that much of a thrill if you ask me. Reese Witherspoon's animated character, Susan is supposed to be the lead star and yet in the end we could care less for what would happen to her. I'm impressed with Keifer Sutherland's peculiar voice as the angry general, hearing the voice alone I wouldn't have figured out it was Kiefer. I don't wanna drag this review, point is MONSTERS Vs. ALIENS is pointless, predictable, and over-hyped. You won't miss a thing if you never watch it. You shouldn't be surprised because Dreamworks animation is a hit-and-miss situation unlike Pixar that always lives up to its promise.<br/><br/>--Rama's SCREEN--"
"eye-shuh","3","12","23","6 April 2009"," boring and disappointing
","Went and saw Monsters vs Aliens on Friday. It was a cute movie, but very disappointing overall.<br/><br/>We were very excited to go as (1) it's in 3D and (2) we were babysitting one of our friend's cool little brother who was pumped to go to the movies.<br/><br/>About halfway through he got so bored that he started playing Mario Kart on a borrowed DS. I kid you not.<br/><br/>That was the biggest issue. It was just a boring movie overall. The fight scenes don't last nearly as long and weren't as frequent as the previews suggest. In fact, there are only two main fight scenes and neither manages to make the movie worth while.<br/><br/>The whole movie revolves around Susan (the woman who grows into a giant after getting hit by a meteor) and her issues rather than around the much more fun idea of monsters fighting aliens. Susan's tale is one that has been told a million times over with the exact same conclusions - yet they dragged it on and committed the movie to it.<br/><br/>The positives: There are lots of fun old sci-fi references. When the President first tries to make contact with the aliens, I couldn't stop laughing. It was classic. Also, when other reviews say Seth Rogan is the highlight of the movie, they aren't kidding - well, his character, Bob, is anyway. His performance is brilliant and brings the most laughs, though the other voice acting is quite excellent as well just unfortunately falls flat on humor.<br/><br/>It's really too bad Susan was even in the movie. Taking her out of it would have given the script much more alien vs monster goodness to play with rather than focusing on her boring dilemma that we all knew exact plot and ending for.<br/><br/>The cool concepts of monsters and aliens couldn't liven this old story.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say don't go see it in theaters. Even the 3D is lack luster. I would have been much happier just renting it and watching it at home during a dull afternoon.<br/><br/>I badly wanted to love this movie but I came away with a bored 12 year old boy and crappy giant black nerd 3D glasses rather than the cool paper red and blue ones."

","The friendly folks from Dreamworks Animated Entertainment have pitched in yet another cartoon that shall satisfy both children and their parents. The only thing is that as I was watching the movie, there were a bit too many adult pop culture references that could go over a child's head. Yes, many modern animated movies are layered both for children and adults, but as I have discovered in the Pixar movies, the Disney animated studio, most of the layering is kept both at a child's and an adult's level by not throwing in too much pop culture to amuse the adults.<br/><br/>The premise of this recent flick is a group of mutated monsters, well, saving the world from alien attacks. There is always a reliable cast that gives voice to each character to match the personalities so you can think, ""I know who's doing that voice."" The heroine of the movie is Susan Murphy (voiced by Reese Witherspoon), a sweet and perky young California girl who is about to get married to an egotistical TV weatherman named Derek Dietl (voiced by Paul Rudd). Quicker than saying ""I do,"" Susan, who was momentarily hit by a meteoroid, grows into a strong, near 50-foot mutant, stomping on grounds and pulling objects apart. She is taken by the feds to a monster prison run by the gung-ho and macho General W.R. Monger (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland). She meets and makes friends with four other mutated monsters held capture there for 50 years. They are the grunting half-insect, half-dinosaur Insectosaurus, the oozy, blue, one-eyed Bob (voiced by Seth Rogen), the fish monster Missing Link (voiced by Will Arnett), and the small insect mad scientist monster Dr. Cockroach (voiced by Hugh Laurie). As for Susan, one of the monsters dub her as Ginormica, although initially, Susan doesn't think of herself as a monster, but as a human being. Anyone familiar with the 1950s B-monster movies would guess which character the monster is being based on. Small children may not understand the movies their parents grew up on.<br/><br/>The monsters are all banded together and now the general, as well as the President of the United States (voiced by Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert), want to free the monsters from captivity. All the military talks are done in a war room run by the president in order to reference the 1964 classic ""Dr. Strangelove"" to keep the adults interested, but small children may not get that as well. To do that, they have to fight an alien ship. The attack starts in San Francisco (and the scenery of the city is amazingly drawn) and then moves to Susan's hometown of Modesto. In Modesto, Susan is taken aboard and goes face to face with an evil four-eyed alien with a pointy head named Gallaxhar (voiced by Rainn Wilson) and has armies of aliens who look like him to do battle. Three of the four monsters get on board to help Susan, temporarily back to her regular size, since Gallaxhar zapped Insectosaurus. In the end, the monsters defeat the aliens and Susan returns home with all of her friends to her family, now happier as a monster than as a human.<br/><br/>Most of the character development revolves around Susan/Ginormica. Despite her gigantic size, she's too perky to be frightening. All the other monsters are well-drawn but there is little depth to them in their development. Also, these monsters have personalities too benign to be scary. The humans in the movie, the General and the President, are drawn to look exactly like the actors voicing them to remind us who they are. But Gallaxhar is the scariest character in the entire movie because he and his armies are so evil. The animation and visuals are fantastic, and the actors, like in many Pixar/Dreamworks animated movies, lend fine vocal support. I don't think this movie will make animated history like ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Shrek,"" ""Toy Story,"" or ""Ratatouille,"" to name a few, but it is a sweet and genial escape, and the visuals are what make it worthwhile. It is shown in two versions  2D and 3D. Either way, it makes a pleasant outing. It is fun for the family, but it is rated PG for cartoon violence and a bit of crude humor and mild language."

","Monsters vs. Aliens is a family-friendly Dreamworks Animation feature which pits classic sci-fi monsters vs. space aliens, in a 1950's B-movie style showdown with modern humor and the visual flair available through today's computer effects. For a special treat, the film is also available in 3D.<br/><br/>The story is simple. A meteor crashes on Earth, or more specifically, onto bride-to-be Susan Murphy. Some substance from the meteor causes her to grow to 50 feet in height. She is hidden by the government with other monsters (based loosely on The Creature From the Black Lagoon, The Blob, The Fly, and various Godzilla foes), until space aliens arrive, bent on world domination. Outmatched by the alien's technology, the U.S. government calls on the monsters to save humanity from annihilation.<br/><br/>All of this is done with a light and fun air, with nothing taken too seriously. Like the best of recent animated features, Monsters vs. Aliens is as enjoyable for adults as for children, thanks in large part to a constant barrage of jokes and a stellar voice cast. Reese Witherspoon is wonderful as Susan Murphy, while 24's Kiefer Sutherland gets a rare chance to flex his comedic muscle as backwoods general W.R. Monger.<br/><br/>The Office's Rain Wilson is fine as Galaxar (the evil alien), as is Arrested Development's Will Arnett as The Missing Link and House's Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach. Popular political comedian Stephen Colbert, in an inspired casting choice, plays the President of the United States. Hands down the best character, in my opinion, is Seth Rogen's B.O.B, a gelatinous creature who is blissfully stupid and eats anything in his path. The character design is fantastic, and the film is a visual treat. Monsters vs. Aliens comes recommended to people of all ages."

","Monsters vs. Aliens is animated film about a women who is turned into a giant, becomes part of a team of monsters to defeat an alien trying to take over Earth. this is one of the few animated films that I like now a days. I'm not a huge fan of the way animation is now. I like animation from the 30s to the 80s. Directors Conrad Vernon and Rob Letterman do a pretty good job with Monsters vs. Aliens. Some of the action sequences are engaging. What really holds Monsters vs. Aliens together is the script. It is written very clever with the humor about the government and I really like the homage to old horror monsters. I had some really good laughs through this film. Monsters vs. Aliens has an impressive voice cast: Reese Witherspoon, Hugh Laurie, Seth Rogen, Will Arnett, Kiefer Sutherland, Stephen Colbert, Rainn Willson, & Paul Rudd. The whole cast delivers line after line really good giving you laughs throughout. Monsters vs. Aliens is entertains for all ages and you're bound to get laughs out of it."

","I had seen this first in theaters in 3d. This was the one of the first 3d movies I had seen with the whole glasses deal and stuff. And really, the 3d wasn't as amazing as it could have been. I can recall two specific parts where the 3d was in use, one right at the beginning of the movie with the ping pong ball paddle, the other later on when the alien is having coffee or something and the fork floats in the air. There may have been a third but I can't specifically remember. Which is basically what I'm trying to say, the 3d wasn't good enough.<br/><br/>The story was okay, and comical enough to keep me entertained, however I still wish they could have worked a bit better on the plot. I mean, why date and try to marry some guy who in the end is a jerk? All of that work for nothing. And then there's the comical Government which steps in and tries to take care of things because they know better than us.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was good. It was one of the better dreamworks movies compared to some of the stuff they've made. It could have been better, but it could have been worse. 7/10."
"gregeichelberger","5","12","25","30 March 2009"," New 'toon has a brain but very little heart
","One would have to believe that - as far as animated features goes - Dreamworks must feel sort of like Avis Car Rental, No. 2 behind Pixar Studios. This feeling of inferiority was never more apparent with the release of ""Monsters vs. Aliens,"" which is basically ""Monsters, Inc."" meets the ""Incredibles,"" two vastly superior Pixar movies.<br/><br/>A colorful wonderama for the kiddies with a few over-their-head jokes tossed in to please mom and pop, this picture exhibits a lot of intelligence, but strangely very little heart. This is surprising especially for the studio which produced the hilarious and often emotional ""Shrek"" franchise. It also gets a bit intense in some scenes and parents may find this a bit of a problem, as well.<br/><br/>Story has Susan (voice of Reese Witherspoon) preparing for her marriage to cocksure, selfish weatherman Derek Deil (Paul Rudd, ""I Love You, Man"") when she is struck by a meteor from out of the blue. Of course, as we all know, such an occurrence would not crush her, it just makes her grow to gigantic proportions - 49 and-a-half feet, to be exact.<br/><br/>Soon, the government arrives, stuns, captures and hauls her off to a gray jail cell (here is where my children and many others in the theater had their initial glee interrupted, as the scene is quite dreary and depressing). Soon, though, she perks up when meeting her fellow cell mates, various monsters kept in captivity since the 1950s: Dr. Cockroach (a play on the Fly, voiced by Hugh ""House"" Laurie); the Missing Link (a Creature from the Black Lagoon,); B.O.B. (a one-eyed Blob-type thing, Seth Rogen, Observe and Report"") and a giant caterpillar (think Mothra). This last mutant is really creepy and exhibits no cuddle or humor factor, whatsoever.<br/><br/>General W. R. Monger (""24's"" Keifer Sutherland) informs Susan (now called ""Gi ) that she will have to be incarcerated here for life, now very promising news to a lady on her wedding day. But soon, as fate would dictate, an alien entity (a giant one-eyed steel robot) has landed on earth in search of a substance that was in the meteor that stuck Susan. When the President (Stephen Colbert, ""The Colbert Report"") tries to communicate - via a series of wisecracks - the intruder goes berserk, and even the Army cannot stop it.<br/><br/>These scenes, as well as the war room sequences, are very funny, but are far above the average child's ability to grasp. Seeing no other choice, Monger tells the President that only the captive monsters can save the day. They are subsequently released and tackle the giant robotic device. Later, they are forced to face the angry alien leader (Rainn Wilson, ""The Office"") aboard his mothership.<br/><br/>As previously written, the animation here is terrific. The scenes in and around San Francisco are amazing; the views from space awesome and the characters well done and well-defined. The writing, for the most part, tries to imitate the old Warner Brothers cartoons with juvenile silliness the youngsters could relate to mixed in with the jokes only adults could contemplate. <br/><br/>The main problems are the lack of character development (we know little of any of the main leads and the various aliens and monsters are just thrown at us); poor pacing (the movie speeds up slows down and speeds up again) and the absence of an emotional center (we just do not care about any of these characters like we did Shrek or Fionna or Donkey, for that matter). The faults are not fatal, but do draw the distinction between better, more polished animated CGI efforts.<br/><br/>Still, in an atmosphere of really bad films currently playing, and fewer family movies showing, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is not a terrible picture to see; at least the whole family can be entertained for a while and there's nothing wrong with that."
"MovieCriticDave","6","10","20","28 March 2009"," Spotty, uneven story leaves Monsters vs Aliens wanting
","Okay, admit it; at some point, you've bought something based solely on how cool it looked on a commercial or ad, only to find out your diamond-in-the-rough purchase turned out to be a papier-mache disappointment.<br/><br/>That's the disappointing truth that is Dreamworks' ""Monsters vs Aliens,"" Paramount's heavily hyped 3-D big screen adventuretoon that bears only a fractious resemblance to its title. And one would be well-advised to save your popcorn money and don't make the special effort to seek out a 3-D theater. In this offering, the net ""dimension"" is ultimately forgettable.<br/><br/>If you go into the theater expecting the movie advertised on countless TV spots and trailers, you'll be sorely disappointed, and the disappointment highlights Dreamworks' lost opportunity. Where the title suggests the possibility of a delightfully inventive story between legion carton monsters and otherworldly counterparts, it delivers a decidedly uneven montage of a story that bounces between outer space, suburbia, San Francisco, and a bizarre-but-explained-away military encampment. ""M vs A"" suffers the same identity problem as so many other similarly fractious films; poor execution from a poorly conceived story. The saddest part of all is that the clear potential of the film lay squarely in what its title promised, contrasted against what its creators ultimately delivered.<br/><br/>Although there are some cute bug-eyed monsters, with Seth Rogen's cycloptic Bob clearly the comedy star among them, they are relegated to background characters in the ultimate conflict around which the movie is drawn. Even the ultimate bad-guy alien isn't ultimately much of a character; he's merely a strawman bad guy for the hero (make that heroine) to battle. In the end, ""Monsters vs Aliens"" isn't about either; it reduces to a tired girl-power story that's been told better in Disney TV outings like ""Kim Possible."" ""Monster vs Aliens"" is not without its comic moments, but only in one-shot jokes, not from an underlying comedic theme that a strong film should aspire to provide. At our screening, the audience was quiet for conspicuously long spells between laughs. Moreover, the Dreamworks animation team still plays second-fiddle to the Disney-Pixar gold-standard, with lapses in continuity including sequences where it seemed some characters failed to maintain consistent size and proportion within the confines of their animated environment.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story suffers from the same problem - loss of continuity. There's at least one stretch early in the movie where one begins to ask if the projectionist accidentally switched to a different feature due to the sudden, lengthy, and tedious departure from the basic story. Sadly, the departure became the basis for the bulk of the rest of the film, while providing almost none of the laughs.<br/><br/>To be sure, there are sufficient moments for the kids to get their due share of giggles, but the 3-D moments are ultimately a why-bother. Sadly, much can be said of the rest of the movie. Ultimately, animation and 3-D tricks can't conceal the fundamental sin of a poorly conceived story.<br/><br/>If only ""Monsters vs Aliens"" had delivered a story representing even a pale shadow of its title.....if only..."

","The latest effort from Dreamworks Animation is among their best efforts to date and, for the first time, I see them stepping ahead of Pixar.<br/><br/>What a better set-up for an animated film than Earth when it is about to be invaded by a squid-like alien with his fair amount of bad eyes and his army of clones? You get to meet a group of monsters in their containment area somewhere deep within Area fifty***. The Creature From the Black Lagoon (Missing Link), the Blob (BOB), The Fly (Dr. Cockroach), Mothra  one of Godzilla's enemies (Insectosaurus) and the 50 foot Woman (Ginormica/Susan)  who is only 49ft by the way  are all covered here. One may wonder where is the Giant Killer Tomato or the Invisible Man but this handful of monsters are enough to nullify the Alien menace.<br/><br/>The movie itself is pure enjoyment: Colbert as the President is hilarious, Laurie is an excellent mad scientist and I could not point a single flaw in the cast but, it is definitely Seth Rogen who shines voicing BOB, the inform mass of gelatinous goo. He adds layers of volume to the character and brings his own goofiness with him.<br/><br/>The action is well paced, you don't perceive any lengths or unnecessary moments, even better, you don't feel there is missing any either. As an added bonus, the movie does not feature horrible cover versions of musical gems like in some other Dreamworks Animation movies.<br/><br/>Monsters VS Aliens raises the bar for animated movies when it comes to technical achievement. It is the first film I see that makes an adequate use of 3D. The computer rendered 3D world is seemingly the only suitable setup for stereoscopic vision as it failed to impress beyond 'Oh Well!' when used with flesh and bones actors and filmed decors.<br/><br/>If you are heading to see this movie, make sure it's in 3D, the movie itself is worth seeing no matter the viewing experience but what really makes it special is the rendering of everything in stereoscopy."

","The idea was fun. The story was even fun. What made this dreadful was the timing. Now this isn't the editor, this is the director and script. You would have moments that were just not even remotely amusing and time would be wasted and wasted and you'd still be there waiting for a punch line that never came. And of course when the moment was witty you never held it for the laugh.<br/><br/>So poor timing and a tedious script could not be made up for in vocal talent. I am a huge Hugh Laurie fan and he couldn't save the dreadful lines. And Stephen Colbert should have been given his writing team to make the president amusing. He couldn't deliver the lines given to him. Not his fault, he isn't an actor in the traditional sense. He is more of a presence/personality - and his show is hilarious.<br/><br/>My kids left the theater and never brought up the film again. They said they like it but unlike other films, they didn't ask for merchandise, to see it again ... and they aren't picky. They even liked the Dragonball movie today.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time paying for it. Rent it. Better yet, wait for free redbox Mondays and pick it up then. Truly as a parent there are too many lines you don't want your child quoting in public or at school - they will get in trouble.<br/><br/>Dreamworks wasn't creative.

","If there is one movie this year that you would expect bar none to be  the most fun this year, then that movie would have to be Monsters Vs.  Aliens. Why? An irresistible premise, a massive ensemble comedic cast  and boasting three whole dimensions, the latest dreamworks animation  kid flick has everything going for it, and yet ultimately the whole  endeavor feels strangely stunted; the story seems stunted, the action  sequences seem stunted and many of the character arcs seem stunted.  Not that much of the above will matter to kids, nor to the adults who  go with them, nor did it matter much to me but there are simply so many  better films out there (*cough Pixar*) that the bar has been  permanently raised to such heights that even mammoth monsters or alien  technology cannot reach. Ultimatelty the success of the film lies with  the voice cast which includes Reese Witherspoon as Susan (later  forcefully renamed Ginormica) Seth Rogen as the blathering B.O.B.,  House's Hugh laurie as Dr. Coachroach, Will Arnett as The Missing Link,  Kiefer Sutherland as the steely General W.R. Monger, Rainn Wilson as  the evil alien Gallaxhar and finally Stephen Colbert as the dimwitted  President of the U.S.  While cute and likable Witherspoon doesn't have quite enough pizazz to  pull off voice work and the show is mostly stolen by Rogen, Arnett and  Laurie. There is scattered genius throughout Monsters vs Aliens, in the  satire of monster movies and alien invasion scenarios and simply with  some of the hilarious writing and impeccable delivery. Alas it  ultimately feels like the little brother of The Incredibles; lacking  the full punch, consistently snappy screenplay and pulse-pounding  action that will literally thrill young and old; here young an old will  only be amused. The plot is simple and the story progresses at a nice  pace, beginning with Susan being struck by a meteorite (that  coincidently is sought by Gallaxhar for devious purposes) that causes  her to grow to enormous size. Quarantined by the government she is  imprisoned with the other aforementioned misfits until general Monger  comes up with a proposal; prevent the alien invasion and earn their  freedom.  Unlike most animated films where a sequel almost always feels forced  and is always more disappointing then the first, I actually believe the  contrary here. Now that the set-up is complete and the lovable monster  team is assembled they can one-up themselves with a full-throttle  monster/alien brawl. The series has potential, that much is certain,  and the right balance of kid friendly and adult amusing antics are  present. All Dreamworks need to do is give the source material that  spark that made their other efforts like Shrek and Kung Fu Panda  irresistible and ultimately rewarding."

The studios really have to go the extra mile to ensure people will still be watching in theaters.<br/><br/>As for ""Monsters vs. Aliens,"" I frankly did not like the movie too much. The Monster characters who are supposed to be the good guys are not too memorable or cute. Even my 7-year old son found the character of Link and Insektosaurus to be ""corny"". The character of Susan/Ginormica is rather ""meh"", with a predictable character arc.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there were also positives. The main bad guy Alien Gallaxhar, a sinister squid with 4 eyes, was more interesting. The artwork of the alien spaceship interior were also more interesting. The character of the US President was the only thing that is really funny, especially the scene where he makes first contact with the Alien probe, and that stupid scene at the end of the credits.<br/><br/>But of course, the best thing about this movie is the 3D.

There are some really good characters but they just seem to be there. There are essentially two action set pieces and a couple other sequences that attempt humor but nothing comes (actually all of the jokes are in the trailers and commercials).Its a shame because in Ginormica and her fellow monsters they have a winning band of creations, that almost nothing is done. Sadly it seems that a great deal of effort was spent in creating a world with depth for the 3D. I saw this in 2D and was impressed at how good it looked. Actually too good since everything seemed to be designed for maximum effect at the expense of the story (and the human characters who looked plastic).<br/><br/>The only thing I really liked beyond the under used characters was the clever throw away bits and references to past scifi films I liked the references to Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, ET, Close Encounters,Kronos, Eath Vs The Flying Saucers, It Came From Beneath the Sea, Star Trek, etc.(though what is the Axel F theme doing in this movie?)

Now, the 3D is spectacular, so I give it props for that. But everything else about this movie is so... predictable. The screenwriters, tossed unoriginal material, clearly tried to make the most of it, but ending up flopping in the end, trying to include pop culture potshots, but not pulling it off as successfully as the Shrek movies. The voice direction, may I add, was also painful. If the directors were trying to squeeze any emotion out of Paul Rudd and Reese Witherspoon during their scenes together, or Hugh Laurie and Will Arnett trying to come up with a plan for their lives, they failed miserably. Seth Rogen seems to have to direct himself in the only decent voice performance in the movie. Yet, kids should eat this movie up, while adults should wince in pain at the horribly placed jokes and cringe at the cheesiness. The shallow plot tries to teach the lesson that it doesn't matter what your friends look like on the outside, it's what's on the inside that matters. Huh, that's a new one. While the producers and screenwriters try to keep kids entertained with ""funny"" jokes while they teach this lesson, the whole thing comes across as extremely cheesy.

","This film had the promise of being really funny with a great line up of talented actors such as Kiefer Sutherland, Seth Rogen, Reese Witherspoon and Hugh Laurie (all talented Actors) and produced by DreamWorks.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the laughs were quite tame and even for mid aged kids they weren't very funny, being more for 4-9 age group. Whether the cause was the script writers strike or the need to push out as many films as possible I was left quite disappointed. This is definitely a wait for DVD film unless you are taking young children to a safe film.

So all kids under the age of 8 will have nightmares. And I am not sure if the movie offers anything for the older age group. I certainly didn't enjoy it and I am very disappointed. I was hoping for something along the line of Monster Inc where the storyline is on some level cute and funny, even though it is about monsters.

","This comment is on the Imax 3D version.<br/><br/>I'm aware, when I watch movies, of what the scale of the narrative is that I am plugged into.<br/><br/>Often these days, its the short for narrative. Eddie Murphy puts on a fat suit and hilarity ensues. Yokels discover oil and come to Beverly Hills. Girl has problems with mom. All the action on the screen is episodic around this simple core.<br/><br/>Its what I call ""long form"" that interests me. You enter a world with cosmic machinery rich enough to match the one you live in. Things actually happen and change. There is overlap between the worlds themselves and this can matter in how you change and grow.<br/><br/>But there is a layer above this, one that threads through movies and often is the only real narrative I can get. In the lowest form, this is anchored on celebrity, so for instance we can follow the story of Mel Gibson from energetic Australian-style actor, through discovering his intellectual limits, making a successful Weil copy and devolving into a caricature.<br/><br/>More interesting is the journey of filmmakers, even film ideas. A variety along these lines is the metastory of animation studios. We have the ennobling story of Pixar with all sorts of interesting dimensions, and contrasted with that, the comparatively second rate Dreamworks Animation. <br/><br/>Its actually a pretty interesting story to follow, because it has tragedy, desperation, huge risks. It has some scheming — for instance with the ""Ants"" movie designed to cripple ""Bugs Life."" Its particularly interesting when they try to leapfrog Pixar.<br/><br/>They tried with ""Shreck"" and succeeded — at least so far as tickets — by engineering the humor and pathos because they just cannot seen to engineer story like Pixar can. Its an organizational thing I believe; committees cannot make real stories.<br/><br/>Here they try something else and the results are pretty shocking to this observer. I think something important has happened. For this, you have to understand Pixar's two competitive advantages. One is the story engineering already mentioned. A second more cinematically interesting is the exploitation of their three-dimensional modeling to give us a new way of cinematically dealing with space, specifically in the way the camera is placed and moves.<br/><br/>So what do Marshall-Kennedy do if they want to leapfrog Pixar? They surely cannot beat them on their own ground. Well, they try sex and three D and bury it. I am sure that what is going on here is all the usual stuff, that they had teams for story and gags and pacing and such. But the core experiment was in how to work with sex. <br/><br/>By this, I mean not the ""in your face"" stuff of beer ads, but the soft familiarity of a sexual presence in the room. I can even tell you something about the age of the guy in charge of this team, knowing the effect that the ""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"" had on boys. Even the gay Almodova was affected; see the giantess scene in ""Talk to Her,"" and its foreshadowing in the first scene in the bathtub.<br/><br/>What's going on here is that the third dimension allows a presence, a presentation of body that the flat screen simply cannot. Excepting the standard vocabulary of ""in your eye"" tricks, all the animation and modeling has gone into Susan's body. Not just her shape, which is expected, but subtle details of that shape. Particular attention is spent on how she moves, with a sensuous grace that is designed to be seductive. Yes, I know it is not obvious, but watch the beginning half again and note how surrounding women are presented, before we enter the action, second half.<br/><br/>Look at how many computing cycles went into the way her clothing moves on her body. The cloth does not move as her skin does, but over her skin, emphasizing the womanly movement of the dancer that was used for the motion capture. Study how this compares to sexually-designed Japanese animation projects. See how clearly different and more human Susan's movements are from those of the other characters, especially the humans — except for the women that surround her in the first half.<br/><br/>These things are highly, highly engineered. This studio is the most severe in this dimension. These releases are strategic probes into competitive progress on cinematic advantage. Its all about how to leverage the technology to capture eyeballs. Pixar cannot respond to this. Well played.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

"pinkarray","7","2","3","26 January 2017"," On the surface, it may appear clichéd but it's still very good
","Some people may not like Monsters vs. Aliens due to its references to B-movies, its corny jokes, and its simplistic characters. I was a little annoyed by B.O.B.'s idiocy and the other monsters are quite stereotypical but I wouldn't let that bring me down from enjoying the film.<br/><br/>I thought that the character of Susan was really pretty and wasn't some sassy brat like some women are. She was sympathetic even to the alien. Though, I did have problems with her design, her nose was small and her eyes were big bug eyes.<br/><br/>The team put in a lot of effort into the animation, making it turn out striking.<br/><br/>The person who voiced Susan did a pretty good job with her character. She put a lot of emotion into her voice. And I also liked the person who voiced the other characters, too. They did a pretty good job of making them humorous and trying to capture their personalities.<br/><br/>The dialogue on the other hand, is archetypal, though. Especially at the beginning. Once the story gets going, the movie gets way better and quite interesting.<br/><br/>The movie was too short, it stopped at a cliffhanger. I wished they could've made a sequel of the movie from there. Also, there was not enough character development to Susan and her adjustment of being with the new monsters. Her finally knowing she doesn't need Derek felt a bit forced. But it had a lot of heart and action and some soul but not enough.<br/><br/>While it's not as great as Shrek, it's still a good movie with high replay value and your kids will probably love it. The little ones might get bored but the older ones will love it. It was a very memorable experience to me and I think it would be a valuable film for the kids. It had a special place in my heart when I was a kid and words couldn't describe how much I loved the film. And Susan is still one of my favorite cartoon characters and I still really liked this movie."

"imdb1334","7","2","3","3 February 2011"," Pleasantly surprised
","After reading the synopsis of Monsters vs Aliens, a few friends and I decided to watch it, assuming it would be one of those ""it was so bad it was funny"" types of movies. Regarding the plot, we were not entirely wrong. However, the movie had good special effects (even though I did not have the chance to watch it in 3d), entertainment value, and a women's empowerment vibe, which certainly is a positive message to send to any young girls watching the film.<br/><br/>The main character is about to marry a career-obsessed TV weatherman when she encounters a radioactive material that causes her to grow to an enormous size. The man spurns her, and the movie pretty much evolves into a self-discovery process, at the end of which the protagonist recognizes her self-worth and abandons the egotistical fiancé. Along the way, the main character joins up with monsters to fight an evil-mastermind alien who is trying to retrieve the radioactive material. The creatures, though, are the typical cute and lovable characters to be expected from DreamWorks. One of which, Insectosaurus, was probably one of the funniest animated characters I have ever seen. I legitimately laughed every time it came on the screen. <br/><br/>While I walked away thinking the movie was fairly cheesy and predictable, I was also entertained the whole way through. If you are looking for intellectual stimulation or an in-depth plot, this is probably a good one to skip. However, if you are craving a simple feel-good movie, young kids will probably love it, and while it probably won't be your favorite movie, you may find yourself pleasantly surprised."

It was predictable and the humour could be funny at times but was rather hit or miss.<br/><br/>The villain of the movie, Gallaxar, was the part that truely took it away from being all bland or stupid comedic characters. His self-important take-over-the-world attitude was what made me giggle most times. B.O.B. was also kind of innocently stupid granted he had no brain.<br/><br/>It still looked good like most DreamWorks movies and it's a passable distraction for the kiddies, but lacks in many places."

The plot, albeit not exactly original - aliens wanna take over the earth - works out fine because the characters are funny and endearing. Susan/Ginormica is certainly one of the sweetest and most attractive female leading characters in the animated world. The whole movie is a delightful surprise.

","Anyone over 5 won't find this entertaining. It's just another animation following the template made by so many other films. If there is any one good thing to say about it is that it has some big stars in it that the more mature audience can relate to. But all in all it is another bore fest that has been spun out. Don't expect Shrek quality in this one. <br/><br/>Boring for the mature people, but probably be alright if you are younger and haven't seen or made the connection with other films.

","This movie is a good way to kill an hour and a half, if you have nothing better to watch. The cast is excellent, other than Reese Witherspoon as Susan.

I wanted to turn it off a few times just so I wouldn't have to hear her. But other than that, its a decent movie. OK. Have to write more. The other voices were great for their parts... here she goes again... I have it showing now. Its Reese grunting and trying to play the part. This is painful.

"Naylie","10","5","12","30 March 2009"," For what it's worth, this movie isn't half bad.
","First off, Lemmie tell you guys something important. If you have read my review on Kung Fu Panda, you'll know that it's a true fact Dreamworks have started working on animation for quite some time now since 11 years ago in 1998, that includes their first computer animated movie Shrek and then from where on there, they give us unforgettable moments and fun but very lovable characters to watch.<br/><br/>But, as the more we get into CGI and much less of traditionally hand drawn animation in the 21st century, our love for animated movies might of wear out; and then there's Monsters Vs. Aliens.<br/><br/>To start off, let's just say I thought Shark Tale and Bee Movie was better before I saw this, not that I'm complaining but it needs a little bit more work. The film starts off with a beautiful young woman named Susan Murphy play by the wonderful loving Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon, getting married to a weather reporter young man from the news named Derek Dietl play by Paul Rudd who you might recognize his work from I Love You Man, Role Models, and Knocked Up. He's not a very hard guy to spot if you're familiar with the voice in this movie.<br/><br/>Their wedding goes out fine before she gets hit by a meteor and grows into a 49 foot giant size monster named Ginormica (Funny name if you ask me). That's when she gets send by a little place called Area 51 from a General named W.R. Monger (voiced by 24 action star Kiefer Sutherland. His voice is really hard to realize when you're watching the film cause it's very rough around the edges when he speaks.) and meets three monsters.<br/><br/>B.O.B. (play by Seth Rogen, who course lend his voice before in Horton Hears A Who and Kung Fu Panda) a silly goofy little blob. A green swimming monster (can't remember what type he was suppose to be) called The Missing Link (whose voiced by Will Arnett who also was in Horton Hears a Who with Seth Rogen) and of course a human scientist with the size of a cockroach head named Dr. Cockroah Ph. D (voiced by Hugh Laurie who is quite known for his role of that crazy thriller horror show House) Their world suddenly becomes in huge danger when a four eyed alien from outer space plans to take over the world so it's up to Susan (aka Ginormica) and her new friends to save the day! For what it's worth, the movie isn't half bad, but you may want to think it over when you're watching a movie like this. I really personally thought it was gonna suck when I first saw the previews and trailers, but then the more I look at it, I began to realize it couldn't be half bad because Dreamworks has given us a bunch of laughable movies we can watch over and over. Besides Shrek and Kung Fu Panda, there's also Madagascar 1 and 2, Over the Hedge, The Prince of Egypt, The Road to El Dorado, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron and Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas.<br/><br/>I know there's a little bit more than that, but I don't wanna waste the rest of my review spamming a list of Dreamworks movies. So if you're really into Sci-Fi stuff, then this movie would be for you! If not, well...there's always something else better to watch. Would I ever recommended for people to watch this film? I might and I might not, but it's their choice. Not mine!"

Illogical, boring, and lacking that emotional spot that other animated movies have, this movie will have laughs for the kids and sighs for adults. As for the studio, quit while you're behind.

"peisenmann","3","3","6","16 March 2010"," Pretty awful
","My wife and I watched the movie on HBO at home tonight (not in 3D), and we were really disappointed. We both tend to enjoy animated films, but ""Aliens Vs. Monsters"" did nothing but let us down. The commercials played it up, and we actually wanted to see it, however the commercial was just about all the good there was.<br/><br/>First off, it was terribly written. The characters were entirely one-dimensional. There was hardly any growth by anyone except the main girl, and that growth couldn't have been more annoying. The plot was cliché and terribly predictable. <br/><br/>Now, I realize that it's a fantasy/sci-fi type movie, and there are going to be unrealistic elements, but you have to give the audience something to work with. I can suspend my disbelief for a goo monster that can talk, but I can't suspend my disbelief for atypical human behavior. The characters were not real at all, and not just in the sense that some of them were monsters. They didn't have real emotions, and everything felt like it was forced in there awkwardly just to advance the plot. Parts of it felt like they were literally just spliced together at the end.<br/><br/>Overall, it was one of the worst movies I've ever sat through, and I don't recommend it to anyone. It does not deserve the rating it has, and honestly I'm shocked that it ever reached a 6.<br/><br/>I give it a 3/10 because there were a couple amusing comments from B.O.B., and it still wasn't the absolute worst thing ever made.<br/><br/>Edit (Dec 29, 2011): I originally posted this comment in March 2010, and my feelings toward the movie have remained the same. Since then, my wife and I compare all bad movies to this movie, for example ""It was kinda rough there in the middle, but it was no Monsters Vs. Aliens"". This is still the worst film I've ever sat all the way through."

And I believe a movie like that should be magical on some level. This one is just plain boring. The characters are not inspirational at all. The plot is disturbingly stupid. I think that the 3D version might have been more interesting, but the 2D version falls, well, flat. And at the end of it, all you're left with is a weird movie you have mixed feelings about. Maybe the kids will understand it better than I have? Maybe. But from my point of view, this movie was a waste of my time."
"Otoboke","Null","4","10","3 April 2009"," A banal and flat affair.
","Every once in a while, a children's animated film will come out that is tailored towards children, and yet written from an adult frame of mind—like the best works of Roald Dahl, such works usually incorporate both the younger and older audiences into their respective appeal. More often than not however, the animation genre is one flooded with tired clichés, dry, disconnected vocal performances and mundane writing fit only for the minds of those unaccustomed to the more substantive forms of entertainment. It's the kind of writing that is not only targeted at children, but consistently feels like it was written by them; unsurprisingly, the little ones will get some kick out of it all, but for everyone else (and I include some of the more discerning of children in this exception), Monsters Vs. Aliens will instead only mildly distract with its pretty pictures and sporadically amusing farce.<br/><br/>What's most surprising about the extremely derivative writing present within the movie's script however, is that it comes directly from chaps involved with quite a few of the genre's most enjoyable and original outings. Yet constantly burdened with lame plotting, contrived moments of three-dimensional dazzle, and jokes that grow calluses on their proverbial faces after the first act, Monsters Vs. Aliens is a remarkably dumb, forgettable affair that is sure to induce more yawns than laughter. Of course, it's rather unfair to judge a children's movie purely on an adult perspective, and so I must concede that younger viewers will inevitably enjoy the experience quite a bit more than adult counterparts; but not by much.<br/><br/>You see, part of what makes a good animated film the nice breath of fresh air for adults, and the sweet piece of candy it is for children, is usually reliant upon one thing; the characters. It's disappointing then that Monsters Vs. Aliens lacks any definable, or memorable personas within its ensemble. Sure enough, there's B.O.B., the gelatinous blue blob who inherits Seth Rogen's signature dumb-ass laugh (which still isn't getting old, believe it or not), and even a surprising addition of Stephen Colbert as an obnoxious United States President (go figure), but even these two mildly amusing additions never truly come off the screen. Not only is it frustrating to be forced to artificially root for a protagonist we're never really given a chance to care about (that's Susan by the way, played by a bland Reese Witherspoon), but there is also a distinct lack of comic relief to the whole thing—in fact, the best parts to Monsters Vs. Aliens aside from Colbert's brief appearances, are all the cool space shots and action sequences.<br/><br/>This of course, brings us to the primary reason many people will be seeing the feature in the first place; the 3D. As a separate medium, or movement on its own, the three-dimensional movie has yet to truly take off, but with frequent glimpses into what the technology can do over the past few years (and with many in line for this year alone), there's no denying that those images at least do tend to take the breath away. Seen through comfortable glasses, Monsters Vs. Aliens can be a wonderful treat for the eyes. There's the beautiful exterior shots, and the close-quarters actions sequences which all flow terrifically and jump out at you in ways that aren't always contrived for the sake of milking the technology. Yet for the good that it does for the movie's aesthetic appeal however, the overall impression is that without such an artificial distraction, Monsters Vs. Aliens would be a banal and flat affair.<br/><br/>The problem is that despite the awe-inducing animation and sometimes amusing performances, the majority of the feature is actually devoid of any life. The story, which I have neglected to give a synopsis of, simply because I have deemed it largely unnecessary (okay, so aliens come to take over Earth, and monsters have to stop them), is so predictable and formulated that it will literally take a child who has seen no more than five movies to not see everything that's coming. Furthermore, there's also the complete lack of character, humour and heart that are key to delivering an enjoyable and memorable experience fit for both the children, and the adults who have accompanied them. Children will find B.O.B. funny, and they will laugh whenever his buddy Missing Link (Will Arnett) bangs his head on something, but that's about it—ask them who their favourite character was and they'll probably just say ""the blue guy"". Why? Because he's silly and brainless, much like the script in which he resides; and yet he is the highlight of the feature so what does that say? - A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)"

I'm not against product placement, movies need to be funded, but the way its presented in this movie is annoying and obvious. This scene doesn't even really have much to do with the rest of the movie. Its just a short scene with characters we never see again lazily introducing the plot. This whole scene could've been cut and it would've barely affected the movie.<br/><br/>There isn't that much to say about this movie.

"nickstaehling","4","2","4","15 January 2014"," My Thoughts
","I'd like to start by addressing any kids reading this review; get the Fuckk off ""The Boards"" you little assholes. In the past i have posted many reviews that would not be suitable or understood by the young ones and the last thing i need is to talk another 10 year old through masturbation on skype. One of the main reasons i did not like this movie is because of Regal Cinemas. For starters, i'm 100% sure there was multiple puddles of dried semen on my Real D glasses. When i asked ""Monica"" who was an employee at the time for another pair, she told me to stop busting her balls. Since i was at Regal of course to my right and left there were families from Somalia who heckled the vast majority of the movie in some third world language. The actual movie was the worst part of the entire experience. I sat through 94 minutes of sheer garbage and was bothered by an on again off again boner that returned in every major fight scene. Overall, the movie had an ongoing message that taught kids it's OK to be different, which is just not true. In actuality if you are different at all you deserve every bit of the cruel and creative sexual harassment techniques of today's youth. I would bet my left foot that there is a sequel on the way that will go straight to DVD and that it will be bought only by the Carvalho family. In closing, I'd like to say on my way out of the Theater a concession stand employee tried to sodomize me behind the arcade. Oh and since i have some extra characters i'd like to make an unrelated prediction. In the next 4-7 years Maya Kirkpatrick will gain 160 pounds."

True, the story is predictable and there isn't much character development. That said, the animation is beautiful, with well modelled characters and bold bright colours and backgrounds. Not to mention the battle on the Golden Gate bridge, which was stunning. The writing is also very funny and smart, the references to Close Encounters, ET and Men in Black are clever, the music is fun and the characters while not having much development are likable and charming. The voice acting is also solid and fit their characters well, Reese Witherspoon is a nice surprise and Hugh Laurie especially is fun. All in all, very good fun, not a classic, but enjoyable family entertainment. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"katherine_stears","3","2","4","29 June 2010"," I thought a movie with an Aqua song in the sound track couldn't fail...and I was wrong.
","Monsters vs. Aliens is a Dreamworks production, featuring a handful of celebrities whom I guess wanted to give voice acting a try, with a boring, overused plot idea, gimmicky characterization and gloriously unfunny jokes. Reese Witherspoon plays the main character, a girl named Susan who gets hit with a meteor and instead of dying from the impact, or radiation poisoning, grows really really big and gains super strength. You knowwhy is it that all these movie/comic/game characters are gaining super powers from radiation exposure? It's just not fair, and it's obviously not true. But I digress; with these new super powers Susan becomes a member of the Monster Union, loses the love of her life and then realizes she's better of without him, makes a bunch of freaky monster friends and saves the world. Among her friends are a sea monster, a bug, a bigger bug, and a blob who has no brain (or any organs for that matter) and is still somehow capable of sentience, which is an unfortunate thing for all of us because as a result of his lack of intelligence he is often the character the designers looked to for 'funny'.<br/><br/>I said the characters were gimmicky and I meant it; the blob was the go- to 'funny guy', the sea monster was a pseudo tough-guy who'd lost his macho but finds it under the couch cushions where he left it, the not- big bug is a mad scientist with a 'mad scientist laugh' that I am would really like to think Hugh Laurie thought was stupid but the producers beat and raped him into doing, and the bigger bug is like no species I've ever seen before but is big, stupid, attracted to bright light, dies and becomes a butterfly in the end. Because that's how it ALWAYS goes, isn't it? You know not ALL giants are capable of just roaring and stomping around; SUSAN was pretty big and she saves the world from the aliens with her awesome girl powers and...well, alright she's a bad example. But you see where I'm going with this, don't you?<br/><br/>Oh right! The aliens! We almost forgot about that part, didn't we? ""But it's up there in the title so I guess we should probably throw in some aliens at some point"", says the executive producer as he stabs the animation team with the cattle prod again. ""I've got it!"" Cries the coffee-bearing intern. ""Why don't we instead make ONE alien, a purple squid-like one, and then we'll just clone him a hundred thousand times and that'll be our alien race!"" <br/><br/>""Nonsense! That's cheating!"" Shouts the writers. ""If we're going to take the easy way out, we have to work it into the plot somehow! Let's have this alien guy clone himself as a means to populate the earth for a hostile takeover!""<br/><br/>""Brilliant!"" is the collective response. That's about the extent of the alien's contribution to the story. He's supposed to be the bad guy, and he wants the radioactive substance that makes Susan so big and he gets it, then decides that while he's there, he might as well take over the Earth, but Susan goes all 'girl power', gets the radiation back and saves the world with a little help from her friends. It's supposed to teach us that friendship and determination conquers all and everyone has a little bit of hero in them, even Reese Witherspoon. What it taught ME is that even Dreamworks can't win EVERY time.<br/><br/>But it's a kid movie, so I guess the big question is ""Will the CHILDREN like it, Katie?"" and my answer is yes; I happened to have three kids with me at the time and they all enjoyed it. But seriously, if you're going to take your kids to the theater to see this movie, they better not be charging you for it. Even Regal knew better than that. <br/><br/>This review was edited for length and content. To read the whole thing, and other reviews, check out my blog! http://moviessuck.tumblr.com/"

","Monsters vs Aliens is the exact opposite of Kung Fu Panda. It has no vision, it has no interesting characters, it doesn't look good, and the heroine is quite irritating. It's the kind of movie I wonder how it even got past the script stage. It all feels a bit... random, and not fleshed out at all.<br/><br/>Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is struck by a meteor on her wedding day to a cocky anchorman. Transformed into Ginormica, she is sealed off in Area 51 by the government, alongside four 'monsters' - a mad scientist turned cockroach, the missing link, a weird gigantic larva, not to mention the ""Blob"" himself - only his name is Bob. Their help is needed, however, when an alien emperor plans to invade earth.<br/><br/>The premise sounds promising but the execution is all off. Of all the 'monsters' they could think of, they go for those four? They have none of the depth or visual appeal of the characters in Kung Fu Panda. None of the characters appear to have gone through a character design stage at all; they all look quite crude and unimaginative. If this movie had a vision, I'm not seeing it. The plot is very thin and is almost solely held together by gags - which are admittedly quite hysterical at times. But jokes alone don't make a movie. Ever heard of the phrase 'too many cooks spoil the broth'? Well, look no further. What's the point of having many writers if all you're gonna end up with is a mismatched, albeit amusing, hollow shell of a movie? While I enjoyed Monsters vs Aliens a bit more than I thought I would (or should have), it left zero with me. As I watched this movie unfold in the cinema, I couldn't feel any sort of heart to it. It seems Dreamworks learned nothing from their previous film, Kung Fu Panda. What I love about that film is that it's deep and full of substance, and just plain beautiful. I just don't understand how Dreamworks could throw all that out the window. But even the dumbest script in the world can sometimes be saved by just being 'cool' - and this movie doesn't even have enough substance for that. Nothing about this movie attracts me to it. Dreamworks have completely degraded their standard with Monsters vs Aliens, and I hope it's only a temporary setback. I'd rather studios focusing on making movies with more substance than movies that come out of the screen."

","It's Susan Murphy's (Reese Witherspoon) wedding day to fiancé Derek (Paul Rudd) which is disrupted by her being struck by a meteorite!

From co-directors Rob Letterman (Shark Tale, Goosebumps) and Conrad Vernon (Shrek 2, Madagascar 3) it's naturally lovely looking animation as can be expected from Dreamworks and there's a lot of fun had in the sci-fi movie aesthetic that they go for. I think what makes the film tick is the dialogue and the star-studded talent that provide the voices; from Seth Rogen as B.O.B, Hugh Laurie as Dr Cockroach PhD, Will Arnett as Link, Kiefer Sutherland as the army general and more!

","Monsters v. Aliens. Round 1. FIGHT!<br/><br/>This wasn't quite Aliens v. Predators and that's OK. The aliens in this movie were a lot more delightful and these monsters--in lieu of Predators--were funnier, more loveable, and clearly on our side.<br/><br/>One monster had no business being labeled a monster, just a 50 foot woman. When Susan (Reese Witherspoon) was hit by a meteor on her wedding day in the rural city of Modesto, CA she found herself 50 feet tall with white hair. What she didn't know is that she was hit by a meteor of Quantonium, the most powerful substance in the universe. In any case, she was instantly branded a monster by the government and locked away. That is until Earth was invaded by an alien robot and required monsters to fight it.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this Dreamworks animation. It was funny and didn't drag with any slow violin moments. There was the brief sad/disheartening moment but they moved past it fairly fast. There were a few references to some older movies (Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Fly to be exact) which is always a treat for the adults in the room. It was just an overall good movie."

","This is such a lovely, family friendly movie! It is filled with light hearted humour and perfect for a young audience. Is strongly enjoyed this movie and found it a very easy turn your brain off type of film.<br/><br/>The plot line is quite simple. Asteroid hits earth and crashes onto the main character giving her super strength and increases her height by 50 feet. She is taken to secret facility similar to Area 51, where she meets her side kicks, Bob, the missing link, Insectasorours and Dr. Cockroach. An evil alien wants the substance that allowed Susan her superpowers so sends a gigantic robot to steal it from her. Susan and her sidekicks defeat the robot which allows Susan to have faith in her self as a monster. Later on during the film Susan realises that she does not need her selfish love interest, and grows as an independent monster. The film ends with the evil alien being defeated and earth is saved!<br/><br/>The animation in this is fabulous and the actors chosen for the voice of these characters are the perfect fit. I love the life lessons laced into the film about how women do not need men to be complete and that women are super mind strong and are capable of anything if they believe In themselves.<br/><br/>This isn't the best film Dreamworks has ever done but it was quite enjoyable, would recommend for a young audience!"

There were so many opportunities to be something very fun and creative, but they are just ideas that they had and they missed the mark by a lot with the execution.

","When it comes to big-screen animation, it's pretty widely accepted that Pixar frequently mines critical and commercial gold whilst their biggest rival, Dreamworks Animation, provides the fluff. Pixar certainly possess the largest awards cabinet, but Dreamworks know how to attract an audience, with the likes of Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda and How to Train Your Dragon all developing into successful franchises with memorable characters. With the market now aggressively over-saturated with animated efforts for the whole family, a few of their titles have flown under the radar, and sometimes unfairly. 2009's Monsters vs. Aliens is one such example: a fun, funny and heartfelt throwback to 50's B-movies that spawned some spin-off shorts, but wasn't successful enough to warrant a sequel.<br/><br/>In California, Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) is waiting to marry her vain TV weatherman fiance Derek (Paul Rudd), who has just announced the news of a job offer in another state. Before the wedding ceremony kicks off however, a huge asteroid crashes down on top of Susan. and although she appears unaffected at first, the mysterious energy given off by the rock causes her to grow to enormous size. With her head now peaking through the roof and the guests running for their lives, the military are quick on the scene, capturing Susan and taker her to a secret government facility ran by General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland), who has been hoarding a collection of strange monsters for decades.<br/><br/>There she meets fellow captives B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), a boneless blob of blue goo; Dr. Cockroach Ph.D. (Hugh Laurie), a genius half-man, half-insect; The Missing Link (Will Arnett), a hybrid of sea creature and ape, and Insectosaurus, a gargantuan mutated bug. Their futures look increasingly bleak, but when alien Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) arrives on Earth in search of the crashed meteorite, US President Hathaway (Stephen Colbert), gives Monger the go-ahead to put his freaky prisoners to the test and straight into battle with the intergalactic invader.<br/><br/>B-movie fans will spot the homages immediately, and there's enough of a modern twist to the rag-tag gang of 'monsters' to delight any children watching. The references are obvious: there's Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, The Blob, The Fly, Creature from the Black Lagoon and Mothra, but the characters are so lovingly crafted and terrifically voiced by a talented cast that they feel more love letter than straight rip-off. Although there are a few laugh-out-loud moments, Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon's film, working from a script by no less than five writers, fails to be consistently funny, and the arrival of Gallaxhar is a one-note plot device designed to bring everybody together. But there are some exciting set-pieces, particularly whenever the weirdly adorable Insectosaurus is involved, and there is enough heart woven into its fabric to make Monsters vs. Aliens one of Dreamworks' most underappreciated animations."

","7 June 2009. Whether or not 3-D would have significantly altered the ultimate visual enjoyment is difficult to speculate. The 2-D version was crisp and attractively compelling - an animated spectacular that lent a specialness of its own that even live action likely could not have provided any better visual interest. Unfortunately, this movie while having the intelligent humor, the action, and even the emotional drama somehow didn't jell (pun not intended). The chemistry just didn't seem to be there. Not all the various monsters seemed to impart their potential and some even seemed to been weak, if that could be possible.

","'Monsters vs. Aliens (2009)' doesn't actually do all that much in the way of satire, especially considering it barely touches the wealth of parody-esque possibilities its central conceit should theoretically provide. It does use its archetypal 'monster' characters rather well, though, and clearly has a love for the genre it attempts to ape, no matter how successfully it does so on the whole. This leads to a light, fluffy but fun affair that heads in a predictable direction but gets there mostly intact. The animation is the rubbery, slightly off-putting but equally inventive post-'Madagascar (2005)' stuff that came about when Dreamworks settled into its groove and pumped out more filler than it knew what to do with, though the actual movie it brings to life is on the middling to better end of that second-rate pile.

Filling the alien spaceships with lively performances from Seth Rogen and Hugh Laurie in a tantalising playground,the writers disappointingly stay away from picking up everything that the setting offer,due to the focus on Murphy leading to the other monsters and aliens feeling oddly normal,in a battle that is far from being the war of the worlds."

","What a great slogan to a rather unexpected project from Dreamworks animation studio. I have to admit that I was thrilled by the overall concept and while it's not the first time monsters battled aliens for control of the planet, this was a nice twist and a great tribute to classic 50s creature features.<br/><br/>Plot: Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) was about to be married to the dashing reporter Derek when she was stuck by a meteorite full of an unknown but powerful energy, causing her to grow to nearly fifty feet in height. Somehow deemed a monster by the government and renamed as Ginormica, the poor girl gets locked away in a secret facility with other monstrous misfits; macho fish-ape Missing Link (Will Arnett), mad scientist Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie), indestructible and gelatinous B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), and the 350 foot grub Insectosaurus. When the evil alien Gallaxhar (Riann Wilson) attacks the earth with giant robots and an army of clones, General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) convinces the president (Stephen Colbert) to let the monsters loose to defend the earth from this outer space menace in return for their freedom.<br/><br/>The cast was a lot of fun as they all fit very well with their roles like Hugh Laurie as the intelligent Dr. Cockroach (reminiscent of House) and Seth Rogen as the fun-loving but dim-witted B.O.B. Reese's character Susan a.k.a. Ginormica was a great heroine (as well as easy on the eyes) and was developed surprisingly well and and Will Arnett's Missing Link was also pretty cool, plus Insectosaurus is one of the coolest and cutest monsters I've ever seen. General Monger was awesome as he's afraid of no one and takes no nonsense. Finally, Gallaxhar was a good villain and actually has typical alien characteristics (big head, tentacles, etc). Riann Wilson did a good job bringing out his delightfully despicable nature.<br/><br/>The graphics look great right down to the finest detail, then again Dreamworks always brings out some good animation. The comedy made me laugh a good number of times as the jokes range from a little slapstick to references to classic sci-fi films. Heck, the monsters and aliens themselves are funny little parodies to those films like The Fly, The Blob, Mothra, The Day the Earth Stood Still, the list goes on. The action scenes, while not as grand as Kung Fu panda or Disney's The Incredibles, are pretty good, utilizing the abilities of each monster pretty well and bringing a sense of adventure to the movie.<br/><br/>There are a couple of bones to pick here. One is that it seemed that the film put more emphasis on comedy then action, which kinda disappointed me, after all this is called Monsters vs Aliens so you would think that there'd be tons of action like The Incredibles. On another note, I felt that some characters where heavily underused and not able to reach their full potential, particularly Insectosaurus and General Monger.<br/><br/>The complaints I have here are noticeable, but they don't stop me from enjoying this movie and they shouldn't bother you either. Overall, this was a fun tribute to classic science fiction and very entertaining. Definitely worth a watch, so check it out!"

But there was just something missing, something to make it stand out and go the extra mile.<br/><br/>The story told in ""Monsters vs Aliens"" is pretty easy to get yourself immersed into, and it is a fast paced story as well, lots of action and fun along the way.

There were so many really good actors and actresses here, and they really did a great job with their characters, and you really bought into it.

Earth decides to combat the Aliens with da-da-da-da-da-daaaaa Monsters! that they have accumulated over the past 50 years.<br/><br/>Included in the Monster's squad are Susan, now known as Ginormica and basically a white haired replica of Elastigirl/Mrs Incredible, a gelatinous blob named BOB, a fishy looking thing (apparently the missing link) called Link, a maniacal genius called Dr. Cockroach due to an experiment gone wrong and finally a giant bug called, you guessed it ""Insecto"".<br/><br/>There are really only two fights between Monster and Alien, a few jokes and a couple of pop culture references, though refreshingly less than normal, but not much more than that.<br/><br/>You'd think rather than being P.O.'d Susan would be happy to have an excuse to buy an entire new wardrobe! Sure she's 50 odd ft tall but men always notice tall women and there aren't many 4 ft 11 inch models running around?<br/><br/>The 9 minutes of credits should mean Dreamworks tried to make this a classic, and I wanted to like it, I really did. The fact is that I laughed three times in the entire 80 minutes (sans credits), all because of, or at the expense of BOB (without details, BOB is stupid and has no memory). 1/ How the others cheat at cards and Bob is none the wiser. 2/ Bob tries to crack onto a jelly plate. 3/ How he acts when he is unaware he is about to die.<br/><br/>Before you cry SPOILER!, it is a G rated movie, you know no-one dies.<br/><br/>Where they it all went wrong:<br/><br/>Not a big deal, but Susan is constantly disproportionate, without harping in one scene she knocks a power pole over with her shin, later on the power poles are head-high. Also Bob is at times around 2 ft tall, then later seems 6 ft in size in relation to Susan. The characters also seem to have no weight when they fall, land or even walk around.<br/><br/>The character designs seem half-arsed, (more on this later) and the designs seem more like prototypes than fully-fleshed creations.<br/><br/>Dreamworks did limit the pop culture references in this one, I hate PCR as they both date the film, and short sell the value of jokes by using the work of others to almost create ""enjoyment by acknowledgment"". (For the record: Dance-Dance Revolution, Axel-F, Roller-blading).<br/><br/>After the credits rolled my first thoughts were that I didn't really like any character, including BOB, who was the token likable character, I also thought that from a marketing perspective MVA would make crap toys if I wanted to buy a present for my son.<br/><br/>Boring characters + crap toys = Sequel suicide. Even ""Cars"", which wasn't that flash, is getting a sequel, because car-toys sell!<br/><br/>I think somewhere in this review I am expected to say that the animation is ""amazing"" and ""groundbreaking"", but it really isn't if you've seen anything since ""Toy Story 2″ or ""Monster's Inc"". The fact that it is in 3D is irrelevant and is more a marketing ploy in my view.<br/><br/>Final Ranking – 6.5 / 10.

","I usually really enjoy animated films and I remember when this one came out last year it had one or two good reviews. So I had some fairly high hopes when I popped the DVD into the player.<br/><br/>Outside the church on her wedding day, bride-to-be Susan Murphy gets struck by a meteorite. She looks dazed, but still makes it to the alter. While the ceremony is taking place she begins to grow and grow and grow until she is so big she takes the roof off the church. All of a sudden the military are there in numbers and they drug Susan and take her away to a secret government facility run by General W.R. Monger. Here she meets other monsters, B.O.B., who is a kind of blob, Dr. Cockroach Ph.D., a human/cockroach experiment that went wrong, The Missing Link, who was found in a glacier and the skyscraper-sized mutant larva Insectosaurus. She also gets told her monster name will be Ginormica. The monsters are soon called into action when an alien robot sent by Gallaxhar, a deranged alien overlord, lands on Earth. They defeat the robot only for Gallaxhar himself to come for the resource the robot failed to collect, a resource held by Susan. I think that's enough spoilers for one day.<br/><br/>Quite a well made film with some neat animation, but we would expect nothing less from DreamWorks. The plot was okay with some nice jokes thrown in for the adult viewers. Decent performances from all the main cast, so honourable mentions go to the voice talents of; Reese Witherspoon as Susan Murphy / Ginormica, Seth Rogen as B.O.B., Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach Ph.D., Will Arnett as The Missing Link, Kiefer Sutherland as General W.R. Monger and Rainn Wilson as Gallaxhar.<br/><br/>I guess I was slightly disappointed with this film, the script was OK but I just didn't really care for any of the characters that much. There seems to be something lacking. Don't get me wrong, the kids will love it, but I guess it's just one of those films that just didn't connect with me. Over all, for the younger viewer, recommended. For the adults, well maybe watch it once (under junior supervision).<br/><br/>My score: 5.8/10"

","Monsters vs. Aliens is a diverting 94 minutes, with lots of celebrity voice talent -- Reese Witherspoon, Hugh Laurie, Rainn Wilson, Kiefer Sutherland, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, etc. -- but ultimately it's no more involving than a three-minute Bullwinkle cartoon.<br/><br/>And, actually, only about half as funny.<br/><br/>This film is great for kids. Unfortunately, unlike Bullwinkle -- and Bugs Bunny, for that matter - - it doesn't really offer the double-edged adult commentary that makes some cartoons so memorably subversive. <br/><br/>I hear the 3D makes the experience more involving. Well, something better, because on the home screen, Monsters vs. Aliens is only a winner for the kids."
"dee.reid","7","0","0","25 March 2010"," Overall, this wasn't a bad film at all
","One of the great joys of watching ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is that it is a delightful throwback and a parody of virtually every sci-fi ""B""-movie made within the last 60 years. From ""The War of the Worlds"" (1953) to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977), to ""Independence Day"" (1996), to ""War of the Worlds"" (2005), to Godzilla, to both the original and remake versions of ""The Fly,"" ""The Blob"" and ""Attack of the 50 foot Woman,"" you can bet that if it's sci-fi and cheesy (cheesy sci-fi), it gets lampooned by the film-making team of Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon, working with DreamWorks Animation.<br/><br/>Nothing about the animation in this movie really stands out when compared to what we're seeing from Pixar or Hayao Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli (his animation is truly the best, in my opinion), but ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is pure fun from the start, beginning with a meteorite that crash-lands on Earth, or, more specifically, crash-lands on bride-to-be Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon). Witherspoon's Susan Murphy is really the most important character in the movie because she's the only one with significant motivation and feeling. Her cohorts do their normal supporting-role thing and manage to stand out on their own, but don't have the emotional depth that Susan Murphy does.<br/><br/>As she's walking down the aisle to her husband-to-be Derek (Paul Rudd), Susan starts to grow - and I mean really grow - into a 49-foot-tall giantess (while still somehow managing to remain fully clothed in her wedding dress), who the government later names ""Ginormica."" She is soon taken prisoner, watched over by General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland, ""W.R. Monger"" - ""War Monger,"" get it?) and introduced to characters who seem to have popped right out of '50s sci-fi movies - the Gill-man The Missing Link (Will Arnett), the blob B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), mad-scientist Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie), and the gigantic Insectosaurus. The octo-pod alien Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) has plans for world domination, but the government soon sees it has no choice but to unleash these Monsters on an unsuspecting human populace to fight some nasty Aliens.<br/><br/>""Monsters vs. Aliens"" will at the very least keep you entertained. Should it be seen by adults? Sure, why not. If they've seen enough sci-fi movies over the years, then they might get a kick out of all the movies that get skewered during the proceedings. Obviously, kids will love it, especially B.O.B., who I found to probably be the best Monster character, largely because of Seth Rogen's portrayal of the lovable, stretchable, if not completely brainless and virtually indestructible one-eyed mass of gelatin. (I even got a free B.O.B. plush-toy out of the deal at Best Buy.)<br/><br/>""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is a great way to kill 94 minutes of your life. I bought the movie on DVD (with the aforementioned free B.O.B. plush-toy) and I can say that it was well worth every penny.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Pretty much par for the course for Dreamworks' animated features. It ain't bad, necessarily, but it's little more than a diversion. I'd rank this one relatively low among their films, though. Actually, when it's doing action and sci-fi stuff, it's pretty fun. I especially loved the whole sequence where the giant alien robot chased the giant girl (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) through San Fransisco. The big problem with this movie is that it is almost never funny. It tries really hard - Seth Rogen in particular tries really hard as a semi-sentient blob of goo - but all the jokes land with a thud. I should say I kind of liked Stephen Colbert, as well, as the president. The animation is quite good, though nowhere near as good as anything Pixar has produced. The movie originally played in 3D in most theaters, and it opens with the most clichéd 3D image imaginable: a ball and paddle game. I think it might have been a joke, but it's a good example of how flat all the jokes fall here."

","Well, let's see what we have here. Another one of them 3-d movies that are becoming very common nowadays. It's pretty predictable, and on the most part is family friendly and quite light hearted. That being said, the humorous parts of the movie reign supreme. Some of it is just random humour typically found in these type of movies. Some of it contains references to sci-fi films and such.<br/><br/>The lead character, Susan, is not really interesting. However, the side characters, particularly B.O.B and the president, are hilarious. Unfortunately most of the screen time is obviously given to Susan which is a downside. Even though the overall plot is pretty predictable and maybe even a bit generic, things are generally kept interesting. The animation and effects are good, but not great by 2009's standards.<br/><br/>The problem with this is that I found the high points of the movie it's funny parts, but they weren't enough to make this a great movie. Susan's love/drama life was given too much attention. Plus, the plot felt a bit rushed.<br/><br/>If you're an animation fan like me, go ahead and watch it. It definitely has it's moments. However, it could've achieved an unforgettable status with just a bit more work. I think it deserves a 6.5 but since IMDb doesn't have that option, I'll give it a generous 7."

","When a radioactive meteor hurtles into Susan Murphy on her wedding day, she is transformed into a towering, platinum-haired giant. Taken away by the government, Susan is introduced to other scientific oddities, including the amphibious Missing Link , the dim blob B.O.B., and the brilliant, bug-headed Dr. Cockroach. These ""monsters"" are released from captivity when a massive alien robot sent by the scheming Gallaxhar appears in San Francisco. With little time to adjust to her new stature, Susan must learn to work with her strange allies to avoid an all-out extraterrestrial invasion.<br/><br/>MVA is what I would call a ""safe"" movie. It's fluffy and nice, but it doesn't push boundaries. It sticks to entertaining the audience for 90 or so minutes and it does the job well. Compared to Pixar's most recent movie, UP, it's pretty much crap, but I won't do that because most animated movies can't reach Pixar's greatness.<br/><br/>MVA starts off pretty quickly and the movie runs in a fast pace. I'll admit it, some of the jokes are plain dumb and unfunny. There's one scene where the president of the US plays a well-known tune when first meeting an alien spaceship. It was cringe-worthy to say the least. However, the movie also has a lot of funny moments, most coming from Seth Rogen's character, B.O.B. He's my favorite character in the movie. The other actors were decent, but nothing to shout about.<br/><br/>The movie also has plenty of great spectacles and some truly vibrant action sequences. I did not see this movie in 3D, but this is one of the few rare movies where watching it in 3D could possibly make it a BETTER movie. As I watched through the movie, I envied the fact that I was watching it in 2D, seeing some obvious shots for the 3D technology when it was in theaters a few months back. But overall, it's a fast-paced, forgettable, harmless movie for the family to enjoy."

","Gimmick wins. That's what sold the movie.<br/><br/>While better than ""Bee Movie"", I think it loses out to ""Bolt"" on my measuring stick of animated films this decade.<br/><br/>The plot was flimsy and rather nonsensical, even for animation. The characters were hard to get into, especially the monsters. Obviously we got lots of backstory and emphasis on Susan, since she's the focal point of the story. However, the rest of the monsters were just thrown at us with a quick ""Oh, we have to let the audience know how they became monsters"" attitude and as a result, I felt no connection or desire to care about the rest of them. The lead villain was kinda fun, and Stephen Colbert's President had a moment here and there. As a whole, though, I think this movie was all about the 3-D and pretty much nothing more as a selling point. To Dreamworks' credit, that strategy worked."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","0","0","31 October 2009"," The Difference Between Monsters And Aliens
","While I have enjoyed most of Dreamworks's animation films, only very few have reached the level of 'Pixar' in terms of overall quality. Some names that I can think of are 'Kung Fu Panda', 'Bolt' and 'Monsters vs Aliens'. 'Monsters vs Aliens' is a wonderful tribute to the 50s B-movies but if one is expecting a story on similar lines (like what the Rodriguez - Tarantino Grindhouse movies have done) then one might be disappointed and I think many have felt that way. But, this movie deserves a chance and ought to be watched as a stand alone that has some references to those old movies. 'Monsters vs Aliens' has heart. There is not one moment which I can think of that bored me. The dialogues are hilarious and the characters are very funny and likable. The CGI animation is terrific (Dreamworks seems to get better in this department). The star studded voice cast of talented actors who are gifted with comedy (Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett, Kiefer Sutherland, Rainn Wilson, Stephen Colbert, Paul Rudd, Julie White, Jeffrey Tambor, Amy Poehler, Ed Helms, Renée Zellweger, John Krasinski and Sean Bishop) is excellent. For me, 'Monsters vs Aliens' has been full-throttle entertainment from start to finish."

","""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is an oddball family film that is as charming and likable as it is inventive and whacky. Sporting a top-notch voice cast and electric animation, it tells an interesting story in an equally interesting way. Certainly, its story is rather basic at its foundation (it is, after all, in its simplest form, a story of good vs. evil), but the unique twists on that foundation are what really put it ahead of its competition. In an ironic twist on classic monster films and alien invasion films, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" pits a group of five monsters against aliens looking to invade the earth. When the American military proves to be useless and the President (voiced by Stephen Colbert) cannot begin peaceful negotiations, these monsters are our last hope against total annihilation. Had this been an adult-themed film, it would have probably dealt with the monsters' reluctance to protect the same people that have imprisoned them for years. As it is, it is more concerned with how cool it would be to be an indestructible blue blob. That is not a bad thing.<br/><br/>Read My Full Review Exclusively At: www.thecinemaview.blogspot.com"
"imdb-21622","7","0","0","30 September 2009"," I liked it
","I looked forward a lot to seeing this movie. No one wanted to see it with me at the theater, so 3D was not an option. I am not sad about that, because I have seen 3D before. While cool, I don't think it's make or break.<br/><br/>What I liked about the movie. I saw it in Blu-ray. So the animation quality was impressive. It's not like it was a few years back when every CGI movie was improving noticeably. But every movie gets a bit better.<br/><br/>There is tons of impressive detail in the animation. The Golden Gate bridge scene was very cool with interesting perspectives.<br/><br/>The plot was pretty standard. I had envisioned it being just a bit different. But it worked. The evil alien reminded me a bit of Marvin the Martian. It would not surprise me if he had been a little bit of an inspiration.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see a bit more teamwork from the Monsters. There was some, but I would have liked more.<br/><br/>The role of the gigantic woman was OK. None of the monsters really stood out to me. But as a whole they worked OK. I have to admit my favorite was probably insectasaurus and he did not talk. Can't say why I liked him. He was just cool to me.<br/><br/>The president was a trip. I especially loved the scene where he played the Yamaha DX-7. I have always loved that synthesizer. Nice touch - I hear Yamaha helped to make it look authentic, and it did (except for the display which was pretty modern looking compared to what I remember from the DX-7.) Anyway, the president had some pretty funny moments.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the movie. Could it have been better? Maybe. But I think they implemented the basic premise pretty well. Monsters take on an alien invasion. The key was that I enjoyed it more than most movies I have seen lately. So 7/10 for some cool animation, a few laughs, and an overall fun time."

","As the user/reviewer ""Dick Steel"" wrote here too, technically this movie seems perfect. The voice cast is great, the animation looks great and I'm sure the 3-D version looks awesome too (I could only watch the 2-D version).<br/><br/>Unfortunately all the (best) jokes get revealed in the trailer and B.O.B. has nothing (much) more to say in the movie itself. He almost becomes annoying. The story is too thin, most jokes aren't working (or are revealed in the trailer as mentioned above) and you get the feeling that this was rushed into production. There must have been so many other things/directions the movie could've have gone, but unfortunately we will never know ... well maybe we will, because I'm sure despite the fact, that the movie wasn't successful, commercially and critically, there might be a sequel ... I can only hope they get it right then!"

","Out of a scale of 1-10...<br/><br/>Animation: 9. The CGI by DreamWorks is very well done. Graphics of the military fighting the alien robot that landed on Earth and the interior of the alien spaceship were some of the highlights. DreamWorks did a great job raising its level of CGI animation ever since Shrek.<br/><br/>Characters: 6. Susan's character development throughout the whole movie proved to be sensible and easy to follow and understand. Susan goes through stages of self-realization as she starts to find out her role and what she must let go in order to move on to greater purposes. However, the other characters did not really help in the plot other than Dr. Cockroach, who does have some purpose in his role as a mastermind and Susan's mentor. There was not much difference between the characters of B.O.B. and the Missing Link. They were cool ideas for two different characters thrown into the movie, but the script writers did not care to add unique personalities to each of them. Susan's fiancé was very one dimensional and predictable, and his one-way downward relationship with Susan was expected.<br/><br/>Plot: 7. The movie story really helped to follow the adventures of Susan and how she starts to find her identity as a monster. There were parts of the plot in the beginning and the ending which really hurt the flow. In the beginning, the president attempting to communicate to the alien robot really only served as a reference to overly heard pieces of pop culture and no other useful purpose. The end when Susan finally broke off her relationship with her fiancé was very abrupt and feels like a speed bump to the plot.<br/><br/>Theme: 4. The idea of all the monsters as a family really did not go smoothly. It failed to capture the essence of it. Although it is recognizable how they teamed up to fight evil, it was all that served as the foundation for the idea of family. There was a lack of depth and development happening in the relationships among the monsters. The idea of a monster family thrown in your face instead of being explained thoroughly.<br/><br/>Overall score: 6"

","This has been the first 3-D movie I have seen in the last 15 years. Despite the cost being 11 dollars, I thoroughly enjoyed the film, specifically when everything seems to be coming at you, but what made this animated movie a success is not necessarily the 3-D animation nor the plot (which isn't that great), but the cast, particularly on Seth Rogen's part as B.O.B., the mindless blue matter who has the attention span of a goldfish. Hugh Laurie is excellent as Dr. Cockroach. I'm so used to seeing him in ""House"" that I thought he could not pull off any other role, but he does in this. In fact, he changes his voice which is so different from ""House"", that he is almost like a totally different person. <br/><br/>Rainn Wilson as Gallaxar also delivers his line brilliantly, as a power crazy alien whose intent is to take over the world. Reese Witherspoon, Keifer Sutherland, Will Arnet, and Stephen Colbert deliver great voice acting to their characters as well. In addition to a brilliant cast, the film contains plenty of satire and parody against the government that most of the time I felt like I was going to fall out of my chair laughing. Overall, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is a great film that is not aimed at a specific audience like many of the other animated films out there are, but to the general public. There is some irreverent humor, but it isn't over the top. When it comes out on DVD, you better check it out. My rating: *** out of ****"

","After conquering fairy tales with such classics as the ""Shrek"" franchise, DreamWorks tried doing so again but fell a bit short in the Sci-Fi genre!! Despite ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" having all the makings of being a potential huge hit like it's recent predecessor ""Kung Fu Panda""; it simply fell short to me on the laughs. The main thing which attracted me to this movie was the fact that it pays tribute to such Sci-Fi classics as ""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, The Blob, Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Fly, Mothra"" and every alien invading movie ever made.<br/><br/>""Monsters vs. Aliens"" mainly revolves around (Susan Murphy) a young lady on her wedding day voiced by Reese Witherspoon who has several events occur which lead to her dreams of a wedding to be dashed. Now seen as a threat and possible weapon, (General W.R. Monger) of the U.S. Military voiced by the veteran actor Kiefer Sutherland both capture and recruit her to a secret agency consisting of monsters. Here she meets (B.O.B) the friendly blob voiced by the multi-talented Seth Rogen; the brilliantly mad (Dr. Cockroach) voiced by Hugh Laurie (of House M.D. fame); the overly confident lizard-man (Missing Link) voiced by the usually funny Will Arnett and the gentle giant grub (Insectosaurus) voiced by voice over veteran Conrad Vernon. Meanwhile an invasion on Earth is about to commence led by (Gallaxhar) an alien overlord with a Godlike complex voiced by the still somewhat newcomer Rainn Wilson (you'd know him better on the comedy hit ""The Office"" as Dwight Schrute). Needless to say all hell breaks loose forcing the U.S. Government to rely on their Monsters to even up the playing field causing for much more mayhem to proceed. Who will win and how?? I wont spoil it you'll just have to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>In conclusion despite some of the talent/star-power ""Monster vs. Aliens"" packed; it simply came up awfully short. Though most animated movies are aimed at young kids; I found ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" to have something for all ages, cute and endearing but simply wasn't huge on laughs as I had hoped. I'd say, catch it as a matinée or simply wait to rent it. I hope this post was of some help and use. Enjoy."

","I must admit I was a bit sceptically about seeing this film, especially in the wake of such box-office disappointments as Igor. To be honest though, Monsters vs Aliens was never going to be an Igor, its completely different, especially with the addition of Reese Witherspoon, Hugh Laurie and Seth Rogan but to name a few. It didn't take me long to see that maybe my pre-judgements were indeed premature and that maybe this film is actually quite funny. Fine, the plot isn't the most interesting, or original for that matter, but it's a kids film and it does what it should do to keep the target audience happy. The film is actually extremely funny in place, not just because of the writing but because of the characters, in particular B.O.B., the President and ""The Missing Link"". Most of the characters are absolutely lovable and unlike anything I've ever seen in an animation before. The President is one of the funniest things in the film, the typical ""solve everything with violence"" kind of leader, bumbling around thinking he's invincible. One of the funniest sequences in the film has to be the first scene that is set in the underground bunker involving the President and the General (voiced brilliantly by Kiefer Sutherland) done in the style of Dr. Strangelove, a hilarious scene which is well written and well acted (the voices that is). The only bad thing I picked up on was that for me Reese Witherspoon's voice did get annoying after a while, I do think she is a brilliant actress but for some reason I did find her a little over the top in this. On the other hand Hugh Laurie and Seth Rogan were hugely enjoyable and very funny. The plot was a little too easy to follow and even predict, but this wouldn't be a problem for most kids. Hugely enjoyable film, and very funny, which is a massive breath of fresh air as I don't think I've been this impressed by an animation since WALL-E, and by a Dreamworks animation since Shrek 2. Fine, its no Toy Story, but then again, nothing is."
"sprintz1132","7","0","0","18 April 2009"," Not spectacular but still fun
","First of all, let me start off by saying that I had never sat through an entire movie in 3D before, and it was kind of fun. Of course, I was swatting at things for the first ten minutes, but after I got used to it, it was an enjoyable experience. DreamWorks made a dynamite decision by choosing to release their latest installment in 3D, because although there were some decent laughs, the movie mostly relied on visual effects to keep the viewer interested. <br/><br/>Monsters begins with the protagonist, Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon), on the day of her wedding to her pompous, weatherman fiancé Derek (Paul Rudd). Right before the ceremony, a freak accident involving a massive falling object (evidently carrying a substance called ""quantonium"") pummels Susan into the ground. The quantonium has a bizarre effect on Susan, making her grow 50 feet tall and inexplicably turning her hair white. Understandably frightened to death by the giant woman, the government tranquilizes her and she awakens to find herself in a secure bunker. There, she meets an array of other creatures, appropriately called monsters, and befriends them. First, there's B.O.B, a blue, goop-like substance (Seth Rogen), whose handicap of not having a brain actually makes him more adorable than anything else. Then there's Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie), a brainy yet mad scientist whose own crazy experiments led to his transformation into bug form. Will Arnett voices a half-fish/half-lizard hybrid named Link that has a curious obsession with weight lifting. Then, topping it all off, there's Insectasaurus, a massive caterpillar-like creature who, sadly, cannot talk. <br/><br/>When an alien probe lands on Earth, the President (the incomparable Stephen Colbert) and his advisors decide to release the monsters in order to take on whatever has just invaded American soil. The creature aboard the probe, a slimy, tentacled Martian named Gallaxar (voiced by Rainn Wilson, who's so clearly having a blast), has come to Earth to obtain the quantonium in order to create a clone army of himself to take over the universe. In exchange for defeating the outer-space invader, the monsters will get their freedom. <br/><br/>Although it had its fair share of laughs, one of the problems I had with Monsters was that the humor was very topical, but about a year too late. Colbert's President was humorous and well intended, but his general incompetence thwarted him at every turn. Mostly, his advisors just used any opportunity to manipulate him. Does that sound like anyone you know? Maybe a certain president that just left office? What I'm saying is, topical humor is fine, but when it's not relevant anymore, it just becomes stale. Another issue I had was that (and I've noticed this in a couple other DreamWorks movies) the reliance on big name stars to do voice work makes the filmmakers a bit more lax on character development. Admittedly, a primary reason I even wanted to see this movie was that I'm a fan of Seth Rogen and Stephen Colbert, so I wanted to hear them. Most of the voices used in this movie are recognizable because of how popular the actor is, not because there's anything particularly distinctive about them. I remember hearing a joke at the Oscars this year in which Jack Black quipped that he'll do a DreamWorks film (he recently voiced the title character in Kung Fu Panda) only to see the prize go to Pixar come awards season. Well, Mr. Black, DreamWorks movies are usually just as impeccably animated as Pixar but all the big name actors in the world won't captivate audiences if there's no creativity. In the last few years, DreamWorks has come out with, among others, Shrek (1, 2, and 3), Horton Hears a Who!, Bolt, and Kung Fu Panda. The first Shrek is a bad example because that wound up being one of the most original and funny animated movies I've ever seen, but when you compare the latter three with Pixar's most recent installments of Cars, Ratatouille, and WALL-E, there aren't nearly as many big names in the credits, but they also have three things DreamWorks doesn't have—Academy Awards. I think the creative team at DreamWorks needs to kick it up a notch if they're going to have a shot at their first Best Animated Feature Film award since Shrek. That means no more sequels (I'm looking at you Madagascar 2 and Shrek the Third). Also, try and hire some less popular but more talented voice actors. Rogen and Colbert can stay, though, because they make me laugh. To wrap up, Monsters vs. Aliens was captivating in 3D, but lacked finesse in the storytelling. The monsters (Dr. Cockroach, B.O.B, and Link) provided for most of the humor, but it wasn't quite enough to make it stick out in my mind as a truly hilarious movie. As I was leaving the theater with a friend of mine, she pretty much summed it up for me. ""That was cute,"" she said. ""I'm glad I saw that."" Need I say more? <br/><br/>My grade: B-"
"walsh-22","8","0","0","12 April 2009"," Didn't bowl me over but was still entertaining
","I wasn't bowled over by the film but neither was I bored for the 94 minutes it was on. The time passed so quickly that I didn't feel the usual customary discomfit sitting in the cinema chairs that I usually get.<br/><br/>The story was interesting and as other people have commented, harped back to the 50's Sci-fi films about monsters on the loose, terrorising the people on screen and in the audience. I thought it was really refreshing to have the monsters trying to safe the earth instead of destroying it, putting a different spin on it as in the past monsters are always seen as the bad guys.<br/><br/>The film was very funny and I liked all the nods to other Science Fiction films like Close Encounters, The Blob, E.T and The Fly. The cast are brilliant and clearly are the right choices for the characters they play, Reese Witherspoon as Susan, Hugh Laurie as Doctor Cockroach, Will Arnett as the Missing Link but in particular the two that gripped my attention the most was Kiefer Sutherland as General Monger and Seth Rogen as the not-so-bright B.O.B.<br/><br/>Is it worth going to see it at the Cinema or when it comes out on DVD?, yes it is because it was never boring and through the cast, script and visual effects kept me watching till the very end."

","I went to see this today with my son and a friend. I'll be short and to the point. It was lame. Worse than the average kids cartoon. -The plot was mediocre. -The characters were 2-dimensional stereotypes. No character development. None. -The jokes were not even funny. -The animation (3D) was out of perspective in places. I've liked a number of the movies in this genre. Not this one. No idea how it rates a 7 on average. Go watch Pixar or Studio Ghibli if you want good. The rest of this review is just me getting 10 lines of text in the box so that the website will accept the review.

"Jay_Exiomo","6","3","9","27 March 2009"," Falls flat if not for the 3D presentation
","Short on a compelling narrative and real characters, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is nonetheless an adequately entertaining endeavor for Dreamworks Animation greatly enhanced by its three-dimensional presentation in selected theaters. Which is to say seeing its resplendent visuals in 3D (particularly in IMAX) will at least partially offset the flatness of the hyper-zippy story littered with pop-culture jokes and action sequences that, though fun while they last, comes across like a bucket of popcorn that doesn't leave an impression after it's over.<br/><br/>Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is about to marry Derek (Paul Rudd), a self-absorbed weatherman whose dreams of getting an anchor job comes at the cost of having to shatter her dreams of having a honeymoon in Paris. On the day of their wedding, an alien substance-filled meteorite slams on her that renders her the size of a small building, prompting a secret government agency to rename her as ""Ginormica"" and imprison her in a clandestine location along with other cryptozoological beings such as the Missing Link (Will Arnett), an anthrophomorphic cockroach (Hugh Laurie) and a dunderheaded yet well-meaninged gelatinous blob (Seth Rogen). But shortly, a nefarious tentacled alien (Rainn Wilson) arrives on Earth and the US government decides that the fate of the earth now lies in the hands of the monsters they have tried to hide from the general populace for the last 50 years.<br/><br/>Obviously a throwback to the sci-fi horror movies from the '50s, directors Conrad Vernon and Rob Letterman affectionately lend a frolicsome cheekiness to the whole proceedings with arresting visuals and some humorous one-liners pumped up by the occasional rock-and-roll (and even an 80s funk) soundtrack. But inasmuch as the film is a visual stunner, it's unfortunately diluted by an overly familiar story and a moral that sounds less a genuine didactic than a target demography-pandering afterthought, compressing it into an altogether unmemorable affair that dissipates as soon as the novelty of 3D wears off."
"Quinoa1984","6","2","5","12 April 2009"," kids will find it to be like chocolate cotton candy in a silver platter. everyone else, it's a coin toss
","As a critic, or perhaps would-be one most days, when facing a movie like Monsters vs Aliens it's about context: I can recommend this movie about as highly as possible to anyone under the age of 12, because frankly, the producers and writers tried their hardest (and maybe succeeded) to create this movie in a lab so that it would reach that audience to the maximum. It's got bright and colorful monsters with singular personalities that keep kids entertained, including Insectosaurus who looks like a cross between Totoro and Godzilla and never utters a word, and some of those goofy gags and occasional physical bits of business that, from what I could hear seeing the movie with a nicely sized crowd, did the job well.<br/><br/>As for everyone else- teens, young adults, kids' parents, the elderly, miscellaneous or other people I've forgotten to mention- it'll be hit or miss. This will depend on how many of these animated movies or sci-fi movie that the movie alludes to or just flagrantly rips off that tickle the funny bone. Sometimes, for me at least, they tried a little too hard. There's one joke in particular that is a perfect example, where the President (voiced by Stephen T. Colbert, who should be the best thing about the movie but isn't, a minor but significant disappointment) goes up to a keyboard to communicate with the aliens. This was funny if just for a moment because of the recognition of Close Encounters. It was a quick little gag that worked. But as though the filmmakers thought no one under the age of 20 would get it, they extended it, having the President go into playing a ""funky"" version of the Beverly Hills Cop theme by Herbie Hancock. It doesn't matter that kids probably wouldn't know it either. It just goes on too long and is too knowing of its goofiness to actually be funny after a while.<br/><br/>Again, this is for those who may actually get the references. For kids, this is silliness on an epic scale that will keep their jaws drooling with the laughs. At the least there's a very good voice cast assembled- aside from fairly straightforward leads like Reese Witherspoon there's Seth Rogen and Hugh Laurie as monsters and Rainn Wilson as the evil alien set to make clones of him/itself to take over Earth- and it does have wonderful animation. Following soon after Dreamworks' success last year with Kung fu Panda they kick it up another notch in terms of the quality of its style, its detail (even a burger, yes a burger, shown early in the picture is fairly incredible), and in how it whips along from one cool sight to another. If eye candy is your thing, this is the thing for the, uh, month I guess (I actually bucked the trend and saw it in 2D, and it didn't seem to lose much of its ""umph"" in the regular format).<br/><br/>Everything works on that surface level, but then when it comes to the characters and plot, whatever there is of it, it falls into some predictable things, or just ideas and motions that seem too familiar even as goofy homage. As comedy it doesn't come anywhere near Dreamworks' first big hits with Antz and Shrek, and as all-around entertainment it's a split decision. Parents wont be bored entirely, but they'll be the ones tugging their kids arms to see Pixar's Up! following the trailer more than the other way around."

""Monsters vs. Aliens"" obviously pays homage to monster movies, alien movies & disaster movies (the San Fransico bridge sequence was fantastic to watch) but I just feel that it had the potential to be something as excellent as ""The Incredibles"" but was stymied by Dreamworks' unwavering dependency on ""saturday morning cartoon"" dialog, formula, & delivery.<br/><br/>Though I praised them earlier the interactions between the mad roach scientist, the blob & the sea monster do not seem fresh; like they were ripped straight out of a standard Saturday morning cartoon & I've seen them before....These 3 characters have an inspired backstories that are briefly explained in the movie, so I was expecting them to be a little more engaging.<br/><br/>Now before you die-hard ""Dreamworks"" fans out there say this user comment isn't useful & submitted by a biased Pixar fangirl, I actually enjoy many Dreamworks movies; even the ones that are usually bashed like ""Bee Movie"".<br/><br/>Although I laughed harder @ Bee Movie than I did ""Monsters vs. Aliens"", the latter movie is superior as a MOVIE but like the former Dreamworks flick, I think there was a lot of untapped potential.<br/><br/>The visuals were excellent (the most beautifully animated Dreamworks film yet) but it wasn't as funny as it could've been even though there were many jokes & one-liners.<br/><br/>However, I'm not a child nor do I have a family of my own, so maybe I'm being a tad bit harsh.<br/><br/>Children (and most parents) will Definitely enjoy this movie, so I do recommend it."

"jdonalds-5","9","2","5","29 March 2009"," great animation, fun story, lots of laughs, 3D added a little
","The best part was the story was funny and entertaining. I laughed quite a lot, some out of the script, and some out of the absurdity of the characters. What blew me away was the increased animation quality. I saw it in the fire, water, hair and clothing. It just keeps getting better each new production.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I wanted to see this movie was it is the first of a blast of 3D movies coming out this year. Hollywood seems to think this is the next best thing to draw audiences and I wanted to see for myself.<br/><br/>Certainly the technology has improved and the quality of the 3D was the best I've seen. There were a few moments where the 3D effects were pushed to the limit for effect, and many others where it simply fit well into the movie. Overall though I thought it added little to the movie, perhaps a 5% improvement. On the other hand we had to wear the glasses through the whole movie. In the end, even with my interest in the technology, I didn't think it added enough to the movie to be worth the effort and, I would guess, added expense. Let me say it this way, 3D won't be enough to attract me to a movie soon, and I certainly wouldn't pay extra to see it. I'll keep an open mind though and will check on future movies to see if I think there is value in this wave."
"Red_Flag","7","2","5","28 March 2009"," See it in 3D!
","Ifhere's one thing that's undeniable when it comes to DreamWorks Animation it's that its increasing in quality with every movie it makes, sure last month's Madagascar 2 wasn't quite up to snuff, but compare it to the original it may as well be Shakespeare. Kung Fu Panda couldn't hold a candle to last year's Wall-e but if you remember that this is the same studio that gave up Sharks Tale, the Panda doesn't look too shabby. So by making a film that riffs of everything I every loved about the 50's surely Monsters Vs Aliens should top them all, not quite. There are two ways to see monsters Vs Aliens, in 2D and in 3D. Which are so crucial they may as well be night and day. See it in 2D and it's a fun, forgettable animated movie that, while head and shoulders above Sharks Tale or Shrek the Third, its far from Pixar perfect. If you're lucky enough to see it in 3D, it might be one of the most entertaining experiences you'll have in the cinema all year. Calling the 3D visuals astounding is a huge understatement. Last month's Bolt looks petty in comparison, its stunning to watch and you'll get your money's worth even if it means paying full price and a little extra for the glasses.<br/><br/>I'm afraid I might have to eat my worlds from an earlier post I did, while commenting on the new ""Up"" trailer. I might have mentioned my lack of enthusiasm for DreamWorks latest offering. Calling the trailer for it, dull uninteresting and unfunny. Two of which I'll be happy to retract. It certainly isn't dull. There isn't a second during the movie I slouched over in my seat. Your entertained 100% of the time, what doesn't quite work is the jokes. The movie feels split between two major audiences. There were jokes referencing moments from movies that kids below the age of 15 are likely not to have seen (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Mothra) with this looming to movie feels like its geared towards the audiences of film lovers who still revel in the wonders of 50's B-movies, however only seconds later were forced to sit through childish bodily functioned joke followed by a innocent giggle coming from the front row. In this sense then it pleases both audiences and deludes them at the same time, adults wont appreciate the childish fart jokes while the 50's references will escapee minors.<br/><br/>When California girl Susan Murphy is unwittingly clobbered by a meteor full of outer space gunk on her wedding day, she mysteriously grows to 49-feet-11-inches tall. The military jumps into action and Susan is captured and secreted away to a covert government compound. There, she is renamed Ginormica and placed in confinement with a ragtag group of Monsters: the brilliant but insect-headed Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D.; the macho half-ape, half-fish The Missing Link; the gelatinous and indestructible B.O.B.; and the 350-foot grub called Insectosaurus. Their confinement is cut short, however, when a mysterious alien robot lands on Earth and begins storming the country. In a moment of desperation, the President is persuaded to enlist the motley crew of Monsters to combat the Alien Robot and save the world from imminent destruction.<br/><br/>What's amiss is cleaver development, the films moves so fast and where rarely allowed to catch our breath to such an extent that some of the characters feel left out and excluded from what's going on. It's reassuring however that DreamWorks have made a film that both appeals to the avid movie lover in me as well as the young child. It works to an enormous extent and is a rarity that I can recommend both you and your child to go see this. You'll probably take your kids to see Monsters vs. Aliens, but you might have more fun seeing the movie without them.<br/><br/>Verdict: Its rare i ever come across a split verdict for a movie, I'm usually set on how I feel. With this I was debating it and debating it and could come to only one conclusion.With a witty script and a collection of adorable characters, Monsters doesn't have a lot of emotional depth, but it's a well-designed crowd-pleaser. You can't go wrong if you're willing to fork out an extra couple of pounds for the 3D experience. For my overall rating I give Monsters Vs. Aliens 3D 4/5 while the 2D experience gets an enthusiastic 3/5."
"tburke85","9","2","6","4 October 2009"," Monsters Vs Aliens A Very Funny Animated Movie
","Monsters Vs Aliens is a very funny animated movie from Dreamworks. Now I'm not a big fan of these kiddie movies but I have to admit that I found this one to be very humorous with a good story and well developed characters for the most part. I actually enjoyed it a lot more than most recently Transformers Revenge of the Fallen or 2007's Spider-man 3 to name a few which ended up being big disappointments compared to this one and other films out there. Directors Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon are admirable in making this movie that plays homage to the 50's monster films. The talented voice cast including Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett, and Kiefer Sutherland brought so much to their roles. They all do a really great job and were just perfectly chosen for their characters. The voices some of them came up with for the characters matched very well and the movie was fast paced making the 94 minute running time fly by fast. The rest of the voice cast including Stephen Colbert, Jeffrey Tambor, Paul Rudd, Amy Poehler, Julie White, and Rainn Wilson are very good as well despite most of their animated characters only having a few extended appearances throughout the movie. Renee Zellwegger and John Kranski even lend their voices for brief cameos in the film. There was a good balance between the humor, action, and character development which some films these days have greatly lacked. The special effects and the action sequences are impressive. They weren't anything spectacular or mind blowing but they were well executed none the less. Even the animated characters seemed to have genuine chemistry together which made their friendships believable on the screen. The commitment by the actors and everyone involved in making this movie made that happen. The music they chose matched perfectly with what was happening on the screen and it added a lot to the movie. The only few tiny flaws were that things moved a bit fast in the beginning and some characters lacked development but the good definitely more than outweighs the bad in this one. This movie seems to be telling us a lot of messages about being true to yourself and that it's not whats on the outside but the inside is what counts. Just like you should never judge a book by it's cover. Overall Monsters Vs Aliens was a lot better than I thought it would be and it was just as good as either Wall E, Shrek, or Kung Fu Panda to name a couple. Monsters Vs Aliens has plenty of humor, action, character development, and a talented cast who help bring these animated characters to life making you care about them. If you're a fan of these type of movies than chances are you'll enjoy Monsters Vs Aliens just as much. Go see it much better than expected."
"ja_kitty_71","10","2","6","28 April 2009"," Monster-ific DreamWorks classic
","I saw this movie in 3D, and after that I know that it's another DreamWorks classic. The film is about Susan Murphy, A young Californian woman, who got hit by a radioactive meteor (maded out of a substance called quantonium) on her wedding day, causing her to mutate and grow to a height of 49' 11 1/2"". <br/><br/>Now she is immediately labeled a monster, renamed ""Ginormica,"" and sent to a top-secret prison facility headed by General W.R. Monger and containing other monsters: B.O.B. , a brainless, indestructible gelatinous blob; Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D., a mad scientist with the head and abilities of a cockroach; the Missing Link, an amphibious fish-ape hybrid; and Insectosaurus, a colossal grub that is even larger than Susan. The monsters are forbidden to have any contact with the outside world; while the other monsters have been living contentedly with this lifestyle for the past 50 years. <br/><br/>Poor Susan feels incredibly isolated and wishes to return to her old life; that is until an alien named Gallaxhar detects the quantonium radiation emanating from Earth and deploys a gigantic robotic probe to find it and extract it from its source - Susan. And so, General W.R. Monger (on a desperate order from the president), calls on the monster crew into action to combat the aliens and save the world from imminent destruction. I don't have a favorite scene (as I said many times), because I love the WHOLE film - from beginning to end, and I love the lovely, bad-a** Ginormica."

","Who do you root for when it’s aliens versus monsters, anyway? This isn’t like Aliens versus Predator, where no matter who won, we lost. OK, time’s up - it’s monsters. The monsters - the Missing Link, Dr. Cockroach, Ginormica, B.O.B., and Insectosaurus - are on our side, helping to defend Earth from the dastardly intentions of one Gallaxahar.<br/><br/>Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) is searching for an element called quantonium, which he believes will make him superpowerful or something. Some quantonium has landed on Earth in the form of a meteorite. A meteorite that lands on Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) right before her wedding, causing her to grow to enormous proportions! Soon the military catches her and imprisons her with other caught monsters from over the past fifty years. And then when Gallaxhar sends a massive robot probe to Earth, a probe that is invulnerable to all attacks, only one group of mostly inhumanoids can save the day! In addition to Susan, now known as Ginormica, there’s B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), a gelatinous blob; Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie) , a roach-human hybrid; The Missing Link (Will Arnett), a gill-man; and Insectosaurus, a giant - and I mean giant - grub. Bound together by a thirst for justice and fresh air, they “agree” to fight back against the robot probe.<br/><br/>Couple of things to note here. First, although this is a PG-rated film, there’s a notable use of the word “boobies.” As a male adult, I think it’s awesome that such a word has finally made into kiddie fare, although the fact that I have no kids probably plays into that a little bit. Still, I don’t think it bothered the sold-out crowd in the theater; at least there were no audible gasps. Also, the violence, because it’s in 3D - yes!! - is a little more intense than for a 2D movie, since it’s all in your face and such. Again, I don’t think it affected the kidlets negatively.<br/><br/>Another thing to note is that Seth Rogen is a comedic genius. Fans of his live-action stuff have known that for a while, of course, and now the kids will, too, if they know he’s the voice behind B.O.B., who falls for a plate of Jell-O at one point. Rogen’s comic timing is hilariously on key, and he always sounds as if he’s having the time of his life.<br/><br/>Reese Witherspoon (like Rene Zellweger in Bee Movie), as Susan, is a sweet, engaging voice actress as well. Her bemusement as she struggles with her sudden height - she uses cars as roller skates - is entertaining. There are also some slight nods to other movies; the President (played memorably by Stephen Colbert) plays the famous five notes from Close Encounters of the Third Kind before showing the Vulcan hand sign. And when the military attacks the probe, one plane has “ET GO HOME” painted on its side.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie that makes good use of 3D technology, and it’s one that viewed in 2D would seem pedestrian. It’s not quite a classic, but there are plenty of good jokes - particularly from Rogen - and it’s well cast. The kids will enjoy it, and it’s another in a line of enjoyable DreamWorks animated features."
"AlienatorX","8","1","2","4 April 2016"," A cool tribute and a great animated film
","I am a fan of Superheroes, I am a fan of b-movies, and so I love films that blur the line between the two, part of the reason is also because I think that a lot of those old B-movies could be remade as superhero movies very easily, you want proof? Sam Raimi's Darkman was inspired by old universal horror films and mad scientist B-movie, Wes Craven's Swamp Thing also blurs the lines a bit and you also have this movie. Aliens have invaded the earth, sending in a giant robot probe, after attempts to destroy it fail the government resorts to an alternate method; Monsters. For years the US government has been capturing and containing monsters the most recent of which is Ginormica, a to-be bride who is hit by a meteor which contained radioactive material which causes her to grow giant, she joins the team which already consists of Dr Cockroach, B.O.B, the Missing Link and Insectosaurus. Everyone of the monsters is a stand-in for some iconic b-movie monster; 'Missing Link' – 'Creature From the Black Lagoon', 'B.O.B.' –'The Blob', 'Dr Cockroach' – 'The Fly', 'Ginormica' – 'The Fifty Foot Woman', and 'Insectosaurus' – 'Godzilla/Mothra'. As a tribute to those old B-movies this film succeeds, the plot is over-the-top, the story is outrageous and the action is top. But this films succeeds on another levels, this movie is outrageously funny; the verbal humour, the slapstick are both done expertly and the voice actors are having a blast, top points to Hugh Laurie (yes, THE Hugh Laurie) as Dr Cockroach. And yet past the humour and the b-movie tribute this film also has its fair share of tender moments and it's kind of heartfelt overall. This movie is great: kids and adults will love it, proof of my theory that when Dreamworks are good they are fantastic. So where's that superhero remake of The Manster? What about The Amazing Colossal Man? Or The Indestructible Man? Octaman? Blood Freak? The Amazing Transparent Man? Come on studios! Most of these movies are in public domain for crying out loud! And there's no shortage of B-movie loving directors and writers, Make this stuff happen!"

"jboothmillard","7","1","2","10 January 2011"," Monsters vs. Aliens
","The return of 3D, a tradition that has been in and out of cinemas for decades, was a big deal in the 2000s, and this was of the films leading the way forward for what is possible. Basically Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) is just about to get married to news weatherman Derek Dietl (Paul Rudd), when all of the sudden she is hit by an alien meteorite full of a substance called Quantonium. She absorbs all of this substance that it causes to grow about fifty foot high, and being classed as a monster labelled Ginormica she is taken to the secret government prison facility holding feared monster inmates. The three leading monsters, the brainless indestructible gelatinous blob B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), the mad cockroach headed scientist Dr. Cockroach Ph.D. (Hugh Laurie), and fish-ape hybrid The Missing Link (The Incredibly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret's Will Arnett), mistake her as one of them, oh, and there's monster giant grub Insectosaurus too. Meanwhile evil alien dictator Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) detects that the Quantonium he wants is coming from Earth, so his probe goes there and starts destroying things, and General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) convinces President Hathaway (Stephen Colbert) that the monsters are all that can stop it. When Susan gets out however, she is more interested in getting back to her normal life, and even being fifty foot high and monsters coming with her she tries to return home, only to be rejected and have Derek dump her. After accepting that she may be better off as a monster, she is then abducted by Gallaxhar and the Quantonium that made her big is sucked out, making her normal size and lose her super-human strength. Eventually the other monsters catch up to the alien leader and his clone army, they are defeated with the help of butterfly turned Insectosaurus, and in the end Susan aka Ginormica stays the way she is, and she, B.O.B., Dr. Cockroach Ph.D., and The Missing Link fly away to solve a new threat. Also starring Jeffrey Tambor as Carl Murphy, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel's Amy Poehler as Computer and Renée Zellweger as Katie. This is a really funny spoof of all the popular horror and alien B-movies, borrowing Mothra, The Blob, Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, The Fly and Creature from the Black Lagoon, and referencing the popular sci-fi films for buffs, like E.T. and Men in Black. The voice casting is really good, the animation is of course class, including the distinctive 3D moments, and the sight and one-liner gags are all hilarious, my favourite bit being the President referencing the Close Encounters communication music with Harold Faltermeyer's ""Axel F"", a great fun family animated science-fiction comedy. Very good!"
"ksub","10","1","2","24 October 2010"," DreamWorks bold move
","This film in one of my guilty pleasures. Yes there are some story flaws if you take it too seriously, however don't forget, this is a comedy/action movie. In making this movie, DreamWorks made some bold moves. First they made this there first 3D animation. Second they blended a love of B monster movies with a ""Dirty Dozen"" idea of prisoners being let out of prison to defeat a greater threat. Third they gave Henry Jackman his first break in scoring the music, who did a fantastic job. Focusing on the character of Ginormica (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) they tell a story of a young woman letting go of her smallness and accepting herself and her true power. Besides being a flawless job of technical animation, the character of Ginormica may be one of the most beautiful girls ever to be computer animated. It is unfortunate that DreamWorks said there will not be a sequel."

","When she is stuck by an alien meteorite, summer bride Susan finds herself growing to enormous size and in possession of great strength – neither of which she wanted as the intervention of the US military does rather put a damper on her wedding day. Next thing she knows she is in a secret facility and part of a group of other monsters and mutants which the government keeps under wraps for the greater good. However, when an alien forces comes to Earth searching for the power that transformed Susan, the Government has no choice but to unleash their ""monsters"" to fight back.<br/><br/>The family animated film ""genre"" is pretty crowded at certain times of the years. Since Pixar hit big with films that deliver plenty of adults and children, many have tried to do the same. Dreamworks has probably been one of the more successful and Monsters v Aliens is, for better and worse, a fine example of their output. The adventure story provides plenty of spectacle and, as two people in their 30's watching this without children, we were consistently engaged by it thanks partly to this. What worked mostly better for me was the humour. In the most case the film is pretty funny thanks to the characters and the dialogue – BOB and Dr Cockroach are probably the strongest and they provide plenty of laughs. In contrast I thought the Missing Link was only OK as a character. I was chuckling consistently when the main group were around and the only bits I felt were poorly judged were most of the stuff involving the President (which was a waste of Stephen Colbert – a very smart lampooner of politicians); his keyboard moment didn't work and is quickly followed by an inappropriate joke about soiling himself.<br/><br/>Otherwise the voice cast is well used. Witherspoon plays it more or less straight and does a solid job. Rogen and Laurie dominate the laughs and their delivery is great. Arnett is capable of more although his presence along with Tambor makes for an amusing Arrested Development moment and of course Poehler is in there too. The Office's Wilson is fun as the ""baddie"" of the piece although Sutherland, Colbert and Rudd are not really particularly good or well used for a variety of reasons.<br/><br/>The one thing that this film cannot do though, is to deliver anything beyond the impressive visuals, smart lines and fleeting laughs. It doesn't appear to be trying to have more than this which is fair enough but for my money MvA does remind the viewer of the difference in class (generally) between Pixar and Dreamworks. Pixar films generally seem to be able to do all that this film can, but also deliver so much more – while Dreamworks seems happy with pop culture references in place of depth. That said it is harsh to judge this film against a very high bar of Pixar's best films, but rather it should be met on its own merits. So, yes, while there are things that don't work and also aspects that could have been significantly stronger, the film is generally colourful, funny and engaging for a wide age range. Not a classic by any means but it is still fun."
"Floated2","8","1","2","27 August 2010"," Surprisingly an amusing film!
","I was somewhat surprised tat I enjoyed this film as much as I did. I didn't really have high expectations before watching this but I ended up enjoying quite much. It was actually very funny, and the special effects were nice (though I didn't see it in 3D). It was much more different than other animated movies from recent. Unlike the others, this one has more action and better humour.<br/><br/>The characters in general were pretty good and funny. Though I strongly disliked the lead female Susan. He was very stereotypical and cliché and she was selfish. IMO she was more selfish than her boyfriend who she accused of being selfish. I hated the whole ""woman can do things without a man"" thing was laid on pretty thick. Her act was soo clichéd and typical. At first when she became a giant, she wanted to be back normal sized, then once she finally got turned back normal, she wanted to go back to being a giant..how predictable. And for Derrick, he had reasons for not wanting to be with her after she became a giant, yet she couldn't understand that and she got mad real fast. Her attitude and personality wasn't all that great. BOB (Seth Rogen) stole the show, he was the best part. His character was hilarious throughout. The other characters were pretty nice too (the cockroach prof., missing like, the evil Galaxar). The graphics were quite pretty, and that final fight scene was something to behold. Overall I really enjoyed this film, so id recommend it to others!"

Naming a few animated films like Up, or Shrek Final Chapter, or Coraline or The Polar Express. <br/><br/>Monsters vs Aliens is a pretty alright movie for families with kids, for parents to join in the laughter. <br/><br/>Though the script could be more solid to justify the efforts for creating the good visuals"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","1","2","30 March 2010"," Good family film
","I have been dying to see Monsters vs. Aliens for a while, back when it was released I never had the opportunity to go see it. One of my friends saw it and said that it was a lot of fun. So finally, I don't know how I missed it, but I saw that it was playing on HBO and definitely had to check it out. Over all I did enjoy the movie, Dreamworks usually comes up with clever ideas for animated family films. This was a very cool concept, never really thought about it, how different aliens and monsters are and what it would be like if they ever had to get into a fight. Although I do miss good old animation and there is so much CGI animation, Monsters vs. Aliens is very cool visually. The characters are so great to look at, also have great personalities that make the movie very cute and funny.<br/><br/>Susan Murphy is hit by a meteorite on the day of her wedding to weatherman Derek, absorbing a substance called quantonium and growing into a giantess. Alerted to the meteorite crash, the military arrive and capture Susan. She is labeled a monster, renamed ""Ginormica"" by the government, and sent to a top-secret prison facility headed by General W.R. Monger and containing other monsters: B.O.B., a brainless, indestructible gelatinous blob; Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D., a mad scientist with the head and abilities of a cockroach; the Missing Link, an amphibious fish-ape hybrid; and Insectosaurus, a massive grub that is larger than Susan. The monsters are forbidden to have any contact with the outside world; while the other monsters have been living contentedly with this lifestyle for the past 50 years, Susan feels incredibly isolated and wishes to return to her old life. An alien named Gallaxhar detects the quantonium radiation emanating from Earth and deploys a gigantic robotic probe to find it and extract it from its source, Susan. After a botched attempt by the President to make peaceful first contact with the robot, it begins destroying everything in sight, resisting all conventional military force used against it. General Monger convinces the President to use the monsters to fight the robot instead. The monsters accept the mission with the promise of freedom if they succeed.<br/><br/>I would of course recommend this movie for the family or if you're just a fan of animated movies. I nearly died laughing with the scene where the president tries to communicate with the alien at first, it's just so beyond goofy that you can't help but laugh and of course since he messes that up, he runs away getting into a helicopter screaming he's a great president and tried his best. Also another great scene is when the monsters first try to get rid of the alien, seeing their reaction to it and still learning what their power is and how they could use it to their advantage was great. The animation, the actors, the story and effects really made this into a great movie and an absolute pleasure to watch. While I'm not sure that this will go down in the classics, it's definitely a fun family film.<br/><br/>8/10"

"Coventry","8","1","2","22 December 2009"," A delightful treat for horror fans!
","The reviews that I've encountered on ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"", both from professional and amateur authors, were largely negative and harsh ones, mostly claiming that the film doesn't have a real target audience. Animated movies are usually primarily aimed at young children but this movie is definitely ""scarier"" than your average cartoon and even for the more adult audiences the script it too full of subtle references and little tributes to the world of ancient 50's B-cinema. I even read in one specific review that ""Monsters Vs. Alien"" is the out-of-control project of a couple of obsessive and nerdy film-fanatics and can probably only be enjoyed by other obsessive and nerdy film-fanatics. Well, I am a obsessive and reasonably nerdy – at least when it comes to old horror and Sci Fi movies – film fanatics and indeed I tremendously enjoyed this film; thank you very much! I never dreamed I would ever see an animated movie that brings homage to long-forgotten (at least I assumed they were) and shamefully underrated cinematic milestones like ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"", ""The Blob"" and ""The Fly""! And then to think these titles are only just the famous sources of inspiration. I really couldn't believe my eyes when I spotted references towards much smaller and even charmingly clumsy Sci-Fi films like ""Mothra"", ""The Thing from Another World"", ""It Came from beneath the Sea"", ""The Amazing Colossal Man"" and ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"". To me – although we stated clear that I'm just an obsessive and nerdy fan boy – this is all the more proof that horror and Sci-Fi, and monster mania flicks in particular, are not dead genres. Even though you're not familiar with the era of 50's monsters, the over-the-top grotesque ideas and situations of mass hysteria still definitely inspire the nowadays generation of scriptwriters and, in spite of what a lot of people think, with success!<br/><br/>On the day of her long anticipated wedding with the ambitious weatherman Derek Dietl, the beautiful Susan gets hit by a radioactive meteorite and almost instantly grown into enormous proportions. Much against her will, Susan – now renamed Ginormica - is taken to a secret government lair where she's locked up amongst other monsters, like The Missing Link, a blob-like creature, a gigantic moth and a genius but mad scientist with the body of a cockroach. When the evil alien super villain Gallaxhar threatens to destroy the world, however, their guardian General Monger releases the monsters to fight back. It's true that the story of ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" occasionally feels rushed and the creators didn't take enough time to properly introduce the magnificently versatile cast of characters and their fascinating background. On the other hand, though, this is an animated movie and nobody wants to watch a three hour cartoon, right? ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" is fast-paced, witty, incredibly clever and chock-full of hilarious situations and adorable inside jokes. Especially the character of dim-witted B.O.B and self-indulgent evil alien Gallaxhar are downright hilarious. The computer animation and design is damn close to perfection and even the 3-D gimmicks were aptly chosen. Also, Dreamworks made some excellent choices in Hollywood names to provide these delightful B-animation-movie characters with the exact right voice, like Reese Witherspoon as Ginormica, Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach PhD, Kiefer Sutherland as General Monger and Seth Rogen as B.O.B. Don't even bother reading the bashful guarantees; I'm an obsessive nerd and I say this is the best animated movie out there, along with Kung Fu Panda."

A special mention goes to the president ""talking"" to the alien. It did lack some of the heart and magic present in most Pixar films but it did have more fun sarcastic humor and was overall quite entertaining.

"macattackanimationproduc","4","1","2","19 April 2009"," 'Monsters vs. Aliens' Confusing and Forgettable, yet Charming
","It was the perfect alien movie parody- an outer-being invades Earth and a bunch of dim-witted monsters have to stop him. Add the fact that DreamWorks Animation (Shrek, Kung Fu Panda) is behind it should make it to be a hit! But ever since Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, DreamWorks has been going downhill. Pixar and them were always competing to be the top studio, DreamWorks constantly casting major stars to voice (Aliens no exception) and Pixar always winning awards (Wall-E took home the Oscar for 'Best Animated Feature' last year). But even celebrities couldn't save this train wreck of a movie. The predicaments are frankly unlikely and dumb, and a lot of the scenes are left unexplained, the ending for one. Directors Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon, who have both been with DreamWorks Animation for quite a while, Vernon having been since the first Shrek movie, attempt to create a parody of alien invasion movies like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and may have done just that. In a scene where the president (Stephen Colbert, hilarious but unnecessary) tries to communicate with the foreign ship, he plays a keyboard, obviously spoofing Close Encounters. It'll have you snickering. <br/><br/>But snickering alone does not make a good comedy. A good comedy has to have a few sight gags, evenly spaced jokes and a fairly funny cast. The cast is great, and I'm not referring to their talents. Monsters vs. Aliens stars Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen (whose character is pretty much the best part of the movie), Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett (we also get a cameo from Amy Poehler), Kiefer Sutherland, Rainn Wilson, Paul Rudd, Renée Zellweger, John Krasinski (you know him from The Office), Ed Helms (him too), Julie White, Jeffrey Tambor and, as I mentioned before, Stephen Colbert. Of course, we also have small parts played by DreamWorks regulars including the directors plus Sean Bishop, Tom McGrath, Chris Miller, Lisa Stewart, Latifa Ouaou and Geoffrey Pomeroy. A huge cast means huge money, which Monsters is sure to make.<br/><br/>In Monsters vs. Aliens, a meteorite from outer space hits a young girl, Susan (Witherspoon), on her wedding day, turning her into a nearly 50 foot woman. She's taken to a secret government lair with other monsters that have been kept hidden: B.O.B (Rogen), Dr. Cockroach (Laurie), The Missing Link (Arnett) and Insectosaurus. When the world faces an alien invasion by Gallhaxar (Wilson) soon after, General W.R Monger (Sutherland) suggests to President Hathaway (Colbert) to release the secret monsters and see if they can handle the situation better than the government can. ""Oooze gonna save us?"" B.O.B, no contest. The giant blob of blue goo saved the movie entirely. If it wasn't for the Seth Rogen voiced character, Monsters would have fell flat. ""I think that Jell-O gave me a fake phone number.""<br/><br/>Monsters vs. Aliens is the latest rocket that DreamWorks attempts to land on the moon. It doesn't land anywhere near Kung Fu Panda or Flushed Away, but it's enjoyable if you don't think too much about it. It's full of spoofs, cameos and some goofs only the adults in the audience will get (a pretty funny one from The Colbert Report, watch for it). You get a few giggles, but no real laugh-out-loud moments come from it. <br/><br/>Pixar's still going strong, but DreamWorks is staring to create epic money-making bombs.<br/><br/>2/5 popcorn buckets."

","As the title states, this film is definitely suitable for all ages, and I don't mean kids. Along with the small corny jokes for the kids, there were plenty of other jokes hidden throughout the movie for the adults. The number of references to other movies was amazing, but it kept us laughing and didn't ruin it.<br/><br/>I couldn't even recognize Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach, I had to wait for the credits to figure out which character he was as I'm only familiar with his work on ""House"" but he definitely got into his character and nailed it on the head. Seth Rogen as Bob generated most of the laughs with his character and even Reese Witherspoon was believable and had you feeling sorry for Susan. Over all, the movie was well cast, and they did a bang up job.<br/><br/>As for the 3D, it was perhaps some of the best 3D I've seen. It wasn't in your face, things flying at you all the time. It was used subtly throughout most of the movie and generated a couple great moments as well. They did a bang up job using the 3D to compliment the movie instead of the other way around. You even forget it's in 3D sometimes, which is how it's supposed to work.<br/><br/>I went into Monsters vs Aliens expecting it to be a great kids film (I'm 18) and I left with a smile on my face because it was one of the funniest films of this year so far, and it was good clean humor.

"jantoniou","6","1","2","13 April 2009"," Another somewhat mediocre CGI flick
","I had high hopes for ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" and in certain respects it met those expectations but substantially as a whole it failed to meet them.<br/><br/>Why? Because essentially it lacks real heart.<br/><br/>It just felt wrong - you'll know what I mean when you watch it. Like Pixar's ""Cars,"" it just lacked the heart, the engaging storytelling of their past triumphs.<br/><br/>The story is fine, if a bit retreaded from alien movies - a super-secret group of monsters sequestered away by a vague, mysterious government agency is finally (after 50 years, holed away in a facility that, had it been real, likely cost billions to operate, but let's not let reality intrude) called to action when an evil alien named Gallaxhar invades earth to retrieve a vital mineral that made one of the monsters-Ginormica, voiced by Reese Witherspoon--a monster in the first place.<br/><br/>There is some good action, the CGI animation pretty solid (standard, I'd say, by today's standards), and the climactic battle scenes good but, while it is supposed to feel heartwarming as Ginormica grows surer of her identity as a ""monster,"" it feels somewhat limp.<br/><br/>My theory - and take that for what it's worth, which is nothing - is that these CGI movies generally fall flat because there are too many big name, big screen actors taking these roles. I'm serious - there are just too many big names here and I don't think they're up to the task of good voice acting, which is a whole different ball game than screen acting. I didn't think Reese and Hugh Laurie were particularly good though Seth Rogen as B.O.B. the blob is pretty funny.<br/><br/>Let me provide a supporting argument for this theory: In the movie ""Bolt,"" John Travolta, in my opinion, was not that great as the movie's namesake dog. Likewise Miley Cyrus was not that great, which is not saying much as Cyrus is a questionable actor anyway. But Mark Walton, who voices Rhino in that movie, and is a professional voice actor, was very, very funny and really made that movie worth watching.<br/><br/>The biggest problem in my opinion is not that the big name actors are especially bad - though I think they lack the art of good, professional voice actors - but rather that we know the voices themselves. We know Reese's voice and Travolta's and so on.<br/><br/>Of course my theory falls apart in movies like ""Kung Fu Panda"" where major names like Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman, voice stars of that movie, deflate my theory entirely. Of course ""Kung Fu Panda"" was ""A grade"" CGI, storytelling, and easily on par with Pixar fare which has set the gold standard for animated CGI. ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" - not so much.<br/><br/>All said ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is decent, not spectacular, somewhat fun, but not amazing. Much of the humor feels rather flat to me. It's enjoyable to a point and then seems to strain.<br/><br/>My feeling? Wait for the DVD."

","Animation is a wonderful medium that allows us to create worlds and creatures that would not be possible in the realm of live-action film-making. However, like in live-action, the most important aspect in animation is the story. No matter how fantastic your visuals will be or how funny and multi-generational your jokes are, if your script is not up to snuff, your film is going to be simply average. Featuring an all-star cast of talented film and television actors, Monsters vs. Aliens is similar to an amusement park ride. You have fun while on it, it all passes by very quickly and then you forget about it some moments later as you go on the next ride.<br/><br/>When a planet explodes and a meteorite enters the Earth's atmosphere, Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) comes in contact with it and soon she grows into a giant. Naturally, she is caught by the government and detained in a top-secret building with other monsters: a scientist who experienced a botched experiment to give people the live-span of cockroaches (Hugh Laurie), a gelatinous blob with no brain (Seth Rogen), a playboy fish-ape hybrid (Will Arnett) and finally, the chemically-altered Insectosaurus. When an alien leader Galaxaar (Rainn Wilson) attacks the planet, the President (Stephen Colbert) calls upon this group of monsters to help save the day.<br/><br/>Monsters vs. Aliens just feels like a fun excuse to show off some impressive visuals, but without a concrete story, it's hard to care for the main characters or their quest to save the world. Susan is quite under-developed and I didn't feel much emotion for her character in the same way I did for, say, Stitch (from another animated science-fiction comedy Lilo & Stitch) or last year's Wall-E. The best aspect of the film is B.O.B. Seth Rogen does a great job in the role and even when he's not saying anything or when the scene is not centered on him, the character's facial expressions are hilarious to watch. Stephen Colbert also does some funny work as the President of the United States (the role he was pretty much born to play). The rest of the actors do good jobs, but nothing quite impressive. Had a professional voice actor like Jim Cummings and Tress McNeille taken on those roles, they would have knocked them out of the park.<br/><br/>In any case, the film has enough good humour and well out-together action sequences that the audience will not be bored by it and Monsters vs. Aliens feels half as long as the advertised running time. However, some added character development would have helped the film from being just another run-of-the-mill DreamWorks animated comedy. While certainly better than the likes of Shark Tale or Madagascar, it doesn't reach the heights of their other comedies, most notably Shrek and Bee Movie. Monsters vs. Aliens is a good enough for a rental or a cheap matinée screening, but paying extra for the 3-D glasses isn't a good investment for such an adequate product."

","*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I'm so, so sorry, but I think my expectations went a bit too high for this film. Reese Witherspoon, that unfunny actress that acted in Legally Blonde and Legally Blonde 2 comes and acts in Monsters VS Aliens, a movie that sounds like it will be tons of fun and will have heaps of laughs and (family) action scenes. Boy, was I wrong. Only a couple of scenes of action were in this movie. But that was not the bad part. The reason that this film is so utterly bad is because the ""jokes"" aren't even jokes! I think I just found out how to give people cancer, and that's to watch this movie! The film makers did an awful job with the jokes and quotes, and the storyline was terrible, plus it didn't even have enough action to entertain us through this horrible animated family comedy. Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of family comedies. I also like a lot of family actions. Although this had more action then most family animated films, it had less laughs than most family animated films! Let me start off with how the movie starts.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a woman (Reese Witherspoon) in a relationship with a man, and she gets struck with a meteorite that turns her into a giant. Reese Witherspoon is then stuck into a top secret government facility with MONSTERS...that have terrible quote lines. Hip hip, hooray. So, meanwhile, in deep space, Gallaxhar the purple alien sends ...let's say something to find an energy source on earth. But of course, it has to land in America, doesn't it? It wouldn't be an action film then! So, the fictional president makes contact with the something, and the something goes and has a party at San Francisco. Yes, I know. Terrifying.<br/><br/>The top secret facility lets out the monsters that tell horrible jokes out of the prison of unfunny monsters so they can destroy the something. So, they kill the something. Then an alien comes and so on...I won't tell the rest of the story, just in case you do watch it. However, I recommend you don't watch this movie unless you are going to watch it with your kids.

","Belated Day 18 Of My 31 Days Of Horror.<br/><br/>Dreamworks animation like Pixar animation has been going through the slumps. I will have to admit that one of the smartest and funniest animated films I have seen Is Monsters Vs Aliens which I think is a throwback to the old monster movies of the 1950's.<br/><br/>The film is about Susan voiced by Reese Witherspoon whose wedding day has been ruined due to a freak accident where she grows 100 feet tall and is deemed Ginormica. She meets up with B.O.B. voiced by Seth Rogen Dr. Cockroach Phd voiced by Hugh Laurie and The Missing Link voiced by Will Arnett to help destroy alien robots that have invaded Earth.<br/><br/>This like I said is smart funny and inventive that reminds you of the classic monster movies of the 1950's.

","Having two different types of creatures come onto the same screen is an interesting idea. Monsters are organisms created by humans. Many are from some malfunction in scientific procedure that led to the disfigurement of the original organism. Aliens, as we know of from previous science fiction films, are organisms that are not from this planet. But what really makes this film unique, is how it tells the story of finding one's place in the world. Even if you're over twenty stories tall.<br/><br/>The characters in this film are very amiable. Reese Witherspoon lends her voice to the character of Susan Murphy, who later becomes Ginormica (a really tall woman), and finds herself in an area she's never heard of before. It is there, that she meets with several other creatures that were all created by a freak accident. The few other creatures that Murphy encounters have their voices through other great actors as well.<br/><br/>Hugh Laurie plays Dr. Cockroach who is really fun to listen to because of how he talks. Plus the fact that anything he tries to make doesn't work. Will Arnett is funny as The Missing Link because he always talks about how strong he is but can't really do much. And last is B.O.B who is voiced by Seth Rogen. B.O.B is possibly one of the funniest characters on screen just because how flexible the character of B.O.B. is (physically and mentally). And what's great is that there's almost a funny line for every character in this film, except for the more sentimental parts of course.<br/><br/>The other thing that I really appreciate is how this movie makes references to movies released to the older generations, not to mention they're all from the same year as well! For example, Ginormica is a reference to the film, Attack of the 50-Foot Woman (1958), while Dr. Cockroach is almost and exact replica to The Fly (1958), and B.O.B. alludes to The Blob (1958). It is quite clear to what this film was inspired from and it shows that the film crew paid extra attention to the details. It's an honorable tribute if you ask me.<br/><br/>The only thing that could've been done better was the actual comedic parts themselves. Yes this movie was funny but when I watched the trailer to this film, it seemed like it was going to have even bigger laughs once I saw the whole film. Unfortunately, it didn't. I laughed often but I felt like I wasn't laughing enough. I wanted more from the screenplay and I wasn't getting what I expected. But in the end, I walk out satisfied knowing it was a fun movie in general.<br/><br/>Dreamworks has created a CGI adventure that will not only be fun for kids but also for adults to watch as well. With its goofy script, and sharp visuals, Monsters Vs Aliens is a family film worth seeing."

","Honestly I thought this movie was going to be like a lot of other Dreamworks movies a bunch of pop songs and Mike Meyers but instead this movie is hilarious and not filled with a bunch of pop culture references. I have to add this is a pretty original premise the story is kind of predictable but it is a kids movie so I am not looking for too much depth.<br/><br/>The story starts with a meteor landing on this girl named Susan (Reese Witherspoon)on her wedding day because of this she gets the power to grow really big and she can't get smaller so the government captures her and throws her in this secret facility with the other monsters. You can tell they are all buffoons but funny ones. Well honestly the aliens attack the government can't beat them so they send monsters it is that simple of a story but it is a fun one at that.<br/><br/>The voice acting is phenomenal Reese Witherspoon is OK she is the level headed I just want my old life back girl. Then you got Seth Rogan is perfect as a voice actor I liked him in Paul and I like him in this Seth do voice acting I hate your stoner comedies. His character is a blob named Bob and this guy is so retarded it is funny not slapstick retarded but just stupid funny. Hugh Laurie play a cockroach named Dr.Cockroach and he is great as the mad scientist his evil laugh got me every time. Will Arnett was good his character didn't have any memorable lines but he was still good. The villain Gallaxhar had his moments of hilarity but nothing special.<br/><br/>So overall this has a kind of a weak but interesting plot great voice acting and wonderful writing with jokes that keep you constantly laughing. I can only give this movie a Buy if you have kids if not a strong very strong rental."

","Good examples of animated movies combine the dazzling graphics and drawings, with good story lines, easy to follow 'moral of the story', and humour that children and adults can enjoy.<br/><br/>""Monsters vs Aliens"" successfully does all of that in my opinion. I knew nothing about this movie before watching it and I came away surprised that it is not talked about in the same regard as Monsters Inc., and the Toy Story franchise.<br/><br/>The animation is exceptional. The characters are memorable and the monsters all play an important part in the storyline and in helping Susan find her own identity. The battle scenes are great but they are a small part of the real story which is Susan stepping out of her shell, and finding herself surrounded by the most unconventional friends imaginable.<br/><br/>kudos to Seth Rogen who delivers a lot of the really funny lines and also to Stephen Colbert who's turn as the president of the US of A is hilarious. Parents who are familiar with ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" will especially enjoy the 'first contact' scene.<br/><br/>9/10"
"dunmore_ego","5","1","3","1 November 2009"," Monstrous Alienation.
","MONSTER VS ALIENS is a suitably giggly concept, well executed in 3D animation, well written, with funny characters and a straightforward storyline that kiddies will understand. Yet it fails for a fundamental reason - it advocates Guantánamo Bay! <br/><br/>Whoa! Poffy's gone insane! Comparing a kid's cartoon to President Bush-Cheney's war crimes. But think carefully now: <br/><br/>As a human being with compassion towards other human beings (yes, I'm talking to you directly), what would be the first thing you would do if a woman suddenly grew to fifty feet tall? You would try to get her help, right? Not so if you are a misanthropic swine like Bush-Cheney - at the first sign of ""difference"" you would declare her an ""enemy combatant,"" persuade everyone she is a ""threat,"" then lock her away with no habeas corpus, no rights, no legal prerogatives, no resolution, in a cell with no windows.<br/><br/>This is what happens in MONSTERS VS ALIENS. Young bride-to-be Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is hit by a meteorite, which makes her grow to fifty feet tall on her wedding day - at which point the military shows up and takes her captive without one word of permission, compassion, approval or apology. She is told her subterranean prison is so secret, it is ""an x-file, wrapped in a cover-up and deep-fried in a paranoid conspiracy."" In other words, it's a rendition. (Coincidentally, Witherspoon played the wife of an Egyptian-American kidnapped and tortured by Americans in RENDITION.) <br/><br/>What does this teach the ignorant populace, let alone impressionable kids? I'm sure that wayward vagina, Liz Cheney (daughter of even bigger vagina, Dick) is forcing her kids to watch the opening scenes of MONSTERS VS ALIENS as if it's a documentary.<br/><br/>So even though I want to laugh at the many funny moments in this movie, it is informed by plot lines like this. And I can't see anything funny in General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland, sounding as unbalanced as R. Lee Ermey in FULL METAL JACKET) telling Susan as he locks her away, that ""the government has changed your name to Ginormica."" <br/><br/>""Oh,"" say Liz Cheney's kids, ""the government can DO that?"" ""Yes, children,"" informs their spineless hawk swine of a mother (daughter of draft-dodger and spineless hawk swine of a mother, Dick), ""the government can do anything it wants. Now go wash up for dinner and wipe your asses on our American constitution towels."" <br/><br/>I'm sure that Stephen Colbert (of THE COLBERT REPORT), who voices The President of the United States, would have noticed this misanthropy, but he's being employed merely as an actor here, so had to let it slide without biting commentary.<br/><br/>In prison, Susan meets other detainees, kept just as unwillingly, but more humorously, since the less a lifeform resembles us, the more vicious we can be towards that lifeform without guilt: Dr. Cockroach Ph.D (Hugh Laurie), The Missing Link (Will Arnett), and B.O.B. (Seth Rogen, who brings his crazy little laugh and scattered personality to this blue blob, unlike his innocuous participation in other animated features, like HORTON HEARS A WHO or KUNG FU PANDA).<br/><br/>Together, they defeat the forces of Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson), an alien who wants the essence from the meteorite that landed on Susan.<br/><br/>Some of the funniest scenes take place on Gallaxhar's ship, which is an architectural wonder. In 2009, we take a lot of visuals for granted because of computer technology, so we have to step outside ourselves to admit that the destruction scenes of the interior of Gallaxhar's ship actually look more ""realistic"" than the interior destruction of the Death Star in RETURN OF THE JEDI! Let's face it - referring specifically to only those scenes (where a giant generator-type thing starts falling and splintering), both are ""non-real"" scenes, either matte paintings and/or computer animation, so we are comparing apples to apples, not live-action to a cartoon.<br/><br/>Everyone ends up Disney happy, obviously because it's only a kid's fantasy disconnected from reality.<br/><br/>Directors Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon (who also participated in the writing) predictably fill their movie with messages of self-realization and philanthropic acceptance. Ironic then that they depict their own government so callously as being the opposite - but again, this is because America as a nation has become so inured to the criminality of the Bush-Cheney War Crime ethos (being perpetuated and promoted even after their doomsday reign by the Cheney cabal) that it is now considered comedy. Not even black comedy, but mainstream, nay, KIDDIE comedy! <br/><br/>But Guantánamo (and other ""black sites"" like it) are no laughing matter; creations of a pathologically insane sadist who lived in a fantasy disconnected from reality: Dick.<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."

","This film was wonderful, cute and enjoyable and great for kids age 8 and up, but not to mention good for the whole family. This movie is a about a Californian who is taken to prison after her growth and ends up heartbroken, crushed in sadness and rather homesick, but don't despair, she does cheer herself up a bit when she starts getting to know the monsters. Once she has beaten the robot, you will not believe how happy and clever she is to do it all by herself and I agree that she is super mega successful and I almost forgot to add 'pure' success is how happy she possibly was. Soon once Susan gets used to all the monsters, she befriends the group of monsters named 'The Missing Link' 'B.O.B.' 'Dr. Cockroach phd' and slightly 'Insectosaurus' so this is a nice movie with enough jokes to amuse and entertain the bored kids. Some people think this movie will be lame and dull from the previews but no, briefly on second thought they enjoyed it so this may be a good enjoyable movie with likable and cute characters especially B.O.B. everyone's favorite character and think he's just the best 'no brain' slob on earth (or maybe not.):( He's just one of our likable character. But this did have good characters I liked it. This is highly recommended. I took my 7 year old cousin, my mother, ordena and rochella to see this and we all liked it and might buy the DVD. This is marked for being a good dreamworks film, an enjoyable family movie, and a awesome 3d action film. This is a comedy-packed film so if you propose to watch this, sit back, fill up the popcorn bag and laugh your way through this funny film."
"MartinHafer","7","1","3","24 May 2009"," An 'A' for CGI and music, otherwise a disappointing 'C'.
","This was a film I really wanted to love. After all, it was shot in beautiful 3-D, the idea sure sounded cute and the film appeared, at least at first, as a homage to my favorite genre, 1950s sci-fi films. However, after a while, it seems that this angle really wasn't all that important and the film degenerated into yet another clichéd and by-the-numbers children's movie. Sad, as the film could have been so much more.<br/><br/>The film begins well enough, with Susan being hit by a weird meteorite just before her wedding that transforms her into a 100 foot tall (give or take) lady. She is drugged and taken to a US government facility for monsters, where she meets four others--Bob who is a cute blue blob (the best of the cast), Dr. Cockroach who is quite fun, the Missing Link who is a 50s style aquatic monster and a giant bug who is quite a bit taller even than the newly christened 'Ginormica' (Susan). You can tell at this point that it is yet another buddy film and by the end, they'll all have worked together to save the planet.<br/><br/>Now I did like the evil alien, Gallaxhar. His voice was hilarious and he had a lot of personality--sort of like The Great Gazoo (""The Flintstones"") mixed with The Brain (""Pinky and the Brain""). He provided some nice comic relief and was a decent villain.<br/><br/>What I did not like was how once the characters were all established, the film seemed terribly familiar. You realized that because it was a standard plot (despite the strangeness of the characters), what HAD to happen by the end of the film. I predicted way before it happened that Susan would lose her size and powers--which SHOULD have been an answer to her problems BUT that she would CHOOSE to make herself big again to save humanity and be true to herself. In fact, her entire character was like a textbook example of a combination damsel in distress and spunky female action hero--and nothing like a real person.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a decent film for the kids and parents can sit through it without too much discomfort. However, considering that it COULD have been a great parody of 50s sci-fi films and wasn't (it concentrated too much on the dull plot about self-acceptance and all that crap), it is only an okay film with really great CGI, 3-D effects and music in the ending credits. Plus, it has all the look and feel of an upcoming made for TV kids series and not much more.<br/><br/>By the way, this is more a commentary about the use of big-name celebrities to do the voices than a comment just on this film. A few years back, I met Rob Paulsen and heard him give a talk. He is the voice of a bazillion cartoon characters (including Yakko Warner, Pinky and one of the Ninja Turtles) and he was lamenting how often the studios use non-voice actors for the full-length movies not because they are talented voice actors but in some attempt to boost ticket sales. While I doubt that it really does increase sales, in many films these voices just aren't that great or necessary. As for MONSTERS VS. ALIENS, Hugh Laurie was great as Dr. Cockroach, Rainn Wilson amazing as Gallaxhar and Stephen Colbert pretty good as the President, but the rest of the voices just weren't all that memorable. I really think in some roles (such as Susan or the General), a professional voice actor could have done the job for a lot less and probably better than hiring big name actors and actresses--especially since my teenage daughter and I had no idea who were doing the voice-overs before we went to see the film. Plus, I just can't imagine a six year-old saying ""Mommy,...we HAVE to go see the film, Reese Witherspoon is one of the voice actresses!"".<br/><br/>Finally, the name of the TV station in the film is incorrect. As the station is in California, the call letters should have begun with the letter K, as all American stations west of the Mississippi River have this designation. Despite this, it started with a W. No big deal--just a small mistake."
"Neenee-b","8","1","3","14 April 2009"," Monsters v Aliens
","A long time ago in a land far far away, well the year 2001 to be precise Shrek arrived and set the benchmark for modern day animation. Shrek had the one thing that many other children's films did not have - the adult factor and because of this a franchise was spawned that peaked at Shrek2 and died an undignified death at Shrek the Third. Every animated movie since the release of Shrek has desperately tried to gain adult acceptance as that is were the true money lies and on the Easter Weekend we were treated to Monsters v Aliens.<br/><br/>It stars the usual big Hollywood names in the trendy fashion that is voicing a CGI kids film. This time we had the talents of Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogan (who is more than everywhere these days), a British Huge Laurie as the Monsters and Keifer Sutherland hamming it up voice style as General Monger. I don't know what it was, maybe because I actually liked the actors voicing the characters but I thought they were all great. Reese Witherspoon did a great job as Susan (Ginormica) and Seth Rogan is apparently just as funny doing voice work (and gaining most of the laughs) as the literally brainless B.O.B.<br/><br/>The story is as basic as it gets. Monsters are imprisoned. Aliens attack. Monsters fight Aliens and are accepted into the world. Although the story is basic that isn't a criticism. It was simple enough for the young kids to follow but it is the telling of the story and all the little side scenes such as those involving the President of America and all the daft clichés were for the adults.<br/><br/>The animation was fantastic to look at. It had all the polish of Pixar without the over smaltzy Disneyness that usually accompanies it and was just as funny as the rough and ready Ice Age series (which in my view outranks Shrek any day of the week!) There were some very funny set pieces and the action was fast and exciting. There was nothing to scary for very young children but there is enough action that the older kids (and adults!) will be impressed by. I will admit to laughing out loud on more that once occasion especially at the ""global warming - convenient truth"" quip that no body else in the audience seemed to pick up on.<br/><br/>I would give the movie 8/10. It is an animated movie that you can actually volunteer to take your kids to and enjoy it just as much as they can. There probably will be a sequel but if you look at Shrek (again) the second one is always better!!"
"michael11391","9","2","10","27 March 2009"," Monsters Vs. Aliens is one of Dreamworks Animation best work, it's very fun and entertaining.

Reese Witherspoon, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett & Rainn Wilson as the main villain Gallaxhar were great and fun to watch. But Seth Rogen as B.O.B & Stephen Colbert as the President stole the show with memorable characters, they were funny as hell!! I liked the good visuals, the nice 50's look at alien invasions and mainly the action-packed sequences (surprised how great the action was in this). It wasn't as funny as I expected it to be but I still laughed hard out loud a couple times as well a few more laughs at other scenes as well. The action sequences though, is surprisingly well-made and loved it. Monsters Vs. Aliens is like The Incredibles of Dreamworks Animation, The Incredibles is the best & most action-packed feature from Pixar and this Monsters Vs.

","Susan gets transformed into a 50ft woman on her wedding day and as a result is forced to join a group of monsters to fight an oncoming threat from an approaching alien.<br/><br/>Wall-E, Toy Story, The Incredibles and Monsters Inc all show how fantasy comedy and storytelling combined can work. All Oscar winners that are not DreamWorks pictures. Pixar therefore are on somewhat of a role and the arrival of Shrek and Kung Fu Panda have been the closet rivals ever so could this promising picture depicting the most famous of legends finally top the best animators in the business? For this year that certainly remains to be seen after a fairly disappointing trailer for next Pixar release Up! But Rob Letterman's release is certainly enthralling viewing for any age, if perhaps not going to rattle the cages of Pixar's seemingly unflappable reputation.<br/><br/>What this picture does is entertain from start to finish with a coolly funny plot that maintains the comic without diving too deep into the weepy soap styled animations that can be the knockdown of so many others. When the plot feels like heading that way up pops one of the cool looking monsters with an in-joke or crazy physical act to keep the laughs coming which is a massive relief as when the emotions hit this film doesn't handle all too well. Susan's overwhelming emotions and The Missing Link's unfit shape make you want to hide your head. But do not fret as this is surely the funniest picture DreamWorks have ever mustered.<br/><br/>Shrek had all the attributes for great family viewing. The physical humour of eating disgusting food and Eddie Murphy's Donkey are classic and the emotional core on the concept of appearance is almost tear worthy. Monsters Vs Aliens emotional core may waver but the hilarity from the monsters is beautiful. The physical attributes contributed by BOB are exquisite and the Cockroach's mad attitude towards science is manic humour where even Susan has her moments. Go Monsters! It is an obvious one sided film where you will always route for Monsters as the stereotypical and over dramatic evil alien Gallaxhar (worst villain name ever?) will have you hating him each time on screen.<br/><br/>The bizarre representation of the President is often funny if way overboard but the kids will love it.<br/><br/>The intertextuality of the film survives on classic Sci-Fi films such as The Blob. Not to mention the inclusion of monsters away from the real world feels Men in Black. But these are handled well through some fine physical humour and an easily accessible plot that will make kids laugh and adults intrigued by the sophisticated action and political agendas."

","Susan is about to get married when she is hit by a meteor which makes her grow 50 feet tall. So, of course, the US military captures her, renames her Ginormica, and confines her in the company of several other socially unacceptable individuals: the amphibious Missing Link, mad scientist Dr Cockroach, so named because he has accidentally merged himself, Fly-style, with a cockroach, the screechy, skyscraper-sized Insectasaurus, and B.O.B., an amorphous blob of blue jelly which has become self-aware but, with no brain, is terminally stupid. These lonely misfits come into their own when it becomes necessary to fight off an alien invasion. In 3D, no less.<br/><br/>I loved everything about this film. I can't possibly cover everything I liked, but here is a partial list:<br/><br/>1. The sci-fi premise appealed to the sci-fi buff in me, but was also engagingly daft, which appealed to my sense of humour; 2. The film looked great and the 3D was fabulous; 3. The voice talent was, without exception, excellent, though I would single out Seth Rogen and Kiefer Sutherland; 4. The movie was packed with stuff to appeal to kids, but also to their parents (and grand parents - one of the very first references is to the bat and ball on elastic as used by the barker in the Vincent Price 3D House of Wax in the 50s); 5. Loads of humour, not only straightforward gags (verbal and visual), but character based humour too.<br/><br/>I could go on (and on!) with specifics, but you get the point. Highly recommended, especially in the 3D version, but with much to enjoy flat, too."

The four other monsters looked rather cutesy, especially Insectosaurus, who looks somewhat like a hamster to me. Also, there were some things I totally didn't expect in this movie. Dr. Cockroach Phd. saying ""OMG!"" surprised me for two reasons: 1. He was very formal most of the time; 2. So far, I've NEVER heard any character in a movie say ""OMG!"", instead of ""Oh my God!"". I thought Insectosaurus was male and died, but it turned out that he/she is alive and turned into a feminine-looking butterfly/moth. I guess this insect creature was actually a caterpillar of some sort. Anyways, the ending was good.

She is also not the only reason I'm asking you to see this. The supporting performances - from Stephen Colbert, firmly in his Colbert Report persona gives as POTUS.

","The best that the second tier animated movies has to offer. By second tier, I mean the movies like Megamind and Cars. This movie had me really laughing a lot. <br/><br/>The movie is about Susan. Through an odd turn of events, she is turned into a giant. She is then taken to a compound with other monsters, where no one gets out. But when the world needs help, there is only one place to turn, to the monsters.<br/><br/>Every one in this voice cast is hilarious, starting with Reese Witherspoon. She is great as Susan. Seth Rogan is amazing as B.O.B. much better than his role in Kung Fu Panda. Hugh Laurie is second funniest, behind Rogan, as Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D. Also Kiefer Sutherland is super funny as General W.R.

","I was impressed with Steve Colbert as president. His TV persona showed through in this left of center satire on monster and alien movies. It is a movie that parents will find entertaining as well.<br/><br/>There is a reference to Susan's boobies and a scene where the military man scans his butt to enter a room. That is pretty much the extent of objectionable material. The movie starts out with Susan getting married in a Unitarian(?)church (no Christian symbols) when she is struck by a meteorite which turns her into the 50 foot woman. The military subdues her like Lilliputians and imprisons her with other monsters (interment camp).<br/><br/>When an alien robot attacks the earth, the monsters are let loose to save the planet and win their freedom in return.

Basically the movie is about your average girl who is hit by a meteorite on her wedding day and turned into a giant and becomes imprisoned by the government only to be released with a team of other freaks to do battle with an alien who wants to take over the world.

","Monsters VS Aliens (2009): Dir: Rob Letterman, Conrad Vernon / Voices: Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogan, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett, Conrad Vernon: A creative family adventure about placing one fear against another that make for an exquisite visual feast. Earth is targeted for an invasion by an alien race until four monsters along with a 50 foot woman are released to stop them. Directed by Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon with a screenplay that follows full formula and predictability. That is not to say that the film is lacking in creative process. It just arrives at the predicted action climax where the obvious occurs. Reese Witherspoon voices Susan whose wedding is interrupted when she grows to alarming height. She will eventually learn to use this ability to counter attacks by an alien race. She is assisted by four monsters. Seth Rogan voices Bob the blob who is indestructible but doesn't have a brain. He does have the ability to consume objects of large mass. Hugh Laurie voices a cockroach scientist in a hilarious reference to The Fly. Will Arnett voices the Missing Link who appears to be half ape and half fish. Finally there is an oversize bug-like beast in a reference to Godzilla. Conrad Vernon voices Insecto transformed by nuclear radiation for another gimmick power or talent. Hilarious jabs at old monster movie clichés clashed with monstrous visuals. Score: 8 / 10"
"elshikh4","Null","0","1","8 June 2012"," Being good while needing something to be very good isn't really bad !
","They told me ""Monsters vs. Aliens is bad"". Bad is what that itself turned out to be after viewing this fun movie. How many elements do form its perfect fun? Let's see..<br/><br/>The casting. It's quite familiar criticism that what DreamWorks misses (in term of creative story, 3D,.. etc) compensates by assembling at random any stars walk in Hollywood streets. This round, everything clicked rightly with everyone. Reese Witherspoon as Susan - Ginormica - Murphy, Seth Rogen as B.O.B, Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach, Will Arnett as The Missing Link, Kiefer Sutherland as General Monger, and Stephen Colbert as President Hathaway--represent, literally, great casting work. Originally, I'm not, by any chance, a Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, or Will Arnett fan. In fact, you can call me the opposite of a ""fan"" as long as it concerns these guys. In any movie they do, whatever its defaults were, I used to see them as the WORST. So, it was such a mind-blowing surprise to find myself falling in love with their voices as those characters. I haven't thought that Witherspoon has that tender voice and wonderful performance, or that Rogen is that funny. Even Sutherland did one of his most memorable character I kid you not. Which leads to the next factor...<br/><br/>The writing. While mixing some of the 1950s cheap monsters movies, with the 1960s super spy vs. ""I want to takeover the world"" evil man movies, the script, so brilliantly, reproduces a cute, hot, and explosively comic version of (Seven Samurai), with a message too of ""be yourself, no matter what they say"" or ""it doesn't matter what you look like, it's all about your heart"". There is even a wicked pun in the title; where the monsters vs. aliens, and vs. being an actual aliens in their society as well. The movie is cracking. The best comedy DreamWorks ever made I presume. From the wacky characters, to the unbroken laughs, I had a mega-enjoyable time. The script has a one of a kind comic talent; just recall character like B.O.B with his involuntary personating; where he gets to be anybody's character passionately, or antics like President Hathaway's, or scenes like showing the way how the lead characters became monsters. It's all a creative entertainment.<br/><br/>The lines worked like a snappy punches: ""As you can see, he has no brain. / Turns out, you don't need one. Totally overrated!"", ""I think that Jello gave me a fake phone number!"", ""I'm not looking to get married just to live in someone else's shadow, and you're casting a pretty big shadow!"", ""Once again, a UFO has landed in America, the only country UFOs ever seem to land in!"", and ""Dr. Cockroach, I would really appreciate it if you didn't do your mad scientist laugh!"".<br/><br/>The direction made a top action sequences, like the fight over the bridge. The designers made dazzling interiors for the aliens' spaceship. The editing has a superb timing which's rarely found in the cartoon or 3D movies of today. And the references to, for instance, the arcade game (Dance Dance Revolution) at the try of shutting down the spaceship's electronic brain, or playing the theme song of (Close Encounters of the Third Kind) which was directed by DreamWork's owner Steven Spielberg, and Harold Faltermeyer's music of (Axel F) at the first encounter with the aliens. All of that worked for the benefit of this movie's clever mildness. I liked in specific the closing credits, which was designed a la Maurice Binder's moving shadows from James Bond movies. This is like a cinema's tribute to itself and us.<br/><br/>About the shortcomings, I thought that the evil man Gallaxhar, played by Rainn Wilson, was the least interesting character around, despite his importance to the story. All what he had to be distinguished by was 4 eyes in the face! Another flaw came from the idea of unleashing an army of Gallaxhar clones, while having another army of sure bigger and stronger robot probes! Gallaxhar was stupid; he could have owned the world with these giant probes. Even an idea like ""He did that because he was stupid"" wasn't used. And a correction: We don't wear turbans on our heads in Egypt as it was shown at the sequence of Gallaxhar's speech to the Earth's nations!<br/><br/>Now, the movie's major flaw, rather major letdown for many: the second act. It's short, laconic and disappointing. It has only 3 events: the fight with the probe, the party of Susan's new friends at her folks' home, and Susan's emotional shock due to her fiancé's reaction towards her transformation. On another level, that act didn't go through the lives of the rest of the monsters' team else Susan. Since these characters were lovely and rich, we wanted to have more of them, but it was official: Susan is the lead, and the rest are sidekicks. However, if they were more taken care of, this movie would have been more satisfied and satisfactory. Because these characters' storylines, even if made as short, could have diffused more affection and - why not - comedy to the final product.<br/><br/>Earlier I read about (Monsters vs. Aliens) something that went like this: ""It's another DreamWorks big-budget CG feast of flash-in-the-pan celebrities and trite pop culture references"". Though after watching it, I said: ""Here's a triumph for DreamWorks, and a complete joy to us"". Despite nearly missing an act in my viewpoint, DreamWorks DID IT this time. Frankly, where there're ""creative"" and ""enjoyable"" with ""a message"", it's hard to ask for more. Because when a good movie needs something to be very good; it doesn't mean that it is bad. On the contrary, it is a good movie already."

","Monsters Vs Aliens is a cute little family movie that's energetic and fun to watch, but I wouldn't say it's anything I go i'll out of my way to see again. Reese Witherspoon provides a great personality for Susan and gives us a very likable and energetic heroine, and I liked the supporting characters as well, it's just it didn't seem like anything all that special to me. It started off tremendously at the beginning with a very thrilling capture of Susan and how she turned into an enormous human being, but after that things just seemed to really die down in my opinion. The all star cast for the voices for the characters is quite an impressive feat when you look at it, and all did wonderful jobs, and while I enjoyed myself in the end, it could have been better as well.<br/><br/>Bottom line.

","When a giant robot from outer space threatens to destroy all life on Earth, a group of adorable monsters - whose very existence has been kept under raps for decades by the federal government - is deployed to defeat the menace. One of the ""monsters"" is Susan (energetically voiced by Reese Witherspoon), an average California girl who becomes a multi-story giantess after she is hit by a meteorite on the day of her wedding. The save-the-planet mission she is sent on gives her a chance to prove to herself and to those around her that she has what it takes to make a difference in the world.<br/><br/>""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is a minor-league animated effort that is clearly aimed more at the youngsters in the audience than at the adults. Kids will enjoy the cutesy creatures, the frenetic pacing, the bright colors and clean backgrounds, and the nonstop action sequences that make this feel at times almost like a ""Transformers"" for the pre-teen set. And speaking of other movies, the film is stuffed to bursting with cinematic allusions, ranging from ""Close Encounters"" to ""E.T."" to ""The Wizard of Oz"" to ""The Blob"" to ""Attack of the 50-foot Woman"" to ""Dr. Strangelove,"" some of which will be familiar to the kiddies and some of which only the adults in the audience will be able to pick up on.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is lively, attractive and innocuous and will probably be forgotten by most viewers a good five minutes after they've seen it - the older viewers, that is."
"Turfseer","5","0","1","2 April 2010"," Mildly entertaining but flat animated sci-fi comedy
","Monsters vs Aliens had the potential to become a Sci-Fi comedy classic along the lines of a 'Coneheads' or 'Galaxy Quest' but didn't quite make it. There were a few scenes that really hit the mark however, due to the satirical content. My favorite scene was President Hathaway (voiced by Stephen Colbert) trying to make personal contact with the alien robot. The President is depicted as sort of a twisted Madison Avenue Ad exec type from the 60s surrounded by prototypical yes men. First he plays the theme from 'Close Encounters' on a DX7 Yamaha synth and then breaks into Axel F, the theme from the 1984 Beverly Hills Cop movie (the anachronisms just seemed to jell perfectly). When the robot makes it clear that he's not interested in 'peaceful co-existence', President Hathaway just manages to escape with his life. The president's transition from feckless appeaser to impulsive warmonger in a matter of a few minutes is priceless! <br/><br/>The film's inciting incident draws you in at first. That's where Susan is infected by the meteorite and is transformed into a giant monster on her wedding day. We break into the 'second act' when Susan is transported to the secret government facility where she's imprisoned with other monsters who have been captured over the last fifty years. I just couldn't understand how the secret government monster unit could have so easily muzzled all the guests at the wedding who were witnesses to Susan's amazing transformation. And that especially includes Derek, Susan's social-climbing TV anchor boyfriend, who would have been first in line to promote the media scoop.<br/><br/>I was further disappointed when we soon learn that the government has 'collected' a total of only four monsters (not including the newly minted Susan, now dubbed 'Ginormica') over the past five decades. And it seemed crazy that such an enormous facility was needed to house such a limited collection (I guess that was the joke—the government was so paranoid about the monsters escaping that they built such a giant facility despite the fact that their prisoners were a completely sorry and ineffectual bunch). The bottom line is that it would have been much more fun if there were more monsters released to combat the invading aliens. The film's scenarists could have worked the additional monsters in without taking away from the principals (the other monsters could have been designated as less intelligent and unable to speak—at the same time, their ineptitude could have been highlighted through various visual scenes without the need for dialogue).<br/><br/>The monsters of 'Monsters vs Aliens' seem to be created in order to emulate Dorothy's allies in 'The Wizard of Oz'. Susan (having been separated from her family and propelled into a new world) can be likened to Dorothy. Then there's Dr. Cockroach as the brainy Scarecrow, The Missing Link as the Tin Man without a heart and BOB equivalent to the cowardly lion (since this is a comedy, BOB's 'cowardice' is due to stupidity rather than a lack of nerve). And Insectosaurus, the lovable moth, functions as a sort of Toto character, beloved by the protagonist and her allies.<br/><br/>I found the Monsters to be a rather unfunny lot. There wasn't much difference between the Dr. Cockroach character and the principal villain, Gallaxhar (both had that maniacal laugh). And what about the 'Missing Link'? I guess he was supposed to be some sort of Loch Ness Monster but there was nothing distinctive about his comic persona. BOB, the gelatinous mass, who couldn't think straight, was perhaps the most amusing of the motley trio. The bit about him falling in love with the jello mold was one of the funniest scenes in the entire movie.<br/><br/>As the Monster vs Alien's plot develops, it becomes obvious that the vapid Susan, who defines herself in relation to the obnoxious Derek, finally gains confidence and is no longer dependent on men to go forward in life. That's her 'internal arc' and I had no problem with the way the story was going in that regard. But the 'external arc' of the story was underdeveloped and derivative. Take for example when Susan first stops the alien robot (but must destroy the Golden Gate Bridge in the process). Although the city of San Francisco had been evacuated, I would have thought that the battle with the alien robot would still have been covered by the news media. The film's screenwriters missed a big opportunity to depict Susan as the new hero and media darling after destroying the alien robot. And for awhile, it would have been nice to see Susan distracted by fame and seduced by the culture of celebrity.<br/><br/>Finally, Gallaxhar and his spaceship, seemed to be like a cheap imitation of the brilliant Coneheads. Contrast the sharp, satirical portraits of various narcissistic characters in the Coneheads with Gallaxhar —reminiscent of the mustachioed villain of 19th century melodrama.<br/><br/>Monsters vs Aliens has quite a bit of very neat animation along with a positive message of self-empowerment. But by the film's end, it becomes too much like the kind of films it seeks to satirize. Yes, another 'mother ship' blows up after being set on 'auto-destruct', thanks to the heroic efforts of a group of motley but lovable losers. 'Monsters' has its moments but it's not consistently funny enough to be ranked as one of the better comic animations."

This is what most of DreamWorks animation movies lack. An exact and EverEnding ending. It's just about to remind the great 'NeverEnding Story', each part of which actually was given a great ending! Maybe, it's some kind of marketing move: say, if you, audience, approve the movie, we, DreamWorks, could shot further. No, precious 'producers folks', it doesn't work that way.

I failed to laugh at most comedies released in this year, but finally after watching this, I am happy to say I am not disappointed. It's quite honestly, probably, the funniest movie of the year. I'm not exaggerating.<br/><br/>It's another Dreamworks masterpiece, and it's no secret why animation is able to beat out most comedies these days. An animated film doesn't have R ratings or 18A ratings for graphic content or profanities. It's family themed jokes and it's fantastic fantasy jokes that can be realistic but totally impossible.<br/><br/>From start to credits, I was laughing my head off at the funny antics of B.O.B, the quips and quirks of Susan, the wild and insane Doctor Cockroach and last but not least, the Missing Link who is just funny because of his ego.<br/><br/>Monsters vs Aliens is a delightful, funny comedy for everyone.

","Monsters vs. Aliens is one of the better animated films of the last couple of years. It's really a genre satire film, and makes the humor fresh because its references to other movies are done so subtly. The sight gag bits support the development of the story's own universe. (Much better than those genre-title movies that just reenact scenes from recent films.) Sci-Fi movies are the target this time, ranging all the way from the way out drive-in alien invaders of the 50's to recent sci-fi encounters. I didn't keep count, but some good stuff from at least 25 movies and probably more were hidden to pop up at opportune moments here. Some are disguised, others are more obvious, but the jokes all work.<br/><br/>A bride-to-be gets conked by a rogue meteorite, turning into a 50-foot giant. Men-in-black seize her, and she becomes a reluctant heroine joining a team of sci-fi mutated good-guys opposing alien nasties. This story line is a nice framework for adapting all the craziness of the numerous sight gags, and there's a good flow in the action. My only criticism might be that the main character, Susan, is written somewhat melancholy and bitter. It really wasn't necessary, and conflicts with other comically written characters. The gooey blob, the mammoth bug, the missing link, and the bug scientist all make for a great team. I especially got a kick out of the nut case villain guy, who wants to conquer the universe. His multi-eyes that look in different directions are classic.<br/><br/>Fun stuff. There's humor in this movie that both adults and kids can appreciate, making for a great family film."

Well, here you go, you smacked your head on a doorway, guess you're not so smart after all, nyuck nyuck nyuck.<br/><br/>The jokes regarding how men are either terrified ninnies were also cruel and stupid. What's the point in demonstrating that someone is a coward? Sure, once you can pull it off, but over and over and over? What's your point?<br/><br/>Or the plot line where the girl gets rid of her power. Ah, without massive power, she's totally useless. But once she gets her power back, viola she's a useful person again. The implication is power=good, no power = sucker. Yeah, thanks for telling me that assholes.<br/><br/>It has no compassion for the various characters. It also doesn't have any compassion for the viewer. The writers think we're interesting in watching how clever they can be.<br/><br/>But people come to movies to gain something, to feel something. And the only thing I felt watching this was ""how much longer do I have to put up with this crap?"""

","This is a very entertaining movie for adults and kids. It focuses on Susan who is about to get married to a TV anchor. On her wedding day she gets his by a meteor which makes her huge. This gets the attention of the government who imprison her with other ""monsters."" When aliens decide to invade earth, the warden of the monster prison tells the president, who is a lot like Stephen COlbert, that the monsters can defeat them and allow them to do so. Through this the monsters become close to one another and Susan realizes she likes them and does not like her old life after her boyfriend dumps her for being big. This movie has a lot of very funny one liners for adults and great action sequences. The voice cast is great and is one of the reasons why i really liked this movie. Stephen Colbert is hilarious in his role as the president and is a lot like his character on his TV show. The ending after the credits roll is very funny as well."

","Monsters vs. aliens is a pretty funny movie. If you heard that it wasn't that good, don't believe it. I finally saw it and it was actually very funny. Am I saying it's as good as things like Wall E or Ratatouille? No, but I still think that this film is worth seeing, I wish I would've saw it in 3-D.<br/><br/>The film really focuses on Susan(Reese Witherspoon). On her wedding day, she is hit with a meteor and it causes her to grow into a large person. A giant. She is taken to a facility by general W.R. Monger(Keifer Sutherland). While at this facility, she meets B.O.B.(the best character in the film, Seth Rogen), Dr. Cockroach(Hugh Laurie) and The Missing link(Will Arnet). They soon realize that they are under attack by an alien(Rainn Wilson) and they come out and try to save the world. <br/><br/>There are some great moments in this film. Like when they are fighting in San Fransisco. The plot doesn't have too much to it, but the film is pretty good. I laughed really hard at some parts. Monsters vs. aliens is actually better than the original Madagascar. There was something about the original. I liked it, but it could've been better.

"Kinetek","7","0","1","25 September 2009"," Taken For Granted
","Now here is something that is close to my heart. An animation film based on 1950's sci-fi fodder - it's just got to work. Or has it?<br/><br/>Thankfully, yes it does. As film lovers in the digital age, we have become so spoilt for choice over the last ten years, what with Toy Story, Finding Nemo and Wall-E to name but a few - that we are quick to knock films of this genre with even the slightest flaw - forgetting the time, patience and effort that goes into producing one of these modern day miracles.<br/><br/>Monsters Vs. Aliens isn't a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but is ludicrously good fun if you're a fan of science fiction. There are too numerous references to list here, but needless to say if you've ever watched a black and white sci-fi flick, you'll recognise plenty here.<br/><br/>Technically, the film holds it's own, and at the same time manages to resist the temptation to overwhelm the viewer with flash/bang trickery. The monsters all have their own endearing qualities that children and adults alike will love - while the aliens thankfully fall into the category of 'so smart they're stupid' that made the likes of 'Mars Attacks!' so much fun. The vocal acting is competent and manages to keep disbelief at bay for the best part.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, MVA isn't great great - but it's not bad bad either, and there are plenty of animations that fall into that category that really do get a bad time in the press, simply for not being a Pixar movie. All aside, kids will love this - and if you're a big kid like me, you'll love it too. Good stuff!"

","Story, well a simple fun story. No deep attempt to moralize or philosophize, but enjoyable. Its a cartoon, OK? And the running time is not too long. Plenty of nice animation, good visual and dialog jokes. Might even be fun to watch a second time, though not if I have to pay for it.<br/><br/>What is outstanding is the IMAX 3D. Head and shoulders better than what Disney did for Up. The IMAX version has a fast frame rate and electronic glasses which shutter each eye in sync with the film. The content is also rendered totally in 3D. So, things never feel layered. Motion scenes - and there are lots of action scenes - are stable and clear, better than ordinary cinema (they really do need to stop showing films at just 24 frames per second). So the 3D is immersive. You can sense things in the far distance as well as quite close. This is definitely how 3D should be done, and I give a 1 point bonus on my rating simply because this is a showcase for 3D done right and both audience and other film makers should raise their sights on 3D to meet or beat this quality level. It is a milestone.<br/><br/>And a fun one."

"Robert_duder","8","0","1","19 May 2009"," Solidly entertaining, epically huge and a romping good time
","First I will say quite clearly that Monsters vs Aliens is not the greatest work of animation from Dreamworks, or Pixar for that matter. That isn't said to take away from the film at all just simply a statement of fact. Second of all I knew I wanted to see Monsters vs Aliens in IMAX 3D which I don't often get to see. So I'm sure that influences my opinions as well. The film is monstrously entertainment, great characters, fun adventure and just something everyone can enjoy and that is really the goal of animation right now. I think in some ways the film might have been too much for just one animated movie. The characters are all terrific but seem to have so much more they could have done with them where minor characters were perhaps overused. The film is still a load of fun and could truly be fun for anyone who wants to go. The 3D aspect is truly awesome. They do an amazing job and some of the scenes really stand out. It was awesome to watch the kids around me in the theater really be impressed with the 3D graphics and it was just as much fun for me. I really wanted to reach out and try to touch the 3D object like they were all doing.<br/><br/>Reese Witherspoon proves that she has talent beyond acting on the big screen by lending her vocal talents to Susan Murphy and her enormous alter ego Ginormica (love that name.) She has the perfect sweet voice and really makes her character come to life. Seth Rogen is absolutely perfect as less than clever B.O.B. He is one of the characters that I felt got sadly underused which is strange because I would have thought they'd shove Rogen down our throats. Still his character and his silly voice really just made him one of the best characters. Hugh Laurie is just awesome as Dr. Cockroach Ph.D. He is probably my second favorite character in the entire film and could easily carry his own spin off movie I think. The character of The Missing Link was a very important character but not quite as lovable and funny as the rest of them. He had his moments but his character is more serious and flawed adding a touch of the dramatic to the film. In that way I felt like Will Arnett didn't really match his character like the rest of them did. He does well but certainly doesn't get a whole lot of heavy comedy out of the deal. The supporting cast of voices are all perfect for their respective characters including a terrific voice over by Kiefer Sutherland, Stephen Colbert (hilarious as the President,) Paul Rudd, and Rainn Wilson who is a much better voice actor than he is an actual actor. Truly my number one favorite character of the entire film...has no voice over at all. He is the single handed creation of the animation artists and that is fuzzy, adorable, mean looking Insectasaurus. One of the greatest scenes in the film and in recent animation is the scene with the giant one eyed robot staring down Insectasaurus across the Golden Gate Bridge...it was a spectacle.<br/><br/>Directors Rob Letterman of Shark Tale fame and Conrad Vernon of Shrek 2 fame as well as numerous animated voices, do an amazing job on this story. Both Shark Tale and Shrek are quite obviously terrifically told stories that revolve around bringing these ""cartoon"" characters to life and not in a Scooby Doo kind of way but rather making animated features as good, if not better than live action. This story certainly shows some real talent. The characters are brought to life and it's fun and exciting and even touching and manages to pull off a moral message to boot. Not an easy task for a film nowadays. Monsters vs Aliens isn't the best animated feature out there but I think honestly it's mostly due to it's own illusions of grandeur, it just tried way too hard to be perfect but still pulls off excellent. Definitely check this one out for fans of animated movies or watch it with the kids because you will love it as much as they will. 8.5/10"

","We live in an era of dark and gritty action films, most of which have been largely successful-the Bourne trilogy, The Dark Knight, Casino Royale, the International etc. But sometimes, its always better to watch something that exudes pure and unadulterated fun and a large dose of much needed optimism. After all films were originally meant to be a form of escapism and in these troubled times, we can sure do with some escapist fantasy.<br/><br/>Who cares if monsters and aliens don't really exist? Who cares if there are no such things as UFO's, alien invasions and meteors which can turn young women into giants? Who cares if the US Government doesn't actually operate a top-secret facility to imprison monsters? Its all meant to be fiction, to be fantasy...and as long as its enjoyable, I'm all for it! The humour is excellent, the animation and effects doubly so. Some of the characters and their antics and dialogues can be extremely goofy and ridiculous...but SO WHAT?! as long as its funny and entertaining.<br/><br/>I especially loved the part where the US President attempts 'first contact' with the alien probe. One of the most humorous parts of the film, undoubtedly.<br/><br/>Ultimately, you can have all the grim and gritty action, graphic violence and death and stark realism you want in films, but it shouldn't really hinder your appreciation of a real winner like this one..."

","It is rare that you see such a fast-paced original children's movie which allows you to focus on the characters. I saw this movie in 3D and I thought it was a wonderful little animated film that really used the humour that was available to the storyline.<br/><br/>The story is based around Susan who ends up as a giant mutant creature after being hit by a meteor. I found that the other characters, not just the main character each had their little quirks. Even Insectasaurus who doesn't actually speak was an adorable comic addition to the story. I loved all the monsters, I felt like they were what made the movie. Without their cute and crazy personalities you wouldn't have a movie nearly anywhere near as good as this actually is.<br/><br/>Also, seeing it in 3D was kind of weird because I'd never actually seen a 3D movie and when I put on the glasses there were things jumping out at me but they didn't steal the focus from the characters within the screenplay.<br/><br/>Finally, a well-done kids movie. Keen to see it again."

","Freddy vs. Jason, Alien vs. Predator and now... Monsters vs Aliens? No, it's not another brainless, cash-motivated horror icon mash-up, but a heartfelt tribute to those '40s and '0s movies where cult genre figures (Dracula, the Wolf Man and, uh, Abbott & Costello) ran into each other for no apparent reason. It's also Dreamworks' most accomplished feature since Shrek 2 (although Kung Fu Panda came pretty close).<br/><br/>The incredibly simple story goes like this: on her wedding day, Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is infected by meteorite radiations and becomes a 50-foot menace. To avoid mass panic, a certain General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) locks her up in a top secret facility with other monsters such as Insectosaurus (the name says it all), the blob-like B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), The Missing Link (Will Arnett) and Dr. Cockroach, Phd (Hugh Laurie). However, freedom is offered when an evil alien named Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) starts wreaking havoc and the planet traditional defences prove to be less efficient than expected.<br/><br/>Those expecting anything new will be sorely disappointed: Monsters vs Aliens is a 100-minute cliché marathon, from the Dr. Strangelove-inspired secret meetings to the typically moronic US President (Stephen Colbert), with the usual string of references (Star Trek and Close Encounters) and spoofs (Beverly Hills Cop and Mars Attacks!) coming along the way. But for once, the plot's weaknesses are actually a strength: since this is a homage to films that had pretty lame scripts, why should this one have a smarter story?<br/><br/>Then again, most people won't care about the plot: the real attraction is the 3-D. Impressive and breathtaking, yes, but as Jeffrey Katzenberg pointed out, the writers and directors were keen to shell out a feature that could be enjoyed just as much even without the funny glasses. This is accomplished through clever gags and even smarter voice casting, Sutherland and Laurie above all (""I'm not a quack, I'm a mad scientist. There's a difference."").<br/><br/>In short: this is fun and exciting all the way, whether you watch it in 3-D or not. Besides, what's not to love about a movie that contains the line ""Another UFO has landed in the United States, the only place where UFOs seem to land.""?"

Any of its flaws tend to gently fade into the background, and if you don't enjoy what's happening on screen, something more entertaining will be around in seconds.<br/><br/>This film is full of delightful B-movie references and some of the most satisfying role reversals and inversions of classic tropes I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The action scenes are fast-paced, coherent, and character driven, and well worth watching in IMAX 3D.<br/><br/>Susan/Ginormica may well be the best female action hero to come out of Hollywood in 30 years. She manages to be stay sympathetic and believable in a way the obnoxious Mary Sue powerhouses failed to be.<br/><br/>For most people, this will be an enjoyable action film. For hardcore fans of B scifi and schlock horror esoterica, it will be a deeply rewarding experience. The ending may seem trite, until you stand back and think about how this film's romantic subplot sets it apart from not just most action movies with a female protagonist, but a good bulk of contemporary cinematic history.<br/><br/>I would have given this ten stars if she had eaten Derek in the last scene."

I really didn't comment on movies in IMDb that much not because I don't love them but due to time constraints that I have. I personally think the comment I made should be fair to film itself as well as the audience. I love the way animator gave (human) expression on animated characters (or shapes). Just look Bob. It's just a kind of jelly. But throughout the movie Bob did huge work lord to entertain the audience. What a beauty of use of impressions! The story flow and language use is really good. This kind of quality can be expected from DreamWorks products. Let's see few conversations in the movie: <br/><br/>>>>>>>>> How many times do I have to tell you this. UFOs don't exist and we are never gonna see... Wow. It's energy. Signature is massive. Holy Jesus, what do we do? No one ever told us what to do. The only reason I took this job is cause you don't have to do anything. <br/><br/>>>>>>>>> I'm brave. I'm a brave president!!!!<br/><br/>>>>>>>>> Yes Bob. We are in the presence of the rare female monster. . No way.It's a boy. Look at his boobies.<br/><br/>>>>>>>>> Might we ask your name, Madam? . Susan.  No, no, no. We mean like your monster name. Like what do people scream when they see you coming? You know... like: "" Look out. Here comes... ""  Susan.  Really? Suuuusan. I just scared myself. That is scary. >>>>>>>> <br/><br/>I have enjoyed the impressions, the story, theme, language all the efforts so I gave my maximum in to this animation. Hope you all will have a gr8 time with this movie. A bit to add It's typical that we see criticize against any good movie. Some may argue the story line is poor or stupid. Common arguments may be the existence of monsters, the reality or even if monsters exist, why the hell we depend on them when we have powerful techniques.

Son: Good (Let me explain a little about his one word answer. My son is a very articulate, bright little boy. But for some reason, when it comes to using positive adjectives, he seems to only know one – ""Good"". And he uses it alone – no subject or verb as in ""It was good"" – just ""Good"". The only problem is that to my son, ""Good"" is used to describe anything from an ice cream cone to a trip to Disney World. What did you think about that pizza? Answer - Good. How was school today? Answer - Good. What would you think if I gave you a million dollars? Answer – Good. So take his ""Good"" as you will.)<br/><br/>Me (trying to drag something else out of him): What was your favorite part? Son: When Ginormica was busting through the wall.<br/><br/>Me: Was any of the movie funny? Son: Yes – It was funny when Bob got stepped on.<br/><br/>Me: What did you think of the 3-D effects? Son: Good. (See what I mean?)<br/><br/>Me: Would you recommend it to your friends at school? Son: Yes, it was really good (What? Really good? Where did that come from?).<br/><br/>There you have it – a succinct review from a reasonably typical 6 year-old kindergärtner. <br/><br/>As for me, the movie was only okay. The 3-D effects were often breathtaking. And some of the comedy hit the mark. I especially enjoyed Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach. But the plot was overly simple and very predictable. There were few if any surprises. And I really didn't like the way the monsters were used. They were often little more than comic relief and had no real purpose. So while my son may say ""Good"", I say ""Average"". A 5/10 from me."

","So, I saw Monsters Vs. Aliens not too long ago, and I can sat that I would've loved this movie more if I saw it in 3-D. It's not as if 3-D makes the movie, it just makes it better. However, since I saw it without 3-D, I was able to realize any cheesy and obvious pop-out effects, and there were only two effects like that. Seeing it in 2-D was fine though. This movie involves aliens invading Earth, and the government calls on a group of monsters to take care of them...I guess. Well, the plot doesn't really matter. I throughly enjoyed this movie, but little things annoyed me. First of all, there were a bit too many obvious references being jammed down your throat. Also, some jokes are bland and just...fail. However, some jokes are really cleaver and funny, and I think that kids will enjoy the...pretty colors and the adults will appreciate the humor. However, If you ARE an adult without children wanting to see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it's on DVD, unless it's in 3-D in your theater. <br/><br/>One final thought, this movie is comparable to Kung-Fu Panda, but in my opinion, Kung-Fu Panda is much better."

","I've read a lot of comments about this not being a Shrek, or whatever, but we are talking about this movie. Most of the trash that Hollywood puts out now days can never compare to Gone with the Wind, but we still go to see movies.<br/><br/>The voice cast was excellent. Hugh Laurie gets to use his real voice, something that most ""House"" viewers may never actually hear. And he makes a terrific Dr. Cockroach. Will Arnett plays Link, the big talk little action character which is perfect for Arnett who has played these types before. Seth Rogen is everywhere these days and his lovable buffoonish voice carries Bob the Blob quite well. He has such a command of the nuances of his character that even in voice role come out and make for a great job. Reese is great, she carries her role of a sweet 20 something trapped in the body of a 50 foot women with ease. Plus her tough girl attitude comes out strong and confident but never ""witchy.""<br/><br/>Keifer Sutherland proves that he can act just as well as an animated character as in the flesh. He nails his General WR Monger part perfectly, and even sounds a little like a combination of R Lee Ermey and George C. Scott. This helps when viewing the Dr. Strange Loveesque parts. (For those who can remember Dr. Strangelove)<br/><br/>Raine Wilson, Renee Zellweger, and Paul Rudd round-out the cast in great form as well. For those of you who are fans of ""The Office"" you should get a kick out of Raine's Mad Alien Scientist role.<br/><br/>Again, it's not Shrek, but there were things in Shrek that were sophomoric and rather stupid, but I still liked Shrek. The same goes here; there will be stuff that you may not like, but taken as a whole this is a fun movie. It's great with the kids, or just a couple of grown-ups wanting to escape the stress and doldrums of everyday living. I'll recommend this one to the family and friends for sure."

","""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is a bit of let down; we have become spoiled by the animators now putting together what has been a string of fine offerings in the past decade. This movie, like many, seems to have two parts; a vigorous first part and a more lethargic ending portion.<br/><br/>It starts off by showing us a bride-to-be having her wedding ceremony interrupted by the fall of a meteor whilst she is outside the church. The result of the exposure – she becomes a giant, and you can't help recalling ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"". She is forthwith whisked off to a secret government prison for other monsters. Some of the incarcerated monsters – and none of them have similar problems – have been there for many years.<br/><br/>An alien probe lands on Earth, and no solution can be found to deter them from destroying our planet. Finally an (overacting) general offers that the monsters in the prison should be used to thwart the invasion. This general character is too much remindful of George C. Scott in his role as Buck Turgidson in ""Dr. Strangelove"".<br/><br/>After initial attempts to repel the aliens fail, we follow the efforts of the monsters to put an end to the invasion. This is the second portion of the film and is not nearly as engaging as the first part.<br/><br/>Despite the rather saccharine lessons we are made to endure – why are we constantly lecturing to kids? – the overall animation makes this one worth watching.<br/><br/>Three Stars."

It is another generally funny family film by Pixar.<br/><br/>The next paragraph is just plot, if you know it you can skip to the third paragraph.<br/><br/>The films plot starts at the wedding of Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon), who is getting wed to a cocky news reporter (Paul Rudd) who has a long plan to become head anchor of a big city, instead of the small local community he conducts from currently, but when Susan is hit by a meteorite she grows 50-100 feet tall (I think its that tall) and is placed in a government quarantine by General WR. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland from ""24"") with B.O.B (Seth Rogan) a big blue blob without a brain, The Missing Link (Will Arnett) who is a lizard thing captured after terrorizing teenagers on a beach, Dr. Cockroach Ph.D who was a scientist studying how humans could become more like cockroaches but then becomes one and Insectasourous a huge and dumb animal but still lovable . Anyway eventually they have to take on Galaxar (Rainn Wilson) who is trying to blow up then world in return to have his own planet of clones.<br/><br/>OK out of plot time"

","Overall really good. I would say the best so far this year.<br/><br/>The animation is excellent (great faces by the way)plenty of laughs and a solid if slightly predictable plot.<br/><br/>It starts a little slow but it picks up as it goes along. Understandably some time has to be devoted to how it all begun before the action starts. The door is open for a second movie, we'll see how that goes.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I didn't see it in 3D so I cannot comment on that.<br/><br/>My kids loved it, I had a pretty good time too. It is definitely worth seeing by young and old."

","When California girl Susan Murphy is unwittingly clobbered by a meteor full of outer space gunk on her wedding day, she mysteriously grows to 49-feet-11-inches tall. Alerted to the threat of this new monster, the military jumps into action and Susan is captured and secreted away to a covert government compound. There, she is renamed Ginormica and placed in confinement with a ragtag group of other monsters: the brilliant but insect-headed Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D.; the macho half-ape, half-fish The Missing Link; the gelatinous and indestructible B.O.B.; and the 350-foot grub called Insectosaurus. Their confinement is cut short, however, when a mysterious alien robot lands on Earth and begins storming the country. In a moment of desperation, The President is persuaded by General W.R. Monger to enlist the motley crew of Monsters to combat the Alien Robot and save the world from imminent destruction. This film will make you laugh, laugh and laugh some more. Monsters Vs. Aliens 9/10"
"RainDogJr","Null","0","1","7 April 2009"," ""I think that Jello gave me a fake phone number""; Monsters vs. Aliens: 8.5/10
","I think Roger Ebert said just about right: ""Monsters vs. Aliens is possibly the most commercial title of the year. How can you resist such a premise, especially if it's in 3-D animation?"". Well in Roger Ebert's case ""very readily"" but in my case even with the fact that the trailer never ended to convince me that this movie was one of those that I must see on the big screen I could not resist to go and pay for the 3-D version of the movie. Hell I'm glad I came, I wanted to see this movie however for what I thought of it after seeing the previews I must say I found in Monsters vs. Aliens a real pleasant surprise. <br/><br/>I don't like to see dubbed movies, certainly only if the movie is in English or, obviously, in Spanish I don't read the subtitles (yes even that I don't write that well in English I do understand the I think 95% of a movie if I don't pay attention to the Spanish subtitles), certainly in Mexico, like I think in any other country, movies for kids are in its dubbed version in most if not all of the theaters. So yes I saw this movie in its dubbed version, thing that I really dislike especially if the people doing the voices are a******* like in this case but anyway I will see someday again Monsters vs. Aliens since I liked it a lot and I will see it in its original language to hear Seth Rogen, Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd and company. <br/><br/>Monsters vs. Aliens ends as you expected since always and ends leaving plenty of room if not too much room for a sequel, basically is just the beginning of the team of monsters that will defend the Earth of whatever comes to the writers' minds for the possible sequel or sequels. I didn't care that much about the plot, I won't mention it in this little comment; certainly the premise was just ""monsters vs. aliens"" for well whatever reason and yes all the monsters are really appealing characters. I like how it begins since is like meteor alert, normal day at a wedding and we have our 50-foot woman. There's the typical message, certainly the monsters will be seen as heroes but anyway B.O.B. (voice of, stoner, Seth Rogen) teals the monsters' show, this one is a terrific good-looking movie. Now I can't wait to see the new Pixar production Up!"

","Firstly the film: Brilliant film, not too much to think about. The animation was spot on and flawless as per usual from dream works.. Some very funny parts also, My kids loved it! so did I.<br/><br/>The 3D: I've never watched a film in 3D at the cinema before, and I was really really impressed. This film had them odd parts where things came out of the sceen at you, but it did hae a allot of perspective too, you forgot that you where watching a film on a flat screen..... For now on im going to watch every film I can in 3D... I hope the 3D catches on more with non animated films, terminator rev for e.g would bhe great in 3D.<br/><br/>Go see this film this easter! well worth the extra charges for 3D."
"meatloaf6","5","0","2","4 April 2009"," What a let down
","I walked into the cinema thinking that this film would be a decent movie- It wasn't a bad assumption, considering the great movies dreamworks have made previously like Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, even small soldiers. However after seeing the movie, i came out extremely disappointed. The film is basically something that you'll only sit and watch because you payed for it; and if you got a 2D ticket then all the worse- as the 3D addition basically makes this movie.<br/><br/>The jokes throughout the movie are pretty dumb and unfunny (i think i laughed at one maybe), with a lot of things that you've seen before in just too many movies. Bob the blue blob isn't that funny, the jokes you see in the trailer are pretty much all you get, and some of the things that happen in the movie are so utterly random that you think ""Why the hell did they even do that?"" It's pretty desperate- Just another tragic case of the film being more funny when it doesn't want to.<br/><br/>However i'm not going to completely wreck this movie. It did have its fair share of entertaining bits throughout; a lot of the kids seemed to find it funny... but they are easy to please. Normally a lot of kids film relate to kids and adults, with some humour that you can't believe got into a U-PG. However this movie is pretty much all empty, immature humour throughout.<br/><br/>Pity..."
"manikhero","9","0","1","4 April 2009"," It was totally Awesome, Cool and Comedy
","The movie was totally awesome, cool and comedy. All the monsters were cool, comedy and awesome. Gallaxhar was like a pucca villain. When, Ginormica is growing into a giant, that scene was awesome. Among the five monsters, Ginormica and Insectosaurus was totally awesome and cool. Even, the robot probe was totally awesome and it was outstanding. When, the robot probe is attacking Earth and when, the monsters are attacking the robot probe in the bridge, these two scenes were totally awesome and cool. When, Ginormica introduces The Missing Link, BOB and Dr Cockroach Ph. D to her parents, that scene was funny. When, Ginormica is chasing Gallaxhar and she breaks everything and she chases him, that scene was superb and it was amazing. When, the monsters are fighting with the guards of Gallaxhar, that scene was also awesome. When, Ginormica is skating on the cars and also she flies on small two planes, these two scenes are also awesome and cool. Even, Gallaxhar was also funny. After all, all the scenes in the alien spaceship, was awesome and it was superb. Even, the last scene was cool and outstanding. I should really appreciate the creators of ""Monsters Vs Aliens""."

","3-D technology has really taken leaps and bounds recently with the development of REALD CINEMA. No longer do you need those flimsy red and blue glasses, it's all done in the projection now, and eventually you'll have cut-to-size 3D compatibility with Iphones and Home Computers, in fact by the end of this year.<br/><br/>The movie begins with some exceptional 3-D, and any movie that features music by Journey can really do no more (Who's Crying Now? plays in the car when the probe comes to Earth). You might remember Journey has a song that plays during the credits of the 1982 film, TRON, sequel to come out in 2011. While playing cards we hear the song, ""Reminiscing"" by Little River Band, a song recorded in 1978.<br/><br/>Overall the film is cute, enjoyable by adults and kids alike with some really silly moments to keep you watching. The war room scenes remind me of Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove. This president keeps wanting to resort to nuclear war as a solution, and his general wants to resort to using monsters which have been kept under guard at Area 51 since the 1950's, holding an arsenal of monsters captured over the years, some you might recall.<br/><br/>Of whose voices which are played by some of my favorite actors including, Reese Witherspoon as Susan Murphy / Ginormica (Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman), the joke is that she's only 49' 11"" tall, Seth Rogen as B.O.B. (The Blob), Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach Ph.D. (The Fly), and Will Arnett as The Missing Link (Creature From The Black Lagoon).<br/><br/>It was also a joy to hear Keifer Sutherland, Wil Arnett, Rainn Wilson, Paul Judd, and Stephen Colbert as POTUS.<br/><br/>I'd recommend seeing it, but remember that now that 3D is on a hot streak and we've truly perfected this craft, expect to see more and better films to come."

","OK, this is a cute movie. It shows the importance of self-awareness and the beauty of friendship. But it's also a movie that has been done beforeI'm almost positive I've seen this story line somewhere else. Who cares!?! You have Seth Rogan (Knocked Up, Superbad), HILARIOUS! And you have Stephen Colbert (news-parody anchor of The Colbert Report) who is also HILARIOUS on his show. You have Dr. House from the show House as a cockroach, I mean we all know that House is an ass, but ya didn't know he could be a cockroach, did ya? You just have to get past another attempt on world domination or hostile takeover of Earth by alien(s). And I'm sure you can already think of a story where a there was a woman with low self-esteem who is involved with a self-absorbed guythen she discovers through trials (she at first prefers not to go through) that she was better off without him and that she was a lot stronger than she previous thought. Yup, we've seen it all before. But let's play again Sam and watch the movie, just remember it is rated PG some kids but not all of your kids should watch the movie. Enjoy!"

","MONSTERS VS. ALIENS (2009) *** (VOICES OF: Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett, Kiefer Sutherland, Rainn Wilson, Stephen Colbert, Paul Rudd, Julie White, Jeffrey Tambor, Amy Poehler, Ed Helms, Renee Zellweger, John Krasinski). Amusing animated valentine (in 3-D yet!) to the classic sci-fi/horror films of the '50s and '60s featuring a gaggle of monsters led by sudden giantess Susan Murphy (plucky Witherspoon making a fine action heroine) AKA ""Ginormica"" enlisted by the secret cabal of the US government/military ala Area 51, to stop an alien invasion instigated by megalomaniacal space case Gallaxhar (Wilson, having a field day at his most unctuousness). Referencing everything from ""ATTACK OF THE 50 FT. WOMAN"" (aforementioned Susan, the giantess, whose really 49' 11""!) to ""THE FLY"" (Laurie's maniacal yet practical Dr. Cockroach) to ""CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON"" (Arnett as The Missing Link), and to ""THE BLOB"" (Rogen's mindless, shapeless moving mass of ectoplasm steals the film every time he's on screen), with other nods to ""GODZILLA"", ""INDEPENDENCE DAY"" and even ""DR. STRANGELOVE"", the film has the right tone and pace of a send-up/homage to the genres and the out-of-this-world 3-D effects blend rather seamlessly to the point you kind of take it for granted. Fun for the whole family and hopes for a MVA 2: GINORMICA'S RETURN! (DIRS: Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon)"
"thesar-2","8","0","2","29 March 2009"," A Few Good Monsters
","What a joy 'Monsters Vs. Aliens' was. Especially on IMAX 3D, which given the choice, any movie that comes out in IMAX format and 3D, should be experienced like this. Was it comparable to 'Bolt,' 'Kung Fu Panda,' 'Ice Age' or any Pixar film? Not really, but that didn't make it any less fun, exciting, funny and a great homage to previous B-movies of decades past. There were probably 6 dozen references  you'll spend a great portion of your time counting or realizing all they're throwing at you. Or you can just sit back and enjoy the awesome 3D ride. (My recommendation, definitively see it in IMAX 3D. It's truly amazing in that format and worth the extra cost.) The actually basic premise is monsters shut away in a prison the size of Montana (or the Matrix's lair) until they're needed to defeat an alien hell-bent on retrieving an energy source that turned Reese Witherspoon's Susan into the almost-50-foot woman. The movie revolves around Susan, her new found powers/strength/height, but as usual in animation, the secondary characters steal the show. Though easily recognized by voice and humor, Seth Rogen's BLOB, er, I mean BOB was hilarious, as was Hugh Laurie's Dr. Cockroach. Kiefer Sutherland's General was funny, but seemed to remind me a lot of his life-action character from 'A Few Good Men.' Originality be damned and predictable as all Hades, I still highly recommend for all humans  it's safe for kids, and certainly entertaining for adults who remember the drive-ins of years past. (Funniest laughs involve the screaming woman at the old news reels, the evil laugh of Dr. Cockroach and any scene involving Bob or Insectasaurus. The (unfortunately only) two action scenes were inventive and extremely fun to watch, especially the Golden Gate Bridge.)"
"RichardSRussell-1","7","0","3","28 March 2009"," Not Intended To Be Taken Seriously  And That's a Good Thing!
","Monsters vs. Aliens is a lot of low-key fun, as a small group of pretty easy-going ""monsters"" are released from decades of secret imprisonment by the government and, evidently bearing their erstwhile captors no ill will, help the US (""the only country where flying saucers ever seem to land"") fend off an invasion from an evil alien overlord. The invasion comes in 2 stages: 1st a gigantic robotic probe that our heroes battle on the Golden Gate Bridge, and 2nd the archfiend Gallaxhar himself and his army of not very perceptive clones. A 4-eyed squid descendant, he's the sole survivor of his late planet, but he assures Susan, the 49'11""- tall woman, that she needn't feel sorry for him, since he destroyed it himself.<br/><br/>You might think that a woman of that height would dominate every scene she's in, but animation isn't limited in scale, and the folx at Dreamworks weren't just thinking big, they were thinking HUGE! Susan isn't even the largest of Earth's monsters; that would be the 350'-tall childlike Insectosaurus.<br/><br/>You might also think it would be a challenge to make the monsters (especially Dr. Cockroach and the slimy Missing Link) engaging and endearing, but Pixar showed the way back in 2001 with Monsters Inc., and this production is up to those standards in terms of both personality and technology. And the dimwitted but good-natured BOB the Blob is just a hoot.<br/><br/>The whole thing is played for chuckles, and they come at a nice, easy pace, not forced or frenetic. There are some good visual gags, too, including the president's big red coffee- dispensing button on the wall of the war room and BOB's romance with the lime Jell-O.<br/><br/>I saw it in 3-D (tho not in Imax 3-D) and thot it enhanced the experience.<br/><br/>I have lots more to say about 3-D (and I also lament the demise of voice acting as a career), but there's a limit on these IMDb entries, so I refer you to my blog for the rest of my thots on these subjects:<br/><br/>http://richardsrussell.livejournal.com/2009/03/28/"
