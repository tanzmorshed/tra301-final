"MartinHafer","10","264","313","2 June 2011"," Wonderfully entertaining.
","It's hard for me to review this film, as I have not seen a huge number of Indian films--probably no more than a couple dozen. Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.<br/><br/>Like so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since ""3 Idiots"" is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it's very long and involved and I could recount what occurs. But I don't want to spoil a single wonderful moment, so my advice is just sit back and watch--and if you give it a chance, I can almost guarantee you'll have a great time with this poignant and funny film. Wonderful and well worth your time--with a delightful script, wonderful characters and lots of moments that made me smile...and a few that brought me to tears. See this film."

","I asked my co-workers to recommend a Bollywood movie. I expected ""Dumb and Dumber"" by the title. It wasn't that at all. It is more of an inspirational comedy with some serious but good messages. A more accurate title would have been ""The Legend of Rancho"".<br/><br/>Odd to me is that they speak in part English, part Hindi through the movie, kinda like some speak ""Spanglish"" here I suppose. I know none of the actors but the acting was good, and there was plenty of humor. The characters were believable. Most movie dancing I find a little silly but I even liked the dancing routines in the bathroom.<br/><br/>I will be asking my co-workers for more recommendations after this one!"
"vvv832","10","140","170","19 February 2011"," ^_^The best film reflecting Asia's education ever!
","As many ordinary Chinese high school students,who have to study fourteen(14) hours every day for the college entrance examination in the final year,I was entirely shaken and moved by ""3 idiots"",sharing the same feeling with all the students from high schools and universities in China(or Asia). O(∩_∩)O Compared with mainland China,India is lucky,having less corruption in education system.<br/><br/>This film is incredible inspiring,especially for those who are struggling or ""survived"" in high schools and colleges.<br/><br/>I read some reviewer,some doubt whether suicide in the film is logical,which is really DISAPPOINTING! (—__—!)<br/><br/>If you experience the life in poverty areas in Asia,you will understand what a significant role the higher educations play in their lives. Burdening great pressure from family and society,they attach great expectation and significance to the enrollment of colleges,and they intend to abandon poverty by getting higher education.Diploma means everything for them. Thus,the plot where the man committed suicide after lost the chance to graduate is reasonable."

","Awesome film man. Saw this with my family in a theatre. Worth every penny n worth every minute. Never seen such an amazing film.
Its about the pursuit of happiness. 
What is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. The last 30 mins were beautifully shot. Very good direction by Hirani. The star cast is good n Aamir khan steals the show. This guy is the best thing to happen to Bollywood. The editing is top notch. U don't feel bore for even a sec.

"" Life is not about getting marks, grades but chasing your dreams"".. These are the golden rules which 3 IDIOTS teaches you in a very light and entertaining way.. The movie makes you laugh and in the process you learn many golden rules which can alter your life in a big manner...<br/><br/>3 actors from the path-breaking blockbuster RANG DE BASANTI( Aamir, Sharman, Madhvan) team up together with Rajkumar Hirani.. It couldn't get bigger! Loosely based on blockbuster novel ' Five Point Someone ' by Chetan Bhagat the movie deals with the present education system in India that whether getting more marks and better grades is better than gaining knowledge and is mugging up everything more useful than understanding it..<br/><br/>The movie has many hilarious scenes and everyone in the film form Aamir to Boman Irani to Omi Vaidya were superb in their roles.. Aamir has outdone himself.. Never in the film he has looked 44 year old... Film's music sounds mediocre but when viewed on the screen then the music sounds perfect.. Cinematography is awesome and so is the direction.. Raju Hirani's screenplay(you can easily ignore a few loose points) is a masterpiece and the film will achieve cult status for engineering students in a short period of time.. It has the soul which Five Point Someone had.. It is easily Aamir Khan's finest film to date.. The film's climax is fantabulous and is a shocker.. It takes everyone by surprise...<br/><br/>To conclude 3 IDIOTS has the potential to break all records and sweep all awards.. Watch it... You will Love it...<br/><br/>My Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Thanks and Regards"

","I'm an IITian myself and hence, needless to say, was looking forward to this movie as it is based on the life in IITs. I went with my family and watched the first-day-first-show and was I pleased ? In one sentence - The best Bollywood movie ever ! If you are into movies, then this one is not to be missed unless you are the 4th idiot. I cried, I laughed and I enjoyed every moment of the 3 hours that I spent watching this gem. The songs that seemed mediocre before watching the movie, feel like perfect for the movie. They are so ideal for the situations that I just loved them.<br/><br/>As you can understand, they could not bring the name of any IIT into the movie to avoid disputes. But trust me, whatever they have shown about the life in IITs, it's all true. Right from suicides, cold-hearted Professors to lack of encouragement and support for talents who can really bring serious change in this world. The movie successfully depicts how once inside, your life is only about meaningless grades, go get into the race before it's too late.<br/><br/>Take my free advice and avoid any reviews or words from people who have already seen the movie. Don't let anyone spoil any scene from the movie. Rush to the nearest theater and experience the phenomenon for yourself. You'll bless me for this advice !"
"vivee003","10","199","308","24 December 2009"," Aamir has yet again chased excellence & success follows him !
","Plot Two idiots Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman) sets outs on a journey to find their lost friend and the 3rd idiot Rancho (Aamir).. As the journey starts off, their college life and old memories of their friendship, with a unique free-thinker Rancho who inspired them and changed their lives, are unfolded through flashbacks and followed with some twists and turns...<br/><br/>My Views 3 Idiots looks at our educational system which pressurizes the students and does not allow to chose his destination by his own wish, in a satirical way and brings out some of the flaws in it... On parallel there is a love angle between Rancho and Pia (Kareena)... Many of the situations/characters have resemblance or inspiration to ""Five Point Someone"", blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat...<br/><br/>Both humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality rib-tickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feel-good comic caper is leading to its culmination, there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani...<br/><br/>Technically, it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography, the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualizations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...<br/><br/>Coming to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting, Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good...<br/><br/>On the downside, there are some unbelievable filmy situations which can be excused as writer's liberty and the episode of Mona's delivery was a bit far stretched.. Still these minor negatives does not affect this wholesome entertainer ! In short the basic theme of the movie is that ""chase excellence and success will follow"".. Just like that Aamir and Raju has chased excellence and success is following them...<br/><br/>So to sum up, Aamir and Hirani has delivered the best movie of 2009... Do yourself a favour by seeing this highly emotional and feel good comic entertainer...<br/><br/>Verdict : THE BEST of 2009 !

","I was lucky to see the first day show of 3 idiots on Thursday in Dubai. Well the title of this post says it all. The movie is an example of classic film making. brilliant and highly entertaining.<br/><br/>Watch 3 idiots for a) amir khan's incredible acting b) intelligent and highly energatic screenplay & direction (Rajkumar Hirani has done it yet again!) c) amazing chemistry among actors, d) some of the best comedy scenes coming from Indian cinema in a long time and e) a heart warming story which keeps you spell binded right till the end.<br/><br/>I would rate it as among the best from amir khan (which obviously means among the very best from bollywood. I would also give a lot of credit to the director rajkumar hirani, who after this movie (and his previous munna bhai series) should rank as among the top in bollywood too. 9/10."

","I'm from the Philippines. For years, I have always been curious about Indian cinema. I've seen clips of Indian films on cable TV and to be honest...I just don't get it. I don't get all the silly dancing and singing in almost all movies. I find it so corny and irrelevant to the story. But don't get me wrong, Philippine movies back in the 80's were also filled with corny singing and dancing. But we have gone past those and transitioned into movie-making based on good scripts...rather than cheesy story lines. <br/><br/>When a friend of mine recommended this movie, I haven't really heard of it. I thought it was a Hollywood release but it wasn't. It was a Bollywood movie. He said it was really funny, so out of curiosity, I got hold of a copy. <br/><br/>My first thought was that it was nothing but a silly story of 3 guys doing slapstick comedy that I have all seen before. When they started singing ""All iz well.."" I told myself... I knew it! Just what I thought.<br/><br/>But as the movie progressed...I was amazed at the intelligence embedded in this movie. I was so impressed with the smart dialogues delivered by Amir Khan. It was so mature and thought-provoking. The life crisis all of them were in... the pressures at school..the pressures from society and the pressures from family as well... they rang so true. I was even at one time crying my heart out. I can't believe it! All the preconceived notions about a Bollywood movie were obliterated. I was so moved by this picture and I have no regrets seeing it."
"sumanbarthakursmailbox","10","201","333","24 December 2009"," 3 idiots is a masterpiece and easily one of the greatest Bollywood movies of all time
","I saw the paid premiere of 3 idiots today.On the whole, 3 idiots is a winner all the way everythingwise.3 idiots suits the term 'landmark cinema' and has all it takes to help Bollywood take a giant step into world cinema with pride.3 idiots is a sparkling example of qualitative cinema.3 idiots not only entertains, it also enlightens.3 idiots is forward-thinking, but also makes you recall your roots. It promises lots of laughs and also a heartwarming message.There are movies aplenty, but very few remain etched in your memory and possess recall value. 3 idiots is one of those films. Indisputably and undeniably, this Aamir-Madhavan-Sharman outing is worth the price of the ticket and more.The film will set new records and has the merits to emerge one of the biggest hits of all times. The weekend business should be historic, the Week 1 business should be unparalleled, the lifetime gross should be amongst the biggest of all times. In short, 3 idiots has 'Blockbuster' written all over it.The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly, the story offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would unfold next.There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervals. You aren't restless. 3 idiots demonstrates how strong film-making can enhance and elevate an already solid concept.An Aamir Khan film is nothing short of an event. The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line.To sum up, 3 idiots is commercial Hindi cinema at its best. The film has 'Hit' written all over it. Let me put it this way: Cancel whatever you're doing today and go watch 3 idiots instead.Director Rajkumar Hirani strikes a fine balance between humor and emotions. The comic portions are executed with panache, the drama is attention-grabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moist-eyed. The marriage of humor and emotions as also technique and content is what drives 3 idiots to the winning post."
"StevePulaski","10","55","84","3 January 2013"," Scarcely has a comedy provided its audience with so much insight, intelligence, and human affection
","""All is well,"" the three ""idiot"" heroes of 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous, while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief.<br/><br/>But all is well, as they so often say. Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots, my introduction to the world of Bollywood cinema, is a comedy-drama unlike any one I've ever seen, long, but never drawn out, frantic, but never desperate, and emotional, but never manipulating. It provides us with three of the most likable characters of the last decade, and with insight to the culture of Indians and their parents. Rarely has a comedy had this big of a brain in its head and a canvas of opportunities in mind, while possessing a title not even fit for a farce.<br/><br/>Our title characters are ambitious but stunted Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), jittery, fearful Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and borderline prodigy Ranchhoddas ""Rancho"" Shamaldas Chhanchad (Aamir Khan), three close friends who attend the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE), one of India's most prestigious colleges where only the best are accepted. The young boys already are facing some of life's greatest challenges, all of them pursuing the field of engineering when the only one who seems to have a passion for the material is Rancho. Farhan was forced to become skilled in the field because of his strict father, and Raju is pursuing the field with the goal of getting his family out of poverty, with his father's expensive health bills, his mother's fragile core, and his sister's inability to marry all on the table. Rancho is studying because he feels that one should pursue passion and make a career out of it, so it doesn't feel like work. If you're passionate and devoted to your work, success will find you - yet this is only one of the countless morals and insights 3 Idiots provide its viewer with.<br/><br/>The film chronicles their issues in college in flashback, with instances in the presence popping up to show Farhan and Raju searching for their pal Rancho, who has disappeared and avoided contact for several years now. This is not your typical flashback film, however. It uses this method much to its advantage, and doesn't feel like a narrative within a narrative. It seals both stories nicely, but it takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotions through carefully constructed events before it even arrives at those endings.<br/><br/>One of their problems in college is the professor/dean of the campus, Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), who the three derogatorily call ""Virus"" when his back is turned. Virus is strict and often largely unsympathetic to the problems of his students, which allows the film to explore a dark topic one assumes a comedy wouldn't dare cross paths with and that is the issue of Indian teen suicide. One kid had his father have a stroke, rendering him unable to focus on academics for months, falling gravely behind. Virus is grossly unsympathetic to his case, denying him an extension on a project he's work so unrealistically hard on but can not perfect.<br/><br/>If anything, we can say 3 Idiots is a message to the parents of the Indian youth and that is to stop applying pressure to an already stressed out demographic. I've read several articles articulating the point that Indian teenagers are among one of the highest in suicide rates, and that many parents put an unrealistic amount of pressure, duty, and responsibility on the child to the point of a physical and mental collapse. You're given the unalienable freedom to raise your kids with the method you choose, but not every method is perfect, and when your method is one of the ones that leads to suicide, mental health problems, and perpetuates fear and anxiety in the minds of teenagers, then you may want to reevaluate your methods.<br/><br/>3 Idiots also provides us with the idea that many Indian children are told what to become in life early and are discouraged from exploration or even personal ambition. This I can't believe. What an unhappy, uninspiring, completely wasted life to slog through everyday doing something you loathe all because it was the lucky career choice of your parents. Yet I'm sure millions have been lead through this same life. It's the worst way of ""living through a person"" that I can imagine.<br/><br/>The film runs ten minutes shy of three hours, which for few viewers may seem too long and uncomfortable. I was skeptical myself walking in rather blind. Almost every Bollywood film I've conducted research on seems to run an upwards of three hours, some extending and testing the waters to roughly five hours. If other Bollywood works have characters drawn along the same lines of being relatable, human, and easily accessible and not biased towards race or social class, I can't see it being a struggle to get through any of the industry's films.<br/><br/>Through every quick-witted song and dance number, through every comedic scene, through every instance of dramatic despair, emotionally alive moment, solemnly poignant sequence, suspenseful setup, to a lovely, heartfelt conclusion, 3 Idiots is a wonderful, invaluable endeavor in the world of film. Its actors are beautifully fitting for their roles, assisted by a script so human and true to life that it is honestly hard to believe, and captured through beautifully alive cinematography to collectively give us a beautiful package not just in the figurative sense. This is arguably one of the best comedies I've ever seen."

","We saw a sneak preview of 3 Idiots last night at Globus Cinema in Bandra, Mumbai.<br/><br/>Brilliant. Simply, brilliant.<br/><br/>Simple but articulate story telling laced with lots of humour and lessons from life. A wonderful experience to watch as every single actor from Sharman, Madhavan, Boman, Kareena & Aamir deliver probably the best performance in a movie this year.<br/><br/>Sharman & Madhavan start off on a journey to seek out their friend Rancho. Together they were the 3 Idiots in college. And they take us the viewers with them on this beautiful journey with such warmth, panache, humour and love, that we don't want the journey to end.<br/><br/>Sharman really shows why he's one actor to watch out for. His acting genes come through in every single scene. He's perfect in his role. Sharman, you rock!<br/><br/>Madhavan as the guy who's chasing his father's dreams rather than his own is wonderful. The character who learns to laugh at life and it's ironies thanks to his friend Rancho. Madhavan shows his humorous side brilliantly savoring every scene and making it a pleasure to watch. His narration of the movie is very good.<br/><br/>Boman Irani is probably the one actor we take most for granted just because he's so brilliant! His characterization of the control-crazy, hyper-active, hyper-competitive, almost dictator-ish, college principal, is beyond words. He plays it so so well, that you love to hate him. He's that Good.<br/><br/>Kareena comes through in this movie as one of the finest actresses we have. No one else could have played her part and also looked so beautiful at the same time.<br/><br/>And now take it from a hard core Amitabh Bachchan fan, Aamir Khan is the best actor in town today after AB. Period.<br/><br/>His range is phenomenal and his characterization of 'Rancho' in this movie is positively brilliant. The small mannerisms, the walk, the smile, the attitude, the brilliance of a young person who's not restricted by the educational system, his positive attitude towards every thing in life, it's Rancho you are looking at. Not Aamir. <br/><br/>Aamir's ability to transform himself convincingly from the super-huge well-built temporary amnesia patient on a revenge spree in Ghajini to this whacked out college student, which is half the age he played in last movie shows his prowess as a master actor to transcend age barriers to play almost every role in the book.<br/><br/>This is THE best movie of 2009. Aamir again reigns supreme. Thank you Raju Hirani & Vidhu Vinod Chopra.<br/><br/>Cliché word, but I have to use it - FANTASTIC !! 10/10 <br/><br/>P.S. Don't forget to say 'Aal Izz Well'"

","I missed it during the 2010 Hong Kong International Film Festival and am really glad it is released publicly.<br/><br/>Haven't seen such a feel good movie for a long time. Excellent and inspiring plot with very positive messages and many hilarious scenes.<br/><br/>Inspiring messages and witty lines are dotted throughout the movie, intertwined with some teary scenes: all is well if you follow your passion; chase excellence and success will follow; be brave and follow your dream; think outside the box and be flexible.<br/><br/>It challenges our current values on education and success – that we should learn for the sake of learning but not for grades or what others want us to do. What's the point if you memorize everything but do not understand what it means and do not know how to put what you have learned into application? What an inspiring movie. It challenges your comfort thinking mode and urge you to be yourself and chase your dream/passion.<br/><br/>Excellent acting, colorful and typical Bollywood musical scenes with uplifting songs and dance moves, not to mention the soothing natural scenery interspersed in the moving episodes of friendship, love, family and playful/stressful campus life.<br/><br/>Every student, teacher, and parent or anyone who cares about our future should see it. What kind of world do we want to live in? What kind of person do we want our next generation to be? What kind of lives do we want to lead? This movie makes us ponder on these.<br/><br/>Somehow the movie echoed Steve Job's quotes : ""Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people's thinking."" ""Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."" Both Steve and the Rancho character (Aamir Khan) are smart and creative, nice and helpful to friends and people who are willing to learn. They are true to their feelings. They dare to challenge authority and encourages others to do the same. We need more people like these in this world.<br/><br/>Just go see it. You won't regret it."

","This is the first Bollywood movie I have seen. (I don't know if ""Slum dog millionaire"" is also an Indian movie or not.) I have learned from my parents long ago that Indian movies are excellent and full of dance scenes. They watched quite a few Indian movies when they were youngsters.<br/><br/>Then I had my first experience of watching a Bollywood movie quiet by accident. It was during the sports meet held by the school in which I teach English. I was appointed to do some work using the computer, which we would run some movies when we were free. And the first movie was ""3 Idiots."" I don't know who picked the movie. To be honest, I never would have picked this one myself because of its stupid Chinese title, which, translated back into English, is ""3 idiots who make scenes in Bollywood"". <br/><br/>I expected to see a movie that was funny from beginning to end and that could be enjoyed without your brain working too hard. It turned out to be way more than that. It's a movie that made me laugh uncontrollably at some points, shed tears at other points and think all the time.<br/><br/>It's about friendship, dream, love and college education. I think the best part is about college education. The situation depicted in the film is almost the same as in China. As a teacher in a high school in China, I know exactly what problems we have in education. What shows in the movie is exactly what happens in China right now. We attach so much importance to grades that teachers and parents will do anything to improve their study, which causes a lot of students' losing interest in study. I recommend all Chinese educators see this movie. I myself have watched it for at least 6 times, including those times I watched it in my class with my students.<br/><br/>I give it a ten."

Cancel anything you're planning to do till the 31st, watch '3 Idiots', it's worth your time and money. Hirani and Joshi's script is simply superb. Through Humor how many rights and wrongs are said. I really loved the way Hirani showed us Sharman's family. A typical 1950's family, it's hilarious as well as genius.<br/><br/>The film has Superb Performances: Aamir is fantastic as Funsok Wang Do. He's a delight every time he appears on screen and delivers his careers finest work. Maddy excels, he's astounding in the sequence when he shares his heart with his father. Sharman Joshi is good, yet again. Omi is a Masterstroke. A surprise packet, his speech sequence is sure to be remembered forever! Kareena is weak. Boman Irani is mind-blowing as the vicious head. He leaves you speechless in the scene when he awards Aamir The Pen. Mona is average.<br/><br/>The Music is decent, with 'All Izz Well' being a complete chart-buster. The cinematography is perfect. All other departments are satisfactory.<br/><br/>Watch this film right now..."
"Glock_Boy","9","22","36","3 July 2011"," Don't judge this book by its cover!
","This movie hit on all cylinders. It was fun, funny, deep, intelligent, thought provoking, and seriously entertaining. It is not a dumb comedy, rather a very smart (and humorous) look at the struggles of engineering students in India.<br/><br/>I thought I would have trouble with the subtitles, but after about 10- minutes I was completely 100% engrossed in the movie. The wife loved every bit of it.<br/><br/>My single and only criticism is the length of the movie. I believe there were one or two too many situations which kind of caused the movie to drag.<br/><br/>Otherwise I thoroughly loved it.<br/><br/>Do not be fooled by the idiotic picture on the cover of this movie. And the first 5-minutes of the movie are not indicative of the brilliance of the rest of the film. It is not stupid humor (even though I like stupid humor).<br/><br/>You will leave this movie being glad you watched it. Trust me."
"tianqiluo49","10","29","50","3 August 2013"," The only movie that made me laugh and cry so hard...
","As you can see, I'm a huge movie buff. However, my scope is strictly limited to English-speaking movies. In other words, I have scruples watching foreign movies in subtitles. Nevertheless, I'm completely in the state of idleness for the whole summer. What's even worse, I've run out of American movies to watch since I've basically watched every movie that suits my palate. A friend of mine hugely recommended this Indian movie for me to watch. I was completely reluctant in the beginning to say the least. The title sounds like a Jim-Carrey-parody-like comedy which nothing in it can be literally taken serious. On account of my preference for serious movies, I tend to ignore those ""silly"" comedies. However, my friend's non-stop imploring drove me nuts. To humor him, I decided to give the movie a try.<br/><br/>The beginning was kinda within my expectation. Two goofy ""idiots"" started to turn the world around them upside down by extremely over-the- top actions(stopping a flight, hitchhiking a limousine), they reached an observatory of The Imperial College of Engineering, aka ICE, their alma mater, to meet a friend they've lost contact for six years. Only to find another classmate, Chatur, who started to boast himself for his success over some guy named Rancho. Until then, I was feeling this movie was no different than any other comedies. However, the following sequences kicked in and I was completely blown away. It all started with a magnificent melody that unveiled the main storyline.<br/><br/>The main character, Rancho, was a guy who was enrolled in ICE. However, he was totally different than any other students. Instead of studying by rote like any other students, he focused more on the practical aspect of the knowledge. As a result, he was able to shock a bully in the groin with electricity. There was another student like him, who was working on his own helicopter project. However, their director, Virus(a nickname of course) wouldn't allow him to graduate. The heartbreaking rejection ultimately led to the student's suicide. Rancho realized the education system in India was extremely flawed. It suppressed the personalities of all the students, focusing on nothing but the grades. Rancho decided to step up against it. He kept challenging his teachers and even the director. He made 2 good friends, Farhan and Raju(the two goofy idiots in the beginning) and really inspired them. Later, he met a girl named Pia, who turned out to be the director's daughter. A lot of clashes occurred in Rancho's intent to change the education system and even his friendship was put to test. The ending of the movie was so touching that anybody would shed tears from their eyes, with a small twist that would made everything pleasant once again.<br/><br/>Overall, it's really a sweet movie. It can be a comedy at times, with a lot of over-the-top action from Rancho and his friends. However, it's a lot more than that. It's more of an insight into the education system of India, which is similar to those in the likes of other Asian countries like China, Japan and Korea. It can at times be so heart- warming that your tears can't help but surge out like waterfalls. It can be a musical too, with a lot of exotic dances and songs which are common among Indian movies. Great film. Totally change my impression for Indian movies. Easily 10/10."
"SunnyGolightly","10","31","54","19 May 2013"," Americans, Enough, This movie is that good!!!!!!!
","Well, at least it is in Asian's Mind. It's SO GODDAMN GOOD for Asians.You don't get the high school thing so you think it's overrated. Well, Dark Knight and The Avengers are overrated for us because we don't get the superheroes thing. But so what? Still, a lot of people love it, so Stop Taking Your Personal feelings as The Lethal Truth. <br/><br/>To make you understand better. Let me tell you something about the high school thing. If you have studied in Chinese or Indian High school you will understand what's all about the suicide and sad plot. Life was like a pis of sh!t. You have to wake up at 6:30 and go to bed after like 10:30, you can never choose your class, you can never say anything that against the teacher, you can never be in relationship with boys or girls. Right here, NO PARTY, NO PROM, NO NOTHING. All you have to do and all you can do is study and study, and the only way to make your life better is to get good grades. Because of the hard works and lack of fun, you're totally exhausted while the teachers and parents keep complains that you're lazy. And what's even funnier, is that 80% of what you have struggled to learn has nothing to do with your future life. So it simply sucks here.<br/><br/>That's why we love the film, it showed our mind, it's not a perfect movie. But it make us laugh and cry. This movie is 9.1 in douban.com(A Really Famous Website in China)<br/><br/>It's 8 out of 10 for us, and even for some of you. For some of you, it's 6 or 7 out of 10. So, it's 8.1 for average. NOTHING IS WRONG. <br/><br/>So, please, try to understand."

","When I was looking through IMDb's Top 250 movie list and saw a movie called ""3 Idiots"", I was surprised. Why would a movie with such a bad title be voted so highly? I went in thinking this would be India's version of Animal House or American Pie. But after watching the film, I was in love! It is so much more than the usual college story of young guys getting drunk, flunking classes, and getting back at their superiors. It is an extremely well-made film about doing what you love and facing your fears. The acting is incredible by the ensemble cast. The script is funny and poignant at the same time. Even the scenery is breathtaking. Although the length of the film is pretty long and has some quirky musical numbers, 3 Idiots is a delight. It is worth the watch!"

","If i could give this movie higher then a 10. I would. I think anyone gives this movie a low marking, should not be allowed to judge movies, maybe even keep them out of the theaters!!! This movie is funny, charming, loving, did i mention funny? Will make u tear from laughing as well as in other moments. One second you'll be laughing, and the next second you'll feel their pains. Lots of ups and downs. awesome movie........must watch for everyone.<br/><br/>Amir khan has always been great. Old classic movies to all the new ones. He has broadened his horizon. Amazing actor who plays serious parts as well as goofy roles. He kind of reminded me of Johnny Depp. Man is brilliant. The Dean of the school was also hilarious. I know that had to be a hard role to play, but wow did he pull it off.<br/><br/>Again, must watch for young, old, teens. If you have been through college, it will definitely hit the spot a little more.. Enjoy!"

","I checked this out on a whim from my library and was so impressed that I just had to come here to review it. Please note I am NOT Indian, but this is (as of yesterday) one of my top five favorite films of all time. My only criticism is the title - it's horribly misleading for American audiences who would probably expect a Judd Apatow nonsense film (and offensive to boot). Not so with this film - the characters are anything but idiots despite their college experiences. Brilliantly written and directed, there's something for everyone here: comedy, tragedy, and even a couple of song and dance numbers (seamlessly integrated). The acting is superb, the plot is a bit complex but fascinating, and it's shot with care and attention. LOVE IT."
"gothicangel_1990","10","16","28","16 January 2013"," A really fun and enlightening movie
","I've decided to start this review by describing what happened during the screening of this movie in one of my University class to demonstrate just how interesting this movie really is.<br/><br/>Our lecturer has decided to replace one of our classes on a weeknight and during the class, he has decided to show us this movie. The class started at 8 p.m. and as my class consist of students who are used to skipping classes (even the afternoon ones) or are prone to leaving early (including myself), I was expecting the class to be almost empty by the end of it.<br/><br/>By the end of the class, which was about 11.30 p.m., none of the students actually left the lecture hall because everyone really enjoy the movie so much and all of us wanted to finish the movie because it was fun, interesting and inspiring.<br/><br/>The movie has tackled an important aspect in the modern society: Why do we study ? Is it only for the sake of getting a well-paid job in the future ? Or was it for the knowledge or interest ? This movie had us questioning our purpose of studying and whether we are doing it for the sake of our future job, to fulfill our parents' demands and expectation or to feed our hunger for knowledge ?<br/><br/>All of us go to school for a different reason, some to make friends or to hang out with their friends, there are some who really enjoys learning new things everyday but many are those who go to school just for the sake of completing their studies.<br/><br/>The movie tries to bring out this point through humor, loads of them ! The movie is really funny and through unfolding the events by looking into the past and present, it avoids being too straight forward which in my opinion, keeps the audience interested in the movie without getting bored.<br/><br/>I really love the movie and has always recommended people to watch it, in fact, everyone that I know who have watched the movie loved it. This movie is really one of my favorite movies of all time."
"ctowyi","10","14","24","29 June 2013"," An undeniable masterpiece
","One of my students - a girl, once asked me how would she know if she has found the right guy. I told her I don't know how but I shared with her a method to sieve out the useless ones. Get them to watch 2 films with you and watch for their reactions. If the first reaction is ""I don't watch silly Japanese cartoons and musical Hindi flicks,"" discard them like used tissue papers because they are not worth your time. Why?  Because they already have deep-set perceived ideas and worse of all, they will not even give it a chance, not even for you. Then if they do want to watch them, watch for their reactions. If they give snide and self-important remarks, hello-goodbye them out of your life. The 2 movies that I suggested to her were My Neighbour Totoro and 3 Idiots. <br/><br/>I saw 3 Idiots again today and I am surprised it's only my second time. But it feels like only just yesterday that I got to know the 3 musketeers - Farhan, Raju and Rancho. I think that's one of the reason why it's so successful - their easy chemistry.  The 3 characters' arcs are so divisive (each focusing on different aspects of the pursuit of education) but yet so intertwined because of their deep friendship. At the end, I remember walking out of the cinema learning life lessons from a master. <br/><br/>This time round watching it at home, I realize why I love it so much. Most films only have one central theme and all the plot revolves around that. 3 Idiots has bigger aspirations - it was deftly balancing multiple themes. It didn't only delve on aspects of education, it also hit on subjects like superficiality, parenting, treating people right etc.  In my opinion, one of the reasons why the film succeeds is that it wasn't preachy. It didn't need 10 minutes to force the schmaltz down your throat, it just throws the idea out there and it hits home. Take a look at Jack Neo's I'm Not Stupid, same big subject but you will vomit out all the top-down schmaltz by the end of the movie. I think 3 Idiots realizes that these ideas for living your life and the pursuit of excellence are in all of our consciousness... We all know them but we just never act against them and allowed it to permeate our lives from way back.  The film only needs to throw out the ideas, package them in a fresh approach and it hits the home run. None of the ideas needed to linger longer than it was necessary. <br/><br/>I love the narrative structure which is actually a road movie.  Most directors will just do tough love in a linear manner. 3 Idiots uses flashback very effectively. If you think about it, we are only seeing Farhan's version of Rancho for 95% of the film. How do we know that's the real version? The real Rancho only appears right at the end.  The use of screwball comedy works remarkably well too. In fact, the tone switches like the mind of an idiot suffering from a tri-polar complex. For instance, in the ending of the second act, the birthing of Mona's baby in the midst of the biggest flood and rain. I loathe these birthing scenes in movies. Always feel like some fake big life affirming moment but seeing how it is handled here I am so awed. Not pretentious and look at how the tone switches like crazy - from sad (expulsion from ICE), to tension (no transport to the hospital and no electricity), to full-on problem solving (the theme of what education is for culminates here), to comedy, to celebration, back to total sadness again ('death' of baby) and to the closing metaphor of ""All Izz Well"". Freaking brilliant. It was then I realized the director builds up the ""All Izz Well"" metaphor all through the film until that point. And it didn't end there. That last speech by the professor to Rancho in the driving rain closed up, no, bookended what actually began in their first meeting where Rancho asks why didn't the astronauts use a pencil in space. This is what CLASS is about and this film has truckloads of it. <br/><br/>The only misstep for me is the romance angle between Pia and Rancho wasn't totally satisfying. Their cute meet is really awesome but if Pia has learned anything from Rancho, why would she still want to marry Mr Pricetag in the end?  I know it was just a narrative ploy to get all the parties together for the final journey to meet Rancho but it didn't feel right for me.  But really, I am just nitpicking. <br/><br/>I apologize if I let out some spoilers but seriously if you have not seen this, you must be the type of person that I mentioned about in the first paragraph."
"levuqchi","9","13","22","26 October 2013"," This movie is really meaningful to us Asians
","The very fact that the education system in my country (and perhaps in a lot of developing countries) SUCKS and as a student, I am seriously suffering from it, makes this movie worth watching. It gives me a little hope, a little faith, that success and happiness will eventually come to those who pursue excellence in stead of just focusing on their grades, their qualifications. I guess that many Western people cannot understand what Asian students like me are going through. We have to study all day, I mean, studying is not only a 7 to 5 ""job"" but it also deprive us of our sleep. The working environment is so damn competitive, our parents are like 'get straight A's or you will have nothing to eat' and the stress is unbearable. So, if you are having to deal with all these, give this movie a try! Good laughs, great messages, enjoyable story."

","3 idiots offers a great deal of fun. Indeed, one of the best movies I have ever seen! Its experience is simple, yet it's great in every aspect! I absolutely loved the fact that this film had it all, wonderful atmosphere, brilliant acting, lovely inspiring songs and a surprisingly thrilling story! During the movie, I laughed and cried A LOT!! The combination of the movie aspects was astonishing. I never thought I would enjoy an Indian movie as much as I enjoyed Slumdog Millionaire, but this one simply surpasses every other Indian movie. The story is touching, inspiring and funny.. at the same time!! This movie is plain FUN. It's about family, friendship and a little bit of romance. It had a great deal of great family moments that are still stuck in my mind till now (I saw the movie a week ago!) Plus it deals with friendship and its impacts on a person's life, and what a brilliant friendship story we saw in this movie! One of the greatest friendship stories captured on cinema mixed joyously with top-notch fun. I recommend this movie to anyone who actually wants to enjoy a real movie experience that has it all, in other words.. this movie is recommended for EVERYONE! <br/><br/>Acting: 10, Direction: 9, Soundtrack: 10, Story: 10, Overall rating: A decent 10!<br/><br/>Don't just rent it, OWN it and show it to friends who like to enjoy a fun movie!"

","Perfect. Almost. Oh yeah... those are the words! I'm writing this at the 8th hour of the morning of 25th December. Merry Christmas, viewers, this is the perfect treat. I was lucky enough to have caught a special preview of the year's best movie, 3 Idiots, last night. Aamir Khan fans, after a disastrous Ghajini, prepare to be truly delighted! He once again shows his 'perfectionist' attitude with this highly-anticipated soon-to-be blockbuster! It has EVERYTHING - from good humour, to emotions that actually move you. When a sense of fear is supposed to be created, it is created, and when you're supposed to feel good, you do! Remarkable performances by each and every one of the characters just adds to the entire effect. A nice-to-listen-to soundtrack assures you that even the song sequences aren't boring. And over that, such beautiful choreography! Witty dialogues and hilarious one-liners keep you wanting for more, and some head-bobbing suspense makes you wonder as well...<br/><br/>But, above all, above EVERYTHING else, what truly, TRULY makes this movie work is Rajkumar Hirani's brilliant sense of direction. How he cuts between the past and the present, at the perfect moments, is just amazing. With this, he could finally emerge as one of the leading directors of the country today.<br/><br/>3 Idiots is based on the book Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat, even though it's hugely different. And, for the first time in my life, I can proudly say that yes, finally, a movie has not just done justice to the book, but easily surpassed it. All thanks to Rajkumar Hirani. And proudly too because an Indian did it! I have to be strict... it's an Aamir Khan movie. So I have no option but to cut off 1 for the editing and dubbing errors.<br/><br/>9/10. What more do you want? Don't miss it for anything!"
"anudge","7","29","59","28 December 2009"," Good, but they overdid it.
","I was eager to watch this movie as the only bollywood films i like are those of aamir khan. When i saw the trailer of the movie, i thought that this movie could be the best of all time in bollywood, but it considerably failed to be. The plot was somewhat interesting , the cast was very appropriate, the acting was superb, the dialogues were wonderful , but the director maybe oozing with overconfidence, tried to put just too much in it. He tried to put it in ALL the good and bad things a teenager should do while he is in college. It was hard to identify the real protagonist in this movie, and even in the end i was left wondering whether raju was the man in the spotlight or aamir. What i hate to watch and hear is a meaningless song with meaningless lyrics and meaningless dance. And thats just what was very prominent in the movie. I don't understand the purpose of such futile non-sense, is it because people like it ? OH REALLY??? or is it because the director finds it attractive? attractive like - cow dung over cake.!? Another flaw i noticed was the change in character of aamir - from when he was a small kid to his teenage years. He looked and behaved like the most innocent one and out-of-all-activities one and later he became the most notorious and daring guy in college. Let the movie be pathetic or super-hit , boman irani was as always at his peak. His character was very well presented and he did just fine enough to make him the funniest as well as the most brutal character in the movie. The movie also had a lot of dramatic, sensitive scenes, at the wrong times, which did at times bring tears in my eyes, and left the other brain-left-at-home audience sob while staring at the screen. I wont say anything about Kareena because there isn't any need to publicize her flaws, there's a need to look for the minimal positivity in her enacting of her cameo. Rest was very appeasing , it was a pleasure to watch nonetheless, and the film was worth watching. 7/10"
"saumya14588","5","52","114","22 July 2010"," idiots...a lot of idiots
","I am writing this very late, even though I saw the movie on the first dayit took a second fast-forward viewing on my laptop to compel me to opine on this film. And since brushing through the comments, I found a lot of good stuff written about it, I'd like to skip over the brownie points the film certainly deserves and focus on what I found sodisappointing.<br/><br/>1) sigh, the jokeswhat to say, I actually felt embarrassed listening to them and hear people guffaw on stuff that evoked chuckles in the 70s. 2) over the top scenes which were just not required- Rancho taking a bath in the garden(!) in front of everyone? In most good institutes even walking on the grass is frowned uponn here this chap doesn't mind spoiling the soil with his soapy water. (This is what annoys me about characters portrayed as non-conformists. They confuse it with plain indecency and ludicrousness, like when Patch Adams bared his bottom after getting his degree); n driving the scooter into the hospital itselfwhy couldn't he just stop at the doorway n make it a genuinely good shot??? 3) The timeline was all wrong; did no one do math at primary school? Farhan says they hadn't seen rancho for 5 yrsramalingam returns after 10 yrs to keep the betno one saw rancho after college finishedengineering is 4 yrsthe bet could not have been made before the second semester as they already have had at least one semester exams!!! Simple math will tell you its all goofed up. Kareena kapoor was engaged when these guys were in 1st-2nd yearso she waited 8 years to get married??? If that banker guy was so considerate and patient, he is the real hero 4) Anybody who has lived in hostel with room mates will tell you that in 4 yrs together, you get to know every minute detail about you buddies; these guys didn't even know rancho's hometown! 5) And these supposedly bright engineers and the doctor Kareena don't have even enough brains to look up the college records to find Rancho's address? They could have at least asked Boman Irani, who would have certainly known it considering he knew Chachad's monthly income! 6) Even with that lame, copied joke 'Do you know who I am', they are just ridiculing their own film; is it so difficult for a professor to find three students of a class whose faces he has seen from the college records? A cheeky antic like that would have meant instant suspension in a real IIT. 7) Hirani's idea of ragging is based on the fairy tales boys brag to wide-eyed fifth-graders; you just cant survive in a hostel if you electrocute a senior's winkie on you first day. I'd have loved it had they shown Rancho getting a beating from seniors in return for his actionsit would have truly highlighted the ragging problem. Instead they showed the whole bunch of seniors running scared on seeing a baby-faced fresher with a live wire. 8) And oh, they took the peeing joke too far, too many timesits disgusting. Ramalingam, a VP of some MNC peeing on a school building? Come on 9) I understand that the ridiculous arrangement barred Rancho from keeping in touch with any student from ICSbut what about Kareena? Was his love so shallow he didn't give a damn about her just to honor some crazy vow which didn't even involve her? How are they showing Indian women? She has no self-respect? She runs away from her wedding, betraying a guy who waited 10 years for her to a guy who left her in a heartbeat? And is it unnatural or materialistic to scream if someone spoils your 2 lac wedding dress or loses a 3 lac watch??? Again the problem with execution of an idea; there were a thousand better ways to expose that guy's shallownessbut all what rancho and his pals did was irritate him by damaging his property. 10) And the law breaking, which when done with timing looks good was just taken too fargetting an international flight stopped, fooling a taxi driver who'd probably lose his job, leaking university paper- they are criminal offenses-why do you need to portray new age thinking with a disdain for the law? 11) And finally even if we forget the fact that any decent college has a medical attendant, a health centre and generators always present to accord a movie a spicy climax, hirani spoilt it with the all-is-well cliché. Cant just one thing be normal?"
"RoundhayReviewer","7","25","50","17 February 2010"," Great Entertainer / but Story and Character holes
","3 Idiots is way too short a movie, which is simply another way of saying that it is an extremely entertaining movie! Raju Hirani has served an hat trick. Three great movies in a row. Raju has brought his Gandhigiri to the world of education, this time the Gandhian is Rancho.<br/><br/>Acting is great by Boman Irani, Sharman Joshi and the best Omi Vaidya or Chatur, without whom 3 idiots would not have been what it is.<br/><br/>Its almost impossible to find any significant deviations to excellence when you have a team like this one. Raju, Boman, Aamir, the perfectionist to name a few.<br/><br/>But there were a couple of things under the surface that disturbed me a little bit.<br/><br/>To start with the easy one, When you anger your senior in the first 5 minutes of entering the college, you know for sure it cannot end there. So from that point of view, the ragging scene mysteriously ends prematurely. Another one is, Boman Iirani or Virus knows Rancho's dad's monthly income but not his address? They spend 10 years searching for him, why didn't they check the college register?<br/><br/>Now for some serious ones.<br/><br/>I like Aamir Khan movies because you never ever ever see Aamir, you only see the character he is playing, which is exactly how it should be. Unlike Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan movies where you see the movie stars instead of their characters (exceptions apply of course, for example in ""Chak de India"" you couldn't find Shah Rukh even if you wanted to). In 3 idiots, I got to see Aamir Khan more than a couple of times and I was surprised. That got me thinking, why would our perfectionist entertainer allow for something like this.<br/><br/>The plot thickens and the mystery deepens. Hmmmm. So I dug deeper and eventually hit the gold mine. Its not Aamir, it's his character Rancho which has a fundamental flaw that even Aamir could not overcome. Rancho is projected as someone who loves to learn, he wants to take in every ounce of knowledge he can absorb for any source possible. But his actions are that of a revolutionary, from teaching the director on how to teach to mocking the definitions of machines and books. On one side he is a sponge, an introvert on the other hand he is a rebel, and extrovert. These opposites needed reconciliation in the story.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the way, even meanness crept in. I am referring to Chatur's switched speech. Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed every bit of that scene. But that does not mean that it flowed with Rancho's character. I think the writers mixed up Aamir's earlier characters, Aakash from Dil Chahta Hai would do this in a heartbeat, DJ from ""Rang de Basanti"" would probably go one step beyond, but not Rancho and definitely not for a ""demo"". Rancho is pure, or at least that's what Raju is portraying him. The same goes with the climax. Now, even though, all of us cheered when Chatur got shafted towards the end in a strange twist of fate. Some how I had a hard time believing that filing 400 patents and signing with the Japanese gel well with this Gandhian educator.<br/><br/>Aamir, in his interview, mentioned his approach to looking young in the movie. His pacings, mannerisms, style of dialogue delivery etc. He executes brilliantly on them.<br/><br/>Madhavan is decent. He could have been much better.<br/><br/>Omi Vaidya, or Chatur, is the real find of this movie. Hope to see more from him.<br/><br/>One additional aspect which is not easily apparent is that this is one of the few movies that projects intelligence with the coolness it deserves, and not in the traditional Hollywood style of nerd portrayal. This is a better role model for students. Towards that end it is on par with Matrix.<br/><br/>To make it clear, this movie is vastly more entertaining than most of the movies of 2009. But I am not comparing this movie with other movies, that would be like comparing apples with windows. I am comparing this to other Aamir and Raju Herani movies. And in that comparison, this does not shine as bright.<br/><br/>______________________<br/><br/>Now, here's what I would have changed if I was in control.<br/><br/>* Raggers are caught by the director and are convinced without any ""pressure"" not to rag any more * Reconcile Rancho's character's fundamental flaw, requires serious deep dive * Motivation for Chatur's speech prank redone, maybe not even instigated by Rancho * Some better reason why nobody can find Rancho * Redo the Javed Jaffery scene where he talks to his dead father, turning the tables to show that Javed actually wanted to take his father to Disney Land but his father kept on insisting that they wait for the highway contract to go thru. That would be hilarious. * Sharman Joshi's family is so central to him but are missing 10 years later, in the starting scene, some how bring them in. Maybe his wife is on the phone talking to his sister, happily married in Bombay, when she yells ""No Pants"".<br/><br/>This review was originally posted on my blog: http://roundhayreview.blogspot.com/2010/01/3-idiots.html"

","Finding this movie and checking out the ratings, I was left a bit confused and wondering whether or not they came from all the Indians watching it. As it turns out, they didn't. This was an amazing movie, a movie that tackles more than one topics but focuses on the anxiety of young people studying, wondering what they are going to do with their lives. <br/><br/>This is a global phenomenon and this is a great movie to watch early in your lifetime. I am not 20 or so, but it still taught me a thing or two and allowed me to objectively assess my situation in my work. I loved it. Humor is there in large doses, the scenery and landscapes are amazing and the movie is optimistic but also realistic at points. There are moments in the movie when you're laughing and in an instant you may find yourself crying. <br/><br/>It was long but justified to be and it was never tiring, not at any point during the film. The actors were just brilliant and I think that this is one of the finest movies on Indian culture I have ever seen. If you also managed to miss it as I did, when it came out, now's the time to look for it and rent it. It's a must!"

"bkrauser-81-311064","9","12","22","10 January 2014"," The Fun Side of Bollywood
","There was an article published by Time magazine some years ago. It explained that while China enjoys a robust population and a rigorous educational system (for those who can afford it), the spontaneous and creative aspects of Chinese culture has been subverted. It's been marginalized so much so that American business specialists have been asked to speak at some of china's most prestigious companies to ""teach"" creativity. The article presumes that Chinese middle-managers have had so many concepts and facts drilled into them in school that they are unable to think outside of the box like Americans.<br/><br/>Subtle racism and cold war paranoia aside, the article does have a point when it comes to the importance of academic memorization versus creativity. American public schools have been drawing and redrawing that line trying to find the right balance to mold the leaders of tomorrow with mixed results. Yet when I hear stories of a fifteen year old inventing a new groundbreaking cancer test, I can't help but feel a little prideful of being the partial product of American schooling.<br/><br/>But while the Chinese seem to be stumbling, India has really stepped up, or at least the film 3 Idiots (2009) would have you believe it. Starring Aamir Khan as the amiable Rancho, the plot of 3 Idiots sounds like a Van Wilder (2002) rip-off. The brilliant but unorthodox Rancho causes mayhem and silliness at an uptight engineering university. His two friends Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi) join in the revelry to the dismay of the pig-headed dean known to the students as Virus (Boman Irani). But when Rancho takes interest in the dean's daughter played by Kareena Kapoor, the dean vows to have the 3 idiots expelled for good.<br/><br/>Bollywood films are very good at taking seemingly trivial plots like the aforesaid and escalating them into gorgeous, high energy, thematically complex tales for which 3 Idiots is no exception. The movie encompasses a vastness of emotion and a breadth of themes which I do not dare expand on here for fear of ruining the movie. I will say that 3 Idiots does further validate my hypothesis that a major theme in modern Bollywood is upward mobility. While my familiarity with Indian film is limited, all the films I have seen made over the past twenty years involve a protagonist unhappy with his or her station in life and works their butt off to achieve better, often through creative means.<br/><br/>I saw this theme in the repellently named Wedding Planners aka Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) and the silly sci-fi comedy Joker (2012). Even the sappy love musicals of Yash Chopra like Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) have characters who want to do better largely by questioning the conventions of traditional ways. 3 Idiots is an extension of that proud tradition only done with excellent comedy and some surprisingly depth along with some catchy musical numbers.<br/><br/>Stop to consider today's modern American films in comparison. Sure there are classic hero journeys in movie theaters but few have unadulterated happy endings quite like Bollywood. Many settle for the moral of ""do what you can,"" or ""you can be happy with your lot in life so long as you have someone to love"". And let's not forget the common contemporary comedy message ""have fun and worry about the consequences later."" These messages make sense in the economic malaise of the day and the superhero genre has replaced the musical comedy as far as being a glitzy distraction for the masses. Still the superhero films as well as the Oscar-bait of the last few years don't have the subversive themes of their Indian counterparts. Nor to they have the energy! The energy in 3 Idiots is so incredibly infectious, if you're not smiling in the first five minutes you might need defibrillation. Seriously call a doctor, you're legally dead.<br/><br/>Those who are worried about China's looming domination of Asia and eventual world power status need not worry about it. If I were worried about any country flexing its muscle it'd be India. It's a polyglot, multicultural nation with English its language of commerce. It's got a huge, pro-democratic population and has the creative juices to pull off long-term economic and cultural growth. But don't lose any sleep over the decline of the American Empire, at least our overlords will be benevolent or at the very least hilarious.<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"

","'3 Idiots' tried to walk the same path as Hirani's debut 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.' but while 'M.B.B.S.' was entertaining in parts and stays consistent, '3 Idiots' is a mess. The film itself lacks direction and the story tries to tackle too many issues, each of which are poorly and superficially handled. It is easy to notice that the film tries to be another 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.'. While some of the jokes are funny, most of them are ripped off from unacknowledged sources (mostly European commercials). I suppose it's become a new trend in Bollywood to rip off old and obscure commercials since the writer lacks an original idea. The songs are easy on the ears but forgettable. Aamir Khan is miscast. He is too old for the part and does not convince at all as a university student. Madhavan too looks old for his part but not as poorly cast as Aamir. Sharman Joshi may look the part but he does overact. Boman Irani is irritating and Kareena Kapoor is strictly average. I'm surprised that so many people are calling this the best movie of the decade. '3 Idiots' is bad."

","When I look back at the films I've watched working my way through the top 250, and I see the over rated bollywood films, I feel a bit of shame for the few of these I watched before realizing none of them belonged on the list. There was all the promise of a top 250 film. After all, it was on the list, it had the rep. But then the experience of watching was painful. It felt wrong. Not like a top 250 film should. At first I thought there was something wrong with me. Maybe I just wasn't doing it right. But then in the end, after asking around, I realized that this film was just awful, and it had played the exact same trick on countless other viewers. Don't be a victim!

","Being an Indian I have seen a lot of Bollywood movies which do not live upto international standards. 3 Idiots is no different. It's a masala movie, which will draw only mainstream and dumb folk. It might be attractive to the viewers outside as such experiences are new to them, however the truth is that this movie doesn't deserve any place in any top lists on IMDb. I'm sure that the people who have given it a 10/10 have never seen any other movie on the top 250 list. It was a major hit in Indian theatres and any rational,logical and a real movie buff can never like this sort of an impractical movie. To be honest, for an Indian movie I'd give it a 6/10 , however on an international scale it would barely get a 5. If you want to watch a good Indian movie, I'd recommend watching Dev.D which I rate as an 8/10; and I feel should be on the top 250 list. Make a wise decision"

","The last one month, movie lovers enjoyed best movies like PAA, AVATAR, and now 3 idiots. these three movies are having different genre but provided best entertainment. 3 idiots is also good movie but not the best as per my view. Acting wise Amir khan is best. sharman, r. madhavan , kareena,boman irani did fine job too. Now where i differ others is the whole idea of movie is adaptation of MUNNABHI MBBS on different background. After interval the movie is like munnabhai MBBS part 2. same situations and scenes. when i came out of the hall i felt like director decided the start and end of the movie first, and then wrote the script, created the situations, characters later. This is my opinion of the film, this may hurt others but when i think about it as Rajkumar hirani film. I don't expect the same tried and tested scenes in his movie. For me the second half of movie was weaker part. <br/><br/>I hope Rajkumar hirani and abhijat joshi will work on better scripts next time. Overall the movie is timepass and watchable but not the masterpiece, we have seen better work from Rajkumar Hirani in his first two movies"

Have we run out of jokes, with all these laughter challenges and standup fresh material, we need to use, how does a induction motor start? This is three smart guys, thinking audience is a bunch of idiots. It is a run of the mill, bollywood, melodramatic, no substance, BS....are they running out of slapstick, that they had to try the peeing scene twice or did they like the joke soooo much? Besides, Boman Irani, who takes his every role seriously and delivers top notch performance, and does it professionally, the rest is run of the mill. Just because you make posters that look like tarey zameen par, the movie does not become one. You know what is funny? Khan says do not be pressurized to deliver, and do your own thing....but looks like he is so pressurized, and he cannot do anything different, and keeps falling for Mr Ideal, and student....<br/><br/>Mr Khan...when you start making smart movies, do not for once, assume the audience is dumb or idiots. WE have the rest of the 99 movies already doing that...and if the movie is not ready, let us wait.... sucking a baby out with a vacuum that runs on car battery based inverters....hmm....400 patents....and you want us to believe.... why did the lap top screen go off, when the power went? I thought they work on batteries?

","I loved this movie, it was a very smart and enjoyable movie despite the length. I loved the characters specially Rancho, Pro Virus and Silencer. I am not a fan of music in movies but I loved the music in this movie. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the name: 3 idiots is not appropriate, it should have been ""Looking for Rancho"" or ""Al-its-wel"". Another thing was It doesn't explain much about why Rancho ran away from his friends and his love, it never explains why he couldn't express his love. You can sort of figure it out at the end of the movie, but is not that clear. Well despite all this it shows Hollywood that a movie can be funny and smart at the same time, and a college movie doesn't have to be about stupid humor, booze, bombshells and boobies."

","This was a good year for Indian cinema, with movies like Dev.D,Gulal, Siddharth: the Prisoner and Kaminey giving a new direction. I was expecting that 3 idiots will be like a Lassi after having a spicy Panjabi Dinner but alas, Aamir disappointed once again. I do not mind losing my 200 bugs, but surely mind losing my precious hair. This movie is very loosely based upon Five point some one and has done balatakar of it. <br/><br/>you will feel sleepy after listening Aamir's boring lecture about, life and education. He makes extra efforts to look like a student which unfortunately failed miserably. <br/><br/>In the first half in a scene Aamir goes to one of his room mate's home. That scene makes such a mockery of their poverty that i feel like slapping the director. If that scene is not enough to cause headache, than baby delivery scene in the second half surely does. <br/><br/>And than comes the Aamir's great invention, making a inventor for the cars batteries, wow that will make even Einstein proud. The only positive thing about the movie is some two or three good one liner and two songs."

","The movie is supposed to be based on Chetan Bhagat's guideline for IITs Five Point Someone.It not entirely true to it.and in the end it does take a turn that is reminiscent of the ever loving Shawshank Redemption in more ways than one.such as Sharman Joshi's candid confession in an interview besides the end!<br/><br/>The film manages a comic depth,what it, at much of the times lacks is emotional depth.It treats issues too naively perhaps.It creates caricatures out of Bhagat's characters.it does hinder character development.Boman Irani's Dean Viru Sahastrabudhhe(VIRUS) did remind me of his own Dr.Asthana in Hirani's debut Munnabhai M.B.B.S. Asthana's funny guffaws were character traits but Virus hasn't any he tries to be whatever is required.He is funny,he is ruthless but never as formidable as Asthana. 3I is not par stereotypes thus is predictable.It also delves in silliness and goes from melodramatic extremes to comic extremes in seconds.<br/><br/>But all said the movie is just too funny. I have not laughed so much in days.Its certainly written better than the novel(apparently not a difficult thing to do).Lead Performances are very good too.In the end its easily lovable but forgettable unlike LRMunnabhai.Its not at all a bad movie but maybe just not brilliant.Lead Actor's own Taare Zameen Par would be a brilliant document on education system.<br/><br/>I rate it 7/10."

","After some really bad experiences with Hindi Movies especially Mangal Pandey, I stopped watching any Hindi movie during first 3 days of its release and normally downloads them from internet except Aamir's movies. Though I have been eagerly waiting to watch 3 Idiots but still I read some 6-7 reviews on different websites before going to the movie. All of the reviews were positive so I decided to spend my money this time on theatre on first day first show.<br/><br/>Pros<br/><br/>1. Lots of hilarious scenes <br/><br/>a. The Teacher's Day speech By Omi: Even if I give you the whole script of the scene, I can bet that you will definitely burst out laughing while watching this scene (an aged sardar had to go out of theatre because he couldn't handle so much laughter in the scene) . b. Scene at Sharman's house where these 3 had dinner<br/><br/>c. Kareena's Sister wedding scene<br/><br/>d. And lots of one liners too<br/><br/>2. Awesome acting by Aamir After watching Ghajini, you will be amazed to see how this guy managed to transform himself into a 20+ college going student and actually looks like one. The spontaneity especially in the scene when he talked to Boman Irani during the cremation of a student makes him the best actor bollywood has ever produced 3. Camaraderie between Aamir, Sharman and Madhvan<br/><br/>After RDB, this triplet has done it yet again!! See the scene where they are drinking on stairs and Sharman and Madhvan challenge Aamir<br/><br/>4. Chemistry between Aamir & Kareena All efforts goes to Aamir for this who manages to look so young that this pair never looks odd and chemistry between them was also amazing<br/><br/>5. Realizations in the characters All the characters except Rancho (Simply because I haven't find or heard of such a genius till now) in the film seems real and you can relate them to one or other in your real life. This brings the film all the more close to your heart<br/><br/>6. Message of the film A well-deserved strike on the existing education system where rot learning has become part of the life of every student (including myself who followed the blind race of Engineering & MBA without knowing what I really want to do) <br/><br/>7. Finally, each and every character in the movie fits in his/her role and has gone their true potential. There are many scenes to see that too like Sharman's dilemma and breakdown during one of his interaction with Boman, The way Boman's carries himself as an intelligent but cynic principal, Omi's character etc.<br/><br/>8. Songs<br/><br/>Honestly telling, before watching the movie I didn't like the songs very much but after the movie I am in love with them especially Give me some sunshine, All Izz well and Zoobi Doobi<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>1. Kareena eloping from her marriage<br/><br/>This seems a little bit dramatic in an otherwise realistic movie but considering the whole movie I can bear with this five minutes part and in fact going by the reaction of other audiences, you will love this scene also. <br/><br/>2. Mona Singh Delivery Scene<br/><br/>Again, the thing which was indigestible for me was how a person can manage to create a suction device via a vacuum cleaner in such a short time and that makes Rancho an unrealistic person but I guess this is Indian Cinema and no movie can be a complete reality (this applies to Munna Bhai Series, Aamir's all movies, in fact I should not be talking about realism in Shahrukh's movie) <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is worth every single penny of your ticket and you won't regret spending even 300 bucks on this movie. This is guaranteed!!"

Not many movies can do that. There are 2 or 3 scenes that I adore, and then there are others, flawed and all.. but still this movie is just special.

Looks wise at first you would think hmmm maybe not so much; but that girl has a spark that you will not find. I saw her in one other movie and so I knew what she could do, and surely as movie rolls along , she adds her sparkly personality and lifts the movie a notch higher. Aamir Khan has become my favorite Indian actor, and is perfect in this, and the professor is also such a good choice! Just wow! Why do I go on and on about the cast, because this cast made the movie what it is. It's not about how well you act, it's how well a role you are put into based on who you are. A super good movie!

","It is only if I had not lost my movie sensibility, I would have been placed better. The best part about India is that everything has a following and Aamir Khan with his histrionics and verbal spats is in the midst of a great purple patch. Everything he is touching is turning into gold and it takes a modern day genius to do that. He is more like a good salesman then an actor. If you can sell the same college song after 21 years, you sure have to be awarded the best salesman in your industry. Well, the real disappointment is not Aamir, as he frequently makes bad movies...Fana and Ghajini to name just the latest 2 but he also carves out little gems like Taare Zameen Par every now and then. And the disappointment is also not from the fact that he is still playing the college Romeo. The disappointment is with Raj Kumar Hirani who in trying to accommodate Aamir's star power did what Shubhash Ghai did in Yaadein. The Box office verdict has been starkly different for both the movies because young India connects to the message of 3 idiots well. Critics with a few exceptions did not speak their mind because they knew that this movie was going to do colossal business. But the fact remains a fact....the ending was manufactured and seriously pretending. It was like that the script writer was superficially trying to make everybody smile while walking out. It is the first time Hirani has erred and hope that he does not slip again, as he has given 2 most memorable movies in recent memory. This does not even come close.

Now for the movie - which starts in an engineering college in India, goes on to show the lives of three of its students through the years till they graduate. This being a Bollywood film, obviously has a smattering of romance and song and dance sequences. Right from the start where Aamir jaywalks into the college building without a care in the world to the time he starts questioning the teaching methods in class, its just a matter of a couple of days. Some cheeky guy this is! Unfortunately, all his antics and funny lines are as old as the college building he is in. You would have heard these jokes a hundred times over. Anyways, that is the best part of the film since it at least elicits a few laughs. The rest of the 3 hours is filled with stereotypes and melodramatic scenes which are ridiculous at best. It seems that these days in India, anyone who can make the audience cry can laugh all the way to the bank. Aamir has this knowledge and isn't afraid to use it."

Rancho, the legendary guy, happens to leak his whereabouts when Chatur declares victory over the other 2 idiots, and they happen to seize the opportunity to make the real Rancho spill the shameful truth, and Pia happens to get married at the same day, so they can restore the poetic justice for Rancho/Wangdo and embrace the perfect ending. Along with the genius student character that challenge the virus and seniors and get away with it, the audience's expectation for this older Rancho climbs to the peak when the car reaches his school, so that the final enlightenment of his true identity push the satisfaction to a climax. The screenplay writer must be a genius.<br/><br/>Actors for the the main roles are also outstanding. There lively expression break the leash of staid Indian faces in our perception. Also I was a little disappointed by the first appearance of Rancho, this extraordinary actor present the image of a genius student and a successful scientist. The one point that touches me the most is their tears, which cooperate with their sincere glittering eyes and pretty smiles. Every time when I am about to leap out of the drama because of the ""I will stay here until your dad gets well""cliché, I am pulled back by their facial expressions. Pia is beautiful and attractive all right, also I don't understand why she attempted to married the price tag after dumping him once. Is it really that important for a Indian woman to get married? Virus is ugly and ridiculous with his huge big belly, I started to like him after he offered Rancho his pen unwillingly after he saved his daughter. He was an ossified elitism asshole until I detected his unyielding love for Mona and his deceased son.<br/><br/>After all, it's a brilliant piece. Love it, 8 stars"

"darameja","10","8","15","1 October 2012"," Amazing, inspiring and enchanting - one of best movies I have seen
","Talking about unexpected When you see the title of the movie and know that it was best grossing Bollywood film that went around the world as a hit all around – well, you expect something watered down, something for everyone. Maybe in some way it is for everyone, but by far this is not bad.<br/><br/>The message is simple – follow your heart, follow your dream and All Izz Good (a little chant of main character – Rancho – used in stressful situations). In India engineering is a prestigious occupation where many Indian parents see as future for their sons. Story is set in Nr. 1 Imperial Engineering University where our 3 main characters – Farhan, Raju and Rancho - meet. Most students are there to blindly cram book, get best scores in exams, get good job and buy big houses and big cars. But Rancho is different – he loves engineering and does not like the school system, he tries to change it. Sounds familiar? Well it is. But this is story is special. It is about real friendship, real emotions and a person who is able to inspire people, shake their mechanical lives, and wake them up. (Oh, and it has Bollywood song-and-dance cuts too, a lot of fun). It is indeed very pleasant to watch.<br/><br/>As usual I would like to ponder upon one of notions of the movie. We all in our lives are faced with important choices and struggle to answer dilemmas they give us. Who should we listen to when we choose most important things in our lives – the Tradition, our Parents and Grandparents, our God or Gods, our Friends, our Hearts or our Rational Mind? It is tough. Sometimes it seems to me it was easier in the times when you knew from childhood who you will be – a son of blacksmith will be a blacksmith, a son of tanner most probably will be a tanner (well, for girls even more easy – marriage – but that's another topic). In Hindu philosophy, in Bhagavad Gita, a similar question is discussed. A great hero Arjuna I faced with a dilemma – he has to fight the battle, as he is kshatriya, warrior cast, however in this case he would have to kill people he knows and loves. He consults his chariot driver - god Krishna. Krishna tries to persuade him to fulfill his duty, his dharma as kshatriya. It is better to be mediocre warrior if this is your dharma, than to be best cook in the world and go against it. A philosophy difficult to pursue in life, especially in modern world. I personally think that since industrial revolution and alienation of worker and his/her work (to borrow the term from Marx), there is no way to see the profession, a job in the same way as it used to be (like I mentioned – son of tanner is tanner, but it was not a ""job"" in nowadays meaning). Our jobs are almost a consumer choice, just usually more permanent one. You choose your career along with it comes the attached lifestyle (a doctors lifestyle is different from engineers, and it is not only about the money, it has much to do with the constructed image of the profession). So in ambiguity of modern world, what does constitute as dharma? Rancho says it is voice of your heart.<br/><br/>The movie has a happy ending. And if it is not pretentious enough for some critics – well, eh I think some things need to have a happy ending.<br/><br/>P.S. I wonder how many engineering students in India dropped out after seeing this movie"
"class_mass","9","8","15","1 January 2010"," It talks about faulty education system, unnecessary study pressure, wrong high expectation of parents, increasing materialism and ignorance of human values THE FUNNY WAY
","There are many people who find nothing useful in real working life which have been taught and studied with great pressure during their student life. There are many instances where students have taken last step as suicide when they can't handle the study pressure. There are people who have inner abilities and skill sets of some other field than the field in which they are currently working or say there are people who trying hard to establish themselves in the field according to their chosen career path but can not make the headway. Actually these kind of people might have realised that they have taken wrong path and that is because of parent's expectation, social status or may be because of peer pressure. There are people who are repenting after making career in the field in which they are not enjoying and have mindset that they would have been done better in some other field. There are parents with the mindset that some educational field are good and some are bad. This is may be because of status in the society, job market and money reward in the field. But by this way they are ignoring inner abilities of their child and take the part in spoiling their career. This is like curing the disease the wrong way by giving wrong drug. This way they are killing their real pleasure. There are girls and guys who repenting after getting married to a person who is so materialistic who running behind only money and has no value for human feelings. Finally this kind of marriage wont last longer and results in the divorce. The film is giving good message to all of above people with humour. Songs are also good and well placed in the movie.<br/><br/>Over all it is another very good movie of Aamir khan."
"j_reen17","10","8","15","29 December 2009"," What a movie! Brilliant
","Unfortunately i can only give a 10 on IMDb otherwise this movie should Definitely get 11/ 10<br/><br/>Plot Two idiots Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman) sets outs on a journey to find their lost friend and the 3rd idiot Rancho (Aamir).. As the journey starts off, their college life and old memories of their friendship, with a unique free-thinker Rancho who inspired them and changed their lives, are unfolded through flashbacks and followed with some twists and turns...<br/><br/>My Views 3 Idiots looks at our educational system which pressurises the students and does not allow to chose his destination by his own wish, in a satirical way and brings out some of the flaws in it... On parallel there is a love angle between Rancho and Pia (Kareena)... Many of the situations/characters have resemblance or inspiration to ""Five Point Someone"", blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat...<br/><br/>Both humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality rib-tickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feel-good comic caper is leading to its culmination, there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani...<br/><br/>Technically, it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography, the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualisations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...<br/><br/>Coming to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting, Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good...<br/><br/>On the downside, there are some unbelievable filmy situations which can be excused as writer's liberty and the episode of Mona's delivery was a bit far stretched.. Still these minor negatives does not affect this wholesome entertainer ! In short the basic theme of the movie is that ""chase excellence and success will follow"".. Just like that Aamir and Raju has chased excellence and success is following them...<br/><br/>So to sum up, Aamir and Hirani has delivered the best movie of 2009, perhaps the decade!... Do yourself a favour by seeing this highly emotional and feel good comic entertainer...<br/><br/>one of the best movies of the decade... a must watch!"
"ironhorse_iv","8","4","6","11 August 2015"," All is kinda well for 3 idiots. It was mostly a great feel-good movie.
","In a country, where over-achievement is expected & anything deem a normal life is look upon as the idiotic or lazy failure. A lot of Asians feel, that slaving away, their lives, for the chance of extraordinary wealth is the only way, to live, even if it's does not suite their personality. Indeed, the hunger for success and wealth is so engrained in Asian culture, that it's hard to escape, such burdens. It's true, that Asians societies, do put extreme pressure on its members. Often, weighting down on them to a point, that some people feel, that it's too much; causing them to common suicide. So, I can see, why people would want to see this film directed by Rajkumar Hirani. It has a more healthy and positive approach when it comes to a country's wants and don't wants, when it comes to the individual member. Set in an India academia world, 3 Idiots revolves around three students studying in the Imperial College of Engineering, in New Delhi. The first idiot, Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) comes from a poor family and is desperate to pass and get a good job, but lacks the self-esteem to go with his plans. The second idiot, Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), comes from a relatively better family, but has joined engineering to please his family, while he really wants to become a wildlife photographer. The last idiot, Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchhad (Aamir Khan) is a radical-thinking young man, who more willing to challenges the educational system at every step he takes, rather than accenting the harsh-crude teaching practices of the college, often infuriating the headmaster of the school, Viru 'The Virus' Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani). However, Farhan and Raju lost contact with Rancho after graduation. Ten years later, Farhan gets a call from an old enemy colleague of theirs, Chature 'Silencer' Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) who says he has found Rancho. Abandoning everything, Chatur, Farhan and Raju set out on a road trip, to find him. But all is not as it seems. Can the idiots find their friend or will the search end up as a wild goose chase? Watch the movie, to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to look at the film, in a western world view set and say, the Animal House style college scenes, far out-live the present day, road trip movie. I really felt, those scenes were far, more effective, even if the social message was somewhat too broad. I like that, the modern day teaching standards are called into question. It made a very interesting film. Sadly, the movie takes the often funny yet brilliant Patch Adam like, school challenges, and mixed it, with below average Bollywood film dramatics. The movie often moves into such clichés, that it become somewhat emotional jarring to watch. One minute, you're listening to a Bollywood musical dance number, and then, you cut to an emotional, over the top preachy death scene. The pacing for the film is all over the place. It really drags at times. Some of the film's greatest twist comes inappropriate mistimed. You'd know that Raju will survive his suicide attempt since he's alive and well in the present day scenes. You know, that the men will end up, being successful, regardless, what the Virus pull onto them. Don't get me wrong, the twist about Racho's past was pretty good, but the film was pretty predictable. Then, there are the unrealistic over the top scenes that are absolutely nearly implausible in any universe, like the whole stubborn baby scene. Anyways, the acting, throughout the film was pretty good. Each character had a moment to shine. My only problem with the acting is Kareen Kapoor as Pia. She was so disappointing, most of the film. I really don't get her character. Why would she still go after, Suhas (Olivier Lafont), after three-times, where characters warn her, not to!? It doesn't make sense. Plus, that noise ring, she wore, during the film was so distracting. Another thing that kinda hurts the film is the songs. Shantanu Moitra's score is a bit too gimmicky. The song, Zoobi Doobi sounds entertaining, but sounds too similar to other Bollywood songs. The song 'All Izz Well' sounds like it should had been, put in the credits than in the middle of the film. Anyways, I love the over-the-top childish humor. While, the jokes are simple and old. They work mostly within the means of the story. Chatur's engineered speech is by far, the funniest scene in the film. Still, the movie does seem, a bit, one-sided when it comes to condone misbehavior. I'm deeply surprise that the three men, wasn't kick out of the school, within the first couple of minutes in the film. Much of the film's controversy, comes from the fact, that the movie is loosely based on the novel, Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhaget. Any fan of the book, would know, that the film is way different. The suicide message of the book, get somewhat lose in the film. Yes, within the last five years, India has one of the greatest absolute numbers of suicides cases, but here is where the movie get some of the information, wrong. Other countries have the highest rates, overall. It's also untrue, that extreme pressures of academia cause most of India's suicide rates. Farmers are more likely to kill themselves, versus any other professions in India, as list by the World Health Organization. Despite that, the film is fun for the most part. The film is distinctive for featuring real inventions by little-known people. The cinematography is beautiful to look at. I love the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh. The film felt like a typical masala film. It's good to eat, but a bit too spicy, at same moments. No wonder, why this film is one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films ever. Overall: While it's kinda overrated. It's emotional, entertaining and enlightening. In my opinion, it was a somewhat above averaged Bollywood film."
"mostlysilly","6","10","20","24 October 2010"," Good, not great
","This movie is very much in the DCH mould, but not nearly as good. It begins very impressively but gradually begins to stray off and by the end goes way overboard.<br/><br/>It may come as a disappointment to those who pride it as a movie that pinpoints what's wrong with our society that the extraordinary nature of events in the movie do not strike a chord with real life regardless of the country or society under consideration. For those who look up to it as the beginning of a trend of quality satire movies in bollywood, I am afraid its a false dawn.<br/><br/>I've seen and thoroughly enjoyed many zany comedies, but those movies are different because they don't try to simulate real world situations unlike a movie based on a serious subject like 3 Idiots. The seriousness of the movie's theme was not reflected in the storyline and/or direction of the movie. <br/><br/>Having said that, it is enjoyable to watch, being full of lighthearted humour, which makes it worth a watch and I wonder had it stuck to a saner storyline, it could really have been the masterpiece that many have made it out to be anyways.<br/><br/>Also, since its focused largely, if not entirely on Aamir Khan and the other two so called central characters don't play enough of a role, the movie doesn't seem to warrant the title 3 Idiots.<br/><br/>Its kind of disappointing to see people adulating and hailing this movie as something which is class apart, if it is so, we can and will have to raise that class."

","Yes - it is a bit long. Yes - It is a bit unbelievable. Yes - it has old jokes. But the point is, it is a movie, not a documentary on global warming where the facts are supposed to be facts (really?) <br/><br/>What I liked? The pace of the movie (assuming you remove some scenes like that baby delivery or bride kidnapping). The jokes are effective because they are well executed, acted, and the timing is just right. So are the melodramatic scenes. The acting is fine. Was impressed by Sharman Joshi. Aamir Khan (a bit old for the role) has always delivered. Omi has portrayed his character well.<br/><br/>A few points. The plane scene is not a realistic one (then neither is Rambo or Air Force One). And, in this day and age, how can you not locate a rich guy who is making half a million dollar a month in small town India! The whole inverter idea with the baby delivery scene! Wow! The climax was a feel-gooder, but not appropriate as the message got lost. Boman Irani should have been a part of the climax and should have learned his lesson then.<br/><br/>Oh, well. It is just a movie. When you compare it to other Holly and Bolly movies (which have similar flaws), this one does stand out as a good entertainer. Definitely worth seeing, I would say.."

"DICK STEEL","10","15","33","26 December 2009"," A Nutshell Review: 3 Idiots
","When I told a friend that 3 Idiots is the best film this festive period, he told me it takes an idiot to be able to tell one, and that I saw myself in the film. If anything, I'll take that as a compliment, as the film is about self-actualization, or the simple fact that it's a wake up call in this rat race of a world that we live in, that we lose sight of things that matter in the pursuit of success. It's a wake up call that we should be pursuing Excellence instead, which in the work environment one gets easily drowned in mediocrity, or blind faith that success follows without putting in too much hard work.<br/><br/>Set predominantly in the varsity days and told in chunks of flashback, this film will allow you to reminisce about a time where life was nothing but exams, lectures, and that paper chase, either making the grade or having to repeat. But there's also probably that one person, or a few if you're lucky, whom you'll meet on campus that will help you directly or indirectly, shape your outlook, thinking and just about forming long lasting bonds, whose interaction with will shape your character just before entering the workforce.<br/><br/>3 Idiots tell of such a friendship, amongst 3 buddies Farhan (R. Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi), two mediocre students who just scrape through, and the one huge influence in their lives, ace student Rancho (Aamir Khan), the livewire of the trio who irks the Dean of Imperial College of Engineering (modelled after the famed Indian Institute of Technology), Professor Viru (Virus), played by Boman Irani. In fact, it's something like a Hindi equivalent of the local I Not Stupid with its critique on the educational system, but done with a lot more finesse, fun and without sledgehammering its ideals down your throat.<br/><br/>The gist of the disparity here is the concept of learning how to learn, or teaching somebody how to fish compared to just giving the students the fish. It's a reminder that knowledge gathering goes beyond just doing so for exams, and the techniques of blindly cramming will do one not much good later on. It's about the application of knowledge for the real world than to answer papers, and the joy of acquiring such knowledge. It's the 3 Idiots versus the Professor, and their peer Chatur ""Silencer"" (Omi Vaidya who played the role with glee, as the peer bootlicker that everyone loves to hate) who throws down the gauntlet to Rancho as to who will eventually be the more successful of the lot.<br/><br/>What made 3 Idiots work remarkably, is the excellent chemistry between the leads. Aamir Khan, the big name as he is, doesn't upstage his co-stars R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi, as their characters get into various forms of shenanigans in college. Instead they complement one another in their roles, and thanks to makeup, look very much comfortable as their aged selves, and their younger teenage ones through closely cropped hair, and outfits. Aamir aces the role of Rancho as the boy who gets ahead of the pack without really trying and at times being perceived as both the smarty pants and the troublemaker of his cohort, though his sudden disappearance after graduation has made his good friends try to track him down, albeit unsuccessfully. <br/><br/>The film also doesn't take itself too seriously when the time calls for it, switching quite playfully to ramp up its funny moments, even at times breaking the fourth wall when telling the story of Raju's background (in black and white melodrama no less). The jokes here worked wonders as well, as do the couple of twists that roll along in the 2nd act after the interval, which is somewhat telling of the narrative depth that the film possessed. Songs were breezy and plenty of fun, and I personally enjoyed Aal Izz Well (All Is Well) best, a chant that the Idiots adopted from Rancho, who uses it to calm his heart when it's filled with anxiety and fear. I think it works.<br/><br/>Affairs of the heart though are kept at a bare minimum, when Rancho falls for the daughter of Professor Viru, Pia (Kareena Kapoor). While they start off in quite testy terms, things start to thaw when Pia sees Rancho for who he is, except that the secret Rancho keeps threatens to keep them permanently apart. And that is unless the other 2 pals could help it in their quest to locate Rancho. Everything falls into place at the end, especially telling of the second act when you learn of this secret at the cliffhanger prior to the interval, and this provides yet another emotional sucker punch to your gut when themes like friendship lasting forever starts entering the picture.<br/><br/>Chase excellence and success will follow; this film lived up to that tagline in being one of the most excellent I've watched this year. Amongst all the film offerings put out this festive season, my choice for the most uplifting, the most hopeful and a jolly entertaining ride all around with elements of everything only a Bollywood film is renowned for, is this one. Don't miss it, and it goes directly, albeit a late entry, as a contender for my top films of the year!"

","The script is the biggest problem with this film. It is filled with clichés and unoriginal jokes. The theme and message of the film is spelled out for the audience a million times. It should be more subtle and realistic. The sequence of events is entirely predictable.<br/><br/>Additionally, there is nothing exceptional about any other element of the film in my opinion. There is nothing impressive about the camera work. There is nothing impressive about set design or costume design. There is nothing impressive about the acting or characterization.<br/><br/>It is emotionally manipulative using every trick in the book and there is nothing to enjoy if you do not fall for that.

","I love Chetan Bhagat's novels. I work with many engineers who immigrated to the US from India. Bhagat's novels (especially ""2 States"") help me appreciate the land they came from, that schooled them, and is still attached to their souls.<br/><br/>Both ""Five Point Someone"" and ""3 Idiots"" tell about students suffering through college and the transformation to adulthood. Both stories are engaging, cleverly constructed and funny as hell, but they show different things, at a different pace. Novels show internal transformation, while movies show the transformation of relationships. Neither story is biographical. Neither story depicts ""reality"". Both stories work as fiction and frivolous entertainment. Both are respectful of their characters.<br/><br/>If you want great art, read Tolstoy. To learn How Things Work, read Darwin. If you like the Marx Brothers, and you want to laugh your ass off, watch ""3 Idiots"". This is not a movie to make you think (Of COURSE universities in developing countries are lethally competitive) but to bombard you with the unexpected. Which for this westerner included the jarring Bollywood ""let's stop the plot and dance"", though in this case it is ""let's use dance to fire-hose a different set of sight gags at the viewers"". One part of your laughing brain can rest while another takes over. This movie will definitely engage all your humor muscles, including engineer and college nostalgia humor muscles if you have them. If you enjoy ""funny machines"", there are plenty of those, too.<br/><br/>Some parts were beyond me - Silencer's idiosyncratic Hindi becomes mere word-substitution jokes in subtitle, and I'm left to imagine how his non-standard pronunciation and mannerisms are 2/3 of the humor Still, even Silencer and Virus were treated with respect - all the characters were victims of a situation created by colonialism, poverty, desperation, and ambition displacing love. You can cry or you can laugh - choose your movies accordingly. If you want to cry about abused students, watch ""Dark Matter"" (2007). If you don't like fart jokes, don't watch this movie, or read Benjamin Franklin, either.<br/><br/>India turns out a lot of films. I'm sure all the elements of this movie are borrowed from others, and if you've watched a thousand movies you won't see much new stuff here. Good artists plagiarize, great artists steal, and these artists robbed the entire film vault. They pasted their swag together pretty well, and in some surprising (to me) ways.<br/><br/>IMHO, a 170 minute movie is too long, which is why I give it a 9. But if they edited it down to 90 minutes, and kept all the best humor, I might have died laughing. It was never plodding, though it slowed from manic to almost sane in places.<br/><br/>I'm buying 4 copies for Christmas presents - I have some godchildren that need their humor centers stretched. This ought to do it."

","First he taught us that laughter is the best medicine. With his second venture, he taught us the ways of piece and love through Ghandism. Now, with 3 Idiots, Rajkumar Hirani tells us to chase excellence and success will follow.<br/><br/>I'm a viewer who believes the best way to send a message is through an entertaining way rather than a preachy way. A message through entertainment hits you harder than a boring and preachy one. Films, of course, are not meant to send messages, but it's always nice to see one that does. I honestly believe nobody can do it better than Raju Hirani - Currently the best director of Hindi Cinema.<br/><br/>Like his previous attempts, Raju Hirani makes us laugh, cry and think all in one viewing. 3 Idiots not only introduces you to a new world, but also provides a fresh way of filmmaking and narration. Not to forget that it tackles an issue that not many have touched upon - The Education System.<br/><br/>Years after graduating from college, Farhan and Raju receive a message from an old classmate, Chatur. Chatur claims that he has found their old buddy Rancho. Rancho, a free mind, an intelligent student, a good guy. Why is Rancho so important? What exactly did Rancho do? Why did he leave? Will Farhan and Raju find him? All that is depicted in the next nearly 3 hours of the movie.<br/><br/>To start, 3 Idiots deals with a few things here and there. Whether it is the poor school system that discriminates and pressures you involving your grades. Whether it's you father forcing you to become an engineer and not allowing you to pursue your dreams. Or even a bright student who fears he may not be able to live up to the high expectations. Finally, 3 Ididots says one simple thing - Chase your dreams, demolish your fears and try your best - Success is a given.<br/><br/>There are a number of significant moments I totally love in the movie. Aamir's introduction itself is a great start. I'll go on and say another lovely scene is when Farhan and Raju come last and find out where Rancho placed. Of Course, who can forget Chatur's hilarious ""Balatkaar speech"" Just Genius writing. There are more moments to cherish here. The whole climax is lovely. Mona Singh's baby delivery is gripping. Finally, Rancho's real identify being shown keeps you glued and enlightened all at once.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the film is when Farhan and Raju decide their fates. Farhan confronting his father about his real dreams and Raju's interview - Just amazing moments.<br/><br/>Flaws? I really don't see any. I do want to note that the film is almost 3 hours yet you do not feel like it has been that long.<br/><br/>Rajkumar Hirani and his co writer really developed a nearly flawless script here. The lines are just amazing. They are fresh and also have that feel-goodness to them. The screenplay is excellent.<br/><br/>The music of the movie grows on you. All Izz Well lifts your spirit. Give Me Some Sunshine is amazing. Behti Hawa is also an underrated song. Songs are pictured well.<br/><br/>R. Madhavan gives his best performance in my opinion. His voice over is also a master stroke. He's got a strange innocence to him him this film. It works. Sharman Joshi is no less. He's just first rate. Especially in the scene when he goes to give his interview.<br/><br/>Kareena Kapoor is actually acting well here. A great act. Boman Irani is first rate as always. He's just brilliant. His character is sort of similar to his earlier character in Raju Hirani's first film, Munnabhai MBBS. However, there's a huge distinction in Boman's act. Shows the man's versatility.<br/><br/>Aamir Khan holds 3 Idiots together all through. I feel he should have gotten the best actor award that year instead of Amitabh Bachchan in Paa (That was a great act too) He looks the role, he's just perfect in every frame. You don't really expect anything less than that from Mr. Khan.<br/><br/>All said and done, even Aamir would agree with me that the real hero of this film is Raj Kumar Hirani, the director. He's filled the movie with so many wonderful moments, extracted some memorable performances and has given one of the most entertaining films to Indian Cinema.<br/><br/>What else can I say? Just a big thanks to director Raj Kumar Hirani, producer Vinod Chopra and actor Aamir Khan for giving us this modern day classic.<br/><br/>In Munnabhi MBBS - It was a ""jadho ki jhappi"" In Lage Raho Munnabhai - It was ""Get well soon, mamu"" And now, it's - ALL IZZ WELL!"

"panuk765","7","7","13","25 January 2010"," Feel Good
","On Christmas day my family and I went to watch a new Bollywood movie called 3 Idiots. Starring Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor. The majority of the film is a flash back of the college days of three young boys, whose future had been decided at birth. Correlating with with the Indian stereotype of: whenever a boy is born he will become an engineer. The moral of the film is that when one finds what they truly love to do, work will become play. This moral is presented to the audience through numerous comedic and emotional situations very well placed throughout the story line. Although much of the story is very predictable, I believe the film was supposed to be this way, as the point of the film was to teach the audience a very important lesson: do what you love to do. As with all Indian films, this one also had the token 'love' part, which no Indian movie seems to be able to function without. This is a recommended watch, whether it is in theaters or on DVD, this movie is a definite 'feel good' film that the whole family will enjoy. It will also be released in its entirety on YouTube after 12 weeks."

","I had read the book by Chetan Bhagat - Five Point Someone and I can say the movie really has done great honors to the book by bringing those characters to life with depicting those incidents. I enjoyed every moment of the movie brilliantly played by Amir, Madhavan and Sharman and off course Boman. There were moments when my wife would just hold my hand and look at me with tears rolling down her eyes. The movie is a must watch for everyone young or old. Hats off to Rajkumar Hirani for the best adaptation of the movie and last but not the least to Chetan Bhagat for creating such a master piece which Hirani has brought to the entire world. Go out folks and watch this fun extravaganza!! 10 on 10 for this masterpiece."

","I have to admit, I didn't expect much. I tend to shy away from foreign movies and the title didn't seem very intriguing either. The trailer looked silly and I didn't really have a reason to watch this other than the fact that it was highly rated. But man was I wrong about this movie. When I decided to start watching it, I had little to no patience and was looking for the first reason to just stop watching it. As the movie progressed, I couldn't stop watching it! It sucked me into a world of comedy, romance, and drama in a way I've never seen used before. It was so unique in the way it was used; it wasn't a typical Hollywood film with every cliché scene being used. I quickly found myself become attached to these ""3 idiots"" through great acting and character development. This movie was stuffed with life lessons and ultimately very enlightening. It was all a slam dunk. a 10 out of 10. However, don't get me wrong. This movie wasn't perfect. There was a few scenes where they would break out into song for about 10 minutes which was a little annoying but I could see how it fit into the movie. I just sorta thought it was a bit childish and a little abrupt. But all in all, a very well developed movie. I highly recommend this."
"rajatduasr","6","16","37","24 December 2009"," It is NOT a great movie, it IS a good movie though
","OK so just to make it clear, I do think this movie is very funny! As a matter of fact, its hilarious. My only problem with the movie is ---<br/><br/>1) Unoriginal - I understand that the original concept was developed by Mr Hirani himself, but nonetheless, its not fresh. Might as well call it ""Munnabhai BSc - THE DEJA VU"". I guess since the west has the 3 stooges, and 3 musketeers, we need something too right? <br/><br/>2) Old Jokes - the common urban legend of spending millions of dollars on a space pen instead of using a pencil, and ""how does a motor start"", and the fact that indians only want their children to be engineers or doctors (we do have actors, cricketers, and politicians, don't we?), just too old. <br/><br/>3) Unrealistic - I don't even feel the need to explain this one. (I think Bollywood directors firmly believe in an old adage- ""Everything is possible"" and they follow it religiously in every movie. Be it bringing a dead to life by saying ""AAL IZZ WELL"" or stopping a wedding at the last second (how does this not get boring, i can name 10 movies that have already done this and i don't even watch too many bollywood movies) <br/><br/>on a bright note, it is very funny (yes the jokes are old, but they are executed pretty well), please watch it and i apologize for being such a hater. I am just giving my 2 cents. Plus, I think everyone did a great job in the movie. I laughed my ass off on few occasions, but so did I while watching American Pie<br/><br/>...and so I strongly disagree with those who think this movie is a masterpiece. it is not. <br/><br/>6.5/10."
"Peter_Young","5","18","43","1 October 2011"," Fairly idiotic, but it's not that bad
","Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots is generally a rather entertaining comedy, but as a film it is only partially successful. Though it does have its moments, it never really manages to completely deliver and lacks the power to enthrall. It mostly works as a senseless comic ride and only occasionally does it convince when it tries to convey a message. The film is quite messy in presentation, and it is a tiresome task to follow the proceedings as every now and then the story moves confusingly between past flashbacks and present developments. The movie is good in many ways, and at times it's very funny, but it is the overall product which is faulty. The dialogue is for the most part excellent, so is the visual style, but then, the script lacks focus. While Hirani's direction is quite smart and creative at times, he often tries to include too many elements, and, as a result, the movie often seems to go nowhere. The humour wavers between witty moments of hilarity and cheap, unoriginal gags. And then we also have poor sequences of overdone melodrama and manipulative sentimentality, which are incorporated rather forcibly into the movie and they really fall flat. The entire birth sequence, for one, is one hell of a clichÃ©. So is the ending, which is sugarcoated to the max. <br/><br/>Where acting goes, the one who does the best--and probably the only great--job is definitely Boman Irani, who is simply hilarious as the lisping, authoritarian college professor. Aamir Khan looks younger than his actual age but is still too old for his role. Acting-wise, he's just ordinary and offers nothing particularly impressive. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi are given little scope and only few short episodes here and there for themselves so that they don't end up unsatisfied from taking part in this film. They do reasonably well, but Joshi is made to cry far too much, and it really gets on one's nerves. Now who's left? Oh, Kareena Kapoor! Well, she is pretty but she is given a thankless blink-and-miss part which is neither significant nor demanding. That said, though she is hardly there, she does well when she is and her presence is pleasant. The songs are quite catchy and fun, but none of them is particularly memorable. ""Zuby Duby"", however, is superbly visualised and is enjoyable enough. Overall then, 3 idiots is an okay film at best which is flawed and terribly overrated, but in all fairness, it is reasonably enjoyable and may provide decent Hindi entertainment for the entire family. According to me, it is worth nothing more than a one-time watch."
"sanjidparvez","6","10","21","9 January 2010"," The story deserved a better climax at the end.
","Definitely it's blast for the fans of Aamir Khan. Great story starts with perfect cast & acting. Then just move forward with a great pace & fantastic humor that everyone expects from any Rajkumar Hirani film. Moreover, the main content & message proves that surely it was another a very much needed film for the respected audience. And as usually Mr. RH delivered the package very well. But my only little disappointments goes with the final climax. The sequences of final climax are very much important to closing the main statement in a way that stays in the mind of the audience for an adequate amount of time. And that can then help to form a judgmental & thought provoking ideas. For example, MUNNA BHAI MBBS. The whole vacuum baby delivery idea may be new for the viewers with a little demonstration of usefulness of WEB CAM tech. Though I haven't get the chance to read the original novel but personally I think this climax sequence didn't quite fit in a proper way with the content of the story like the climax of MUNNA BHAI films were superbly coped with those stories. I think 3 Idiots deserved a better climax at the end rather than found them busy to have a successful delivery with the help of a vacuum machine. At least I didn't expect that coming. Other than that it was perfectly entertaining."

","One thing that comes to our mind when we say Bollywood is fancy stories with dream worlds. They are far for reality and almost nothing to take from it. But this movie stands still as a giant proving that Bollywood isn't all about synthetic dream worlds. This is a classic masterpiece with the combination of geniuses.<br/><br/>Aamir khan my favorite actor in Bollywood shows here, he not just another actor but a man of wisdom. There are high class Bollywood celebrities, acting in very cheap movies even jeopardizing their well built reputation. One thing I notice on Aamir Khan is that he is not after each and every role only seek for the excellence. As he becomes successful with his career, he improves the way of thinking too. This maturity can be clearly visible in his productions too. (He could be the only Bollywood celebrity with a brain :)<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is quite interesting and never get bored. Humor, Joy, Sorrow , feeling and everything is there. The specialty that tied my attention to this movie is the Dialogs. They are really a work of a genius. Rancho's dialogs as a college student perfectly call into our wisdom. They contains the thoughts of a philosopher. <br/><br/>The message given by the movie is astonishing by the end. if it's summarized, ""Don't follow the success, only the excellence. Then success will follow you""<br/><br/>This could be the movie that would change my life one day."

"nadeem107","4","22","57","27 December 2009"," Absolute rubbish.
","Pardon my ignorance.<br/><br/>When an actor of Aamir's calibre decides to act in a movie after a year from his previous release, and when you have a massive production house backing your movie with a director whose had two back to back hits, You tend to expect a lot from a movie.<br/><br/>But instead what you get is 3 hours of absolute rubbish.<br/><br/>The facts are simple. Add a Lil bit of humour to a pathetic story and publicise it well and let the cash registers ring, because its the year end and there a billion fans of Aamir, who have been waiting so impatiently for his next movie for over a year, so anything he signs is bound to be an instant hit. And that has been the case for most of his movies for the past decade. Even MANGAL PANDAY cashed in a lot in the first week. <br/><br/>What mystifies me more is the way Aamir went about publicising this movie? I am still confused and a bit dazzled as to what was the link between the story of the movie and Aamir touring India as your everyday people.<br/><br/>What mystifies me even more as to what made choose him this movie. There was nothing even close to what you would call challenging in this film, considering his previous performances.<br/><br/>Lets start with his character Rancho, a college student . Lets be honest, he has played that in so many movies that he could now do that in his sleep. A free thinker who studies and preaches education by his own rules and practicality. Funny why does Patch Adams just keep springing to my mind. The only difference being Robin Williams and Rancho was that Robin was practising medicine in that movie and Rancho is practising engineering. <br/><br/>There were many one-liners that i heard giggles in the theatre, but not many of them realise that they are so 2 thousand late.<br/><br/>Like for instance the NASA pen scene or even the best gag of the film the Omi speech are lifted from either stand-ups or foreign movies.<br/><br/>It was like watching a blend of Patch Adams, Rang De Basanti,Patch Adams, Munnabhai (the first one because that too was inspired by Patch Adams), Patch Adams & Taare Zameen Par together.<br/><br/>And it was Shambolic mixture to be honest. Even the English song "" give me some sunshine"" is inspired by an old Hindi ghazal. And i am really annoyed that nobody else realised that. Probably because the language has changed. So i will have to spell it out to you, compare the lyrics of this song and a timeless classic by jagjit singh, ""Woh Kaagaz Ki Kashti"", and u will begin to realise, that every bit of this movie is either inspired or lifted from one or the other, in the same manner Ghajini was inspired from a certain Christopher Nolan film.<br/><br/>Yes i did find something that i liked in the movie, and that is only one shot from the entire movie, although very predictable, but the scene in which joy is shown hanging to his ceiling fan was a brilliant piece of direction. Its the way that it was shot in that amazed me.<br/><br/>With Lage raho , Hirani stamped his mark of brilliance in many ways. As a director, a story writer and a story teller. It was refreshing and unpredictable. Even the first of the Munnabhai series had plenty of laughs and frowns although that too was mostly an indianised version of Patch Adams. <br/><br/>Mr, Hirani, move over the patch Adams hangover now. Its high time. <br/><br/>I am sure you might find many other movies in Hollywood, that still haven't been indianised.<br/><br/>And once again pardon my ignorance."
"michaelradny","1","20","51","20 October 2015"," 1 Idiot
","I feel like a fool wasting three hours on what practically is the Indian equivalent of the Three Stooges. With some context, this was the first Bollywood film I had seen, and it doesn't make me want to rush back and view more. The jokes are pretty unfunny, almost inline with unintelligent slapstick comedy and weird foreign comedy. Nothing in this film made me want to continue viewing; poor acting, a poor script and horrible cinematography are among the worst I've ever seen.<br/><br/>3 Idiots may be a favorite in it's homeland, but as a foreign viewer to India, I had a huge problem with viewing it. The jokes fall flat, very flat and the story feels juvenile and childish. 3 Idiots is among the worst in IMDb's top 250 and I discourage viewing at all costs."
"jmathur_swayamprabha","7","10","22","25 February 2010"," Good, not outstanding
","3 Idiots is definitely an over-hyped good movie. A lot of expectations were associated with the movie since it was going to come from Raju Hirani, the Munnabhai director and Aamir Khan, the perfectionist actor (and producer and director). Definitely the movie is a good one but it falls short of the pre-release expectations. It is a nice timepass as the entertainment value is quite high. The inherent message for the youth to pursue their passion instead of joining the rat race is also exemplary. However, giving a second look to the movie (after the laughters and the first time euphoria have calmed down), several flaws can be seen very easily in the storyline as well as the treatment. Loosely inspired by the novel Five Point Someone, the movie has shown the lead characters as black or white instead of grey, the real life ones. The director has played with the characters as puppets in his hands instead of allowing them to develop normally. The best example is of Chatur (played excellently by the hitherto less known actor Omi). The movie has exaggerated several things and the biggest drawback of the movie in my opinion is that the storyteller challenges the intelligence of the viewers at several places. There are several incidents in the movie totally indigestible for a sensible viewer. Perhaps Raju Hirani conveniently overlooked the fact that his audience is not the David Dhawan's audience who is expected to leave the brains at home before leaving for the theatre.<br/><br/>3 Idiots (even the name is not appropriate), falters at many points and on many counts. However taking the plus points first, it is recommended as a good comedy successful in making you laugh. Further the music is good and hummable. The song about the character of Rancho played with the titles is quite meaningful and melodious. Choreography is quite good. The performances are excellent right from Aamir Khan to the actors getting the lowest footage in the movie. The message for the students to give precedence to knowledge over marks and follow their passion is definitely admirable. The movie impresses and moves the viewer deeply at certain places. It does not give you a chance to identify its loopholes and weaknesses while viewing it for the first time. Very entertaining and gripping indeed.<br/><br/>But the minus points are too many to categorise the movie as an outstanding (which has been unjustifiably done by several established reviewers). It is necessary (and relatively easy too) to differentiate between an outstanding movie and a good movie. 3 Idiots is good, not outstanding. It is flawed, not flawless. Making fun of a dedicated student (even when he is a book-worm) is not proper, nor is it to blame the head of an institution for a pressurised student's suicide (and an ignorant father for his non-communicative son's suicide). Suicide cannot be given precedence over communication of your anguish and pains. It cannot be glamorised as well. Showing the head of the college as doing ridiculous things just to make fun of him or portray him in bad light is also not a commendable thing. A scientist with 400 patents being so unknown and unidentified and a girl not marrying for ten years, yet not making any meaningful (and successful) effort to search for her lost love, besides males playing midwives and managing childbirth with the help of a vacuum-cleaner are a few among several irritating things shown in the movie. Rancho's distorting the speech written in Roman for Chatur and making him a laughing stock just because of his lack of proper knowledge of Hindi language cannot be justified either.<br/><br/>Even on the laughter dimension, the movie is not a perfect one. Showing the male students time and again in the toilet or pointing at their asses looks disgusting after the first time. The excessive use of the word - balatkar (rape) does not allow the movie to be watched comfortably with all the family members. Does the moviemaker want the children (because the movie has been given a U certificate by the Indian Censor Board) to know the meaning of balatkar (rape) before the proper age ?<br/><br/>Raju Hirani had impressed the Indian audience with his close-to-heart Munnabhai movies. However in this movie, he has not succeeded in living upto his reputation and the pre-release hype of the movie. The movie is excellent in parts only. It's irritating at many places. Overall it is good. It could have been a better one by all means."

","I have a bunch of Indian and Pakistani friends and they were all going over the moon with this movie so I decided to watch it. There is one way to describe this movie and that is different.<br/><br/>The story revolves around three engineering students who bond with each other. Rancho is a brilliant student who prefers to have fun and makes it his duty to help people in any way he can. Farhan is a student who loves photography and was forced to go to the top engineering school by his dad. Raju is a religious student from a poor family that tries to excel in the school. THroughout the movie, they have their little adventures and even a couple of surprises or two in the school they are studying in. While the movie is different from most Indian Movies, the movie is a little long and a little dragged on. While it is primarily a comedy movie and there are many jokes in the movie, most of them aren't that funny and there were some very babyish jokes (people pulling their pants down randomly and people talking to each other while on the toilets). Like most Hindi Movies, there were also some good songs, but one was a nonsensical song that sounded unusually similar to zipadee doo daa. Towards the end (last 45 minutes) the movie also became painfully predictable and did not match the explosive first hour that had me captivated. The message however was very well understood and very well put in the movie.<br/><br/>Aamir Khan is an outstanding movie star and he shines in this movie and as I heard he also produced this movie, it greatly resembles his other movie, Taare Zameen Par, in which a kid that is dyslexic rises above the standard and traditional South Asian view that a child must learn a certain way. It parallels the moral of this story in which South Asian communities must broaden their views and be more flexible instead of forcing their children to becomes either doctors or engineers and to not put pressure on their children by asking high demands in education.<br/><br/>Overall, its a movie to watch because of its message."

","As someone who has never seen a Bollywood film, and doesn't care much for them, I was skeptical about 3 Idiots. But, I had heard good things and decided to give it a shot. Luckily for me, it is a very enjoyable film. At times laugh out loud funny, at others deadly serious, it's one of those rare films that doesn't break the mold, but still manages to be fantastic.<br/><br/>The film is primarily about three students who attend the prestigious ICE engineering school. One student, Rancho, quickly makes a name for himself as the student who walks the other way and makes enemies of the schools head, Virus as he tries to enlighten his fellow students Raju and Farhan. <br/><br/>While not familiar with Bollywood films, I am familiar with the genres staples, and they are here, including musical numbers, lots of melodrama, and lots of crying. Yes, there is cheese here, but it's a well done film. The characters are enjoyable and the story is wonderfully told. Behind it are issues that, while laid in an after school special kind of way, are very serious. Suicide is even covered here, and it is not handled in a comedic fashion. These issues are taken very seriously and it is the heart of the film. The acting is mostly responsible here for the success of this film, relying on the combined goofiness and drama of the three primaries. I can't say that the film isn't predictable, though there are several shocking moments. But, even with it's predictability, the cast is so charming that it's just something you can sit back and enjoy. <br/><br/>I suppose I wasn't expecting much going in, and at a running time of almost 3 hrs. (something very a-typical for this kind of film), you might think you'd get worn down. But this is a very enjoyable film. Yes, it goes to some very silly places and even seems awkward at times, but by the end, you can't help but smile. Can say I am honestly pleased I took the journey."

It starts maybe as a common University comedy, but soon reveals to be much more.<br/><br/>The whole educating system is put under question, behind what is a maybe not so reasonable argument, cause even if there are loads of people that are GREAT for their profession and don't get GREAT grades, the system evaluates only how a person adapts to a standard system to measure knowledge. All the same we can see a very different culture and values. Even in religion.<br/><br/>The movie is all the time mixing deep feelings and thoughts, with a laugh and a joke. The songs also give the movie a pleasant touch.<br/><br/>All in all, a movie to watch with A LOT of time, but a great movie to see, even with children to give them something to think about."

","I was not willing to watch this when it came out but after seeing all the great reviews I thought of giving it a try, which I REALLY regret! This was nothing like I expected and it does not deserve more than 5/10 rating if not less. I usually don't review movies but this just made me so p****d off.<br/><br/>Lets start off of acting: It was mostly overacted, especially Boman Irani and Omi Vaidya (aka 'Silencer'). Boman Irani was too bizarre and on the other hand, Omi Vaidya, who was supposed to have a good English accent (or did I get it wrong?) had an accent of a typical South Indian person. In fact, South Indians usually have a better accent from my experience. Aamir, Kareena, Sharman and Madhavan were OK (almost overacted), nothing special.<br/><br/>Screenplay/script? Bad. Very bad. Repeats the old boring jokes and offers nothing unique. Looking at the fact they had an advantage of getting the idea off a novel, makes the movie even worse. The whole movie was a combination of stupid jokes which didn't make me laugh one bit (maybe hardly 2 seconds). It almost made me asleep.<br/><br/>And about people actually rating this movie high, clearly they don't have much sense about how to judge a movie. Its a shame to see a movie like this getting so much attention while there are many others which are WAY better don't get what the deserve.<br/><br/>May be I'm not looking this from a Indian-movie point of view. When you compare to other Indian movies, its actually not bad.

Kareena looks good but would get a 3 out of 5 for acting. <br/><br/>The film begins with the entry of our threesome in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high- pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference. <br/><br/>So, you have the threesome embroiled, time and again, in a confrontation with authority, as represented through the domineering figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), the unsmiling Principal who venerates the cuckoo because the bird's life begins with murder. Kill the competition, because there is only one place at the top, believes the Princi. Poor, mistaken Princi! Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duhs in real life and non- conformists (Rancho and Rocket Singh Inc), who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills.<br/><br/>This would easily get a 9.5 out of 10. Don't be an idiot and skip this movie!"
"tashkhelbo","2","16","41","9 January 2010"," Another Munnabhai...Nothing great.
","No...Its not Sholay or Lagaan or even Hum Aapke Hain Kaun or Gadar. No I am not comparing with them. After noticing lots of popularity I was also pulled into the hype. But was disappointed to see another movie like Munnabhai. Same College and Principal and hospital etc. Not fresh story at all. Lots of old jokes. Some sequences are absurd. 3 idiots can take a old patient to Hospital but cannot take a pregnant woman and applies their engineering knowledge to deliver a baby. They can gather the whole college but not a single girl to deliver a baby. Like I said...its a good bollywood masala movie but nothing great. I don't know why some people are surprised about Aaamir's acting as a college boy. His face is still boyish and suits these kind of roles. May I ask in which film he looked like a Man? Arshad Warsi could have done better job in this movie. Now the good things. There were some good dialogues and good acting from Sharman Joshi(Raju) and Omi Vaidya(Ramalingam). This movie is Chatur Ramalingam's. The producers are clever to market the movie like Ghazni and make their money. After few days we audiences will look back and think how they made fool of us. This movie is worth watching only in DVDs."
"vishwanath-xyz","1","11","26","11 May 2013"," Not an EPIC movie
","Its been while that this movie is out. There are many better movies made in the Indian film industry which have a far better script and a story line than this movie. I was quite surprised to see this movie of IMDb 250 list, doesn't deserve it at all. Probably a movie like Lagaan or Jodha Akbar might have been a better choice over 3 Idiots which basically is for the younger generation and like most of the movies delivers a common message. I am not quite sure how it got 8.1..The most ridiculous part was the delivery of a baby using a vacuum cleaner, common people who are watching not dumb, can they point out a single instance. That scene almost ruined the movie. Overall, it is just an outright commercial movie for the youth and the masses, nothing fantastic."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>There are only 3 good things i can say about ""3 Idiots"" (2009): 1. It was a well-intentioned 2. It was not a bad movie 3. I FINALLY finished watching it.<br/><br/>It got me one and half week to actually finish watching this highly overwritten, over acted, Uber-sentimental, highly predictable, over produced tear-jerker, not funny ""good feel"" / ""comedy"". The only reason why i even started to watching it was its high position in IMDb Top 250 movies. WHAT is this thing even doing in IMDb Top 250? This year i saw bunch of movies better by many, many, many (and did i said MANY?) moons and oceans then this... ""stuff"". To be honest, i think i know exactly what is this flick doing in IMDb Top 250 - but i will keep my opinion just to not offend anyone. Can't remember last time i had my eyes rolling like every 5-10 min during the whole ""experience"". <br/><br/>That said, i don't watch Bollywood movies, this is my probably first one, so maybe here lies the reason why i didn't like it at all. Everything is just so ""offbeat"" - and not in a good way. Music is so over written and over used, comedy timing isn't good, although it got me couple of times smiling, this is not a funny movie, well unless... again, i will keep my opinion by myself. <br/><br/>Overall, if you are like 10 years old and do like Bollywood movies, you will probably love it, but anyone else beyond that age or those who don't like movie production from that country - stay away, far away from this flick. And one more thing - i kinda doing marathon of movies from IMDb Top 250, and at the moment i saw like ~203 of them and was intended to see them all. Until this moment there wasn't a poor movie to say the least, and lowest score i gave in the past from any movie from IMDb Top 250 was 8. ""3 Idiots"" is the worst from anything i saw yet, and to think that there are more Bollywood production inside of this great list keeps my head spinning - i don't think i will be able to ""experience"" such a movie again, although i still considering to do the list... God have mercy."

"Barnali_Saha","Null","6","12","27 December 2009"," ""Aal izz well"" with the 3 Idiots!
","Chetan Bhagat's ""Five Point Someone"" may not be called a literary masterpiece, but it sure is entertaining with its guffaws and its Indianized English. I read the book a while back, and I was highly impressed by the author's straightforward and vitriolic views about the sagacious education system. Bhagat had introduced Ryan Oberoi to play the role of the rebel, an anarchist who wanted to do away with the grumpy system of education prevailing in India. Ryan was never his protagonist; he simply played the second fiddle in the book. It was Hari, the mundane narrator of the book who was the hero. But things turned topsy-turvy when Bollywood walked into the scene to dramatize the already dramatic story of Five Point Someone. And then when in the book everything went happily ever after with the three idiots, namely Ryan, Hari, and Alok, Bollywood begot its own idiots Farhaan (R. Madhavan), Raju (Sharmaan Joshi) and Rancho (Aamir Khan)the great for its new cinematic endeavor 3 Idiots .<br/><br/>3 Idiots can be summed up in one word as extremely majestic. It surely will make you laugh your guts out with its slapstick jokes, its funny sequences, its bathetically emotional scenes and make you to shed a tear or two in the emotional sequences. In short, 3 Idiots is a perfect desi dinner for your bulbous eyes which has all the spices in almost perfect proportion. The genetically modified melodrama has all it takes to hit the Indian audiences hard, and I see it topping the charts in no time. The movie definitely followed a major part of the book, only the incidents were either jumbled or heightened for greater effect.<br/><br/>3 Idiot' is a laughter riot right from the first scene where Farhaan fakes a heart attack while onboard an Air India flight to the last scene where Chatur finds out that his role model Mr. Phunsuk Wangdu is none but his college rival Rancho. I especially loved the portrayal of Raju's glum family in black and white. Despite scenes of hilarity, 3 Idiots does suffer from backlogs of vague emotions which seem at some portions of the movie vaguely put on, unorganized and unneeded. Another thing that stuck me was the heroic character of Rancho. I know it doesn't look good for the perfect image of a movie if its hero fails to live up to the standard and flunks in exams or scores 5 point something, so Bollywood made Ryan Oberoi (of the book) alias Rancho become the class topper thus bringing forth the idea that we cannot still accept a flawed hero in our movies. In the long run, the act actually exemplified the character of Rancho and brought out the real essence of the movie. But the child delivery scene in the movie was definitely overtly exaggerated. I don't think Chetan Bhagat has ever imagined his Ryan to do a child delivery with the aid of his friends. Since everything is fair in Bollywood and war, such sacrileges add to the vivacity of the movie's plot.<br/><br/>3 Idiots is a star studded affair which presents us with the grand acting skills of stars like Boman Irani as Professor.Viru Sahastrabuddhe or Omi Vaidya as Chatur Ramalingam. But Kareena Kapoor seemed a little unwanted as Pia, she didn't add to the character of the fashion designing student Neha of the book, instead she is here a smart would be doctor who falls for the charm of Rancho out of the blue. One thing that stuck me about the movie is the way the real ages of the stars have been camouflaged fruitlessly. Even though Aamir Khan is a perfectionist as an actor, he seemed a little too old to be an engineering student in his early twenties. Nevertheless, the movie is a first hand example of great filmatography and fabulous humor. Like all Rajkumar Hirani' movie, this one has treats for all its viewers. The peppy song ""Aal izz well"" reminds us of his Munna Bhai movies.<br/><br/>The dialogues used in the movie will definitely come as eye openers to brainless muggers. 3 Idiots deftly bring out the very quintessence of Five Point Someone bringing to light the fatal flaws of the Indian education system. And though at some point Aamir Khan does look like a know-it-all holy spirit inculcating others with his words, he does reciprocate Chetan Bhagat's ideas that the Indian education system lacks creativity and spontaneous love for knowledge. I hope Aamir's words reach the generation next and come as a harbinger of a utopian vision of a new educational system in India. Movies with messages such as this one should be taken as ground breaking attempts to change society.<br/><br/>The movie is an absolute delight when it comes to music. It features a galaxy of beautiful songs shot in great locations. I personally loved ""Behti hawa"" and ""Zoobie doobie"". Overall, 3 Idiots is a wonderfully heartwarming movie that teaches us to stop being mentally troglodytes and introduce creativity in our minds."
"gauravthemystery","6","6","12","30 December 2009"," Clearly the best Hindi movie of 2009.. must watch
","I watched '3 idiots' on the Christmas Day. Being an Aamir Khan fan the expectations were huge. The movie is excellent, absolutely fun filled and hilarious but deviates from its main idea of Education system after the intermission. <br/><br/>The depiction of education system of India is completely true where each and every prof. is interested only in the fact that you have mugged up his lessons on not. Being an IITian myself I can assure you of this. Aamir Khan is awesome, Sharman and Madhavan are also good as usual. Boman Irani rocks again with his stand out performance. Kareena Kapoor is OK considering her not so important role. The stand out scene of this movie is clearly Omi's 'Balatkaar' speech.<br/><br/>But considering Raju Hirani previous works, this movie can't be called his best. Its like Hirani hit a double hundred in his 1st one(Munnabhai MBBS), a 50-60 in his 2nd and a 90* in this.Considering all these, I would go with an 7 out of a 10 and thumbs up for this movie. You can surely spend two hundred bucks, it is worth it."
"moviebuff223","1","29","84","3 January 2010"," nothing great
","OK, now i really don't understand why people are so obsessed with the movie. Aamir khan made it so that does not mean it has a great story. The story is a munnabhai mbbs ripoff. As acting goes a 40+ man pretending to be in college is a pathetic idea. The story is so predictable and annoying.The movie is full of sad jokes which are so not funny. i totally hated the movie. 2hrs 48 mins of my life wasted which could be so better used.The only good acting done was by boman irani or sharman joshi. And i don't care whether chetan bhagat wants credit for the movie because the movie completely sucked. i wasted my money on the movie ticket. And just don't get me started on the songs."
"krisrox","7","4","7","29 February 2016"," A Bollywood for everybody
","Dear hypocrites: If ""Amelie"" and ""Forrest Gump"" can be mainstays of the top 250, so can ""3 Idiots"" - a movie that similarly gets away with a lot of silliness because it's truly endearing and has an unbeatable joie de vivre. It also features a genuinely uplifting message that only hardboiled cynics will fail to appreciate.<br/><br/>Yes, it's probably 45 minutes too long, but on the flip side: the songs are fun, the directing is dynamic, and Aamir Khan pulls out his best Indian Tom Hanks performance. Also, unless you're xenophobic, it's fascinating to see love, dreams and life from an Indian perspective.<br/><br/>If you want to see one Bollywood movie before you die, make it this one. It will make you feel better."

"zaid-hameed","10","4","7","2 July 2014"," Wonderfully Entertainment
","It's hard for me to review this film, as I have not seen a huge number of Indian films--probably no more than a couple dozen. Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.<br/><br/>Like so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since ""3 Idiots"" is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films."

","I really loved this movie. When you don't understand the logic why people around you stress the importance of studies, then probably the best motivational movie around to watch is '3 idiots'. Aamir (Rancho) showed how dedication and hard work in studies can take you to the heights of success. <br/><br/>The movie proved yet again that Aamir is one of the best and creative minds in bollywood. One of the rare movies that keep your guessing and maintains the suspense right through the end.<br/><br/>The movie is a whole package, its about true friendship and love. A must watch movie.

"prayerwisher","10","4","7","14 August 2013"," great movie
","Despite these foibles, '3 Idiots' makes for an enjoyable watch, thanks to the bonhomie cracked up on screen by Aamir, Madhavan and Sharman. Aamir's Rancho is a bouncy, fidgety genius with a golden heart. The 44-year-old actor almost passes off as a 22-year-old collegian, bringing out in his character the juvenile buoyancy and vivacity few actors of his age can. Madhavan and Sharman give ample support from the flanks, but a word of praise needs to be reserved for Sharman who shines equally in dramatic as well as funny scenes. Kareena, sadly, has been relegated to a corner but makes her presence felt in a few well-enacted sequences, but it's Boman Irani who comes up with the best performance in the ensemble with his brilliant portrayal of an eccentric professor. His jawline protruded, his brows pursed, his gait ungainly, his speech lisped, Irani is every bit the vile and virulent Virus he's supposed to be."

"abhishekjoshi84","6","7","15","1 January 2010"," An average movie which still is better than most of the comedies which rolled out this year in Bollywood (Yes, that's the sorry state of Bollywood these days!).
","Chetan Bhagat's novel on which it is loosely based, is not a literary masterpiece but it succeeds in selling what it promises. I think a more serious, drama with subtle humor approach should have been used to make a good movie out of that novel. What we have got in 3 Idiots is another addition to the streak of mindless comedies. One movie genre which has suffered the most in recent years is comedy and movies like 'Jane bhi do yaron' or even 'Andaz apna apna' or many of the Hrishikesh Mukherjee's movies are not made anymore. What we get these days is run of the mill gags with jokes copied from youtube (Search 'funny student at exam hall' if you want to see an example).<br/><br/>Rajkumar Hirani has tried to emulate the success of Munnabhai films by using the same formula but has tried to pull one too many a stunt this time. Munnabhai movies were fresh, something new always works! Repeating same thing over and over is what killed 3 Idiots. Amir tries hard and gets away with it but definitely younger actors could have done a better justice. Madhavan as an actor and narrator fails big time in this movie. An actor like Sharman Joshi who has done quite decent job till now in comedies isn't given much meat in his role. In fact I would have loved to see him do the role of Rancho! Boman Irani's character is straight out of a cartoon book and its not funny at all. Surprisingly, Kareena Kapoor has done a very good job in the smaller than others role she got. It seems she succeeds in carrying this role forward from Jab We Met!<br/><br/>Finally, I would say that this movie has soul, it has a message(in fact may be one too many ;) but it lacks execution. It fails to stick to this message with heart because of senseless and unbelievable comic scenes which are forcefully thrusted to get some quick laughs but ultimately prove to be roadblocks in the storyline. Many situations in the movie are so hard to believe that you can only gulp them down if the movie was a spoof which it is not. I have seen(and have been a part of) much crazier things when I was in engineering college but still what they show here is simply stupid.<br/><br/>Watch this movie if you want to relax and watch some mindless comedy where you have to apply your brain... 6/10 for me."

"kunalkhandwala","10","7","15","27 December 2009"," A landmark entertainer in Indian Cinema!
","""Chase excellence and success will follow"". This is what Rancho (Aamir Khan) preaches in 3 Idiots and Rajkumar Hirani delineates the ideology with such adroitness in every aspect that it marks a monumental event for Indian cinema. In terms of the sheer inspiration that it instigates, this film resembles the greats of 'Rang De Basanti', 'Taare Zameen Par' and the 'MunnaBhai' series while being the most entertaining film after 'Andaz Apna Apna'. After introducing simple but relevant concepts like 'jaadu Ki jhappi' and Gandhigiri to the population at large, Hirani now teaches us 2 more concepts:<br/><br/>Consoling the heart by saying 'all is well' may not solve your problems but it will give you the courage to face them. Being an 'idiot' in an institution that chases grades and success is absolutely fine if you are in the pursuit of gaining knowledge and exploring your own talent to its potential. Our system needs to evolve in order to encourage us to pursue what we really want to do with our lives. As Rancho rightly criticizes the Director of the ICE about the college having produced numerous rankers but not a single student who has been creative enough to invent anything with what he has learned. <br/><br/>2 of the idiots, Farhan (R. Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi) leave everything they're up to and along with their dorky college buddy Chatur (Omi Vaidya) begin a journey in search of their long lost friend Rancho, who left them abruptly several years ago. This beautiful journey through Shimla, Manali and Ladakh sends Farhan down memory lane to reminisce the manner in which a free spirited 'Rancho' entered their lives and changed them forever. <br/><br/>The non-conformist Rancho rightly questions authority that suppresses free thinking. Every class that he attends is a revelation of sorts for the professor and the students alike. Through outrageously funny incidents and scenes, Rancho gradually changes the way his friends run the relentless race. His influence even spreads to the director's daughter Pia (Kareena Kapoor), leading to even more outrage for the Virus. Through all the hilarious series of events, Hirani also voices his ideologies in some deeply moving scenes to give us an insight into the flaws of the educational system. Its demands are severe on students who are forced by parents who dream for them on their behalf and families that live in sheer misery hoping for the son to become a money-making engine. The latter is humorously depicted as a typical 1950s family in black and white melodrama that makes you sympathize and laugh at the same time. Touch of genius there...<br/><br/>Even after a shocking twist at the end of first half, the film continues its pace while never losing the steam of entertainment. The film's climax is shot in the spectacular landscapes of Ladakh. Speaking of which, the cinematography CK Muraleedharan is outstanding! After painstaking attempts to shoot at the heavenly location, he did manage to catch it in all its majestic splendor. His work overall gives a real, enriching look to the film. <br/><br/>Shantanu Moitra's music WILL not sound like the most appealing when listened to prior to watching the film. It is the manner in which the songs are timed in the storyline and the relevance of the lyrics with the characters that enables the music to grow on you. Give me some sunshine and Behti hawa are the examples of this. All is well was a super-hit from the on-set itself with its catchy theme. <br/><br/>As the usual case is with Hirani's films, the performances are impeccable. Boman Irani as the oppressive director must feel at home with his role as a dean but he still has the ability to impress us with his remarkable portrayal of Virus. Kareena Kapoor has proved her talent in a role that did not require her Kambaqt Ishq attire but rather her true self as a good actress who, when given the right role to work with can prove to be worthy. Omi Vaidya is a discovery here. His speech on stage is one of the most hilarious moments in movies and his inept Hindi and dorky behavior are aspects of his brilliant performance. R. Madhavan shows finesse and a lot of confidence in playing his character. His scene with his father, Parikshit Sahni is the epitome of his performance. Sharman Joshi has displayed his comfort with comedy before and it is a delight to watch him repeat his act from Rang De Basanti rather than that of his other films. Aamir Khan once again, shines light on a rich, well scripted character. His brilliance levels with his commitment as an actor. He proves yet again that true performances only come with understanding and studying the character that one has to portray. He frankly has too many noteworthy scenes but he is at his best while confronting the impregnable Virus. He is the voice of Hirani's ideas and creativity and an astounding personification of a character only he could've played with such virtuosity.<br/><br/>But 3 Idiots is not all about how great Aamir was. This film is extraordinary because it gets the most rudimentary part of film making right - the screenplay and script. With the combined talents of Abhijat Joshi and himself (story, screenplay, dialogs), Hirani's basics in film making achieve overall perfection. There is something unique and entertaining happening in every scene and you would kick yourself if you take a restroom break.<br/><br/>It would suffice to say that 3 Idiots is a landmark film and is set to become one of the biggest blockbusters by the virtues of Rajkumar Hirani and that of his immensely talented team including some of the finest actors. This film deserves multiple viewing and you know what?.... You'd still want to watch it again.<br/><br/>9.505 on a scale of 1-10."

","Superbly made movie. All actors have done a splendid job but as always Aamir has acted his heart out. His performance stands out...one of his top 3 performances I would say...<br/><br/>What makes this movie special is the way facts (positive as well as negative) about our education system have been put forth. Serious issues like students committing suicide under the pressure of performing well in the academics make you sad, concerned and angry at the same time. <br/><br/>Another point to be noted is, Rajkumar Hirani has done an exceptional job in getting a college student out of all 3 actors (Aamir, Madhavan and Sharman)<br/><br/>I strongly recommend watching this movie. Don't miss it."
"rajandey","10","7","15","26 December 2009"," 3 Idiots, Hattrick from Rajkumar Hirani!
","I saw this movie on the first day of it's release. My expectations were terribly high from this movie since the Rajkumar Hirani's last two outings were absolute rock solid products in Indian cinema. Somehow Rajkuamr Hirani managed to make 3 Idiots so damn good that he surpassed my expectations! First of all, the casting.. though we have seen Aamir, Sharman and Madhavan in Rang De Basanti together, they still look very fresh together, maybe it is because of the college factor and mainly because Aamir seriously looks like a student in this movie. Boman Irani just had to be part of this movie because he was also there in Raju's last two. Kareena is also there.<br/><br/>The performances, Aamir has performed brilliantly. He is the total package in this movie! We all know how dedicated Aamir is towards his movies and roles. Aamir analysed the body language of the youth nowadays, the way they talk, and all the connecting details and he implemented them in his acting, which is very visible. He also manages to look 21 when he is actually 43 while shooting this movie! Aamir delivers a power performance, each time Aamir enters the screen you feel immense energy and know your either going to laugh really hard or enjoy the sequence that is going to come! R. Madhavan is very very impactful as Farhan and delivers a great performance, he is known for his impact in movies, even when he has a small role. Well in this one he has a big role, which is only better! Sharman Joshi is absolutely convincing as Raju, the guy that has so much pressure on him. His expressions and everything are marvelous and I thoroughly enjoyed him in this one.<br/><br/>Boman Irani is fantastic yet again, he surpasses all his previous performances and sets a new milestone in his own career. He is just great! Kareena is there for a few minutes, and is effective, though she should have been there more! The concept of the movie is absolutely amazing, we all know Rajkumar Hirani makes movies with a great entertainment value, but at the same time an intelligent social message. He is able to do that again this time, and how! Rajkumar also sends a new hype into the population of India, with Munnabhai MBBS it was the ""Jaadu ki jhappi"", with Lage Raho Munnabhai it was ""Gandhigiri"", and with 3 Idiots it is ""Aaaaal izzz well!!"". I am already using this line on a daily basis, lol! The music of the movie is great, Shantanu Moitra's songs always grow on people slowly, after coming from the movie, all the tracks have been stuck on my head, plus point for sure! The cinematography is top notch again, they have shot at a real college, with real students around. Which creates a very convincing atmosphere in every sequence! The editing of the movie is very very good.<br/><br/>All in all, 3 Idiots has impressed me so much, that I am willing to say this is the best Bollywood movie I have seen YET! A true milestone in the history of Indian Cinema.<br/><br/>GO WATCH IT WHILE YOU STILL CAN! P.S. There are some ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS sequences in the movie that are going to make you cry because of laughter for sure! 100/10"

Even if some may be unaware of this fact, there are many iconic personalities which provide same message through their life achievements that education is no hindrance to one's success.Dhirubhai Ambani and Sachin Tendulkar are such iconic personalities.<br/><br/>Rocket Singh gives same message in the earlier part of the movie without boring the audience.This makes Rocket Singh a must watch movie."

They go off in search for Rancho but there's a secret. In flashbacks, they are freshmen as mechanical engineering students. Rancho refuses to submit to hazing from upperclassmen and the dictatorial teaching methods of Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe. Rancho's rebellious nature win over Farhan and Raju. He rails against Virus' pressure after a student's suicide. He falls for Virus' daughter Pia.<br/><br/>I don't think Rancho works completely. He's too perfect like a mythical creature. He's a magical nerd. The movie needs to build up this high pressure world a lot better before it can tear it down. I can guess at what this movie is striving for but I don't see it as funny or compelling. There is also a great twist in the middle and one at the end which is easily foreseeable from a mile away. The middle twist should be a better exposition. There should be a better story and a better journey to find Rancho.

","When did the last time you had the feeling while watching a Bollywood movie that you are watching the best film ever and then suddenly after the movie gets over you start to get mixed feelings about the movie you saw. Admit it; it has frequently been this way. And then what do you do, you go to watch the movie repeatedly to reinstate your earlier feeling about the movie. The hysteria and invincibility that Bollywood makers manage to create in their storytelling, is what makes it so special. '3 Idiots' is the latest of such hysterical movie with such aura around it.<br/><br/>Rajkumar Hirani's latest offering is based on a popular cult novel '5 point someone' by Chetan Bhagat'. So, it's easy to have lot of expectations for this film right? Wrong! See, this is not Chetan Bhagat's first novel adaptation to the big screen, it's his second. The first one was a disaster called 'Hello' based on his book 'One night at a Call Center'. Hence, there were lots of apprehensions about his latest book to screen adaptation. But hopes were there for the creative team for the film production and the star of the film Aamir Khan. Both Rajkumar and Aamir have impeccable record and status in the industry. Hence, the opening they got for this film was not surprising, even with the steep Ticket prices. But, when the word of mouth began that this is the best bollywood movie ever made, the expectations crossed the limits. And the film about three engineering students in Imperial College of Engineering (a.k.a. a reference to Indian Institute of Technology) does not disappoint. The story is with difference, but the characters are clichéd and true stereotypes of their species. Even the several of the movie sequences that make us laugh in the movie are far beyond being original. But the story is new and relevant to today's youth. Engineering and medical fields of study has started to take a toll on today's youth and the more than half a dozen student suicides that you would witness and hear in the movie is not at all a overreaction. It is turning into an epidemic; hence this film is definitely important. The young India is lapping up the support this film provides to their cause with great hysteria and is enjoying the many jokes and potshots the movie takes on the countries rigid educational system and social norms. The quirky and over the top turns that the lives of these idiots take is bringing joy and happiness to the young India. I should mention the best written character and surprisingly the best actor of the film 'Chatur'. Chatur is the typical Indian student that one sees around the campuses of Indian Colleges. Played by newcomer Omi Vaidya, it is the character the audience loved to see fail. Though he does not, his sequences have brought cheers across college campuses in India. The hysteria of '3 Idiots' becomes easy to decipher for the Indian audience and hence they are flocking the theater with large numbers and are cheerfully encouraging the next person to go watch the film.<br/><br/>For rest of the world this film is irrelevant and has nothing new to offer in terms of the movie flow and character development. But if they are able to put that aside, they would too probably enjoy the funny moments that this movie provides and would end up saying that this is the best Bollywood film they have ever seen."

"ajay_ramaseshan","8","8","19","29 December 2009"," Over-hyped Movie. Good fun for half the way
","I watched this movie yesterday with my family. To begin with, I quite liked the concept about engineering college and the pressures. There were a lot of funny scenes which had the audience in splits. The comic timing of all the actors Amir, Sharman Madhavan and Boman Irani was really good. Chatur is just remarkable, what a launch for him. And when I came out at the interval i was pretty happy. I thought the film would continue in the same way in the second half.<br/><br/>But the second half was too filmy. I mean what was Javed Jaffry s character doing in the film? His character was most confusing and unbelievable. I felt that the romantic angle was totally unnecessary and a bit forced as if just introduced to put some masala in the flick. Had the writers stuck to the basic plot about fun in college and avoided romantic side-angles, it would have been more crisp and slick.<br/><br/>I thought the film would focus also on all the fun in other years, college fests labs etc. But they missed out on all that. And, the pregnancy scene could have been avoided. That was too ""filmy"". But otherwise, good story with a nice social message about the lopsided educational system in India. Hope some teachers and people involved in the education industry watch this movie and try to do something to correct our outdated, one-sided education system.<br/><br/>There is another thing that stands out in this movie- the cinematography. whether its the college ambiance at IIM Bangalore or Shimla or Ladakh etc. has been nicely captured. Music is also good and keeps you entertained.<br/><br/>That said and done, this movie is just an entertainer.Just leave your brains at home while watching this, especially the in the second half."

","So Amir Khan made a new movie. Since Lagaan I have high expectations of the movies Amir makes, but he cannot keep up with the level he has put with Lagaan.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is annoying. The story is told by one of the idiots. A story telling movie in movies nowadays is not modern anymore. The stupid giggles like the narrator is telling a joke is not funny. Never laugh about your own joke. Every time the narrator talks, it's just like he thinks he's telling a joke very time.<br/><br/>I did not know who in this movie were the idiots. Kareena Kapoor, because she wants to marry a donkey and an other idiot has to open her eyes? Omi Vaidya, because he's running his school for years (like in Mohabbatein) but he does not know how to educate children? What happened with Amir Khan's muscular body from Ghajini? Spoiler: Rancho (Amir Khan) ain't Rancho in real life. So Farhan and Hari want to look where Rancho is, but they find out Rancho is an other guy. They see a school photo, but instead of seeing Amir Khan on the photo, they see that other guy. This can't be, because Farhan and Hari were present on the day the photo was made and Amir Khan was on that photo, not the other Rancho. What were the movie makers thinking? That their audience are idiots too? The movie was too long. I fast forwarded most of the scenes. There were no good songs, so I forwarded every song also. In the beginning Omi Vaidya had a pen that he would give to a student who would be outstanding. From the beginning you know that he will give it to Amir Khan. What teacher lives with his family at school, that when his daughter has to give birth to a child, a student called Rancho has to do the delivery? Omi Vaidya plays a man who has two daughters. Amir Khan plays a student that has no child at all. It is not obvious that Amir Khan did the delivery.<br/><br/>I do not understand why this movie gets an eight on IMDb. It wasn't that great. It has moments where the dialogs were interesting, like the father of one of the idiots did not give his son the laptop, but suggested to buy him a camera instead. But there were moments where the movie was awkward, like the speech what was made and raped by Rancho. Rancho was laughing his ass off when the stupid student recited the speech. Why? He rewrote the speech by himself...<br/><br/>I have higher expectations when it gets to movies from Amir Khan. Oh brother where art thou? This movie was a mixture of ""Patch Adams"" and ""Dead Poets Society"". Bollywood movies in general are not original. Mostly they are copies of Hollywood movies. This one is not original either."

","Never would I have thought that a movie that looked this stupid on paper could have turned out so good. Just looking at the DVD cover would have been enough to turn this film back in but it shows up in IMDb's Top #250 so I thought I'd give it a try. It didn't start out that well for me but before long the movie's magic began to take hold. Not that there's anything daringly new about it's message; it all has to do with believing in one's self and doing what you really want to do with your life after one's formal education is completed.<br/><br/>Aamir Khan is a potent anchor for the story of three college friends attending the Imperial College of Engineering, and Rancho's ideas about success don't revolve around getting the best grades but actually learning something. I could see somebody like a younger Matthew Perry performing the role if this was an American film. I wasn't really expecting as much in the way of music from this story, but with the amount of song and dance you could almost call it a musical. The 'Zoobi Doobi' dance number was quite infectious and looked like a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Another thing that keeps you engaged is the non-linear story telling technique. But the thing is, you never really get confused when the time line changes from ten years ago to present day. With all the humorous situations presented, this could have easily fallen into slapstick, and it did get close at times, but then the story pulled back with a poignant message or a sobering decision one of the characters had to make. Story threads are tied up that one forgets along the way and that's another cool element. I just thought it was a uniquely creative film with a neat twist at the end with the identity of Rancho. There's even a romance thrown in for our principal player, and when it was over, I had the feeling that this is what ""La La Land"" could have been but never came close."
"terminator3135","10","3","5","20 September 2015"," My favorite movie of all time
","This is the kind of movie that you can watch over and over again, yet feel like you've never watched it before. The use of comedic flavor and serious drama complement each other perfectly to develop the central theme of the movie (which applies to a lot of people studying in countries where rote memorization is the primary approach used to study). Omi Vaidya is the actor that I felt really stood out in this movie. Aamir Khan and the rest of the core actors did a wonderful job in their roles, but Vaidya presented the perfect impressions of someone who has been corrupted by the flawed educational systems of these Asian countries.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the components, they were absolutely outstanding. Hats off to Hirani and Chopra for meticulously developing a very realistic script and conveying a strong, profound message at the end. I felt that the inclusion of some of the songs was unnecessary, but that's just my opinion. This movie does span almost 3 hours, but the 3 hours will pass by like water roaring down from a waterfall.<br/><br/>Whenever you get a chance, watch this movie.

","I usually don't like movies from India. Specially because of cultural differences between west and east. However, this movie was different. The first half of movie had, indeed, a lot of Indian movie characteristics that made me feel the difference between hollywoodian movies and the bollywoodian - I suppose there is where this movie came from - ones. Besides the funny parts - expected from a self described comedian movie - the movie was disappointing me... until it started the second part. This final part added the drama needed for a perfect movie: it showed us real human problems. Even more: it showed how to solve it. All in a funny way. The main problem of the movie was: should we follow our heart to do what we like in our professional choice or just do what our parents ""suggests""? Other secundary problems - but not less important - were showed as well and all the adventure to solve it made the movie simply beautiful. Highly recommended."
"michelleghislaine","8","3","5","5 January 2015"," A fresh coming of age tale with a big heart!
","I just finished watching 3 Idiots and was rather glad I gave it a chance! The high rating on IMDb roused my attention to its existence, however the title seemed to suggest some slapstick tale (of which I am also partial too from time to time), though as I read the synopsis I became intrigued with the premise of a comedy/drama/Bollywood/musical set mostly in a college campus. I couldn't think of anything I'd ever seen before falling into all of these categories simultaneously and I also felt I needed to give Bollywood a bit more of a chance as my repertoire is quite slim in this department to date! I won't say much about the plot (my summary is about as much as I'd like to give away), as I watched the movie pretty blind of what was to unfold and I really felt swept away in what at times felt like an epic journey of twists and turns; nothing too ridiculous to prompt a 'WTF?!' response, I felt the pace of the film moved really nicely along with realistic and believable scenarios interjected not for shock value but to aid the storytelling. The characters were well fleshed out and I really came to feel a sort of camaraderie with this not altogether hapless but lovable bunch with the main character Rancho, especially likable despite his bad-boy status with the Director of the college 'Virus'. Sometimes I felt a few scenes played out a little like a spoof, feeling slightly cheesy, however I have a feeling some of this vibe came from the cultural gully you often find with having to rely on subtitles (though as another reviewer said, pidgin English is used throughout the film so sometimes you don't need the subtitles). If musicals make you cringe then I guess you may feel a bit like the scenes with sporadic bursting into song are unnecessary, but you have to not only expect this from Bollywood films but also value it as an important part of the storytelling in its own right; plus, the songs in this film are catchy, well crafted and appropriate for the mood attempting to be set. As a final note, if someone was to ask me 'what makes a great movie?', I'd probably answer something like this; It should make me laugh and maybe cry, then come away thinking more about the film and its underlying meanings. Characters should be well formed enabling me to fall in love with them (or even begin to hate them) so, caring if they live or die; to feel their pain and joy and be able to absorb myself into their adventure as though just one of the gang. The look of a film should make me want to make screen-shots just so I could take a closer look at the subtle fleeting beauty that is a single frame, and together, the mosaic of images creating a flow so appealing to the eye that it lends a resonance to the script and plot without distracting you from the deeper message. With that in mind I'd say '3 Idiots' succeeded on many levels and left me feeling satisfied, unlike many highly praised blockbusters of late which have left me feeling jaded and apathetic. There are a couple of scenes where, should I dare say it, 'The Sound of Music' came to mind, though I won't say why other than perhaps the beautiful scenery and the innocent feel to the actions of the characters in comparison to the overly sassy and promiscuous teenager of many Hollywood films these days. Overall, I think my score of 8 is fair given how the movie made me feel, it's lasting impression on me and the fact that I could easily watch it again- perhaps even adding it to my favorites list. I would recommend others to give it a go, even if you're not partial to musicals or Bollywood, or subtitles- so what?! You can always be surprised and I have a feeling you might be!"

There are 30 years old human beings pretending to be 18 years old students. All of a sudden they started to shake and spin. Also those men cries for nearly everything. woke up in the morning, starts crying. every possible solution for any kind of difficulties they encountered is suicide or dance. after that they cry. i agree it's their style. everybody is free to have things in the way they like but please just don't overrate it. i mean, i think transformers is awful but at least there are some cgi is going on there. man, i can't imagine i will say this. one last thing, it's unbelievably long.

","The story had just one positive message (study because you enjoy it, not for a degree) and the rest of the movie was sloppily put together with lots clichés, very little character development and no great thought process.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie was the number of suicides that were portrayed. Are we teaching our kids weakness, that if they face difficulties in life the way out is suicide??? <br/><br/>Instead of showing will power strength when faced with difficulties, the movie went with over simplifications. Instead of telling ""when the going gets tough, the tough get going"" (The movie portrayed exactly the opposite, just to sensationalize and get raw emotional response from the audience, they used suicides). It is a very difficult even to try to understand why a person takes his life, what his emotional state must be, what his physiological balance must be.... and to over simplify the way they did in the movie is just plain irresponsible, sensationalism and poor poor poor story writing. Moreover the theme was repeated throughout the movie 3 times if I am not mistaken. <br/><br/>The difference is, in our movies we like to portray weakness as a virtue.... and that is with our society too. That is what the movie wanted to fight: The social weakness Cliché--Become an engineer or else everything in life will fail. They did fight that point, but justified character weakness, will power weakness.<br/><br/>The other point of the movie that bothered me was, are we trying to condone misbehavior. If we insult someone, are we not responsible for our actions? Should they be forgiven for misbehaving at someones house the way they did (peeing in front of the house, destroying property), just because they were drunk or whatever? Everyone is responsible for his actions and has to face the consequences. That is what justifies a civilized society from primitives. Forgiving misbehavior, is telling kids its okay to misbehave and steal. So what was so wrong when the professor showed them every action has consequences? He was trying to build character. But instead the movie glorifies the character weakness of the kids.<br/><br/>I know that Aamir khan tries to make movies with a socially conscious message, he is probably the only one who is trying in the industry. I wish he puts more thought into his movie next time cause he might be capable of making an intelligent movie, instead of falling short."

","3 Idiots is a Bollywood film directed by Rajkumar Hirani, it stars Aamir Khan, R. Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Kareena Kapoor,Boman Irani.Is loosely based on Chetan Bhagat's novel Five Point Someone.<br/><br/>And this time Rajkumar Hirani failed. Munnabhai series was much better than his 3 idiots. Nothing fresh, contents are outdated and its a shame to five point someone.<br/><br/>Film is about the story of Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and Rancho (Aamir Khan) are three engineering students who all share the same room in a hostel at one of the best colleges in India. Farhan and Raju are from modest backgrounds, Rancho is a wealthy genius who studies for joy(So weird). Threatened by Rancho's talent, ViruS(Boman irani) labels him an ""idiot"" and attempts on a number of occasions to destroy his friendship with Farhan and Raju. Meanwhile, Rancho falls in love with ViruS' daughter Pia. Farhan and Raju dare Rancho to tell Pia he loves her, and when they go to her house, Raju gets drunk and makes sure the mailbox says ""ViruS"" and peeing on it. ViruS sees Raju and they are caught in class, he tells Raju that either him or Rancho gets rusticated, unable to make a decision, Raju attempts suicide, only to be saved by Rancho, Farhan, and Pia. Finally, dramatically Farhan's dad lets him become a wild life photographer, and Raju gets a job.<br/><br/>The story is framed as a flashback from the present day, Farhan fakes a heart attack to abort a plane because he gets a call from Chatur(Silencer) saying Rancho has come. Raju leaves in a hurry without any pants getting the same call.All three of them search for Rancho. They come to a village and find out that Rancho was actually a gardener's son and when his father died, a rich man took him in. The real Rancho is Javed Jaffrey and their Rancho's real name is Chhote. When Rancho couldn't pass his exams, his father not wanting him to fail in life sent Chhotte as Rancho to get his son a degree and leave. Farhan and Raju interrupt Pia's wedding and take her along to find Rancho. They find he is a teacher. Also, chatur be more richer when he signs a deal with Phunsukh Wangdu, a world famous scientist. But everyone realizes that Rancho is actually Phunsukh Wangdu himself.<br/><br/>This movie offers nothing new, a typical bollywood film with no creativity, u will get irritated when Boman Irani speaks, also in Pia's sisters delivery scene. Engineering students with the help of a webcam and vacuum cleaner they take out kid from her stomach. What a disaster.<br/><br/>Only during first half of the movie you can enjoy, Raju Hirani's dialogs are excellent and Shantanu Moitra's music cool.<br/><br/>Performance wise, Madhavan and Kareena Kapoor did a justice to their role. Both Aamir and Sharman overacted. In every scene you can find Aamir khan crying. Aamir didn't even tried to deliver 5% of Lagaan or DCH, very badly imitated walking style of college boys. <br/><br/>I give 5 out of 10 for Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots."

","I first watched this movie while on vacation, staying at my aunt and uncle's house. As this was the movie they chose to watch one night, I was preparing to drag myself to endure a painfully long, three-hour drama. However, I've found it to be very engaging and entertaining.<br/><br/>In this film, Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi want to re-unite with college friend Rancho and recounted their college days at New Delhi's Imperial College of Engineering, recalling the memories of Rancho, who inspired them to think differently, their run-ins with the fiery college dean Viru Sahastrabudhe and their encounters with another student, Chatur Ramalingam, who reminds them of a bet they had made 10 years ago.<br/><br/>This is the first and only Bollywood movie I have seen and while I am not a big fan of drama, Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijit Joshi wrote a very inspiring story for the film that kept me entertained, covering friendship, sacrifices, relationships, antics, secrets, rivalries and struggles in the movie. Hirani took good care making each scene of the movie captivating and intriguing while directing, keeping the plot's momentum going strong even for a three-hour movie, and assembled a likable cast of characters - each delivering solid performances.<br/><br/>I enjoyed watching the antics and misadventures the three friends go through during their college days, fumbling through exam notes and cramming in science projects, striving to reach success. Rancho's little romantic relationship with Pia is also a treat to watch, ***minor spoiler ahead*** especially when, unbeknown-st to Rancho, that she is the daughter of the dean. ***minor spoiler ends*** The songs sung in the film is wonderful to listen to - very catchy and fun - and the cinematography is very vibrant and colorful.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a very captivating and heartfelt film from start to finish, sure to bring you laughter and tears. You can't help but follow along and pretend you are there with the three friends' journey in life. A highly recommended movie! <br/><br/>Grade A"
"lasttimeisaw","6","10","27","6 January 2011"," 3 Idiots
","First of all, I rarely watch Indian films; secondly, I think this highly-praised Indian film is overrated. There is no doubt this film is a quite entertaining one, but nearly nothing special is worth mentioning here, one can easily feel that the director exaggerate to stuff all kinds of popular elements in its 160 minutes (I like the songs though), universities' educational method, the genuine friendship, money is not the most important item in the world (don't marry an over-materialized man), a choice between what I want to do and what parents want me to do, blah blah blah....<br/><br/>The film deals with a quite grand topic, the meaning of life, and luckily its scholastic didactics has not reached my threshold of intolerance, as a result I enjoyed most of its screen time, however, my absent-mindedness did come forth several times. <br/><br/>Actually the general principles which the film tried so hard to convey are conventional, everybody knows, what the film achieved is to manifest it in a perfect cinematographic world where everything is too idealized to happen in our mundane world. Lack of empathy and a shoddy script makes the film fade like a forgettable fairytale.<br/><br/>All the characters are stereotyped, the suspenses do not persist long enough and the whole film is skimpy of plausible explanations for most its plots. Still I give a 6/10, an eligible rate, thanks to Aamir Khan's lovable performance. I don't think the film represents the highest standard of contemporary Indian films, nevertheless the inconvenient truth is that it failed to encourage me to watch more Indian films at the same time, what else can I do? There are numerous films are waiting in lines for me to watch, I don't want to waste my very limited time."

I liked this one more than ""Like Stars on Earth"" I am a teacher and in this movie there are great messages for all teachers and especially for parents. Education is the most important thing to have a bright future. Not only for people, also for countries. ""3 Idiots"" show the importance of correct educational choices and how teachers and parents play a very important role. The movie gives that message in an entertaining way but also touch people's heart. Although the movie is about India and Indian educational system, so similar problems happen every corner of the world. After I watched this movie, I knew I would watch it again.

The whole cast was great every actor played his character very well specially (Boman Irani) and (Aamir Khan) for being 44 years old and performing a younger character with almost no changes in age. This movie is awesome not because of one actor or a couple of actors, it is a joint effort of every member of this movie. The director was good for assigning these actors to play those characters, and the music was good. This was my first time to watch an Indian movie and it's not going to be the last.

"sherlock_einstien","8","4","8","12 July 2013"," For smiting those who are lame enough to give this movie a one or a two star rating
","An experience to behold. This movie evoked the extremities of my emotions. Most here on IMDb have appropriately lauded this flick, so any more appreciation on my part will simply turn out to be quite monotonous. I have penned this review to ponder aloud on the narrow lives of those who hated this flick enough to give it a one star rating.<br/><br/>Frankly, I did not find more than one or two of the one-star reviews genuine. There is this one guy that compares this movie to the other top 250 movies on IMDb. How lame is that! I mean I have known only professional critics juxtapose movies just so that they could rank them; they are simply forced to compare movies. And judging by that particular person's command over the language and his lack of technical knowledge, he was not even remotely associated with any major critic; why then that absurd comparison? This same guy also cited something about the movie liked by 'mainstream dumb folk'. This comment in itself is dumb. Did he know that Shawshank Redemption was a mainstream flick, and that it was rated highly by the same 'mainstream dumb folks'? You are on IMDb for Satan's sake; this is the place where people other than professional critics rate movies. If I was forced to think like critics, I would say that there are more than a couple of movies better than 'Shawshank..'; Pulp Fiction, The Dark Knight, City of God, The Godfather, to name a few. Hope you get the point.<br/><br/>There were a couple of other guys who actually slammed the acting. I wonder, do they even know anything about acting? Being an actor of a small repute myself, I would have no qualms against the acting prowess of the performers, apart from a negligible few areas that needed improvement. And from a consumer's eyes, they made me believe, and there is no higher praise than that.<br/><br/>Well, if they are hard-to-please enough to rate the movie a one, why didn't any of them comment on the direction? That is because either there were hardly any points in regards with direction that they could criticize, or they are not literate enough to even know anything about direction.<br/><br/>There was this other guy that liked 'Five Point Someone' more. He felt that the movie didn't do justice to the novella. I can only say that the person's list of favorite books would most certainly not be to my taste. I obviously won't say this unless I had read the book, and I wonder how it was successful commercially. The movie is way better than the book. Hell, I shouldn't even be comparing the two.<br/><br/>Some other guys claimed that the movie wasn't realistic. Now, since when has the Dark Knight, The Lord of the Rings, The Godfather, Shawshank, Psycho, or Casablanca - I could go on and on - been realistic. Some of them may have been based on a real phenomenon, but they certainly were not out-and-out realistic. We watch and appreciate these movies just for the cinematic experience they offer. So don't give that realism crap. Movies are meant to be a figment of someone's imagination depicted artistically.<br/><br/>Some even quoted the movie's similarity to Munnabhai MBBS. Wow, I don't see where that has come from. It's like 'Django Unchained' is 'Reservoir Dogs' all over again. Wake up call! They are two entirely different movies.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on other haphazard criticisms. There were only 2 or 3 people in the one-two star club that convinced me in regards to their rating. Others seemed more like wannabes or trolls, or simply sad souls. I gave this film 8 stars, and dropped 2 stars primarily because of the songs, and its unnecessary larger-than-life portrayal. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie."

"3xHCCH","8","4","8","14 August 2011"," My Intro to Bollywood: Comedy, Musical, Melodrama in One
","I watched ""3 Idiots"" upon the recommendation of my cousin. I believe this is the first complete Bollywood film I have seen. <br/><br/>""3 Idiots"" is a film that goes from the present time, to flashbacks of the lead characters' college days in engineering school. Pals Raju (Sharman Joshi) and Fahran (Madhavan) are looking for their best friend Rancho (Aamir Khan) with whom they have lost contact since graduation. Amidst the juvenile school jokes and musical scenes in bathrooms, the story is sending a serious message that learning is more than just rote memorization. Life is about following your own dreams. It also tells us not to face life with fear, overly relying on religion and charms.<br/><br/>There are so many over-the-top scenes in this film which runs more than 2 and a half hours! There was a long scene about a speech where the word ""served"" was switched with something considerably more vulgar. Funny but went on too long. This may be funnier for people who speak Hindi than those of us who rely on translation. There was a very long scene about a storm, a brownout and someone giving birth. Dramatic but again overstretched and unbelievable. There was also an unexpected sequence about suicide that did not sit well with me in this supposed comedy.<br/><br/>I personally liked the simpler poignant scenes that deliver a bigger punch, like the scene with the Prof. Virus and the pen, the scene with Fahran and his dad, the final revelation scene at the end. There were also some nice scenes with Rancho and the young doctor Pia about her fiancé who seemed to be more concerned about how expensive things were, than about her. <br/><br/>""3 Idiots"" is generally fun to watch, except when the jokes became too toilet or too mean for comfort. There was a lot of suspension of disbelief at the time sequences of a lot of what happened, sometimes not too logical. I could not believe that the actor who played Rancho, Aamir Khan, was actually already in his mid-40s, and yet there he was still credibly playing a college student. Overall though, I did enjoy this, my introduction to Bollywood film. Time to discover more about movies from this part of the world."

Nice story, nice narration, superb acting and great direction. I was hoping the movie wasn't a remake of the book and was glad to see that the basic characters and storyline were picked up and everything else was original. The actors were very believable in their roles - not for once did they look any older than students barely out of their teens and blended really well into their characters. The movie keeps you so into itself and had so much to offer that when interval came, I started wondering what could they come up with for the second half but they came back with something even better!<br/><br/>The story is of 3 guys - Aamir Khan as Rancho, Sherman Joshi as Raju and R. Madhavan as Farhan going through their 4 years in an engineering college and beyond. All throughout the movie they were their characters and not actors.

It all fits together and you can totally relate to the characters whether or not you went through those 4 years of engineering college like I did. The storytelling is brilliant and it doesn't have second which I found boring or felt like forwarding.<br/><br/>Music is nice - not great but it fits with the movie.

","Now a days people have the tendency to overreact to some good movies. Like in the case of Dark Knight, which was a good movie but not the immortal classic. Same thing goes here, this one is a good movie, sometimes u see movies to relax yourself. This is a good entertainer.<br/><br/>But for a movie to become a classic or the top 250 of all time as some people say, u got to have something which you won't forget for the rest of your life. But 3 idiots lacked such substance. The movie's theme is good. The educational system of India is rotten. I perfectly agree to it. Even more the perspective of the common man to their children's education is pathetic, in my eyes. The movie really conveyed that idea. <br/><br/>But let me ask you a question. Didn't Aamir Khan act in a movie called Taare Zameen Par, which sort of conveyed the same idea. That movie was good. It had heart. 3 Idiots is old wine in new bottle. The wine still tastes good.You can buy it, no problem. But don't b fooled. Don't think its new imported wine. Its still the old one.<br/><br/>If only the director was a little bit more realistic, I think I would have liked the movie much better.

They are not that funny, they tend to run much too long, and they are loaded with bright colors and silly songs. That may make them fun, but it does not make them good.

Well Hirani's directing totally shifted my views not only on Indian cinema but also helped me understand and appraciate Indian culture. For me it was easy to relate with the struggles of the charecters to face their family's plans for them as well as to survive the rat race that our lives have turned into, in spite of the fact that I have no asian background.

It is a very good film, which tells a bit about the pressure that students suffer in universities, pressure from teachers and family, the movie does it very well, arises every time the question should I do what I want or what society wants me to do, it really is a film that makes us think about it. Who's student will identify much with the film. The main actors are fantastic and do very well its role, giving emphasis to the 'Rancho' Shamaldas Chanchad played by Aamir Khan, the film revolves a lot around this character and it just improves the value of the film.

It couldn't get higger! Loosely based on hlockbuster novel ' Five Point Someone ' hy Chetan Bhagat the movie deals with the present education system in India that whether getting more marks and better grades is better than gaining knowledge and is mugging up everything more use ful than understanding it. The movie has many hilarious scenes and everyone in the film form Aamir to Boman Irani to Omi Vaidya were su perb in their roles. Aamir has outdone himself. Never in the film he has looked 44 year old... Film's music sounds mediocre hut when viewed on the screen then the music sounds perfect.. Cinematography is awesome and so is the direction.. Raju Hirani's screenplay(you can easily ignore a few loose points) is a master piece and the film will achieve cult status for engineering students in a short period of time.. It has the soul which Five Point Someone had.. It is easily Aamir Khan's finest f ilm to date.. The film's climax is fantahulous and is a shocker.. It takes everyone hy surprise.

","I am not usually interested in Indian movies since they are always too long with little content to be watched, but this film has totally blew me away from the Bollywood impression.
It lasts for almost 3 hours but every minute was worth watching. The main actor played his part in such a genuine way and the incidents make perfect sense. I cried and laughed throughout the film for countless times because it is naturally relatable. This film is comedy but you will feel everything from the soul.
I never rated a film 10 out of 10 but this one is an exception, not for its perfection but for how it makes us want to live imperfectly but in our very way.

","This blast of a Bollywood movie tells about two friends travelling with their old enemy in search of their college roommate, who they have not seen since graduation day. During their travel they reminiscence about their college days, and let's just say that those days did not suffer from a lack of excitement.<br/><br/>The film is very much a comedy, but it has undertones of satire when it comes to India's school system and the way students are so pushed to excel, to get good grades, to get a good jobs, to provide for their families through success, that it often leads to self-destructive throughts and behaviour.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, for the most part the focus of the film is on these three friends and their individual ways to get through college. And in that aspect the film absolutely shines. These are three great characters, each played masterfully by their respective actors. Their ordeals during college are pretty unbelievable, but in a good way. I also like that the film can be serious and solemn when the situation calls for it. There are touching scenes in this film, which almost made me teary-eyed.<br/><br/>If I had to name a flaw, I would say that the film is a bit on the long side. I did find myself checking the clock once or twice towards the end.

"sanchayan_17","Null","7","18","25 December 2009"," More than just a movie!!!!
","When I heard that Raju Hirani, Abhijat Joshi and Aamir khan were working on a project together, I expected something good. I was wrong, because 'good' is a gross understatement of a project as brilliant as '3 idiots'. Yes, I call it a project because surely it goes beyond the realms of just being a movie. I say so because this movie stirs a dormant chord in our hearts, a chord that was always there but never found voice at the right time. <br/><br/>If in TZP Aamir Khan made you cry and understand, in 3 idiots he will make you laugh tears but make sure you get the point. I sincerely hope that this movie can bring about a social change that is urgently required in our country today. Yes, the story is loosely based on Chetan Bhagats novel but it's far from being a theatrical adaptation. It has a story which will keep you fairly intrigued, humor that you will love and a message that surely has a lot of depth. Three friends stuck in an engineering college where none of them like the way things are run. Only one of them, has the courage to take things into his own hands- that's your protagonist Aamir Khan. You'll like him from his first appearance on screen and end up loving him. In his 40's he looks supremely convincing as a cool dude in college with a kind heart. Throughout the journey,he manages to capture your hearts with a perfect combination of humor and heart. If in TZP we saw Aamir Khan the director, here we are privileged to see Aamir- the actor take centre stage. He is phenomenal in his role and leaves adjectives inadequate for his performance. Kareena, the daughter of the head of the college is his love interest. She does justice to her given screen space and surely gets a few hearts beating fast during ""Zoobi Doobi"". <br/><br/>Moving on from the love angle to the larger picture. Contrary to what you have heard or might hear, this movie not only challenges the Indian Education System, it decisively rubbishes it on every front. More than that, it challenges us to question our way of learning, of questioning, of thinking. Here, Madhvan and Sharman Joshi deserve an ovation for being splendid throughout the film. The friendship you saw in Rang De Basanti among a larger group was easily matched if not bettered by Maddy, Sharman and Aamir. Boman Irani picks off from where he left in Munnabhai playing the comic bad guy of sorts to perfection. The direction is flawless in terms of plot, setting and casting as each character justifies his/her role to the hilt. Also credit to the director for a climax which is sure to catch you by surprise! <br/><br/>If I was coerced to point out flaws in this movie, I would say that Aamir's fake name concept, continuity of the film(which is more than 10 yrs) was a shade unrealistic. Also, the music is good, but as I said earlier, good is an understatement for this film. The epicenter of this earthquake called 3idiots ( I call it earthquake because that's what it will causeat the box office!!) is ""Always do what you love!!"" All I can say is that the entire cast and crew of this project definitely love what they do because their work gives us ample proof. If you'v watched it, go watch it again, if u haven't then I don't know what you are waiting for!! Go watch it, enjoy it, feel it but most important understand it. My Rating:- 9/10"

"Chris Knipp","8","5","12","30 January 2010"," Bollywood comedy blockbuster: pee jokes and wholesome life values
","Released around Christmas 2009 in over half a dozen countries '3 Idiots' , reportedly the highest grossing Bollywood movie of all time, earned $70 million worldwide within 18 days of entering theaters. It was also officially released early to YouTube, another first. In the US, where it's being being shown at AMC/Regal theaters, it made $5.5 million in its first 17 days, the highest US take for a Bollywood import.<br/><br/>So what is this paragon? No 'Slumdog,' it's much more a standard commercial Indian film product. That means it's long, it's got tears, laughter, excitement, music and dance, and homilies about work and family. It's got romance, a beautiful girl who finds the hero in the end, and it's got running pee and fart and bum jokes. The screenplay of '3 Idiots' is drawn from Chetan Bhagat's 2004 bestseller Five Point Someone, a novel initially published in English and later reissued in Hindi. Bhagat's novel deals with the college exam angst and romance issues of three student buddies. But the film goes further afield, including childbirth during a blackout due to a monsoon flood, travels through gorgeous mountain landscapes of Ladakh seen from the air, trips back and forth over the period of a decade, one marvelous scene when a professor's mass of equations and symbols float off the blackboard up into the lecture hall, caressing the students. There are several full-dress Bollywood song-and-dance numbers, one in a hospital. The bright-colored cinematography is pleasant to look at. '3 Idiots' is virtually an epic of shared coming-of-age experiences with wholesome messages. These are: be true to yourself, live your dream. Be positive: the hero's mantra is ""Aal izz well."" Don't cheat -- unless you have to in a good cause. Don't rely on memorizing stuff; think for yourself. Avoid obsessing about the price and value of things. Remember where you came from. Remember your friends. The pressures of school in India where it may be the only way out of poverty are made clear, including the high incidence of suicide among students.<br/><br/>And learn Hindi. There's a sequence when a nerdy materialist who lived abroad and didn't study it much is chosen to give a public address in a high-falutin literary form of the language, ending up with some lines in Sanscrit, which he's even more ignorant of. The buddies inject naughty substitute homonyms like the equivalent of ""screw"" for ""serve"" and he becomes a laughing stock.<br/><br/>It's this materialistic memorizer bloke, Chatur Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya), who starts off the pre-title sequence by calling Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) to say he's located their engineering school pal ""Rancho"" (Aamir Khan) who disappeared after graduation. Farhan has to take the annoying and materialistic Chatur along as he rounds up best buddy Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) to drive from New Delhi up to the mountain town of Shimla to find Rahcho, the pal who influenced and inspired them so much. Much of the film consists of flashbacks along the trip of all the many incidents that happened in engineering school, many involving the annoying and sadistic school principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), AKA ""Virus,"" who has a beautiful daughter, Pia (Kareena Kapoor).<br/><br/>The mercurial and diminutive Khan is so talented he gets away with playing Rancho as a student even though he's forty-something. Rancho is a compelling character: he's the inspiration, the catalyst a young person needs to move beyond his origins and live his dreams. Farhan is from a middle class family and has a huge talent for nature photography; his dad has pushed him toward engineering but he hates it. Raju comes from a dirt poor family -- images of his sick father, unmarried sister, and failing mom are in old-movie black and white -- and the way the family's future is resting on his engineering degree so terrifies him that he continually panics and fails the school tests. But he's a tremendously decent, soulful fellow whose rigorous honesty ultimately wins over potential employers. Rancho, whose origins are as obscure as his brilliance is evident, bows to no one and gets away with all kinds of infringements of the rules because or his inventive mind and fundamental decency.<br/><br/>This summary barely scratches the surface. '3 Idiots' moves with precipitous speed through a dizzying array of incidents. A puzzling surprise comes just before the mid-way ""Interval."" And I said it was long. With that ""Interval,"" the movie keeps you in the theater for three full hours. That's a lot of Hindi, and only a little English. But this feels like a cleansing, warm bath after Judd Apatow and Eddie Murphy. This is good entertainment, and it's neither mindless nor nasty. But is it art? Is it groundbreaking? No, one couldn't say that. It's just a breath of good humor and good sense from a more innocent place."

"KrazzyDJ","7","5","12","28 December 2009"," Good. But misses the Bullseye !!!
","It certainly is all over town. Aamir's next has been hyped immensely and it's not surprising if you are not able to find a movie ticket this weekend. But at the end it all boils down to the question - is the movie worth all the hype ?? After watching it, I can say that the answer (quite disappointingly) is no.<br/><br/>Two college friends - Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) embark on a journey to find the third friend / Idiot Rancho (Aamir Khan) who mysteriously disappeared after college five years ago. The film's story is told through flashbacks as the characters journey to Shimla in search of Rancho - the person who managed to change their outlook towards life.<br/><br/>The problem with 3 Idiots according to me is that although it tackles a very complex issue, it chooses to do so in a light-hearted way which essentially converts this movie into a comedy (something present in abundance in B-Town). No doubt the humor is top-notch and keeps you rolling in laughter but the movie simple fails to connect you emotionally with the characters as opposed to, for example, Taare Zameen Par (2007) which I feel, after watching this, is far more superior in terms of characterization and emotional depth. By the time it reaches the climax, you can well anticipate almost everything that would happen.<br/><br/>As for the performances, they are top-notch. Undeniably, Aamir is one of the finest and this movie reaffirms this. However, what most people seem to be forgetting is that there are two more actors in this movie who, given the opportunity, are as capable as Aamir themselves. First R. Madhavan as Farhan Qureshi is simply brilliant. Watch the scene wherein he tries to explain his point of view to his parents. Next, Sharman Joshi as Raju Rastogi really shines not just in the comic sequences but in the more serious ones (which the movie has very few). Revealing the sequence in which he shines may act as a potential spoiler but watch out for a scene in the principal's office in which the principal asks him to type a rustication letter. Kareena Kapoor is really a thorn in this movie and her romance with Aamir is something that should have been either toned down or chopped off. Omi as the ideal geek is impressive (more so than Kareena).<br/><br/>The cinematography is good and breathtaking in the opening song where the lush greenery of Shimla is captured with such finesse that it induces a sense of wonder. The music is good but the songs have not been used that effectively. For instance, ""Give Me Some Sunshine"" not only has weak choreography, but it comes at a moment which severely reduces its impact. The promo featuring that song was far superior (in fact that was what fooled me into believing that this movie could end up as a masterful lesson in life). Some of the sequences could have been trimmed down.<br/><br/>On the whole, although 3 Idiots is a good movie, it is hard to understand people calling a masterpiece or a breakthrough in cinema. Movies like Taare Zameen Par (2007) or even Hirani's own Lage Raho Munnabhai (2006) are better movies as compared to this. Nevertheless, the movie does provide some really good entertainment so if you're looking forward to just relax and chill out, go for this. For those however seeking some serious depth and a perspective in the life of an engineer, I'd say the movie tries and succeeds in parts but an engineer's life and the pressures s/he faces are a different game altogether. Although the movie it enjoyable, it is far from authentic. And this comes from an Engineer (although an Idiotic one). Now I may get a lot of sore thumbs down on this one but this in my opinion on this movie written in all earnestness. Don't enter this movie with high expectations and you may perhaps find that All Izz (Indeed) Well !!!<br/><br/>Score: 7.0/10.0 !!"
"MartinTeller","4","7","19","4 January 2012"," 3 Idiots (2009)
","I really tried to like this. And just to be fair, there are a few entertaining moments, it's professionally produced, and the performances for the most part aren't that bad. Heck, I'll even go so far as to say all the protagonists are pretty good. But good lord, what an awful script. Melodramatic clichés galore, terrible humor (why so many pee and fart jokes?), simplistic messages, a hero who can absolutely do no wrong and villains for whom the phrase ""one-dimensional"" is generous. It's as if someone marathoned through the absolute worst Hollywood has to offer and took notes. The sad scenes are laughable, the comic scenes are painful, and all of it is predictable (except the final little twist, which I admit was kind of a nifty surprise). Much of the film resembles REAL GENIUS, from the unflappable, infallible hero to the evil professor and the suck-up rival. And that's not a movie you want to aspire to. And there's a scene I know I've seen somewhere else before, but I can't place it. Teacher tells student his exam/paper won't be accepted because it's late, student asks if the teacher knows his name, teacher says no, student stuffs paper/exam in the middle of the stack. It'd be a clever bit, if not for this nagging feeling it was lifted from something else. Even the songs aren't that great, although the accompanying spectacle is sometimes charming. In the end, it's the three leads (Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi and Madhavan) and the romantic interest (Kareena Kapoor) and their endearing performances despite the horrible material that save this from being a complete waste. But I certainly wouldn't recommend it."

A movie like HeraPheri was a wonderful comedy while Swadesh was giving a real life preaching message but blending both genre of movie and come up with such a masterpiece is amazing. Fantastic screen play with crisp dialogs and ultimate cast selection made this as one of my all time best. <br/><br/>And what to say about Amir Khan? He surpasses my expectation level one more time. DCH, RDB, TZP and now this one!! He is such a refreshing feeling in movie that you can't come out of, ever after two days. This is the youngest he is looking in last fifteen years. If I was too surprised with young and charming Brad Pitt in Curious case of Benjamin Button, then Amir on top of that added mischievous of youth too. Look at his curious eyes, his ever swinging body, his quick repartees.. ooh boy he is incomparable.<br/><br/>Best part of movie is that, even with such a powerful casting, I was so much engrossed with Rancho, Farhan, Hari, Pia, Virus, Chatur that no one not even Amir was able to overshadow movie. Boman Irani, Madhavan, Sharman, Kareena all played their part superbly. This new guy Mr Chatur also did a great comedy performance and reason for lots of hilarious moment in movie. <br/><br/>All in all it was a complete entertainment package.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","9","27 September 2011"," Good entertainment
","It does not really matter whether this is intentional on the part of the movie makers or just my own imagination – the three Indian leads, in order of their appearances, resemble Mark Ruffalo, Gael Garcia Bernal and Tony Curtis (some would say Tom Hanks). Whatever that is, it certainly doesn't hurt the movie at all, nor does the winsome eye-candy female lead.<br/><br/>The plot outline and story detail combine familiar stuff with some innovations. Starting with ""ten-years-later"", it employs the proved structure of flashbacks to recount the days the three protagonists share at college day when they cemented a heart-warming friendship – a full entertainment package complete with comedy, romance, breathtaking scenery, mild poignancy and even some ""messages"" with respect to the nature of education. On the last score I won't get overboard although some critics may make a big thing out of it. I rarely look at a movie as anything beyond entertainment, and those who believe that a 2-hour movie can double up as a full semester of philosophy, sociology, political or whatever ""100"" course are welcomed to continue to indulge in their delusion. <br/><br/>By the way, this is actually a 3-hour movie. Word-of-mouth recommendations I received unanimously agree that the 3 hours would fly by without one's noticing it. I generally agree, but not 100%. There are times in the middle when it drags on somewhat, although the last half hour of finale is redeeming. Knowing what Bollywood is like, one shouldn't complain too much about the song-and-dance sequences appropriately sparsely inserted. After all, they even have such things in Ozon (""8 femmes"" 2002)), so what's the fuss? And I have to admit that the rhythmic tunes are quite enjoyable. The only downside is that the resultant length gave an excuse to the local cinema operators to hike the admission price – a bit of a rip off.<br/><br/>All told, this is a good entertainment package, price hike notwithstanding."
"guptaankush-12308","5","3","6","3 May 2016"," Plagiarized piece of writing without any sense of realism
","This is why Bollywood disappoints me more often than not. The 3 idiots creators decided to recreate Chetan Bhagat's ""Five Point Someone"". Unfortunately they failed miserably. All the realism was lost to make the movie more appealing to the masses. Rancho is a student who is kicked out of every class, but still manages to top in the college. Aren't the same professors, who kick him out because of his logic and reasoning, the same ones who grade his papers? The movie also enables the idea that when a student is facing unbearable mental pressure, she/he should attempt to commit suicide and if she/he manages to survive, life will get all fancy for her/him again. Totally ridiculous! The book was so much better. I loved the humor aspects of the book too. The movie just made ridiculous child humor that was borderline funny. Let me not get started on the immense overacting. Boman Irani's character ""Virus"" was so unreal and totally unpalatable. Rancho was annoyingly and unrealistically humble. Kareena's acting was greatly disappointing too. On the whole, I'd say please just read the book instead!"

"lilysmith22345","Null","3","6","6 June 2013"," my take on the film 3 idiots
","3 idiots i a great film, that portrays 3 boys in college and the funny antics they get up to while in this process. The film shows how learning can be made fun, and as long as you love what you do, you will succeed in it. but the film isn't all fun and games, the movie portrays the flaws that India currently have in their educational system, it also shows that not everyone can do what they love as the pressure put upon them by their families can be an argument to persuade anyone, the movie shows a suicide, this really shocks the viewers, and the fact is that the film isn't a fictional one and when a person fails, they do commit suicide, I'm not saying all do but quite a few. They also show the hypocrisy of class and how though everyone thought the main character was a wealthy heir he was no more than a servant posing for the heir who could not even understand engineering. The birth of the headmasters grandchild makes the viewer see that the educational system can change, along with the people running it, and the stereotype of a woman being a doctor and a man becoming an engineer becomes to deteriorate. All in all a great film, and worthy for its position in the top 250 films"
"meera_darji","10","3","6","28 October 2012"," ""A for Apple, B for Ball..."" - 3 Idiots Review
","Since watching many Bollywood films at a very young age, I can confidently say that '3 idiots' is one of the best of all time. With the astonishing 19 wins and 10 nominations, 3 idiots has been a huge success all over the world, especially in India. Director Rajkumar Hirani has amazingly created this comedy drama, which manifests stomach aching humour to an arousal of common, emotional issues.<br/><br/>""Pursue excellence, and success will follow"" - Rancho<br/><br/>The film focuses on the lives of three main protagonists: 'Rancho' Shamaldas Chanchad (Amir Khan), Farhan Qureshi (Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi). The narrative sums up the stereotypical norms and values of how the Indian parents in India have traditional aspirations for their sons at a very young age, wanting them to become Lawyers, Doctors and in this case Engineers! It cleverly questions the education system of which grades and points are rewarded whereas knowledge and understanding is forgotten. The film begins with the two friends; Farhan and Raju searching for their long lost friend Rancho. A non-linear theme is present throughout the film, going forwards and backwards to the present and past, whilst explaining the story so clearly and explicitly allows us to feel part of their journey.<br/><br/>""Today my respect for that idiot shot up. Most of us went to college just for a degree. No degree meant no plum job, no pretty wife, no credit card, no social status. But none of this mattered to him, he was in college for the joy of learning, he never cared if he was first or last."" - Farhan<br/><br/>Amir Khan's character Rancho is played out extremely well. His persona of this happy, intelligent, moral character is easily recognised through his dialogue and actions. For example looking at Rancho's facial expressions and body language, his character is reinforced by; scratching his head, hands in his pockets, playing the Rubix cube etc. Amir Khan brilliantly perpetuates Rancho's character, allowing us to fully believe in him. Rancho is an unforgettable character, a friend everyone aspires to have and a person who will believe in you. Rancho heavily goes against the dominant ideology of how his friends' fates are decided by their parents, the unfair education system and the traditional beliefs. His charismatic, inspiring soul pushes his friends to follow their dreams, for example convincing Raju to follow his ambitions of becoming a wildlife photographer. ""All iz well"" – his famous quote is constantly repeated throughout the film, providing a sense of encouragement and a speck of hope. <br/><br/>Apart from enjoying Bollywood films, I am not very fond of the gleeful songs in between lengthy scenes. However, having said that the music used in 3 Idiots was incredibly perfect in portraying the emotion, meaning and plot. One of my favourite songs used in this film is ""Give me some sunshine"". The song ideally sums up exactly what the protagonist is going through, allowing the audience to empathise with him. The scene provides a shock, where a young student commits suicide due to the pressure and stress of exam deadlines. The song builds up, which made me sit on the edge of my seat, preparing for something pessimistic to occur. I have to say, that the cinematography here was gratifying. In particular, the long shot of the protagonists' legs in the air along with the scribbled writing by him stating ""I QUIT!"" is one of my favourite shots.<br/><br/>The songs lyrics ""Give me some sunshine, give me some rain, give me another chance I want to grow up once again"" precisely fits with the ambiance, emphasising the hardcore reality. I believe that this scene is very moving, as it allows the audience to realise the seriousness of these issues, which can lead to death.<br/><br/>I have to admit, that even though I have watched this film several times, where I even know when the comedy is coming, I still laugh. I believe that this is what you call a film, allowing the audience to never get fed up, arouse emotion, relate to characters and most of all enjoy the humour. The concepts and issues, such as; the difficulty in gaining a degree, parental pressure, financial problems are definitely relatable to mass audiences, thus increasing the viewer-ship. <br/><br/>3 Idiots has to be one of the best Bollywood films. I cannot express how great this film is, which you must watch."
"gauravsaha2003","10","3","6","22 January 2012"," Easily 1 of the best movies ever...Hats off Aamir and Raju Hirani...Aal izz well...
","Knowing that it is an Aamir Khan movie i went to the multiplex with high expectations. and Rajkumar Hirani being director i was even more eager to watch the movie. and boy it did live up to my expectations and even much much more. it was a joyride mixed with emotions, tension, tragedy, social message and romance.The movie has many hilarious scenes and everyone in the film form Aamir to Boman to Kareena were amazing. never expected such an amazing movie. Aamir is truly a genius and a perfectionist. Every movie of his is amazing. Worth every penny u spend. Highly recommended not only to Indians but also to people across the globe. Awesome performances by the cast. A superb entertainer and a must-watch!!!"
"uvindu","7","3","6","2 November 2011"," 3 Idiots definitely tries to do things differently ... to certain extent successfully!
","I generally avoid commercial Hindi films but I watched 3 Idiots because I was told that it does things differently. For the most part, I found that to be true.<br/><br/>Story: While the theme of the story is quite valid it's hard not to notice that it was discussed by a very similar Hindi film starring Aarmir Khan recently (Taare Zameen Par). In both films Aarmir Khan plays a similar stand out role which create a continuous sense of déjà-vu. The main story line of 3 Idiots oscillates between being simple, heart-warming and humorous to outrageous and silly. This makes things pretty awkward. One moment you would be engrossed watching a story of two troubled students being helped by benignant idealist and the next moment the idealist starts acting like Jesus himself with infinite wisdom. The story never hits a good balance. Personally, wise cracking Aarmir Khan's character got under my nerves far too often.<br/><br/>Acting: Acting for the most part was quite solid with the exception Kareena Kapoor. Either all Hindi film directors want her to act the same role in every film or she has been copy/pasted from another film. Most scenes involving her were predictable resulting all attempts at humor to fall flat. <br/><br/>Direction/Editing etc: The film is pretty long which made me feel that editing was not great. There were a few scenes that were quite irrelevant and overdone. But 3 Idiots packed enough comedy and charming sketches to keep me interested until the end. The characters are skewed so much to black/white and right/wrong; the film gave me the sensation that the director wants me to enjoy the film in one particular way. There was very little to think about after watching. <br/><br/>Visuals: Most of the scenery and visual elements used to drive the story along was quite good and well thought out.<br/><br/>All in all, 3 Idiots is enjoyable and there are lot of things to like. It's still aimed at the core Hindi film fans but it's accessible enough for others too."
"thepsychocritic","6","3","6","31 August 2011"," One of Bollywood's best. That isn't saying much.
","Alright. I know the title sucks. The first image it brings to one's mind is three cross-eyed, bald men with fingers shoved up their noses or something, which wouldn't be a lot off the mark from what the real picture is - three college-brats scratching fake, shiny, resplendent buttocks. But Shakespeare said 'what's in a name?' and let us assume that the great bard was not being rhetorical and delve further into the movie.<br/><br/>Inspired from the book '5 Point Someone' by Chetan Bhagat, or as some critics call him, Satan Bhagat, or the IIT-IIM-douche bag, the movie is about three college students in Imperial College of Engineering, the best fictitious Engineering college of India. Each has a history of his own, and while the past of two of them is open in front of us like a book, the life of the third is barely revealed in the first half. Raju (Sharman Joshi) is the stereotypical nerd, haunted by poverty and has a paralysed father and a mother with a total disregard for hygiene, while Farhan (R. Madhavan) is the dilemma-stricken, schizophrenic (not literally) who is studying to be an engineer but his alter-ego (not literally) wants to be a wildlife photographer.<br/><br/>Much through the initial half, the movie focuses on the trio's life in college. There is fun, frolic and all the other juvenile stuff with occasional mentions of suicide, pressure and the sort. The film tries to accomplish too much in too little only leaving behind a residue of laughter and a feeling of nostalgia for people past their 'my-college- life-was-so-awesome' stage.<br/><br/>Rancho (Aamir Khan) is the protagonist of the film. The smartest among the three, he is also the most gregarious and wild. He is a philosopher, experimentalist and conducts innovations in his room or drifts into monologues about success, how-to-study and other inspirational things. Though not a geek, he trumps the obnoxious mega-nerd, Chatur Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) in their results, which marks the inception of a long- lasting rivalry, which soon boils over after Rancho plays a particularly nasty prank on the latter. The rest of the story, as Bollywood cinema goes, is about a ghastly principal with a lisp (Boman Irani), friendship, love, pregnant women giving birth using a vacuum cleaner and other pea-brained escapades.<br/><br/>The twist comes mid-way through the movie, thoroughly inappropriate and mistimed. After this point the movies seems to drag on. The humour turns more contrived than nonchalant. The emotions become mawkish instead of touching. There are things that are absolutely implausible in any universe. The movie splashes water onto the sand castle it had built in the first half. The end is hypothetical at its best and this only worsens the case. It manages to leave a 'what the hell just happened?!' taste in your mouth, and I am pretty sure that the movie director, Rajkumar Hirani, wasn't trying to accomplish that.<br/><br/>However, the three lead characters play a grace-saving role; Aamir Khan in particular. It is difficult to find chinks in the acting armour. The then forty four year old Khan brilliantly morphs into the twenty- something Rancho. Giving a flawless performance, he makes you happy when he laughs, sad when he cries and sway-along when he dances. There is an innocuous air about him which is highly appealing, with some members of the female contingent even defining it as 'cute.' Sharman Joshi, one of the most underrated actors of Indian cinema, dons the clothes of Raju Rastogi seamlessly. He looks tailor-made for the role; right from being the economically-challenged superstitious nerd, to getting inebriated and imitating the working of an induction motor, his acting is like a breath of fresh air. Though Madhavan appears slightly sidelined as Farhan, he manages to hold onto the boat well. He is overshadowed by the other two, who are more distinctly characterized, but this is covered by the fact that he is also the narrator of the tale. He entertains us with his antics (which involves stopping an airplane on the runway), his affable nature and always being Rancho's faithful sidekick. Boman Irani does a commendable job as the uncanny principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe, a part similar in ways to the evil Dr. Asthana is Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. The others too meander through; Kareena Kapoor, Javed Jaffrey, Mona Singh and so on, each well placed in their shoes, but none leaving a lasting impression.<br/><br/>Comparisons with the book are inevitable and the film deserves due credit for being one of those rare books that outdoes its paperback version. But then again, comparisons to a wad of used toilet paper are hardly a standard to go by. Most songs are better than the other blockbusters Bollywood has churned out in recent history. They aid the emotional segment of the film. Yipee for that. While the first half of 3 Idiots is certainly worth a watch, but the latter makes you wish that you'd left the theatre in the intermission."
"ChSharjeel","Null","6","16","24 February 2010"," Over the top, over fantasized, not quite as the hype goes
","I believe its a good movie for an average Indian commercial film goer. Story is different, cant pinpoint which English movie's ripoff it is(like most Indian movies).The comedy is OK, aptly done by very able actors like Amir & Boman irani, other 2 'idiots' provided good support. kareena also justified its selection. The film suffers from over sentimentalism and also its a abit impractical if u have a pragmatic look at it, however not every 1 wants a realistic movie.<br/><br/>Few funny moments but not much in it especially if we compare it to earlier 2 big successes of Rajkumar hirani, i.e the 'munna bhai' series.<br/><br/>The theme is nothing new as it emphasizes on doing in your life what is your natural talent, this reminds me of 'taare zameen par', & can u guess what is strikingly common?...Yes Amir khan. The 'ace' khan as few may call him does a comedy flick after sometime. He looks abit too old for teenage character but then again this detail is overlooked when that supposed teenager is a good actor like he is.<br/><br/>The score of the film is good especially 2 dance numbers.<br/><br/>In the end its an over the top comedy flick, average fan of commercial Indian movies & teenagers should love it. Of course i m neither and my taste is better."
"iamsri","Null","6","16","24 December 2009"," Excellent, deserves 9/10 for a Bollywood movie
","Thoroughly enjoyed the movie, the college humor, the extremely well done dialogs, picturesque cinematography, nice and fluid flow storyline - in fact most of the movie.<br/><br/>Only turnoffs were the over-Bollywoodisation out of the realm of the believable, overdoing gross scenes like repeated showing of male rumps/undies. Some director just don't know where to draw the line. Maybe a Farhan Akhtar was needed for a final editing touch :-)<br/><br/>But the movie overall manages to fully entertain and keep you in splits or at times tears during the entire time. Would be a 9.999/10 without the turnoffs - exactly where it falls half a point below ""Dil Chahta Hain"", though personally it is funnier!<br/><br/>Extremely well cast. Aamir manages to look younger than ""Rang De Basanti"" or any other recent movie - nice acting too from everyone! Even the LA based Omi Vaidya has done a great job in his first Bollywood movie, as a geeky irritant.<br/><br/>Do not miss it for anything!!!"
"varun-mentor","Null","6","16","24 December 2009"," Fantabulous Indian cinema - Slow to digest but overall great appeal
","Well, to start with, lemme clarify, I have a knack of bringing down bollywood cinema being a puritanical movie critic. And the only reason I still hold on to Indian Cinema is Aamir khan. His movies have been the cornerstone of generational behavior through the decades. Indians have experiences the best of reelistic emotions, vigor, love, comedy through the works of Aamir. He defines a supreme talent with an eye for every detail that could connect with the audience in the lightest and most deepest of senses. You will never know what hits you when you watch some of his best works.<br/><br/>Moving forward, I went to see 3 idiots with the same expectations from an Aamir movie. Starting with the storyline, it was pretty well presented and starting was glitchy which was readily made up by Aamir's presence, which obviously was staged as such but does make a nice impact. His two sideburns namely Sharman and Maddy did a superb job in their own respective way and special mention to Maddy for his subtle way of bringing the best out of a sidekick role. Another special mention goes to a character names Chatur (dunno the real name) for adding superb comic zing to the movie. Gals were passé but were essential. Some of the scenes were long dragged and kinda unnecessary songs as such a repertoire of bollywood, nevertheless, weighing pros against cons which anyways outnumber the cons, I would like to assure the kind of essence movie brings out as a whole is meaningful and thematic in the most lighthearted and fun filled way.<br/><br/>Some of the hilarious scenes were so funny that my friend mentioned it to be the best comic scene in Indians cinema. People might point it out as gross or amateurish but it does forms an essential part of college humor which still is gibberish and kindergarten grade compared to western comedies. Aamir does a fantastic job again maybe not that much as the role he portrays but as an overall feel he brings to any movie he forms a part of. Hirani does bring lot of experiences from his part ventures into this movie but they are well figured out and I must admit, he does belong to the best breed of directors in Indian cinema's current generation with the likes of Imtiaz Ali, Vishal Bhardwaj and Prakash jha, masters in their own genre.<br/><br/>Overall movie does give you a fantastic feel as you walk out of the theater and is a perfect gift from Aamir to everyone for Christmas. A must watch for Indian cinema buffs and indeed figures as one of the best recent movies with no award winning stuff but just for the flow it controls the psyche of the audience and brings them through all simple emotions with laughter and grit.<br/><br/>3.5/5"

"IndrajitGhosh","1","16","59","12 July 2012"," Rubbish!!
","Words cannot even describe how crap this films is....let me just outline why it is so bad!!!!!! Firstly, the acting by the cast is awful!! As much as I like Aamir Khan generally, I would have to say his performance as a 22 year old Engineering student is absolutely appalling, however it is not as irritating as Boman Irani's performance as your stereotypical principal who has least favourite students.<br/><br/>Secondly, the storyline is just boring (I am not only saying this because it is a different storyline) - it is not at all realistic and to be perfectly honest it has little to it.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the songs are just annoying...especially the stupid 'All is well!!' If I could rate this film below 1 I would rate it into them minuses!"
"kaushik2562","10","6","17","24 December 2009"," Masterpiece made by ""idiots""
","One of the top graded movies I have ever seen. New angles, new thoughts, yet so simple and so close to life. Time and again your guesses will go wrong, most of the time I couldn't make any guess.<br/><br/>We all know Aamir is a genius, another masterpiece from him. But time to think the Rajkumar Hirani & Bidhu Binod Chopra duo is also the same. This is their 3rd consecutive wonder, first without Munnabhai. I must say their movies remind me of the works of Hrishikesh Mukherjee, simplicity is their similarity.<br/><br/>Every scene was so complete & flawless, one would agree that they didn't left any field related to the scene unresearch. The mix of comedy and emotion with reality was awesome. The characters never looked like superstars; but they were so prominent, so natural, their acts were so funny but realistic. Boman, Sarman, Madhaban thumps up to them. Omi Vaidya (silencer) will be a memorable character.<br/><br/>The movie is around 3 hours long, but not lengthy at all. The story the twists the humors will entertain you and touch your heart and will keep your patience till the end. Finally a good ending in a beautiful landscape did justice to the film.<br/><br/>Rating: Planning to go on Sunday again."
"Esswasim","1","15","55","11 November 2013"," Idiotic
","I heard about this movie from friends in office and outside and everyone wanted me to watch it even though I am not a fan of bollywood movies but the expectations were set high and finally after couple of years of thinking I decided to watch this movie, well it starts with what I can say is Cliché filled Bull Shiiit, I mean there is no attention to any detail paid in this movie, it is like a work done without Post production, personally I feel it is for people who just don't go into details and just want to have a stupid laugh, yeah maybe for them it is a good movie, but for people who crave for movies which provide near realistic experience , please stay away from this crap, as this is nowhere near that standard, I just was shocked to see the first scene, but I thought, well this is bollywood such things are normal, it can only get better, But damn then the college scenes nothing but boring and lame clichés, I felt wtf after 45 minutes and stopped the movie.<br/><br/>Some might say oh wow, reviewing a movie which I watched only 45 minutes, well yes that is because I couldn't stand it or more, thank you very much for your pathetic try to entertain me. Every detail matters not just the theme they are bragging about. Movie experience should be complete 3 idiots is very idiotic as if made by some idiots."
"lekuswati","3","9","29","27 September 2010"," over hyped, unbelievably ridiculous
","Once in a while there comes a film that people, critics...everyone praise sky high....but when you watch the movie, you really wonder whether you saw the same movie as everyone else. 3 idiots is one of those movie.<br/><br/>The film begins well...but just turns into typical Bollywood movie where Hero is above God, jokes are lame and logic is thrown out of the window...and the window is shut, leaving no room for logic to enter back.<br/><br/>The story starts well with Chatur calling Farhan and Raju that ""Rancho"" has been found and the trio, along with Kareena, (who runs away from her wedding, when she finds that Rancho has been found) start a journey to meet him. Chatur is also keen to meet ""Phunsuk Wangdu"", his hero who has multiple patents in his name. During the journey starts the back story of how Rancho was exceptionally good in studies and always topped, always gave out of the box solutions, was wayyy above his teachers...etc. Back to present, when they finally meet Rancho after a gap of 10 years...they find that this Rancho has no resemblance to the Rancho they knew. Then later in the story they learn that Phunsukh Wangdu was the Rancho with them during College, earning a degree for the real Rancho, as Rancho.<br/><br/>Let me not dive deeper into the story, but let me sum up where the movie falters.<br/><br/>1. Aamir Khan's character is shown to be too larger than life...than what is actually possible....he is far more mature than teachers, more intelligent....and holds more than 100 patents?? REALLY?????<br/><br/>2. The movie is keen to criticize Chatur's character, who only mugs up to succeed in examinations. 10 yrs later he shown to have 1 patent in his name. Now let's get real....in a way, aren't they promoting ""mug up to succeed""...coz getting even a single patent is not easy.<br/><br/>3. Kareena-Aamir love story - Aamir's char (Rancho) and Kareena's char(Pia) meet once during the wedding and later, when Raju's father gets a heart attack and they carry him to the hospital. Just these 2 incidents and Rancho and Pia are supposedly in 'love'. So deeply in love that Rancho stealthily visits her home at midnight to confess. <br/><br/>4. Can't take it either seriously nor with a light heart - The jokes in the movie are too lame to call it a funny movie and the seriousness of topics, such as suicides, pressure of education, etc is diluted by the cardboard characters and execution. Nothing seems realistic. <br/><br/>5. Too many WTF moments - There are just too many WTF moments that totally ruins the movie. Pia gets her father office room keys so that Rancho and his buddies can steal the question paper, when she learns that her father is planning set a very tough question paper to ensure that Raju fails. <br/><br/>6. The Chetan Bhagat episode - I can't believe the trio actually didn't even bother to give him a credit at beginning or just after the movie. I have read the book and seen the movie....and every major incident is used in the movie in one form as the other....such as lead falls for the professor's daughter, Raju's suicide attempt, Pia's brother's suicide, attempt to steal the question paper, Raju's family and lunch at his home (which is done very badly in the movie). It's just like you buy a dress from a designer, add your own elements and pass it of as your original. If you compare the book and the movie....the book is much better coz it conveys the boyish charms and their messed up brains (hence their action is believable). The movie is neither funny, nor serious, nor entertaining."

","I´ve read some of the reviews here and the majority of the positive reviews are either from people in India or neighboring countries. From an objective point of view this is one of the most cheesy films I've seen in a while. It felt like a horribly long episode of the Big Bang Theory with it´s dated and predictable humour. The dialogues felt like they were literally being read off of a script and did not flow and they may might as well have not spoken english at all because the accents were so poor. Ridiculously overrated. Don't waste your time with this film if you are really into cinema."
"meet_grn","8","4","10","1 January 2010"," Loosely inspired by FPS? - I think not ..
","Watched this movie yesterday - after hearing about the great box office reports, and insistent friends who were pretty vocal about calling it the movie of the decade. Its a hilarious movie, laugh-out-loud funny, and some scenes leave the tummy hurting. There's enough zing for mainstream cinema - which probably explains its amazing business in a couple of weeks of release. While Aamir is fantastic and totally believable as an engineering student (Defying his real age) and everything else about the movie is great, it's the attention to detail that got me hooked enough to decide giving it a second viewing. The plot is reasonably well thought out while originally ""adapted"" from Chetan's book. There are a lot of great things going for the movie - but i was sort of surprised to not see Chetan Bhagat's name anywhere on the credits. After getting out of the screening, got online to figure out what the deal was - and got wind of the huge controversy brewing. As nice a movie as this adaptation is - it is still an adaptation, and having seen the movie, and given the book a second read to get my facts right - i can honestly state that a lot more than half the movie is a lift from the book, so the claim that the screenplay is original does take something away from the whole experience (The film makers claim that the end rolling credits have Chetan Bhagat's name is pretty funny - because frankly, how many stick around to watch the rolling credits!?) Note: I am in no way related to or have any affiliations with Chetan Bhagat. This is just my opinion after having read the book, and watched the movie - to make sense of the lack of credit where its due."

","I just saw 3 idiots and couldn't resist to put my user ratings and share my preview with everyone on IMDb.<br/><br/>It is indeed a masterpiece and is well handled by lead role by perfectionist Ameer Khan! It reminded me of his old movie ""Dil chahta hai""...The story based on the friendship of 3 college freaks played by Ameer, Sharman Joshi and Madhavan. The characters evolve with master ideas. Some of the basic concepts which could have been seen, heard or experienced is well displayed on the scree! Of course, needless to say,that Boman Irani on his College director role still rocks and reminds of his well handled character in Mumnnabhai MBBS. The friendship, the college life, the fights everything which we see common in life and the fun that's been played is really awesome! The story is based on Chetan Bhagat's novel and is well picturised. I think this should be one of the most successful and award winning movie of 2009 and is released in India on a very auspicious occasion of Christmas! I recommend everyone to go and watch this movie! This is movie worth watching in Cinema halls rather than seating at home! And also do not forget to watch with your best friends! The feeling would be really fantabulous!!!!"

","When Munnabhai's satire meets sensibilities of Taare Zameen Par.. you get 3 idiots! <br/><br/>Hirani and Aamir seems to be trying hard to out do each other with their excellence. That's why they have so easily been able to portray what this movie is all about ""... chase excellence and success will be a byproduct.."". <br/><br/>Music of Aamir movies has always been situational and generally doesn't pick up unil one sees the movie. That's true even for this one too and ""All Izz Well"" will certainly going to play new tag lines for youth since they last changed ""Chak De"".<br/><br/>Movie tries to cover a lot of issues plagueing our higher education system especially in context of Middle class aspirations. Engineering and Medicine are like religion. Although idealism shown in favor of innovation and out-of-box thinking is certainly need of the hour. <br/><br/>Boman Irani may be getting typed in ""Director/Professor"" cast; but then you always feel like a breath of fresh air whenever he is on screen. Sharman joshi had done good justice to his role. Madhvan could have done more justice to his role, but i feel his passion for photography was not aptly portrayed either; in order to have a convincing concluding scene. It was great to see Parkshit Sahni after so much time and a couple of dialogues from Sharman's mother were excellent; especially ""Pizza ki 30 minute delivery ki guarantee hai, par ambulance 2 ghante mein bhi nahin aati"".<br/><br/>Aamir has proved it again that till the time he is around, intelligent cinema will be around."
"JakeBrinkman","5","3","7","20 September 2019"," Poor first half, but a powerful second half
","I've only seen a handful of Indian films so far, but this was the first one that I can call okay instead of bad. It has a really slow start but an emotional second half. I didn't expect to like it based on the beginning. The advertising made it seem like a comedy, when it's actually a coming of age drama, and nearly all of the comedy is extremely immature potty jokes. Plus a lot of Rancho's initial challenges to the establishment (and the entirety of the director's character) seemed childish and/or unrealistic. However, once the story turned serious (about 45-60 minutes into the movie), there were several scenes that had me on the verge of tears in powerfully joyful moments.<br/><br/>If I were in charge of this film, the biggest change I would make is to entirely cut the present day story. In the first half, it's practically the only interesting part of the movie. But in the second half, it only serves as a distraction, never presenting anything remotely as entertaining or moving as the past storyline. My second biggest issue is the music, which is usually jarringly strong and over-exaggerated.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm certainly glad I watched it, though it has too much fluff and such a lengthy runtime that I probably won't ever rewatch it. Oh, and as a surprising bonus, it only has 2 of the ridiculously absurd musical sequences that Bollywood is so strangely infatuated with, and one of the songs is actually halfway related to the plot."

","Unlike many who have commented here in the years since 3 Idiots was released in India and throughout the world, I am not well-versed with Bollywood movies - indeed, far as I can tell from his filmography, this may be my first Aamir Khan movie - so my take on this experience may be different from others. It's not even that I can't get into a cinematic whirlwind like this, as other filmmakers in other countries will (sometimes) go for BIG emotions and BIG turns like this one does (Love Exposure was something that came to mind during this, of all things). So if you read what I'm about to say and think I'm full of it or don't know what I'm talking about it, well, the latter may be about right, but I can still share my honest thoughts much as they are. And, as far as the most general impression, overall, this isn't too bad. Is it very good though, or as bad as certain IMDb message board posters might say since its ascension to the top 250 films of all time? <br/><br/>In short, 3 Idiots is a full course meal of a movie, and it has so many types and moods of movie stuffed into one, like a Turducken or something: it's a broad college comedy, an Alvin and the Chipmunks farce (think about it, with Khan's Rancho as Alvin and the other two idiots variations of Simon and Theodore, sort of, plus the Chatur character as the 4th wheel), a soap opera about strict fathers and their children, a tragic tale about suicide meant to highlight a very real problem in Indian society, and of course for Bollywood a musical, not to mention a kind of moral story of what it means to be a teacher or a student and how to not be so uptight (another subtitle for this movie could be ""The System, They Just Don't Understand!"").<br/><br/>It's even other things I'm sure, and the tones fluctuate and alter on a dime from one to the next. Case in point, there's a little more than mid-way through the film a very serious turn in the plot; nevermind how exactly it gets there, suffice it to say it's due to some late-night antics from Rancho with pals Raju and Farhan, with Raju most drunk the next morning in class and being forced to decide whether to be expelled or put it all on Rancho. Raju decides to jump out the window, though he doesn't die and he subsequently gets rushed to the hospital. Cue up the sad but (it can't be anything else) supremely heart-felt song that plays over as he is brought to stable condition. Then it becomes a rather crazy comedy of 'how do we wake up Raju' sequence as he is stuck in his, uh, comatose-sort of state and Rancho keeps saying wilder and wackier things to get Raju to wake up. And yet as broad as this is it's still serious... sort of.<br/><br/>A lot of this happens throughout 3 Idiots; for a stretch of time the movie will take on something like a frat-house comedy (that's actually how the film seems like it will take shape early on, ""initiation"" sequence with butt-branding included!) but then it's (duh) also a romance with the headmaster/principal's daughter, Pia (Kapoor, pretty but also a very good actress) and Rancho since he not only is the cool/suave prankster but he also spots the phonies who try to have her hand as a significant other. But then it's also about Raju's sad (in black and white no less!) home life, and then it's also about how to function properly in an academic environment with Rancho sometimes like a, uh, RP McMurphy in Cuckoo's Nest turning the system upside down with the headmaster as the one-note headmaster. And then it gets into a musical number about things like ""All is Well"", which gets finished off by someone jumping off a ledge and to their death, which makes it uh... sad again, as it cuts to the pouring rain at a funeral.<br/><br/>This may be de rigeur for those who are regulars for Bollywood cinema - for me, it was at times a startling experience, sometimes akin to getting whiplash on a roller-coaster. This is not to say it made the experience intolerable, however. It was surely made as a prestige/high-mainstream comedy/drama/musical-et-al, and it's the kind of movie that will have high-powered, super-slick musical set pieces (not quite as many as I expected, to be fair, and those that are here do stand out well and are the highlights of the movie aside from Khan's performance), and then for the regular musical score it will be some of the goofiest notes I've ever heard outside of a Disney channel show. And for as BIG as the actors go for this material - perhaps, you could argue, they don't have much of a choice - there are moments where there's something close to not subtlety but measured stuff; when Raju confronts his parents with what he actually wants to do with his life, it's a legitimately strong dramatic scene that pulls on the heartstrings just enough.<br/><br/>In other words, it's probably not what will be the *best* Bollywood movie - some may put it high up there, and that's their prerogative - but if you are new to this style of movie-making (and I don't mean Slumdog Millionaire for the laymans that's basically Bollywood crossed with Danny Boyle), it's a good place to start. It's sometimes quite funny, and sometimes quite harrowing with its drama, and often it's much too much with the emotional manipulation (that delivery scene, my God). It is what it is."

","This is a good movie overall. But the rating of 8.2 is quite high for this movie. Secondly the genres of this movie were not rightly match with the movie. <br/><br/>Anyway, let me first talk about what I liked in this movie. I like it overall. It is entertaining, good comedy and of course good acting by Boman Irani, Sharman Joshi and Madhavan. The main theme of the movie was a concept that the passion of person when matches with his profession, he achieves success. So the concept wise it is good. Screen play and Direction were good overall but not incredible. <br/><br/>Now what I did not like about this movie. Full focus of this movie was Aamir. But I did not find Amir's acting as much appealing compared to others. He was energetic but acting wise, not that good. Secondly, the movie, as per the genre is concerned, is not a romantic movie. <br/><br/>So overall, it is good movie. Good composition, good direction, but to my view it does not rank among the best movies of bollywood."
"bob_bear","Null","3","7","12 August 2011"," 3 hours too long
","I rented this movie largely because of my love for Aamir and the rave reviews on here but in the event it was a disappointment.<br/><br/>The film is crude and vulgar in parts. This is something I did not expect from Bollywood. I don't appreciate fart gags in UK/US movies and I certainly didn't like them here.<br/><br/>Having 40-odd year old guys playing 18 year old students was somehow more ridiculous than normal --even for a Bollywood movie where, lets face it, reality is the least consideration.<br/><br/>But what this film really confirmed to me was that Aamir is always surrounded by second rate actors. The frumpy girlfriend with glasses was as dreary as his two student buddies. There is no one to compete with him here. Other than Dil Chahta Hai, I've never seen him act in an ensemble. For the most part it is the Aamir show all the way. Yes, he's a fabulous actor but having him take center stage with zero competition does him no favors and makes for a boring 3 hours.<br/><br/>Nope, sorry. I found the film a bore and I expected better."

","Innovative, Inspiring, I loved it.. December seems to be a month when Bollywood wakes up from the much dreaded sleep and releases it's 'Good Cinema' for the tired audience.. Maybe that's why it's one of the reasons we can bid 2009 a warm farewell with a smile..<br/><br/>Rajkumar Hirani is the guy with the magic touch. After the enormous success of Munnabhai series, he takes another chance and delivers, and surely he delivers well, winning the heart of his audience again. He's definitely the ""Undisputed King of Comedy"".. <br/><br/>Shortly following him is our Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad. No Spoilers please. Yes, I will follow the advice and proceed. <br/><br/>Music is not extraordinary but it fits the movie and situation perfectly to the limit that you may even start enjoying it. <br/><br/>Plot, loosely based on Chetan Bhagat's 5 point someone which I have not read and I do not really intend to read. For me as a viewer, it's Hirani's and Abjhijat's Joshi's screenplay that made me enjoy the movie and I would like to keep it that way.<br/><br/>I don't enjoy bollywood cinema a lot. 10% of movies which gain commercial success and amidst all the hype can be 'in real terms' can be said good, one of this kind is 3 Idiots. <br/><br/>You will enjoy 170 minutes of this movie that I can assure you. And 70% of the time, you'll be laughing. If you enjoyed Munnabhai's humor, this movie is definitely your cuppa coffee. <br/><br/>Don't miss it but if you've got small kids, enjoy the movie at home.

"thirteeninchwinch","3","7","23","22 June 2012"," A Star For Each Idiot
","Based on the book Five Point Someone this is the story of three new friends trying to survive the universe and the university of information technology. The first half was quite entertaining with a series of flashbacks creating a college comedy where the rambunctious students clash with the strict and traditionalist teacher/school. Some of the messages about suicide, peer pressure, parental expectations and teaching methods were presented quite well, though possibly a bit heavy handedly, and generated some of the genuinely heartfelt moments. The second half relied on a clunky and forced mystery plot device that undermined the previously laid platform and required a character to act completely and unrealistically out of character. It also became more manipulative, corny and overwrought in excessively turning on the tears and trying to wrench the audiences hearts every second minute.<br/><br/>The romance was all right, though it took too much of centre stage too late. A couple of generally well known adages were passed off as original dialogue which detracts from the credibility of the rest of the script. Specifically these were anecdotes about the million dollar American space pen being trumped by the Russian pencil and the toothpaste that's unable to be put back in the tube. The actors were all on cue with the comedy even if they weren't really age appropriately cast. I found the 44 years old Aamir Khan to play it a bit over the top with his attempts at boy genius mannerisms (putting his finger to his mouth) offputting.<br/><br/>The songs were certainly catchy, though the lyrics tended to be rather simplistic eg: ""Give me some sunshine, Give me some rain, Give me another chance, I want to grow up once again"". However, the dance scenes were excellent with the highlight the main romantic to and fro which was only let down by the inclusion of the chicken dance. I still don't understand whether these dance scenes are fantasy or real especially when they are included in a character's real flashback memories. I will continue to presume they are fantasy despite cinematic liberties being taken.<br/><br/>The Indian locations provided some beautiful scenery and were well shot and served the scenes well. The total running time of three hours was unnecessarily long and some needless scenes (eg the birth scene) could have been significantly shortened. Overall it was an enjoyable film, but it was only good and not as great as it is being touted by some."
"mvijaysairao","8","5","15","26 December 2009"," Class Apart
","Before I start heaping praise for the movie, let me point out to a few,very few average points of the film. <br/><br/>The movie at several points turned too obvious , so obvious that I bet half the audience in the theatre could guess what was coming next . I don't imply the director always has to pull out a rabbit out of the hat or do the unobvious ,but I strongly feel not letting the audience see through the curtain is the best way to keep them glued to their seats . Also I feel there was a bit of Munnabhai hangover casting its shadow on the direction of the movie.There seems to be a certain monotonicity in the three films Hirani has to his name, but this is still pardonable.I would have to say a few scenes like ""the Baby Delivery scene"" were a bit off the hook .. nevertheless the audience loved it. <br/><br/>Well enough of biting now let me write something good , very good about the movie .<br/><br/>Rajkumar Hirani Take a Bow !!!! You did it once again you gem of an artist ,you in fact ended up bettering the Novel.The most beautiful aspect of his direction here is the perfect blend of portrayal of Humour and Emotions he achieved. One moment you are fighting hard to keep those pearls grilled in your eyes and the other you actually spill them out laughing . The movie comes up with a beautiful message , I mean what more can the audience ask for ? Another very beautiful aspect of his direction was the ease with which he geared in & out of present and flashback.The screenplay of the movie (which is a combined effort of Hirani ,Bhagat and Joshi(Mission Kashmir & Lage Raho Munnabhai Fame) ) is top notch. The music by Shantanu Moitra though might not appear to have hit the bull's eye initially but goes very well with the Movie.Watch out for the track "" Gimme Some Sunshine "". <br/><br/>Sharman Joshi was just the perfect cast in the role of Raju and did complete justice to the role, but as one of my friends pointed out the character resembled the character of Sukhi from RDB. But still here is one guy who has a perfect timing for comedy and still shoulders emotional scenes with similar ease.The duration of role Kareena got might not be long but the character leaves her effect well.Madhavan too does complete justice to the role. Boman Irani is one of those people who just doesn't stop getting praises every time enters the screen , he does a marvellous job portraying Virus, The Director. In the end I must admit this movie belongs to Aamir Khan. Hats of to you sir!!! May be its his Incapability to do bad that always works for him . Not a moment in the whole movie would you feel that here is a 44 year old man playing a 21 year old boy..... and has looked younger than ever . I bet he would have made the odd 30's and 40's feel like being 20 again ... No doubt he in response to Shahrukh's King status Claims to be the Ekka (Ace) of Bollywood.<br/><br/>Time for rating , As a critic I'd rate it 4/5 , as i thought the editing could have been better , and for the few momentary lapses here and there in the direction .<br/><br/>But as a viewer who wants entertainment I'd rate it a 4.5/5 . Amazing movie , go watch it , you'll laugh , you'll cry and will in the end, end up walking out of the theatre with a message. A Must watch for every age group :)"

"tkchess","8","2","4","5 August 2012"," An American POV: Very good movie, but longer than needs to be
","First off, take note of the length of the movie (IMDb here says 170 minutes). You got that right, just shy of 3 hours. But don't let that scare you from watching the movie - it is a really emotional movie which will grip you for the full 3 hours.<br/><br/>Second, it probably does not need to be 3 hours. I hear there is an American remake in the works. I am anxious to see how it will be done, and what will be cut because there is a lot of stuff in this movie which probably can get the boot. We Americans generally believe that all Indian movies have dance numbers, and this movie doesn't disappoint, with several useless numbers (useless in my opinion).<br/><br/>Third, the IMDb synopsis, while accurate, refers to like...one quarter of the actual movie. In other words, it is a lot like ""Forest Gump"" in that the ""present"" that is initially presented (which involves Forest finding Jenny and his son, and then moving to Alabama, etc. etc.) is setup through the telling of the whole back story, which takes up the majority. Same deal here with ""3 Idiots"". The IMDb synopsis covers the present, in that three guys are on a journey to find their lost friend, but the real meat of this movie is the whole back story which is not mentioned in the least. So just keep that in mind before starting the movie. I say that because when I read the synopsis I came in with this mentality that this was going to be an Indian version of ""Road Trip"" or something, just based on the title, the cover and the synopsis (it really isn't).<br/><br/>Fourth, this movie is nothing like your vulgar/sexual American comedies involving some good buddies and their adventures. There really are some useful messages in this movie, especially some that will really touch home with anyone who has gone through engineering studies (like myself).<br/><br/>With that aside, the movie was great. The emotions are really powerful, the acting is really good - a very touching story. The dean (Viru Sahastrabudhhe, played by Boman Irani) really touched home with me. I had a teacher exactly (Yes, EXACTLY!) like this guy in my engineering studies. Thankfully for me he was just a teacher of a couple classes and not the dean of the school (whew!).<br/><br/>The three hours really flies by because the advancements in the ""present"" story (the three guys on the journey to find their friend) are made after finding out the back story. For example, the movie starts out with a guy feigning a heart ailment to get a plane to turn home, rushing to a friend's house, waking him and rushing his good buddy out of his house (so fast that he forgets to put on his pants) all to arrive at this random location where they meet the third buddy. The third buddy tells them that they all made a promise to meet there 10 years prior. The next (very long) segment of the movie goes back to square zero to introduce everyone and educate (pun intended) as to the significance of the location. After that, the ""present"" advances to the next location. In my opinion, if the movie just focused on the ""present"" without giving any life to the characters, it would be very hollow. I mean just think if ""Forest Gump"" just started with him talking to that lady who tells him that Jenny's address is around the corner and he just runs off - you would never learn of Jenny's issues, Forest's history with Jenny, etc.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the movie is just too damn long, and there are things that probably don't need to be elaborated multiple times. I get it, Rancho is different from everyone else, and will excel at everything. I don't need it to be reiterated 10 times. I also don't need the dance numbers, they provided nothing to the story. If you have seen the movie ""Men of Honor"" I think you can understand of what I speak (Cuba Gooding's character keeps pushing through the barriers to achieve his successes over and over to the point where the movie is longer than it needs to be. OK, he beat the racist general. OK he beat everyone else in their times underwater. OK he beat the racist who cut his tool bag. OK OK OK OK...heh).<br/><br/>All that aside, it has some really powerful messages that you can really take home as a future (or current) parent. I'd say that if you are current or prospective engineering student, this is a *MUST* watch. No joke. For graduates of engineering studies, I'd say you should definitely check this out to get a few chuckles, reminiscing about your days in engineering and to gather an idea of the Indian culture with engineering (if what they portray is true, I'd say it is eye-opening).<br/><br/>If it was more to the point, and not as dragged out, I'd give it a 9 or a 10."

Raju when he started to fight back against his fear he had reached his destiny that means dedication,hard work and if we control our fear and nervousness then we can reach out goal. Farhan was interested in photography but he was study engineering which doesn't give any interest to him from this we can say if you are interested in that course then only join otherwise not don't choose any option which is not make you interest and don't pressure your child choose according to you please give them chance to choose his or her(child) own interest course which he/she want.

","3 Idiots directed by Rajkumar Hirani. The story of the film is about India's education system, which does not encourage students to choose their destination by their wish, rather than it forces us to follow the regular rules of the system to race.
In this film, we see a lot of characters Rancho(Aamir Khan), Farhan(R Madhavan), Raju (Sharman Joshi) are the main leading characters. They got admitted to the city's elite college, where they meet their principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe(Boman Irani). Who was very strict with his rules. For that everyone in the college was afraid of him but in behind everyone call him VIRUS.
Rancho was joyful and limitless who always gives challenges to the difficulties of life, takes it very lightly. Raju and Farhan were different. They were afraid of parents, teachers, and also exams. Both of them have their different family problems. In this movie, we see how Rancho changes their life and also their way of thinking. Here we also can see an interesting character Chatur (Omi), Who always follows the race and want to become the winner. Presence of Priya( Kareena Kapoor) makes it quite romantic and emotional. And the small argues with VIRUS entertaining the audience, especially the Chamatkar/Balatkar speech. Music & Choreography were really awesome. By watching this movie I personally enjoyed it a lot, and also inspired too. I will recommend everyone to see this movie at least once in your life."

","Kudos to director Rajkumar Hirani to doing something more than justice to Chetan Bhagat's novel five point someone. The story revolves around 3 friends namely Farhan (R. Madhavan), Raju (Sharman Joshi) and Rancho (Aamir Khan) and their journey of 4 years through an engineering college.
The film begins with Farhan and Raju going on a searching spree for Rancho after 10 years of their college life has ended. Over the whole of journey of road they keep on lamenting the memories of their elite college life. It takes the first trust with the mandatory ragging session which enunciates who the leader of the gang is going to be. At this point enters the ever charming Aamir Khan as Rancchodas. Rancho not only led his friends through all the mazes of peer pressure, illogical educational system but also taught them some excruciating exciting life mantras.
Through the journey of college life, the three musketeers came in a confrontation with the authority as represented through the dominating figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe who's only principle to life is, to win the race of life you need to be fast or else ""you'll be like the broken egg of a cuckoo bird."" Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duhs in real life and non-conformists like Rancho who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills.
In the process of travelling through the journey of college life, Rancho falls in love with Pia (Kareena Kapoor) who happens to be Viru Sahastrabuddhe's daughter and they inspite of all the odds in the path as destiny has carved out, Ranchho and Pia do end up together after a long wait of 10 years.
The second half of the movie holds special mention due to its sudden turn of events as of Raju's suicide attempt to the child birth sequence. But it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track.
The best part of the film is that, this film is a factory of life lessons yet Hirani for not even once loses the humor essence of the movie. Certain sequences might even have you rolling on the floor, like the ragging sequence, Omi's ""chamatkar"" speech, the mournful meal with Raju's mom, attending Pia's sister's wedding, Ranchos sundry demo of how Pia has chosen the wrong guy for himself.
3 idiots is a complete package watch from comedy to seriousness to life lessons to carry with yourself throughout. Along with the incredible acting of all the actors, Shantanu Moitra's music score gave the movie a whole new level of life.
Having being released in the year 2009, 3 idiots still now holds a good rank in our hearts when reminded of a Sunday Afternoon Movie Marathon with family!"

","The film was a great one, although it's long in duration, it has the flavor of a comedy at the same time we are learning in every scenario. It gave an impact to every college life, and on how learning is about.<br/><br/>First thing first is the friendship they build together. As they took their first step being a freshmen student, they instantly find themselves a companion. The film taught us that real friends would really help you up in times of difficulties. Forced learning and learning with passion, these two are totally different. The film portrays the two possible sides of a student why they took up Engineering. Some students were forced to study Engineering because of the pressure from the family so they would end up being afraid to fail during a test and the worst case is they would commit suicide. On the other side, learning with passion students took up engineering because it's their own desire, no one is forcing them to do it and so they were mostly on top. This taught us that we should follow what we desire, what we want and what we love. Being forced to something that is not our dream is like depriving us to pursue the future we want. The three characters show us the different characteristics of a student. Farhan took up engineering because he was forced but in the end, he chose to be a wildlife photographer and it was a very touching scene how he confessed to his father and being accepted. Raju took up engineering because he has a purpose to help his poor family. Lastly, Rancho is the most optimistic one, he took engineering because the hit is his passion and his dream. Yet, the pressure is a murderer. Another scheme of the film which also strikes me is the pressure they gave towards the students. The system is obliged to focus on the excellence of students. College is supposed to mold the students to prepare for the future and not pressure them to get high grades. Then again, the other side shows positivity. In the film, Rancho keeps on developing his knowledge and uses his skills in helping other people in need. He contributes to saving people and inspired them to strive more. It was an inspiring one.<br/><br/>When we feel that we are in a verge of failings on what we are doing, we should need to look back on why did we took up this program, look back to the people we want to lift up once we are done and look back to our desired dreams and use all of these to make us feel motivated again. Failure is not forever, we all need to be a failure before we condemn as a winner. So what if we fail? it doesn't make us less, Instead, it makes us be wiser in making such decisions in the future. The film clearly depicts the struggles and the pressure of college students. As an engineering student, the film serves us with what we need to understand. It's about choosing happiness at the same time pursuing your dreams. As it said, ""making your profession into a passion"". We may have different reasons why we are pursuing this as long as we find the bliss of learning not because we are forced to. Watch the film and you might learn more than what I learned."

","3 Idiots were directed by Rajkumar Hirani and scripted by Abhijat Joshi.
The story of the film is about India's rude-crude education system, which does not encourage students to choose their destination by their wish, rather than it forces us to follow the regular rules of the system like the rat race.<br/><br/>In this film, we see a lot of characters. In between them Farhan (R Madhavan), Raju (Sharman Joshi) & Rancho(Aamir Khan) are the main leading characters. They got admitted to the city's elite college, where they meet their principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani). Who was very strict with his rules. For that everyone in the college was afraid of him. But in behind every one call him VIRUS.<br/><br/>Then comes rancho with a joyful and limitless, free soul, Who always gives challenges to the difficulties of life, takes it very lightly.
Raju and Farhan are different. They are afraid of parents, teachers, and also exams. Both of them have their different family problems.
In this movie, we see the coming of Rancho in their life changes the viewing angle of them and also their way of thinking. Here we also can see an interesting character Chatur (Omi), Who always follows the race and want to become the winner.
Though it is a very thoughtful and enthusing film, presence of Priya(
Kareena Kapoor) makes it quite romantic and emotional. And the small argues with VIRUS entertaining the audience, especially the Chamatkar/Balatkar speech.

","Story: Rancho, Raju and Farhan enter the elite engineering college, only to learn lessons of life that cannot be taught through books and classrooms. Principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe is no help at all.<br/><br/>Movie Review: 3 Idiots is the perfect end to an exciting year for India: the year when the aam aadmi voted in progress, liberalism, secularism and turned his back to corruption, communalism, regionalism. The three idiots, Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan), are perfect archetypes of the new age Indian who is essentially a non-conformist, questioning outmoded givens, choosing to live life on his own terms and chartering new roads that consciously skirt the rat race. Of course, they begin on the beaten track -- due to societal/parental pressure -- but refuse to become cogs in the wheel. Naturally, they end up as the Frostian hero (Robert Frost's Road Not Taken) who made all the difference to his life, and the world, by taking the road less travelled by.<br/><br/>The film begins with the entry of our threesome in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high-pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference.<br/><br/>So, you have the threesome embroiled, time and again, in a confrontation with authority, as represented through the domineering figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), the unsmiling Principal who venerates the cuckoo because the bird's life begins with murder. Kill the competition, because there is only one place at the top, believes the Princi. Poor, mistaken Princi! Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duhs in real life and non-conformists (Rancho and Rocket Singh Inc), who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills.<br/><br/>The high point of the film is the fact that director Rajkumar Hirani says so much, and more, without losing his sense of humour and the sheer lightness of being. The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas. Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's chamatkar/balatkar speech, the threesome's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself. Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic 'humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track.<br/><br/>Amongst the performances, Aamir Khan is stupendous as the rule-breaker Rancho.

","The film is a classic work of the famous Indian actor Amir Khan. It criticizes the cramming education of India by rote and emphasizes the importance of interest education, diligent thinking and breaking conventional thinking. The protagonist of the story is Lancher. Because of the need to complete his studies for a noble son, he came to the famous Imperial University of Technology. This university is a dream place for everyone. The students in it have excellent grades, the principal is very strict, and also a very accomplished. However, the principal 's teaching method is grade-only theory, which may be similar to the Chinese saying ""only reading is high"".<br/><br/>Lancher had just arrived at the school and said he was going to have a newcomer's gift. The other freshmen took off their pants to reveal their ass. When it was Lancher's turn, he wisely used the principle of urine conduction to tease the teacher who forced him to take off his pants. Everyone understands this physics principle, but few people apply it. The so-called theory seems to stay in the textbook or in the brain. At the opening ceremony, when the principal held an aviation pen to tell its origins, Lancher asked why the astronauts did not use a pencil. This question left the principal speechless. It can be seen that the stereotypes will not only limit the students ' Imagination, even the principal who has made a name for himself is no exception. Lancher's unique thinking gradually attracted everyone's attention and began to affect the entire school.<br/><br/>Lancher soon met two friends, Fahan and Raja. The two agreed with Lancher's thoughts. The three of them have a unique style of work and often sing the phrase ""Everything will be fine."" Their lives It is full of freedom. However, it is precisely because the three people are doing things uniquely, which violates the traditional education of this university, making the university full of enthusiasm. How much do their methods differ from school education? Among the students was a Chartu who studied hard, and he worked hard. Every time before the exam, he would recite a lot of knowledge. Of course, there is no harm in memorizing the textbook knowledge, but Chartu does not understand whether he is learning for interest, and I do n't know what this knowledge means to his life. He delays thinking, and book knowledge becomes his mindset, divergence and innovation. Thinking is severely restricted, and knowledge can not be used to learn and use. No matter whether the problem in reality is simple or difficult, he can memorize a concept in the book proficiently, and then the teacher will praise him for his intelligence. This is what the university advocates. Educational model. I remember that during a class, the teacher asked the students to answer what the concept of machinery was. Chartu stood up and recited a large section and was recognized by the teacher. When Lancher answered, he only said that the machine was a convenient device and used the pants door. The front zipper made a demonstration, saying that the zipper is a simple machine. Because his answer did not correspond to the concept of the textbook, the students all laughed. The teacher also criticized Lancher and asked him to answer in ""terms"". Then he said a large number of The mechanical theory, the teacher did not understand, asked him how to say so complicated, he replied, just tried to use a simple method to explain, and it did not work. Another time, the headmaster of Lancher got angry and was asked to give a lecture on the podium. Lancher wrote an English word on the blackboard and let everyone sitting in the dictionary look up in the dictionary. Who can find who wins first can be imagined. It 's time, and everyone did n't find the word. Lancher explained that this was a combination of the names of his two friends. Everyone was busy looking up the word, but they did n't think about why they wanted to check it, or whether they had a passion for knowledge. And longing to check. Obviously, everyone's mindset limits their enthusiasm for knowledge.<br/><br/>The education of Imperial College of Technology is a one-color education, and everyone uses the same set of standards to investigate. I remember a student who liked to make airplane models very much, but when he was about to succeed, the principal discovered that he was angrily throwing away his airplane model, and also called his elderly father to tell him to drop the student. The student spent everything at home for the children to study, but was eventually ordered to drop out because he was interested in flying. The family members could not bear it, and the student could not accept it. As a result, he chose to hang himself. The pressure killed the student, but the principal felt confident that he was innocent. Lancher 's two friends also had their own interests. Lagar wanted to be an engineer, and Fahan liked photography. Their interest was not understood by the school and family. Their family conditions were not good. When Lagar was ordered to drop out of school, He also chose to commit suicide. Fortunately, the encouragement of Rancher, Fahhan and his family made Raga wake up. This time he no longer chose to escape, he dared to face himself and pursue his own life, and finally succeeded; Fahrenheid This time he asked his parents to study photography, but they were all opposed voices. After the events in Laga, Fahan once again expressed his determination to learn photography. This time, his parents softened and understood his son. In the end, Fahan became a famous photographer. The principal's children used to commit suicide because of the huge learning pressure. Lancher always insisted on his interest. That is why he chose his major. His thinking was flexible and he would not be constrained by the rigid system. Therefore, he always achieved the first major and finally became a scientist, with more than 400 invention. The principal's change of concept occurred when his daughter had a difficult birth, when it was raining heavily. At the moment of life, Lancher used his knowledge and reality to quickly come up with a way to save the mother and son. The principal held the newborn grandson , Saying ""Do you want to be a football star in the future?"" This sentence breaks the headmaster's way of thinking in the past. He believes that interest education is the most important thing. He also sent his treasured pen to Rancher, indicating that Lancher was the best student he met.<br/><br/>Lancher chose a major according to his own interests. He had a sincere love for knowledge, flexible thinking, and opposed duck-feeding education. He was able to link knowledge and real life, and achieved world-renowned achievements in the scientific community. Lancher also influenced other students, enabling them to pursue their dreams courageously, and he also influenced the entire school education system. In contrast, China's education system actually has a lot of disadvantages. It is basically the same as the exam-oriented education, lack of interest education, and insufficient innovation ability of students. Perhaps China should carry out education reform, cultivate talents in all directions, and reserve a new generation of troops for the country. However, the environment we live in is more difficult to change or slower. At this time, we may need to make changes ourselves, so that we can start with a passion for knowledge and a strong desire to choose the direction we are interested in and remain flexible. The way of thinking connects knowledge and practice well, keeps thinking and innovating, and finally realizes our dream."

","""Life is a race: If you're not fast enough, you'll get trampled,""<br/><br/>Writing this review after watching this film countless times.
This is the best Indian movie on The education system of India. This movie is very Amazing. I think everyone should watch this movie. I love it.
Such a delicate reality of Engineering students, their problems and education system and society's attitude towards it!
I see this movie first time at least 8 years ago.I had seen this movie many times at least 20 -30 times but i never feel bored.All the characters of this movie is very good especially Virus (Boman Irani) and Ranchor Das (Aamir Khan) character is my favourates in this movie.
This is a revolutionary movie it changed people mindset towards life in a most fantastic way and taught so many things that I specially will never forget it it influenced me a lot benchmark setting path breaking heart captivating movies is this legendary masterpiece which taught me about life this movie is a one of a kind film that can never be forgotten ever.
3 Idiots puts a limelight on the dogmatic system of the competitive educational system, its inhumaneness, drastic shortcomings and most importantly its repercussions. 3 Idiots conveys a powerful message about how valuable your friends can be when they push you toward reaching your own highest potential."

","Lanche's people are idealized, he is smart, bold and careful, regardless of gains and losses. Such a person does not exist in reality, but his role is to say what people dare not say in real life, to live a life that ordinary people dare not try. So say ""three idiots make bollywood"", lanche this high IQ is the number one idiot. What normal person would rebel so casually against the educational system? But it is only by his presence that we are truly reflected in the real world.<br/><br/>Real we are not lanche, and farhan and radu.<br/><br/>Farhan was the man who almost abandoned his ideals under the pressure of his family's expectations. In fact, he only needs the courage to talk seriously with his family and the determination to send the letter, the ideal is in front of his eyes. Ladue is a man who is afraid to move forward, and dropping the ring is his courage to face the future. And lanche is their courage booster.<br/><br/>The film is absurd, staged the joys and sorrows of three fools. However, the reality of us is not such a fool."

Although the film is ultimately an idealistic dream, it touches on a number of very thought-provoking social issues, including India's high suicide rate, brain drain, rote learning in schools and the lack of a single division of labor and employment options. The maverick hero is a fictional character who can only live in a movie, but his idealistic courage and persistence are still awesome.

Basically, follow your passion. This is an amusing movie with solid comedy, romance and a stern look at India's education culture.

","I have not seen a lot of Bollywood films-maybe 50 in total-but this was easily the best one I have seen. It was a uproarious comedy mixed with poignant drama to shed some truth on the absurd pressures of academia. I feel like any grad student in any country would get a ton out of this film's spirit and message. All is, indeed, well when you put your friends first.<br/><br/>The film is close to 3 hours long but with so much warmth, laughs and visual flair the time just flies by. It is amazing how much of life is packed into its run time. I loved every second of this film. I think Khan's charisma and gravity as a the offbeat, wise Ranco is the key to the film. So much of the film is about his viewpoint that it is really hard to not fall in love this guy.<br/><br/>For western audiences this films reminds me of Animal House mixed with Dead Poet's Society. Plus Bollywood epic visuals and musical. The combination is quite intoxicating."

","A great movie in the Bollywood history, that have much entertainment, motivation, and concepts about different aspects or practicality of life. The movie have both positive and negative aspects:<br/><br/>This is a very, very long film-with a run-time of almost three hours, but since ""3 Idiots"" is a very good film I loved its length.
Movie Emphasis about education vs Job. It is shown in the movie all the students usually focuses on their job and want to collect money, but no body interested and seems love to study or in the concepts of knowledge.
My opinion is that if you're studying with the thought that ultimately you will get a job in future and possibility to earn through it, then this is wrong. It comes in the sense of greedy person.
-Sexual seen(Pregnant women, kissing scenes) is not good for youngsters. It could have influence on the person's individual character and on their behavior.
-Raju's suicide scene, when principal asked him to write a letter against Rancho and become witness in their expulsion, this act negative influence on a young generation, if individual person is in depression.
-Acting and behavior of ""Farhan, Raju and Ranch"" shows disrespect towards teachers.
-Although the whole story is on practical life of students, but I think that there is a huge difference between real life and the acting shown in the movie.' As ""Rancho"" did not work hard for achieving good grades, but he was able to score top marks in exams which is impossible in real life.<br/><br/>Positve:
-Story gives a message that we should alliance with friends, develop strong bond and strengthen our relationship.
-Movie is a great motivational story for all youngsters, it is a message that student should clear his/her concepts and do not try to cramp the whole document or a book.
""Farhan, Raju and Ranch"", their acting, love, behavior, and different activity to each other is so interesting, emotional and lovable. Scenes are perfect, genuine, true and related to reality of student life.
-Students should not be depressed and effect due to their studies and do not take influence and harm himself."

","This movie came against my expectations due to its title, but when I started watching and as the movie kept progressing it hit me like a thunder because it was entirely opposed to what my preconceived thoughts were. This is an inspirational blockbuster movie, full of sentiments, touches upon critical issues like school stress and it carries varying kinds of moments, funny to deep thought-provoking moments with big significant lessons by the virtue of humor and the witty dialogues that keep you engrossed.
Thanks to the splendid Performance by Amir, he owned it indeed, some other acting crew were average and also I think that the duration was too long and I believe it could have been less longer. I noticed that Indian like their films to surpass the two-hours timeframe which might be deemed to be a weakness because you want to keep the viewers awake and you don't want them to yawning, also films suppose to save time or some viewers rather read the book that this movie was based on, you will be moved by the movie and it will absolutely change your mindset after you will have done."

","By Keshab Baskota <br/><br/> In Rajkumar Hirani's inspirational comedy film, 3 Idiots, Rancho (Aamir Khan), is a college student who does not hesitate at all to achieve success. He assists his two friends, Farhan and Raju, by feeding inspirational advice to alter their way of thinking. The film begins when the two friends get together because Chatur ""Silencer"" Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) calls Farhan and claims that he has found out where Rancho is. All three of them get together and travel to Shimla to find Rancho, who has disappeared since graduation. While on the car to Shimla, a flashback story is painted which shows Farhan and Raju starting their college year in the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) in Delhi. Rancho has a conviction that hands on learning is the best and goes to class to learn, rather than achieve good grades. Farhan and Raju have their own personal dilemmas which is why they end up at ICE. The institution's director, Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani) is also a professor known as ""Virus"" in the ICE community. Virus's traditional philosophies on education contrast heavenly to Rancho's carefree and easygoing love for learning. Rancho and Virus's daughter, Pia (Kareena Kapoor), fall for each other but things start to fall apart when the influence of friends is embraced which leads to bad choices <br/><br/> When I watched this film It was in 2014, it was a cold windy Saturday morning. My first impression was, ""here we go again, another boring film!"" Because after reading the title, my brain instantly thought this movie was a flop. But I kept watching because it starred the talented, Aamir khan, who is one of the best actors of Bollywood. The film was hysterically funny and inspirational. The song, Give me some sunshine, is very powerful as it relates to most college students' life. The lyrics, ""give me some sunshine, give me some rain...Give me another chance I wanna grow up once again..."", gives me flashbacks about my childhood and want to relive those moments again where the sun was shining bright; where the clouds would spit out heavy rain which would swell the plants and create loud intimidating drops that simply calms your soul. We are all tired and need a little rain and a little sunshine in our foreheads sometimes. The climax of the film is when Rancho and his friends are caught asleep behind the back seats of the class by Virus. They were all drunk, but Rancho and Raju were awake from it and up sitting down with their blurry faces. Virus walks in and calls, Raju's name and he awkwardly replies, ""present sir!"" The bottle rolls on the floor and goes down to the front row where Silencer picks it up confidently and takes a sniff. Raju is called to Virus's office and is forced into an extreme scenario: He is forced to choose between Rancho or himself to be rusticated from ICE. Raju is stuck between sacrificing his poor family or his best friend. At the end, he jumps from the window and is immediately rushed to the hospital. I think this scene sums up what college experience really is: it is about the decisions you make as you mature. It is really a heart touching scene for the audience. It creates the pathos appeal as the it kicks in with the lyrics, ""We won't let go of you. We won't let you go!"" It is hard to translate it to English, but the second sentence is inversed from the first sentence; this is done to paint an even picture in the audiences' minds because the meaning is same, but it is said in a different order."

","In Rajkumar Hirani's inspirational comedy film, 3 Idiots, Rancho (Aamir Khan), is a college student who does not hesitate at all to achieve success. He assists his two friends, Farhan and Raju, by feeding inspirational advice to alter their way of thinking. The film begins when the two friends get together because Chatur ""Silencer"" Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) calls Farhan and claims that he has found out where Rancho is. All three of them get together and travel to Shimla to find Rancho, who has disappeared since graduation. While on the car to Shimla, a flashback story is painted which shows Farhan and Raju starting their college year in the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) in Delhi. Rancho has a conviction that hands on learning is the best and goes to class to learn, rather than achieve good grades. Farhan and Raju have their own personal dilemmas which is why they end up at ICE. The institution's director, Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani) is also a professor known as ""Virus"" in the ICE community. Virus's traditional philosophies on education contrast heavenly to Rancho's carefree and easygoing love for learning. Rancho and Virus's daughter, Pia (Kareena Kapoor), fall for each other but things start to fall apart when the influence of friends is embraced which leads to bad choices

","This movie really changes the feel of the Indian film. In the past, I felt that Indian films had something very superficial like the scenes in which actors looked directly at the lens (as seen through the 8-year-old bride film), and unnecessary slow motion shots, or as well as the music that takes up most of the movie (Enthiran). But this movie made me really like the Indian film. The music in the movie is really cute and suited to the situation of the film, it honors the film a lot.<br/><br/>The film talks about what each person thinks about what the university really does for each person. What are we looking for in college? We learn rote and seek knowledge to get a degree that makes ours get a job with a high salary and then worry about rice rice money things. And here Shadon is different, he's against mechanical thinking, he's looking for a simple explanation for the definitions. He really learns to love the industry, he wants to learn it. He did not pursue knowledge, he did not pursue money, he did not pursue success. Simply everything he does because he wants to know more, because he is curious, he doesn't wants to race with anyone in the race of knowledge, money, or success.<br/><br/>I really learned a lot from this movie. I was very touched in the scene that Shadon send his dad's friend to hospital, as well as when the friend suicide, then also when the delivering baby scene. A movie worth watching."

It is no spoiler but this movie deals with the current problems in Indian society where one's academic career decides his/her life. And there are some scenes that I have experienced in my daily lives in Japan.
For example, there is a scene a the father of one of the 3 idiots denies his dream to be a photographer because the father gave everything to send him into a good college. It is of course that academic records matter but it should not be ""EVERYTHING"" in one's life. 
Japanese society still tends to put the most great value on academic careers and our university exams stress us a lot. Maybe all the students have to watch it to reflect on what they have done and will do (but only after the exams are over!)."

","Starring: : Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor, R Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Boman Irani. Direction: Rajkumar Hirani Music: Shantanu Moitra Production: Vidhu Vinod Chopra Productions<br/><br/>The story is about two friends Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman) who on getting a clue on the whereabouts of their college friend, Rancho (Aamir), start a quest to find him. Rancho in his college days was an exceptional, but 3 idiots<br/><br/>The movie is a joyful ride from start to finish with the pace tilting downwards only in the middle of the second half. Few good twists and the non-linear style of storytelling help the proceedings in a big way too. But Rajkumar Hirani borrows most of his jokes from the net and also does go filmy in a few scenes like the Sharman interview sequence or Aamir crying for every little thing that his friend does, or the scene where Mona Singh is having a baby and the scene after that. But scenes like the speech by Omi for teacher's day, or the first time Rancho visits Raju's house or Mona Singh's marriage, helps in bringing down the entire theater with laughter. <br/><br/>Initially, getting to believe Madhavan or Aamir as college students might be quite tough, but as the screenplay moves, we just start enjoying the movie and their acting. Aamir Khan is spectacular as Rancho and age aside, we can't think of a better Rancho after seeing the movie. Madhavan might not be looking as a college student but he brings a new dimension to his acting repertoire - a brilliant act. Sharman shows his excellence in a role which seems to be written for him. Kareena looks cute and does her role with equal cuteness. Boman Irani is brilliant, but what's new in it? Mona Singh is good in a small part. The actor enacting the role Omi is easily the find of the season; he is exceptional in almost all his scenes and is a riot to watch. <br/><br/>It's been quite a while since we saw the entire theater clapping, laughing aloud and whistling with you. It's a complete theater going experience. 3 Idiots is easily going to be the number one movie for quite a while at the box-office and can very well be the number one movie of the year. Hirani manages to give an excellent entertainer with a subtle message one more time."

","I was so moved at this film. There are three college students. They are studying about engineering. But Farhan, as a narrator in the film, prefers taking photos of animals to engineering. In India, it is said that men are expected to be an engineer and women are a doctor. So Farhan gives up his dream. One day, an genius boy enters this college and made friends with Farhan and another main character, Raju. He is Rancho. His pet phrase is 'Aal izz well'. He is very good at engineeing and does not hesitate to say his thoughts or opinions to anybody who has wrong ideas. Both Farhan and Raju gradually trust him. As this is a Bollywood film, the scenes of musical are shown. Their dancing is very cheerful and energetic. This film teaches us what learning is. Some people thinks entering a great school is a goal. Some people thinks they have to be an ideal man or woman as the parents wish you to be. But Rancho has doubts about them. He thinks it is most important to cherish your dream. So he helps Farhan to make himself to be honest to his father, and Farhan can manage to tell his true feelings and becomes a photographer at last. I love Raju's attitude for leaning. He does not care about the grade in test or academic background at all. He purely loves to learn. I could not stand crying at his sincerity. This film is not only serious but also hilarious, so makes me laugh often. The ending is very very great. I want to watch this film again and again. And I try to keep the phrase in mind 'Aal Izz Well'."

","It's good in parts but Okay as a whole. Aamir Khan this time comes up as an engineering student and does it not so convincingly. He seemed to have been through college not once but many times over, as he started telling 'Say your heart All is Well and things will fall into place'.<br/><br/>The movie is about giving freedom to kids and a message to parents, let them be what they want to be do not enforce things on them. This is conveyed in a light sense and in a comical way. Yet, at times it becomes preachy, like the confrontation of Rancho with Virus where Rancho says 'Yeh Marks mere ko samajh aaye hi nahi' and yet not at many other times. It is a parody of itself take the black and white scenes of Raju's family or the scene of Chatur Lingam where he says that after 5 years lets see who will be where. But the good moments are far and only between as a few drizzles in a tropic summer.<br/><br/>The cinematography is good only in parts. Like aerial shots of Shimla road and Ladakh scenes otherwise it was just good. The art designing is commendable with the look of college, hostel and other things done well. The editing was not precise as I thought there are lot of things that could have been cut out like the pregnancy sequence in climax. The casting was not apt except Boman Irani as Principal, Chatur Lingam guy the others were clearly not apt. The 3 main protagonists and the heroine were clearly a misfit as none seemed to be students. Acting was average as nothing was so great and so original as if it was never seen. Chatur Lingam was the silver lightning in the otherwise dry acting. Also to mention is Boman Irani as principal.<br/><br/>The writing was mediocre as their previous ones were well written and witty Munnabhai movies. And this was an adaptation of Five Point Someone having read that, I can say that the whole backdrop and the characters and only a few situations were picked but the point that was told was different from the book. That book is much worse than this movie. I am not detailing any instances as mostly, I found them silly and stupid.<br/><br/>And in parts, hardly a couple, the originality came out. The speech by Chatur Lingam is the saving grace otherwise it was merely pathetic but such instances took it to at least average level.<br/><br/>All is surely not well and it's strictly Average - 2/5."

","Not what I expected from Raju Hirani, at least after 'Lage Raho'. This film is shallow, promising to be, but just not the picture of engineering college or engineers at all. Evidently no one from Director's family ever had been an engineer and neither he had seen one. Ever if you go and watch this film, just watch it as an mindless (supposed to be) hilarious ride, with almost every joke that you may have heard of. Movie loosely based on the spiced book '5 point someone' by Chetan Bhagat, makes you realize that book was cent percent a better read than the movie. Too long, predictable and TOO LOUD on being 'Ever Joyful Enthusiast Loving Caring' personality. Performances to be acknowledged are of 'Boman Irani' playing the Dean of the Institute & of 'Omi Vaidya' playing Chatur Ramalingam aka 'Silencer'. Best and most humorous scenes are filmed with them. <br/><br/>In whole I am going with 6/10 for this one because, it did make me laugh out loud in some of the scenes."

","The best movie of 2009,I find it the best comedy film of Bollywood. It does not only titillates but also gives a strong message to change our education system, to change the rote learning method that we hold dear. In his typical style Rajkumar Hirani again gives a strong message with strong fun quotient,that catches everyone's funny bone and wit. Every character in the movie has acted brilliantly, despite their small roles Kareena,Madhavan and even Millimeter(I don't know his real name) excel. Chatur aka ""Silencer"" has given marvelous performance in his first Bollywood movie.Thoug it is based on 5 point someone but it takes very few scenes from the blockbuster novel and the most certainly it is more entertaining than the novel. Watch it for fun and for a strong message."
"raybaker-44985","2","3","8","1 July 2018"," Lost in translation?
","As an englishman I seem to have stumbled across '3 Idiots' the same way as many others working their way through the top 250, and out of the three Indian movies I have seen it is by far the worst. Female wrestling exercise 'Danghal' was passable, and the emotionally manipulative dyslexia film 'Like Stars On Earth' was barely passable, but alas I still had hope that '3 Idiots' would surpass them both. I was sorely mistaken.<br/><br/>The titular 3 idiots are played by men clearly in their 30s and 40s despite supposedly being college age, with the main character being an embarrassing Aamir Khan. Like the previous two Indian movies I have seen, the 2 hour 50 minute runtime is an undeserved slog to get through, this length inflated by having a fourth-wall smashing music video every other scene. It doesn't particularly matter whether a song is appropriate for the mood of a scene, as shown by the song 'All is well', an awful pop song that ends with a tasteless reveal of a student having hung himself to death in his room. <br/><br/>The plot of the film is difficult to follow, but luckily isn't particularly worth following either, with characters such as the antagonist being one-dimesional charicatures of 'authourity'. And that's not mentioning the female love interest, who turns up halfway through the film out of necessity just so the audience can be bored once again with shmaltzy 'romantic' ballads. The social commentary is unoriginal and obvious, with the main moral seemingly being to 'follow your dreams', although the characters and their actions are so unrealistic that this message barely gets through.<br/><br/>'3 Idiots' also fails to earn it's tag as a comedy, and I didn't laugh once throughout the entire runtime - other than out of pure amazement at how awful some scenes were. This film's idea of humour is somebody getting electrocuted by urinating on an electric wire, something that made me unintentionally uncomfortable, all acted with melodramatic facial experssions that reminded me of children's entertainment.<br/><br/>All things considered this is a really awful film, and my 2/10 rating isn't to bring the ludicrous overall score down, but is an accurate representation of my hatred for this film."

There were instances when I couldn't control myself from rocking back and forth on the creaking sliding chair in the theatre and other instances when my eyes truly welled up.<br/><br/>Aamir Khan stuns as usual and is given great support from Omi Vaidya in the comedy role.

Really. The Munnabhai films made you smile and chuckle in almost every scene, but there is such a lack of genuinity in this film, that it gets very hard to do the same here. Maybe it is the poor acting skills, maybe it is the fact that Aamir Khan cannot carry the film well at all, I dunno. Mostly, it must have been my expectations I guess.

"sagar272","3","3","9","24 January 2010"," Fine movie but is there anything called LOGIC and SENSE in bollywood???
","Fine movie but over rated due to 2 main reasons. 1. It's a Amir Khan movie(assuming the country has a huge Amir Khan fan following). 2. It's supposed to be adapted from one of the India's top selling Author's book. The movie has a very pathetic head start. I never seen a taken off plane landing just because of a stupid Chest Pain I thought Airlines were supposed to have Emergency Trauma Treatment and other First Aid services. Well neglecting that point since it's a bollywood movie its quiet fair. As the movie takes off almost till its mid section you may find certain Kicks but not a perfect comedy material yet. I didn surely notice that movie dictates some social values Even though I could see a good script building up only if the characters could have stood by it. The character of Chatur seems totally illogical, from his acting and presentation point of view it looks total waste of Reel time, I personally didn like it may be some mature actor might have Sufficed for it. Amir is OK as ever not a big deal to his role but had done pretty well till now. On with d latter section of the movie there is quiet a story. Boman Irani has been a perfectionist as alwaysactually he was the only character performing queit a Role.<br/><br/>As the climax approaches one can be certain that the movie actually deals with a major issue of student suicides in India but has been presented in a very immature way. Franly being a student of such a big and top notch institute in the country you can get kicked out for all the stupidity they play around in the movie. Climax is quiet predictable and artificial just as a numb bollywood fan would expect. All sets well in the end, those 3 stupid characters turn out to be quiet successful, Amir being the most among them. Actually I think that it could have been enough justice to such a fine move and it being provided with a satisfactory ending. Summing up the major pro' & con's in the movie are<br/><br/>Pro's<br/><br/>1. few scenes with quiet mature and good humour. 2. Message of the film A well-deserved strike on the existing education system where rot learning has become part of the life of every student's life. 3. And lots of one liners too 4. Boman Irani quiet well as expected.<br/><br/>Con's<br/><br/>1. As told before a dumb plane landing scene which actually makes me hate the movie. 2. Kareena eloping from her marriage.<br/><br/>3. And lot of other minor dramatic and directorial flaws. 4. Getting in a hospital Ward in a ""Scooty""<br/><br/>I mean are we nuts to take that??? they were supposed to be shot by the security at the gate of the hospital at least audiences would have been spared of the further stupidity in the movie.<br/><br/>Movie is fine for once time watch.

","With over six months of publicity, gossip, word of mouth, twitter updates, scandals, facebook applications, college debates and disappearing acts later finally Three Idiots released in theaters on the 25th of December 2009. Obviously, the first thought that comes to mind is, will the movie be up to snuff with the expectations it has created? Will i be happy with the comedy or is it going to be the few lines shown in the premiere? Is the movie going to be a typical Hindi film or something more?<br/><br/>If i may?,i would like to stick my neck out and say that the movie was good. In that it satisfied my senses for the three hours that i was in the theater. As my friend put it, there was never a moment that our attention veered away from the screen. We never felt disconnected from the plot, never uninterested. <br/><br/>The direction was beautiful, it was as if some brilliant student from college wanted to try something new and had brought in that fresh outlook. Also it was like a college graduate, as there was hardly an extra scene, the songs also told a tale and meant something. <br/><br/>Cinematography, rarely do you see movies paying so much attention to detail. The lighting, the angles and the backdrop shots were great. I especially like the Pandong Lake scene, the tourism department could do with using shots like that and getting people to go to Ladakh. I am going in 2010. <br/><br/>The acting in the movie was very free flowing, it didn't seem like there were any plastics in any of the scenes which is very refreshing. Boman Irani seemed a little repetitive with the whole Dr. Asthana acting in the movie but he kicked ass as an emotional dad. Kareena, Madhavan, Sharmaan were good in their supporting roles. Personally loved that Madhavan was the narrator.<br/><br/>Aamir Khan - Genius<br/><br/>The real hero in this movie is the well thought out plot and dialogue. The plot is going somewhere, has a direction and up to the last 20 minutes you do not really know where that is. Highlighting the current education system was worthwhile. Unfortunately the last 20 were a lot like a typical Hindi film, which is not always such a bad thing.<br/><br/>All said and done, is this movie going to be viewed and appreciated by future generations? I hope so"

","Direction - outstanding, Script - excellent, Dialogues - Well written, Acting - 10 out of 10, Comedy - mind blowing, Emotions - great, Message - too good, (specially for Indian parents) Whatever else you find left out, add full marks from my side. Rajkumar Hirani's earlier movies - Munna Bhai series, were all exapmles well crafted arts. Which answers all the question about his caliber. I have also heard that script of Lage Raho being added to Academy's Library of scripts. By this movies he proves yet again what he can create. He is simply among one of the best directors present in the country today. RajKumar Hirani + Aamir Khan, upon a Chetan Bhagat's best selling novel and you will find - 3 idiots!. I loved the message most as it matches with the need for today. I remember myself being imposed the dream of becoming an engineer. It beautifully captures the emotions of such students and the pressure because of their family. Dialogues has simple words but at the same time well thought out ones and one of the few i loved was from the suicide scene - ""I Quit"" - least use of words and maximum results.<br/><br/>One of Aamir's best ever!!<br/><br/>A MUST WATCH FOR EVERYONE."

"cherold","9","2","5","20 September 2017"," This inspires me to watch more Bollywood movies
","Until recently my only exposure to Indian cinema was Satyajit Ray. Like a lot of Americans, my knowledge of Bollywood was based entirely on film clips and American take-offs of lavish musical numbers.<br/><br/>I looked on a few lists of top Bollywood films and settled on 3 Idiots, which turned out to be a wonderful decision. The movie is terrifically funny and engaging, seamlessly moving from comedy to tragedy to musical numbers.<br/><br/>The story centers around a brilliant, iconoclastic technical student who spends the movie telling people to follow their dreams. While generally lighthearted, the movie strongly addresses the apparently terrible stresses on Indian college students. But in spite of some dark movies, overall this is about as feel-good as you can get. Feel-good to an absurd degree? Sure. But what's so bad about feeling good?<br/><br/>When I think of Bollywood I think of big musical numbers, and there are a handful here, although they're a tiny part of the three-hour running time. Still, they are tremendous fun.<br/><br/>To sum up, I saw a Bollywood movie, I laughed, I cried, and now I want to see more."
"kharad_p","10","2","5","4 December 2012"," Very near to a perfect movie !
","Brilliant. Simply, brilliant.<br/><br/>In my view 3 Idiots looks at our educational system which pressurizes the students and does not allow to chose his destination by his own wish, in a satirical way and brings out some of the flaws in it.<br/><br/>There are a number of significant moments I totally love in the movie. Aamir's introduction itself is a great start. I'll go on and say another lovely scene is when Farhan and Raju come last and find out where Rancho placed.<br/><br/>R. Madhavan gives his best performance in my opinion. His voice over is also a master stroke. He's got a strange innocence to him him this film. It works. Sharman Joshi is no less. He's just first rate.

"bitz_2008","8","2","5","15 March 2011"," Heck of a ride!
","I'm not from India so I won't comment on the country's educational system. I do believe that I'm allowed to comment on my experience with the movie.<br/><br/>Before watching this film, I lumped it in with movies I call ""message movies"": movies that make it a point to shove whatever message it brings down our throats. I decided to give it a chance and I was surprised at how much I liked this film. It certainly helps that it's also a comedy. I have some small issues with the film and I did feel it could do a lot better, but it didn't prevent me from laughing and crying throughout the movie. What I liked the most about this movie is that it's not like those other ""message movies"". There are times when it does get a bit melodramatic and times when the humor comes off as forced. But when the movie is funny, it's really funny and it's easy to root for the titular 3 idiots. It doesn't play like an infomercial on the education system; it plays off like an experience, as a good movie should.<br/><br/>I like to think the movie is a lot like its main character: fun, good-natured and, as Rancho would say, never leaves its students behind. All in all, it is a tad bit overrated, but it's a charming movie with a relevant message. People who don't like how the message was presented should just realize that it was presented so that the masses can relate and, in turn, get something from it.<br/><br/>All is well. All is well. 8/10"

","3 Idiots are the three roommates. The Story revolves around them, their college life, Happiness and sadness, Loses etc.. One of the Idiot is actually a Genius, And he was not able to adjust with formal and usual education system rather he prefer to learn from around the world.<br/><br/>The Movie slaps our Education system, this movie raises many questions which are reasonable. The Movie is a look back to our own College life. You will feel that you want to be in the college again, one more time or else you wish, at least the movie should have released when you were in College. You will enjoy with the 3 Idiots, cry with them and and will laugh with them. You will enjoy every moment of the movie. Its a blessing to have friends like that and a look back to our own Happy Days. The film starts from 'Good' and Ends at 'Superb'. Rajkumar Hirani, yes he did it again. and This is a Movie every Student and parents should see before going to a School.<br/><br/>Aamir Khan is out there and shines bright. Yet again, he had come up with very impressive performance and the film shows his Dedication. Madhavan - Very Convincing and have good Screen space where he did well with his natural Comic One Liner so as Sharmaan Joshi. Kareena Kapoor is beautiful and very good in a Girl with small brain.<br/><br/>Negatives: Yes the movies has many, though not as many as pluses. The Delivery scene was too much to accept and adjust. - Only unwanted scene in the movie. And in Direction / Screenplay point of view, This time Director had compromised a lot more than he does for Munnabhai Series. Comedy is very enjoyable but looses reality in few scenes and the Most laughable scene (Chatur's Hindi Speech) is more like a Comic and little lengthy. And Have you ever heard or seen a Dean of the College coming in a Cycle?@, that too 'A College which ranks the Highest for Higher Studies' as mentioned in the movie.<br/><br/>At the End - the Movie is very Entertaining and can be rated as the most enjoyable Hindi movie of the Decade or 2 Decades or can increase few more."
"sprska","4","4","15","1 February 2010"," Just entertaining - nothing special
","I did not have high hopes for the movie in the first place given the way in which Amir Khan's last movie Ghazini (another over hyped movie) disappointed to the extent of giving a headache with unnecessary violence and loud sound effects (not to mention the copied storyline). 3 idiots disappointed too...! It has all the ingredients of an entertaining cinema, however it just goes overboard with so many clichés that by the time you are 30 minutes into the movie, you can predict the next turn of events that will happen. Heck! you could even predict the jokes! The most annoying parts were the supposedly funny moments - something which you have seen hundreds of time previously. Many of them seems to have been taken from email forwards that we regularly receive (remember the scene with mixing the examination papers, then pencil-pen astronaut scene, etc etc). Talk of originality .. !(the Five point someone controversy) The movie goes to extremes with emotions - why can't the story be slightly subtle? Everything had to be so loud, including the funny scenes - we are not in the Johnny-Lever/Govinda era anymore. Remember Khosla ka Ghosla anyone - that is funny and original.<br/><br/>""All izz Well"" seems just an extension of ""Jadu ki Jhappi"" - no originality here as well..! Hirani must have thought if something worked so well earlier why not reuse it. Boman Irani disappoints too with a very a very annoying accent which I suppose the filmmakers thought it would add to the film's humor. Why couldn't we have some ""fresh"" face - choice of Boman as the professor was obvious.<br/><br/>Only good and refreshing was Omi's role as Chatur's - he did really well. Amir did pass off doing a 20 something college student - however his antics to play an overtly honest guy was really overdone in most parts.<br/><br/>Just an overall average movie - how it managed to do such business, I will never understand ! May be the hype helped. Again."

If you haven't watched this movie yet and you are planning to do so I recommend you not to. It's absolutely a waste of time,trust me.Before I watched this movie I thought Hindi films are silly and not entertaining but when I saw 3 idiots is on the top rated 250 list i thought that maybe I was wrong.

","Well, three idiots is adopted from ""5 point someone"" novel by Chetan Bhagat and has been shot in IIM B'lore campus. I must admit that Mr. Hirani has come up with another good venture after Munna Bhai and its sequel.<br/><br/>3 idiots illustrates the experiences of college life of 3 engineering friends. Unlike usual college comedies, this movie presents a fresh perspective with a message. Pre-interval part is totally hilarious and I can bet the comedy would roll you all in your seats. Just like MunnaBhai(s), Mr. Hirani has sought to bring forward a message through this movie. Therefore, though some instances post interval might appear out of line (must say a bit un-realistic) but viewers would like the overall movie.<br/><br/>Aamir, as one of the protagonist, has been phenomenal in this movie as a college going student. Sharman, Madhvan and Boman Irani have also made very good contributions in the movie. Kareena looks good but her role is limited. Direction is good and the movie is set in the backdrop of Delhi.<br/><br/>Its certainly worth one time watch.<br/><br/>Hope you all enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Regards, MaDdyMacD"

","This is a great movie. There is no way it deserves a rating below 8.5. Aamir Khan is superb as usual and all other performances are great as well. The movie is quite refreshing and the only negative is that it seems a little stretched during the middle period, but only slightly so. The songs, especially all izz well are quite entertaining. The movie has no violence and the plot is quite realistic. The atmosphere of the engineering college in the movie is not very far from most engineering colleges in India. Aamir and Madhavan do not look out of place amongst young college students, so hats off to them. All in all, it's a great watch. I would recommend it to anyone who'd want to see a light comedy movie."
"anuranjan-kgp","6","2","6","18 July 2010"," Stupid entertainment movie
","With Rajkumar Hirani's third movie he made a hatrick of successful bolywood blockbuster movies and this time with his fresh script he broke all the records in the history of Indian cinema in the term of business. Movie revolves around Ranchordas(Amir Khan) and his two friends Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi).Ranchordas(Amir Khan)as a Engineering Student denied to bound by traditional teaching practices and tried to convey,teaching is at it's best when it is served with simplicity and fun. Boman Irani as Professor Viru Sahastrabudhhe (ViruS) was the only piece in the movie who achieved it's purpose and he was so factual that he could make you, to thank God, to not to cast you in his class-room. Film editor has made a wonderful job to montage all sequences in a self-explainory manner and it was non other but Rajkumar only. Like Amir Khan's other movies he looked here stiffed too, he has failed make any appeal to audience but still his quick clear with perfectly synchronized mover made this movies alive and he had perfect timing for humor punches too. Cinematography is not the thing for director as observed from ""munna bhai MBBS"" and ""Lage raho munna bhai"" but his movies are justified as soon as these are kept in commercial cinema. All I personally liked in this movie was it's script which is soul of the movie but when conspiracy evolved from the all time best seller writer Chetan Bhagat for the story plot nothing was left in the movie. When you personally read his famous book Five Point someone you will also have the sympathy for him. Overall for a film critic there is nothing wonderful to write about but still is a enjoyable movie and in the country like India where dream sells, commercial movie flies"
"the_weirdo","7","2","6","7 January 2010"," Genius Idiots
","As I was approaching the end of the movie, I wished I had a scissor to clip off the last 45 minutes or so from the reel, so that I could leave the movie with a positive note. I fail to understand why would the film maker after delivering successfully the definitive message of ""Follow your heart, not the crowd"", try to show some impractical happenstance of 'vacuum-cleaner delivering a baby' or 'fresh-born-baby responding to Aal-is-well zingle' or 'a runaway bride'. Is it just to cater to the Indian audiences who could only settle for their heroes nothing less than supermen and always believe that miracles do happen in ordinary circumstances? This attitude of ours of seeing geniuses in our heroes had earlier given us before heroes who can sing like Kishore Kumar, fight like Dara Singh and dance like Michael Jackson simultaneously. Now our sensible directors settle only for heroes who can make a model of helicopter, top the class without studying, woo the professor's beautiful daughter, and .....hold your breathe....deliver a baby on a pool table.<br/><br/>I don't agree that the movie has ridiculed that much the professors or the educational system. Quite obviously, all that were shown, were clearly for fun. In my engineering career I had never seen a single professor emphasizing in the lectures more on 'bookish definition' than 'understanding'. I don't also believe that a single professor of mechanical engineering would encourage his student to score high grades so that he could get job in an IT firm.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I must admit that the director Mr Rajkumar Hirani knows how to move his audiences. With his theme of ""Niceties above rest"", he has always given movies that we can cherish and sometimes show to others to justify our actions (I doubt anyone would actually change his way after seeing any movie). One thing I have noticed that Aamir Khan is always good at these preachy-roles where he is smarter than the rest of the folks on screen and delivers his explanations of your-way-is-wrong-and-my-way-is-divine. Don't get me wrong. He is still my favourite actor and in this movie he has done really well to pass for 20 year old engineering genius. Honestly I have not seen a single movie where Boman Irani has done even an average job. He is excellent as always. From the remaining cast my favourite would be the guy who has played the geek. Music was good especially the 'Behti Hawa sa tha woh' song.<br/><br/>I can understand why the Indian youth love this movie. It is the same reason for why people love Five Point Someone on which the movie is based. The 'I- can -so- relate- to- the- story- and- when- I-watched- it-I- relived-my- college -days' argument. I won't rate the movie Highly though I would consider it as a good one-time-watch.<br/><br/>(Originally posted @ weirdo-on-movies.blogspot.com)"

","First of all HATS off to Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Raju Hirani for creating this magic.Bollywood has a history of making films which are not so close to reality and neither they are full of fantasy.but this flick has created a magic though its the same. Rancho is there between us, in fact inside us,just we have to find him. Coming back to the history of Bollywood, one can only say the names of classical hits like Mughal-e-azam,and flicks like Tare Zameen Par,Rang De Basanti and Chak De-India to feel extremely proud(this can be a bit too harsh) and here comes these 3-Idiots with their not so Idiotic rules and principles which can cause a rush of ADRENALINE in your body and tears in your EYES and you love it. This film also present the fact that we Indians seldomly select the education and profession which we like, we have to fulfill the dreams of others,we are all proud of this but still one can only imagine what we could have done if we would have done what we wanted to and this movie made that imagination true.Mr.Phunsukh Wangdu You stick to your seats till Intermission and gets stuck to it after that. When the end of the movie comes you simply will feel that why it has to end,why can't it continue. Acting- No-one could have replaced anyone in this movie.Kareena was the best selection made by Raju Hirani and a lot of things has been said for AMIR KHAN,so i don't have words to describe,just like KAREENA said in her interview, ""You have to work with AMIR KHAN to be a complete Actor"". So, go to theaters especially with your parents to make them feel proud of their children and say AAAALLL ISSS WELLLLL"
"rahulbaskaran","7","2","6","29 December 2009"," A satisfactory meal, but not the best...
","The movie starts of well with excellent wit and moves along a pretty good pace that sets up the rest of the movie. 3 Idiots is all about 3 friends – Rancho, Raju and Farhan (Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi and R Madhavan respectively) who have been accepted into a prestigious institute and set about to pursue their dreams.<br/><br/>The three lead actors share excellent chemistry, along with the authoritarian principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani) and the ever competing bookworm Chatur Ramalingam (portrayed by Omi Vaidya) in an excellent role that gives life to the movie. The humor is pretty good in the movie. And the way the director has managed to intertwine both comedy and sentiments subtly is applaudable.<br/><br/>Going to the negative aspects, I felt that some of the humor has been taken up shrewdly from the internet, the scenes which include Rancho pawning the campus director after his speech about his acclaimed astronaut pen, and then there's the scene where Rancho mixes up their exam papers among the pile of papers of other students. These jokes have been doing rounds on the internet for years now.<br/><br/>Then there's the need to insert a love story into the movie in the most conventional way possible. The usual bollywood type love story, the girl (Pia played by Kareena Kapoor) doesn't like the guy at first. And then the hero manages to weave magic (Chamatkaar or Balatkaar, choose for yourself) around her which leaves her intoxicated enough to fall for our irresistible Rancho.<br/><br/>Hirani also manages to push the limits a li'l far with some scenes, there is a scene wherein Rancho tries to extract a baby using a vacuum cleaner which he manages to assemble all and well within a few mins when our woman is in deep pain (literally), and then there is the succeeding scene where the baby isn't breathing. However, it comes to life when everyone starts chanting the tagline 'Aal izz well' (really???) The rest of the movie is well done which still makes it a full paisa vasool movie despite the flaws. Well written and most importantly surpassed by better acting by the actors who make up the movie. It would have been awesome if the the writer had managed to come up with some more original ideas. But still 3 idiots is one of the better Hindi cinemas this year. This is definitely not Hirani's best work, but one of the better one's indeed!!! There will always be talk about how movies aren't supposed to be taken too seriously, which is absolutely true. But in the end, its the feeling that you walk out with, that will define your contentment. If you read this review, you will find most of it is filled with negative aspects. The reason being, the rest of the movie is truly excellent, laced with sentiment and humor, which is a definite watch. Watch it!!"

Agreed some of the humor was a bit corny but still it keeps you glued to the screen until the end. Amir Khan was a class apart. Almost each of his scenes had some message in it, in a straightforward or comical way. Madhavan & Sharman were the perfect supporting casts. Boman Irani made up a truly memorable performance & Omi Vaidya was hilariously & annoyingly brilliant as Chatur. Kareena Kapoor too did good.

If you are not from India and want to see a Indian movie it should be at top on your priority list.The only thing you may not like is 2/3 songs embedded in it (except ""Give me some sunshine"").Watch it and it will be definitely in your top 25 movies list (at least ) whether you are from India or any other Country."

","3 Idiots is a story of 3 students starring Amir Khan as Rancho, Sharman Joshhi as Raju Rastogi & R. Madhavan as Farhan Qureshi. This movie actually depicts the today's actual condition of studies being taught in Colleges. The best part is being played by Amir Khan who actually believed in skilled learning rather than bookish language. And to prove this he make some changes in the speech of the Chatur and showed that learning like a parrot will not help unless u study and do what ur interest is. I just like the movie very much. Another scene where these three goes to Farhan's home to have dinner and his mother uses that itching 'belan' to roll the chapatis. Yuck!!! Overall the movie was awesome and its one song which I think is composed for every college student- Saari Umra Hum, Mar Mar ke jee liye, Ek pal to ab hume, jine do, jine dooo..."

You go through a roller coaster ride of happiness, sorrow, anger, empathy all spread out throughout the movie and I must say it is one hell of a ride! It is true that some portions of the movie are exaggerated than they need to be, but at the same time you are laughing your ass off that you simply overlook them. It is not a dumb college comedy that you expect from the title, it touches upon many sensitive subjects in the veil of comedy.And the best part is, it is never old and even after watching it multiple times, it still feels fresh and revitalizing.If you are a comedy lover like me, I would recommend it and if you are not, I would still recommend it because it is more than just a comedy."

We see variations of the same jokes and gags we've seen over and over again in other movies. This only makes the story predictable and the 2h50min running time seem even longer than it actually is.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend it unless you are a big fan of light comedy and far-fetched drama."

"manojeetsarkar","10","2","7","8 January 2010"," Beware:That Thing Can Change Your Way Of Thinking.
","It's absolutely true. When I first sat to watch the movie I knew I was going to be thoroughly enjoyed. There was a, very high level of expectation. And is absolutely natural though. Why? The answer is very simple. There is a name associated with the movie. ------------------------------AMIR KHAN--------------------------------- Being a avid movie goer I am fan of a whole lot of actors. But whether you have a favourite actor or not,you got to love this man. Specially to those who regularly follows Hindi movies I mean Bollywood movies. He always stands out in every aspects in which he steps into.However the character of RANCHO is his one of the best creation ever.<br/><br/>I saw a huge lot of films - Hindi,Tamil,Bengali,Telegu,French,Korean,Chinese,Japanese,Turkish and mostly English. But, nothing ever prompt me or rather touches me so deeply as this to right a review on IMDb.The most precious part of the movie is it's acting crew. It is simply heart taking & heart breaking during the sad part as well. I am not getting into any particular actor's work but the main 3 leads are invincible so as to say in one word. Some may think that Amir is looking confused and over elaborative in some part of the movie but I think it's the need of the character to make it believable, not like another contemporary Hero who is king of his college and can't be disposed of. The direction of the film is very different from other Rajkumar Hirani's other film and mature too,of course.The music is simply awesome:melodious, sweet and is absolutely fitting with the movie. The movie is not great for all the above of these. It's only because the message for the contemporary and outdated educational system & the so-called social patterns in which the poor and lower middle class families are still running on the hope of their son's burdened shoulders and unblossomed futures. The things are so purely shown that you can't deny it. And that's the best part::Acceptance to the audience. So,if you are still reading this then don't just go and watch the movie otherwise you won't know what you are going to miss. As I said earlier It can change your thoughts about your life and future."
"sdgreat","8","2","7","3 January 2010"," Chase excellence, and success will follow, pants down
","That's a line that's repeated a few times in 3 idiots, which I think says a lot about the film. Although a lot of films that hit big at the box office are lackluster and forgettable, 3 Idiots is actually a perfect example of the line it repeats several times. Those involved in the film have certainly chased excellence- they've made a great movie that entertains with humor and emotion, all while teaching some valuable lessons to students, their parents, and their teachers.<br/><br/>If you don't know already, 3 Idiots tells the story of 3 friends in college.Two of them are mediocre students, who's lives are changed when they meet Rancho, an eccentric, but brilliant student with an unorthodox way of learning and leading his life. The story is told in a flashback as Raju, Farhan, and their college nemesis Chatur (nicknamed Silencer) journey to find Rancho, who has been missing for the past 10 years.<br/><br/>I'll start off with the most appealing aspect of the film. It is hilarious! I watch both Bollywood and Hollywood films, and I can't remember the last time I saw a film from either that made me laugh this hard. I saw the film 2 days ago, and I'm still laughing just thinking about some of the scenes. And this is everything from the jokes, the comedic scenes, to the really funny and cool characters. But what's even better, is that rather than giving us yet another forgettable comedy, Rajkumar Hirani has managed to find an almost perfect balance between the comedy and the emotion, much like he did in the Munnabhai films. Similar to those, Hirani has put in some strong messages into the film. One, as I've mentioned, is the importance of pursuing excellence, rather than success. Another is the simple, ""all izz well,"" idea-- that you should try and keep calm, rather than worry all the time. As a college student, I could relate a lot to both of those. But that's not all-- The film also provides a good lesson to parents, that you should let your children decide for themselves about a career, rather than force them into one. Further still, it shows us the problems with the typical methods of learning-- the mindless memorization of facts-- which is much less important than learning to apply concepts. <br/><br/>Next, let's talk about the characters. Right from the time I heard Aamir Khan and Madhavan were signed on for this movie, I've been hearing complaints that they were too old. I won't lie- neither of them look like they can pass for a 20 year old, but once I saw them on screen, I stopped worrying. Both give such wonderful and natural performances that I didn't even think about ages. This is especially true for Aamir, who just seemed like he was having so much fun with the role of Rancho that I just couldn't help but love him. Sharman Joshi also did a nice job with his role, especially in some of his more emotional scenes. Kareena's role was a bit small, but she still makes her mark. I really liked her character, and wished she had been in the film a bit more. <br/><br/>The film of course, isn't perfect. There were definitely a few moments that I thought were overly dramatic, and one even a bit tacky. Also, the love story, although it wasn't meant to be the focus, was a bit under developed. Overall, though, the film is really heart warming and inspiring enough for me to overlook the flaws.<br/><br/>I'd happily recommend this to anyone who wants to see a great comedy that both entertains and teaches. Looking at other comments on the IMDb boards and stuff, I'm reading a lot of complaints about how the film is unrealistic, characters are exaggerated, etc. Here's what I say to you folks- if you expected some kind of masterful art film, you came looking in the wrong place. This is a feel good commercial film through and through. So yes, Rancho comes off as unrealistically perfect, and the headmaster is a caricature. If this kind of stuff tends to bother you, I'd stay away from this film. BUT, if you're looking for a commercial, unrealistic yet relatable feel-good entertainer with some nice messages, I highly recommend 3 Idiots to you."
"bobbysing","Null","2","7","26 December 2009"," Hirani and Aamir once again prove as the two most precious assets of Bollywood.
","In few words, ""3 Idiots"" fulfills every promise it made and entertains the viewer completely with its engrossing and enlightening content based upon some real life happenings. Loosely inspired from Chetan Bhagat's novel, ""Five Point Someone"", it starts with a phone call to Madhavan, about their lost friend and then keeps shifting between the present & the past, majorly talking about the days they all spent together in the college.<br/><br/>The first half is full of highly enjoyable moments which have a distinctive Hirani flavor and are sure going to be liked by everyone of any age or gender. The pants dropping humor may be a bit weird for some but the youngsters would not mind it at all for a change. The entertaining first half ends on a mystery note, which straight away gets solved post intermission and then the story moves on towards the search of the third lost idiot,Aamir. Though the second half has got some dragging moments in the mid but overall, it makes a good impact on the viewer with a masterstroke used towards the climax having a pleasant surprise twist.<br/><br/>Director Rajkumar Hirani brilliantly writes all his scenes along with the talented Abhijat Joshi and the experienced Vidhu Vinod Chopra. The ease with which he showcases serious issues like Suicides by Students, Ragging in Colleges, Faulty Education System based on memorization and the unnecessary competition creating tension is simply commendable. He humbly goes on to remind you that Are you doing the job you always wished for? <br/><br/>To be straight, ""3 Idiots"" is a director's movie completely. Though it has been more publicized and awaited as an Aamir Khan project, but significant contribution coming from every big and small character in ""3 Idiots"", simply restrains anybody from calling it an Aamir Khan movie alone. Having said that, I would also like to add that with ""3 Idiots"" Aamir once again proves his unmatchable understanding of the medium and willingness to work better with a team spirit. He consistently delivers another flawless performance of his shining career under the expert direction of Raj Kumar Hirani.<br/><br/>After Aamir, the next best act comes from Sharman Joshi who very convincingly portrays a complex character of a student caught in a dilemma. It's unarguably the toughest role and Sharman's the best performance of his career till date. The third idiot, Madhavan equally impresses in the role of an engineering student, wishing to become a wild life photographer from heart. Madhavan, never makes you feel his huge star status in the south and impressively plays his part with a quite conviction. Boman Irani is superb as earlier seen in the similar role a University professor and looks great in his messy get up in the movie.<br/><br/>Kareena Kapoor hasn't got a big role in the script, but she still manages to catch your attention through her new look with the glasses. Mona Singh is cool in her few scenes but Javed Jaffery is wasted in a two scene role. The actor playing the studious friend of the 3 Idiots is first rate and Parikshit Sahni thankfully is there with a controlled act. Cinematography is worth mentioning especially in the scenes where the three friends meet at the top of a high rise structure, the beautiful roads in the mountains and the climax scene of Ladakh. Shantanu Moitra's music is not worth buying as an album, but it impresses and leaves a mark after you have watched the movie in the theater.<br/><br/>Summing up, there is no doubt that ""3 Idiots"" is one of the finest movies of 2009 and will be a great success at the box office, but at the same time I would like to share a few points I have in mind about the movie : <br/><br/>Firstly, the basic format of the movie remains very close to Hirani's debut venture ""Munnabhai MBBS"". It has many similar (not identical) scenes of college classrooms, lectures and exams (though the subjects are different). The interaction between Boman and Aamir is on the similar lines of Boman and Sanjay Dutt. There is also a Hospital Sequence of Sharman getting paralyzed and Aamir curing him with his miraculous ways (quite identical to Carrom Board Sequence in Munna Bhai). And lastly as there was ""Jaadoo Ki Jhappi"" in Munna Bhai and ""Gandhigiri"" in ""Lage Raho"", similarly here we have a new phrase ""All Izz Well"" used in 3 Idiots to woo the audiences. So I somewhere felt the basic framework of the movie written around the same commercial elements used in Munna Bhai.<br/><br/>Secondly the pregnancy sequence of Mona Singh, where Aamir has to perform as a doctor on the online guidance of Kareena, was a kind of deliberate, filmy and quite far from reality.<br/><br/>And thirdly, I couldn't appreciate the way, Hirani hilariously treated the poor family of Sharman Joshi and the character of his paralyzed father. He mercilessly used the poor character as a comedian and made the audience laugh at his helpless situation which I didn't find very amusing. This particular part was not as per the standards set by Hirani himself through his earlier two masterpieces and was an avoidable patch on an otherwise brilliant and highly entertaining flick from the master craftsman.<br/><br/>Incidentally, as seen in his previous blockbusters, the master director continues to give you a glimpse of his western influences by using the animated scene of millions of sperms racing towards becoming a baby, which is highly inspired from Woody Allen's ""Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex"".<br/><br/>But despite of the above mentioned points, the talented trio, Rajkumar Hirani, Aamir Khan and Vidhu Vinod Chopra have a sure shot winner in their hands, which will be unanimously liked by all the section of the viewers together."

Simplicity is way of life and Indian culture highly stresses on simple living and high thinking, and this is the way of life: 'Legs down to earth and eyes looking beyond the sky' <br/><br/>9. Industrial Leadership Dean of the institute in 3 idiots is showing very typical leadership. He has his own principles, values and ideology, and he leads the whole institute accordingly. This is an example of current institutional leadership. In the present scenario, most of the institutes are fixed in a block or Squarish thinking. <br/><br/>10. Love Is Time & Space Free Love is not time bound and space bound. It is very well demonstrated this movie same love was demonstrated by Krishna and Meera. Love is border free, time free and space free. <br/><br/>11.Importance Of One Word In Communication If communication dies, everything dies. Each word has impact and value in communication. One word if used wrongly or emphasized wrongly or paused at a wrong place in communication what effect it creates and how is it affected is demonstrated very well in this movie. <br/><br/>12. Mediocrity Is Penalized Middle class family or average talent or average institute is going to suffer and has to pay maximum price in the life if they do not upgrade their living standards. To be born poor or as an average person is not a crime but to die as an average person with middle class talent is miserable and if you are unable to optimize your potentiality and die with unused potentiality then that is your shameful truth.

","Rest assured, all ye Desi cinema buffs, Aal Izz Well in apna Bollywood. If 2009 can begin with Dev D and end with 3 Idiots, it is indeed time to sound the seetis and taalis for one of the most exciting years of contemporary Indian cinema. Truly, this has been the year of the I.d.i.o.t in movie lore: the Intrinsically intelligent, Downright smart, Inimitable, Original and Talented film maker, actor, story teller, musician, lyricist, dialogue writer and producer.<br/><br/>3 Idiots is the perfect end to an exciting year for India: the year when the aam aadmi voted in progress, liberalism, secularism and turned his back to corruption, communal ism, regionalism. The three idiots, Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan), are perfect archetypes of the new age Indian who is essentially a non-conformist, questioning outmoded givens, choosing to live life on his own terms and chartering new roads that consciously skirt the rat race. Of course, they begin on the beaten track -- due to societal/parental pressure -- but refuse to become cogs in the wheel. Naturally, they end up as the Frostian hero (Robert Frost's Road Not Taken) who made all the difference to his life, and the world, by taking the road less traveled by.<br/><br/>The film begins with the entry of our threesome in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high-pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference.<br/><br/>So, you have the threesome embroiled, time and again, in a confrontation with authority, as represented through the domineering figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), the unsmiling Principal who venerates the cuckoo because the bird's life begins with murder. Kill the competition, because there is only one place at the top, believes the Princi. Poor, mistaken Princi! Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duh in real life and non-conformists (Rancho and Rocket Singh Inc), who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills.<br/><br/>The high point of the film is the fact that director Rajkumar Hirani says so much, and more, without losing his sense of humor and the sheer lightness of being. The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas. Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's chamatkar/balatkar speech, the threesome's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself. Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic 'humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track.<br/><br/>Amongst the performances, Aamir Khan is stupendous as the rule-breaker Rancho. But the rest of the cast doesn't remain in the shadows. Both Sharman and Madhavan manage to carve their independent characters as lovable rebels too. Even Kareena shines out, despite the minuscule length of her role. A special mention for Boman Irani who is impeccable as 'Virus', the vile Principal and newcomer Omi who perfectly slips into the stereotype of the best, albeit bakwas student. Shantanu Moitra's music score, which may have sounded pheeka in the audio version, comes alive on screen with lyricist Swanand Kirkire giving India its clarion call for 2010: Aal Izz Well. Rush for it.<br/><br/>Source : The Times of India!"
"seriouscritic","10","2","8","2 January 2010"," Superb movie
","I don't remember the last time I saw a movie and sad to myself - 'This has to be the best Hindi movie I ever saw' - that is exactly what I felt when I saw this movie. Good job by all involved. It was nice mix of comedy and emotions churned into an excellent entertainer with a nice message. Boman and Sharman were outstanding. Kareena and Mona Singh were adorable.. Aamir was superb.. Go and watch this movie.. you will not be disappointed. One word of caution though.. if you have small kids.. you may want to leave them at home.. there are some crude scenes too.. which maybe thoroughly enjoyable for grown-ups but you may not want your kids to see it."
"sibsankar91","4","3","15","2 May 2014"," Totally artificial- a piece of cheap propaganda.
","Personally I was totally shocked by the stupidity of this work, for I had heard so many people praising it like anything.It has been made with a social agenda which is very much genuine and praiseworthy. But nothing goes correct in the representation. They have picked up some stars and gone for more glamor than realism. They have made a perfect hero and a perfect villain which itself a trait of poor film-making. A really good film should not tell clearly ""hey this is the 'good guy' and look that one is the 'bad guy'"". It should be able to see some good in the 'bad guy' and also some bad in the 'good guy'. Real life does never have perfect heroes and perfect villains, all people are imperfect. This film has has stooped to that cheap superficiality of a crowd-puller. From the beginning till the end they have gone with a motive, there has been no spontaneity. Only redeeming feature has been probably the pleasing musicals. My rating : 4/10 - rotten"
"sharit_sinha","10","2","9","4 January 2010"," Only stupids will not like ""3 Idiots"".....
","Don't know where to start or rather who to start with! <br/><br/>It has been 3 years since we had the bombshell called ""Lage Raho Munnabhai"" from Rajkumar Hirani Factory and had been waiting for another movie which can exceed the previous two movie masterpieces. While we were still waiting for ""Munnabhai Chale Amerika"", Hirani dropped a nuclear bomb this time.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie is no less than a nuclear bomb, in every terms, every aspect of it. Its a simple story about 3 students who refused to give up their dreams against the conventional norms of contemporary Indian Educational System, where marks and the degree certificate are all that is used to judge a student, where individual and unconventional thoughts are not welcome and suppressed every day, every hour, every minute. <br/><br/>Its simple, if you do not go along the system, it will break you down to the point where you either lose your identity for the rest of your life....or just quit (read suicide).<br/><br/>Yes, this may seem over dramatic to people, but student who suicide after facing the immense pressure of traditional grading system, expectation are not just in fiction. I myself had a friend, who stood before the Rajdhani Express train one day, because his parents expected him to always achieve distinction marks in every exam, which he could never do and on failing every time, his parents lied to everybody they know saying that he achieved 80% in the exams. Imagine the guilt and inferiority complex inside the kid, who didn't try to move away from the tracks when a Superfast Train ran towards him to crush him over.<br/><br/>I am not trying to give away the story or post a spoiler, as almost every Indian College student has read Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat, which is the base of this movie. Yes, Rajkumar Hirani has modified the story except for some key incidents and inserted the moral messages wherever he could.<br/><br/>Result - the film has turned into a laugh-riot and tear-jerker at the same time. You will never feel over-melodramatic in a single scene of the movie, neither will you feel that some buffoonery is going on any of the comedy scenes. This is a movie which will keep poking you every single second with innocent heartfelt emotions and make you laugh, make you cry, make you clap, make you whistle.<br/><br/>Coming to the actors, let's not comment on Aamir Khan's capability. He is just brilliant as an Engineering Student who doesn't care about scoring in an exam, but loves acquiring knowledge whichever way he can. R. Madhavan is fantastic and excellent as the narrator of the movie and a friend everybody dreams of. Sherman Joshi rocks with his highly expressive acting as the hesitating student, who keeps stumbling trying to follow the road his other two friends have taken. Kareena is looking very pretty and natural as the unconventionally strong girl who knows how to stand up against the wrong. Boman Irani is funny and brilliant as he smoothly carries the role of a Einstein-lookalike strict College Director, one of whom we have in every colleges in India. Omi Vaidya is the surprise package, who enacts the Hindi-learning highly-competitive student who can make a Parrot ashamed with his ability to mug up.<br/><br/>Realizing how big the review is turning, I will sum up all the other small actor's work as ""Brilliant""! Hats off to Shantonu Moitra and Swanand Kirkire for meshing the songs in the story so beautifully, that we don't feel them as forced. And salute Rajkumar Hirani for giving us another highly commercial movie which has more dosage of social and moral messages than any of his previous films.<br/><br/>So basically, as far as I think, only stupids will not like this movie...and I am not a stupid, I am an Idiot. But that's just me. So go find out, whether you are an ""Idiot""! <br/><br/>The Idiots rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"polisovil","10","2","9","2 January 2010"," 3 IDIOTS is a fantastic film All izz well.!!
","Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots are really sensible. Like his previous Munnabhai series,his latest release 3Idiots starring Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi, R. Madhvan, Kareena Kapoor, Boman Irani and Mona Singh too strikes the chord with the word Go. After watching the movie everyone will have a new theory in their lives of Aal Izz Well.<br/><br/>The story begins with Farhan and Raju on a journey in the search of their friend Rancho (Aamir Khan) in the exclusive locales of Simla and Ladak. While their journey continues, the movie takes a flashback and unwinds the story of the three idiots of their college days- Ranchodas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhvan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi).<br/><br/>Rancho, Raju and Farhan are the students of the premier IIT College. Rancho is a different than rest of the students; he can't live the way others live. He is an overpowering thinker and also has the capability to change the people views. He leads his mates all the way through this irrational, high-pressure, rote-heavy and malicious education system and teaches them the way to overcome the stupid ideologies. And above all he tutors and guides them as to how to deal with the baddie of the college- the Dean himself, Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani).<br/><br/>On one hand, Rancho is a sensible thinker and on the other he is a true lover of the sweet girl Pia (Kareena Kapoor). But to make his life difficult and more complicated Pia is the daughter of Rancho's arch adversary Mr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe.<br/><br/>Above all the trio manages to handle their each problem and lead their lives happily as well as have fun to the core. The movie takes the viewer through a roller-coaster ride fill with loads of witty one liner and keeps tickling the bone as the film proceeds. The movie's classic humour gives no time to rest and one dies laughing; until one fine day when Rancho suddenly disappears from everyone's life. Post interval the movie exposes the emotional side of the story. The disappearing act of Rancho leaves people flabbergasted as the person who changed the people's ideology for life and thought them reasoning was lost.<br/><br/>Rajkumar Hirani really deserves a standing ovation for the film. Like his previous films this movie to carries the message- A message as to how a student is pressurised and burdened under the parent's expectations to make it big in this world; and one who fails as well as is unable to bear this laden commits suicide. The movie is for all ages and makes everyone think.<br/><br/>The script by Hirani and Joshi is perfect. Muraleedharan C.K's cinematography is excellent. The dialogues are humours and hard-hitting. Shantanu Moitra's music is average. The lyrics are catchy yet sensible.<br/><br/>The actors are just impeccable and everyone delivers their best. Aamir Khan is rocking and this is his one of the finest work till date. Sharman Joshi and R. Madhvan are immaculate and unstoppable. Boman Irani is like other films totally flawless and Kareena Kapoor is superb.<br/><br/>All in all, a must watch flick and one of the finest movies of the year. Go grab it!!! But the real hero of Three Idiots is the guy who gave us jaadu ki jhappi and Gandhigiri. Raju Hirani, you are the man! After all the terrible films and flops this year, you have ensured that in the end, Aall Izz Well."

But the other two guys steal the show with their less but solid, emotional presence.<br/><br/>Being a software engineer, i would like to tell you that the movie resembles with every Engineer of Indian colleges. <br/><br/>Hostel life,masti with friends, exam tensions, every aspect of the students have been touched in the movie.Aamir , sharman, madhavan are Mechanical engineering student, you will laugh till your tummy aches in some scenes.<br/><br/>In the end me,Pushkar says ""A fantastic Movie""."

Viru years to accept this simple truth. Movie clearly shows how mechanical and bookish current generation professors are even in top technical college of India called IIT.

After all strip tease and spicy jokes, i'm sure every student and there parents have secretly taken a message from it. Every father wants his son to be top paid engineer. Under this intense emotional pressure from parents, students commits suicide when they failed to get good grades because they are not made to be an engineer.<br/><br/>Once audience settles down from choking laughters, they are silently told college is not about pleasing your professors and getting good grades. One should really focus on earning knowledge. Even last grade person managed to get job.<br/><br/>MBAs might not be happy to see this. When you spend every breath of your teen life to become an engineer and love technology and suddenly you do MBA and start working in bank. Whats the point?

","3 idiots is truly the ""Dil chahta hai"" of the year. Rajkumar Hirani once again leaves the audience spellbound with his amazing screen play and direction.The movie is a first class entertainer. Films like these are sure to be appreciated over the years to come. The first half of the movie is really good and Boman's performance is exceptional. The second half is good,but slightly drags in some scenes but it doesn't hurt the film much. 3 idiots is not only an exceptional film, it is arguably the film of the year. Hirani once again proves his caliber in handling serious matters in a funny way.the film tackles the minus points of the Indian educational system.the movie delivers a strong message and it tries to avoid melodramatic scenes as far as possible, which was the minor and only drawback of the ""Munna bhai"" series.I can't recommend the movie enough.Frankly, it is one of the movies which is worth watching with your family.Three cheers for Aamir,Boman and Hirani. Rating- 8.5/10"
"Marco_AGJ","7","1","3","14 July 2017"," Some cringy moments here and there, but overall quite bold in its message
","Those Indians seem to be up for the challenge of putting out movies that Hollywood wouldn't really venture into. I hate art-sy movies that depend their own existence on some hidden fundamental meaning of how human existence is badly guided and the directors (artists know nothing about sociology, as much as they want to think otherwise) simply hand out the answers in a silver plate.<br/><br/>The main character seems like the run-of-the-mill politically correct guy that thinks ""being yourself"" is one of the best pieces of advice you could ever grant someone with. As the movie flows his complete lack of respect for authority gets more coherent with what he preaches. <br/><br/>Basically you have a few students that are graduating in engineering while having to cope with an extremely perfectionist professor. While the protagonist believes that the imagination of the students is as much an education problem as studying hours upon hours immersed in technical books. Their world views collide when Poncho, the main guy, falls in love with the professor's daughter. <br/><br/>This is a funny movie while maintaining a strong message of not having to choose a high-pay job to be successful. Contradictions are bound to arrive, like family problems and old ways that always seem to die hard.<br/><br/>Just forget that the film is desperately trying to output some kind of universal happiness through doing whatever you feel like doing in your life, getting ever closer to a modern day fairy-tale than the cheesy foreign comedy."

","I guess I might be only one around here saying bad things about this movie. It's not like the movie is awful, but the its another Bollywood movie where protagonist is really really nice and talented guy and almost everybody else is his subordinate. Good masala, pinch of comedy and memorable characters makes this movie very popular but it bugs me why it is ""3 IDIOTS"" when only one idiot has all the attention. <br/><br/>When the movie was released, I was expecting what was there in the book. A story about engineering life, how things get out of control throughout 4 years. This movie ruins book and it's essence. <br/><br/>The movie talks about and engineering and somehow story turns to a cruel teacher and a rebellious student (I said a student not 3 students, because opinion and existence of other 2 is just there to fill up the space) . Somehow, our education system is culprit of suicides and creating trained monkeys. That topic was good too but they drop it in the middle of the movie and make it a love story. <br/><br/>I will give a plus to acting though, characters portrayed by Amir Khan and Sherman Joshi are fantastic. Even Boman Irani is great in the movie. <br/><br/>In the end, good guy wins and bad guy suffers humiliation we laugh , be happy and leave the theater amused. But I would suggest just think what you watched and is it really different from other movies you watched?"

","The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas. Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's speech, the three some's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself. Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic 'humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track. Aamir does it again. what a movie .from start to the end, hilarious moments.screenplay is fantastic. full on comedy and yet it never looses its heart. pulls off a 22 year old character with brilliance. never for once you feel you are watching. music looks OK"

It only has two scenes where they start singing and dancing so that was not too much. Why they start singing and dancing that I will never get. The story does not need that at all. The story itself was very pleasant to follow. Full of mixed emotions, happy ones and sad ones. The cast and the filming was great. All actors gave a good performance throughout the whole movie.

Even though it is on a serious topic; it makes its points in entertaining yet understandable ways. The story is also extremely relatable. <br/><br/>The story really helps to make these points. It tells of a simple man named Rancho (Aamir Khan) who comes and changes a college based on his thinking. I think the story was very well played out and that the story and ideas fit in very well together.<br/><br/>The performances were splendid. As always, Aamir Khan never fails to impress. He played Rancho to the finest of his abilities. He had everything- from perfect comic timing to perfect emotions for serious scenes. Sharman Joshi and Madhavan also impressed and did their roles well. Kareena Kapoor was exceptional in her role; she fit it well. Omi Vaidya really impressed me, even though he can't speak Hindi he was still hilarious. And Boman Irani gave perhaps one of his finest performances. The accent, the style, the lisp, he did everything well.<br/><br/>Rajkumar Hirani, the director, is one of the finest film makers ever in Hindi Cinema. He makes good, thoughtful films which aren't mindless and are worth your time, and this film is definitely worth your time. His direction was superb.<br/><br/>Overall, if you are looking for an entertaining, relatable, heartfelt, emotional, romantic, and serious film, watch 3 Idiots.

"narayanaswamykadiyala","10","1","3","13 January 2014"," good movie about 3 IDIOTS
","If anyone else had made '3 Idiots', there would have been an immediate outpouring of hosannahs, because the ability to wrap an engaging story around an important message is a forgotten skill in most Hindi cinema. But this is from Rajkumar Hirani who brought back joy and sparkle to the movies. Both his 'Munnabhai' films are superb entertainers that you can watch any and all the time: I would, if I could, put both on a continuous loop, and swoop in for a taste whenever I felt like a dose of upbeat.<br/><br/>'3 Idiots' does not do as much for me. The emotional truth that shone through both the 'Munnabhai' movies doesn't come through strongly enough: the artifice caused by a forty-something playing a twenty- something colours the film. Are there no capable twenty year olds in B town?<br/><br/>It's based, very loosely, on Chetan Bhagat's smash-hit 'Five Point Someone', which is about three friends who bond for life over shared blood, sweat and tears, in the way only those who go through professional colleges brimming with brutal deans and hellish exams, can. The kind of pressure-cooker college where kids who can't handle the heat leap out of high windows, or hang themselves from fans in their hostel rooms.<br/><br/>Ranchodas Shyamaldas Chanchad aka Rancho (Aamir Khan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureishi (R Madhavan) meet on a freshers' night when new arrivals are being introduced to the ways of an elite engineering college.<br/><br/>Undies are being yanked down when Rancho walks in, escapes to his room and devises a devilish way out of the humiliation about to be heaped upon him. From then on, Rancho becomes their lodestar, both as an official getter-into-trouble, as well as the guy who will get them out of it. And then one day, just like that, he's gone.<br/><br/>Rancho's old mates set off on a quest, accompanied by another batchmate (Omi), whose extreme competitiveness and slyness many will recognize from their time at tech institutes. This throwing of the switch, from a coming of age flick to a road movie, unsettles the rhythm, and leads to an overstretched half. This, or that, or both?<br/><br/>Somewhere along the way, almost like an after-thought, the ravishing Kareena Kapoor shows up, to execute a skilled-if-not-madly-novel song- and-dance number with Khan. And because she plays a doctor, she also gets to save lives. She's not a strong plot point, though, and you miss her effervescence when she's sent out to bide her time till her next scene.<br/><br/>Hirani has never been afraid of tears, abundantly on display in both his earlier tours. Here, every single character, including the stone-hearted dean Viru Sahastrabuddhe, or more aptly, Virus (Boman Irani, more cipher than character) is given a wet-eyed moment.<br/><br/>The result is a flood, literally, which leaves the second half awash. I happily cried along with Munna and Circuit; here, I caught myself waiting for the deluge to end. The laughter in some places is forced, as is the effort Khan puts into appearing half his age—in the widening of the eyes, the shuffling of the gait, the loose, wrinkly jeans.<br/><br/>Madhavan and Joshi come off better, especially the latter, who is absolutely first rate. But the one who really leaves a mark is the always-chasing-after-success Chatur, the southie nerd played by newcomer Omi.<br/><br/>The film is meant to be a trenchant attack on an educational system which creates robots, and ambitious parents who insist their child do something they do not want to, even if it means losing the child to despair and death. It makes the point, but not as magically as it could have, given Hirani's unique gift of building extraordinary moments out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>'3 Idiots' was good in parts, but it didn't blow me away."

","3 amazing actors, wonderfully scripted funny, emotional and entertaining storyline. Just watch it. Yes, I'm biased being Indian, but where some critics complain about this film, I find it realistic. This is what happens to Indian engineering colleges. Although suicides aren't that frequent but most people are under enormous burden to shine and shoulder the responsibilities of the family. The pressure is tremendous and the competition is very high. This film captures that, and the actors & film crew does the job very well, but most credit to the writers and musicians for the good songs. Like every film, views will vary among viewers but like almost all of top250 movie, this one has got a certain class. only drawback is the use of 40+ actors as engineering students.

"sheshank-joshi","10","1","3","14 April 2012"," Superb movie..not for those stupid people who doesn't respect your fellow people
","I watched this movie many times. But, only now I find it time to write a review not out of my willingness but after reading a hell lot of reviews blaming India and Creativity. <br/><br/>First of all creativity is not something originating out of your own brain. That's not the right way. Ideas are always the same, just like the sun rising in the East. Its up to you how to view the sunrise and take it. There doesn't need any creativity in finding new ways to cheat, kill, lie, crime, f**k or bad things. That's not creativity. That's, in fact, very much evil. If you want such creativity then you are not a man you are a devil or daemon.<br/><br/>That's what Rancho also speaks in the movie. Try to catch what Rancho speaks. He speaks about life, about philosophy, about aspirations and dreams. Creativity, in your sense as I just mentioned, is never helpful in making you a good and efficient man. It only pushes you more towards crime and evil. That's way too bad. A man doesn't need such creativity. Rancho speaks the same. We don't need something which is not productive. We need to follow our excellence, not success.<br/><br/>Real creativity lies in telling the same story again and again but with different new touch every time. Just like you experience and enjoy sun. We can't enjoy everyday, but love it whenever we experience. Nature doesn't change, but our perspective and mood change. Try to get into good mood by forgetting everything, bluffing your mind.that everything is alright and no need to worry. That's the success formula for Ranchod das Chanchad. I love his formula. Frame your own formula, but don't try to waste your intelligence and excellence for the sake of ""creativity"" which is unproductive neither to you nor to the society.<br/><br/>Education system is not in one person's hand. If any other country is as populated as India or China then they would experience the difficulties faced in Education system and Government. Try to express your sympathy at it, and try to help it - if possible. But, don't show your teeth at it or baffle it. That's the dignity of a homo sapein towards his race. If not, watch out for the day where they become dominate the world when the no of people matters not the amount of technology"

","Three Idiots is a prototype of the best Indian Comedies.

Look at his body language, a 44 Year Old man is portraying a teenage but it is Amir the maestro. <br/><br/>Madhvan is exquisite as Farhan with affliction of expectations of becoming an Engineer. Sharman Joshi is an innate humorist with his home shown in Black & White, her mother itching his father's chest with rolling-pin while rolling chapati, ""Absolutely Hilarious"". Kareena looks whimsical as a doctor and beloved of rancho, she does a good job. Omi Vaidya is just magical as Chatur and makes you laugh your ass off with his BALATKAAR speech. Boman Irani as VIRUS is fantastic as always.<br/><br/>Although it is based on Chetan Bhagat's ""Five Point Someone"" but the movie has its own implication and character set up. <br/><br/>This is a must watch movie and it is Raju Hirani who is giving thought to the people with his social communication. <br/><br/>This is a great piece of cinema to the Indian History."

No way. My gut feeling didn't go away. <br/><br/>I've never seen a Bollywood production before, and it will take me a while until I decide to see another one. I got the impression for what I read from other comments that Indian people reacted very favorably towards this movie, laughed at its humor and somebody even said that he had a good cry with some of the scenes... <br/><br/>Very probable, my total lack of knowledge of the language has a lot to do with my reaction while watching this movie, and it didn't help either the English spoken here and there interspersed with the Indian language, an English accented quite differently from the British or American accents my ear is accustomed to.<br/><br/>It's obvious that different cultures cultivate different approaches towards humor, drama or whatever. I found the ""humor"" broad, simplistic, old fashioned --terribly old fashioned-- and as direct as a third rate circus clown doing his number for the illiterate villagers.<br/><br/>I only watched a few minutes of the film because I found it unbearable, and only kept me in front of the screen the outstanding beauty of nature in that part of India.

","2009 wasn't a great year for Hindi cinema, with not many movies seeing commercial success and even fewer winning universal critical acclaim. Just as it is about to end, one movie makes up for the entire year. 3 Idiots was carrying the weight of huge expectations, and it is almost shocking to realise that those expectations can be surpassed by the product in front of you.<br/><br/>There are shades of Hirani's earlier movies (Munnabhai MBBS, Lage Raho Munnabhai) and even Taare Zameen Par in 3 Idiots, but that is not a bad thing at all. A movie like 3 Idiots often seems predictable, but predictable it is definitely not. Hirani's movies try to deliver strong social statements, and 3 Idiots is no exception, but in doing so, it never gets preachy. Just when the seriousness is about to border on being uncomfortable, they drop a joke that really works.<br/><br/>At the end of it all, the movie makes you want to tell everyone to watch it. It makes you feel good. It connects with you, tickles you, but at the same time, makes you think, without making you think too much. How Hirani does it, only he knows, but AAL IZ WELL!"

The acting is mediocre, the laughs are just ok, the obligatory dance sequences leave this American scratching his head. The length at almost 3 hours is way too long for a movie of this sort. And the hero, is well kind of a jerk not a loveable rebel (a quality I usually love to see). And there is way too much predictability in the plot.

"ajitmahadevan","Null","1","4","17 January 2010"," A very good movie - forget the hoopla...
","3 Idiots is India's biggest grosser of all time. I am sure that is an impossible tag to live up to. So let me relieve the stress by stating that this is not the greatest Hindi movie ever - it however is a very good movie. Raju Hirani shows again that some pretty serious issues can be delivered in the most rib-ticklingly funny way.<br/><br/>This movie has raised all kinds of fundamental questions - but at it heart it talks about all of us living our lives doing something we love rather than what is expected by society alone. It also talks about a failed education system where our best institutes do not churn out innovation. That is real and true. We as a country put too much emphasis on academics - rather than on learning. <br/><br/>Back to the movie - it has some of the best written characters I have seen in a while - Rancho, Virus, Silencer and Farhan... It also has some of the funniest scenes - the wedding gate crashers, the valedictory speech and of course the ragging scene at the start. All the raucous humour takes away from some the spectacular screenplay - as the friends undertake a roadtrip to find rancho.<br/><br/>Few inconsistencies - that these two chaps would wake up 5 odd years later to find out about their friend (as also his lady love)...but overall it is a memorable film. Will it remain a cult film like Dil Chahta Hai or Lagaan (or even Lage Raho Munnabhai) - one that stands the test of time - not sure."
"ballabijay","7","1","5","3 February 2013"," Climax ruins the movie...
","3 Idiots would have been great if the climax were little different. Rancho should have been working as a teacher in a small school (bcoz he doesn't have a degree in his name). And Chatur should've laughed at him. But Mr. Wangdu (different person) should've met Chatur and tells him how great the mind of Rancho is. Mr. Wangdu should've revealed that he worships Rancho's talent.. <br/><br/>The climax in the movie is not realistic at all. I know it's just a movie but still it should not insult the intelligence of people. <br/><br/>Let's compare it with Munna Bhai MBBS. If in Munna Bhai Sanjay Dutt had become a real doctor in the climax, the movie wouldn't have been that great. (I hope you got my point)<br/><br/>3 Idiots could've got a rating of 8. But the climax cost it 2 points, making its rating 6.."
"rounaque-saxena","7","1","5","7 June 2010"," Indian Tertiary Education Depicted Beautifully
","The actual scene of college education in India has now been exposed to the world. Pressures related to studies leading to wrong paths taken by people or suicides have been the major portion of the plot.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the entry of 3 young students to the ICE (best engineering institute of the country ). The starting scene of the movie clearly points out the topic that is competition is so tough in India that students , instead of improving themselves , only look to getting good grades and even mug up for 18 hours a day for the achievement. Finally , what the director conveys through the movie is that one who wants to study will study by any means and not look to better grades but improving himself and he will finally turn out to be the ultimate winner.<br/><br/>ACTING ---- Everybody is excellent, just the way the movie demanded. Aamir Khan , as always, weaves magic playing an 18 year old though he himself is 44. Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, and Kareena Kapoor complemented extremely well by playing their parts. Boman Irani does a typical Engineering Institute Director mastering every bit of his part. Omi Vaidya was excellent in his role especially his dialogue delivery. He is one new actor in Bollywood with some hopes in acting.<br/><br/>DIRECTION --- Good direction as what is expected by Raj Kumar Hirani but way too many flaws, the major flaws being : <br/><br/>Calling Mona Singh's character Poonam in the first half and Mona in the second half. Also, when you steal from someone's office , you do not use their land-line to call someone -- A major flaw.<br/><br/>Since it was a feel good movie, we can ignore scenes like the baby kicking when he listens to AAL IZZ WELL. On the whole , a good attempt on the topic , could have been better as what is expected by Aamir Khan. For me its a 7/10.<br/><br/>In the end, i would love to repeat an excellent quote from the movie : <br/><br/>"" Strive for Excellence and Success will follow """

","HERE IS MY REVIEW ON 3 IDIOTS. Hope you Like it <br/><br/>STORY: The story Is Simple. Not much borrowed From Five point someone. But the Modification Done is Exlempry. Really Rajkumar Hirani put a lot off effort in making a modification. And he Represented the story into such a way we really thought for a second that if STUDIES are only meant for the marks, BUT Most important He Made us see What the Best students Can do for you. I will rate the story 4.5/5<br/><br/>ACTING: Acting is one of the Strongest Criteria in 3 idiots. Lets start from the beginning. * <br/><br/>In 3 idiots Sharman Joshi is at its best. Watch out his expression when the Virus tells that he will be suspended if he did not tell him who is with him last night so that he can suspend them.<br/><br/>Madhavan does a decent job in playing as Farhan Quareshi.He is very very perfect at times, but sometimes got overboard as like in the scene when Virus spotted him in the wedding, he really did't know what to do at that time. <br/><br/>BOMAN IRANI in his one of his finest performance ever. It is Enough to tell him about his performance<br/><br/>Kareena Kapoor just plays himself. No special review for her<br/><br/>Supporting Characters are really Good but the special mention goes to Omi Vaidya. He tops the Performance table in 3 idiots. Should i Add something more?<br/><br/>AAMIR KHAN . H Really plays Rancho so perfectly we forgot Aamir khan is the 44 year superstar. But in some scenes he tries hard to be college boy. Like during the Song AAL IZZ WELL When he was Taking calculation of plane he sees up for 1 second like he was something revising. Thats the thing that a primary child do.<br/><br/>I will rate it 4/5<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY: Cinematography was really the best. You can see the The level of extent of cinematography During BEHKTI HAWA JAISE THA WOH song. rating it 4.0/5<br/><br/>SCREENPLAY DIRECTION: I have no words to express the screenplay and direction. Just rating it 9/10<br/><br/>SOME GOOFS: There are some Goofs that I would I like to share<br/><br/>*One goof written in IMDb that They traveled from Delhi to Manali continuously for 12 hrs with no night scene<br/><br/>*How many Colleges Have the direct Contact Between the Dean and students and especially in the No 1 college of India. By looking 3 idiots I started to feel that there is only one batch studying in the college<br/><br/>BIGGEST GOOF * When Farhan Quareshi Sees the Group Photograph of BATCH. he sees that Javed Jaffery was sitting right to the Boman Irani. Didin""t Boman Irani Have realized that The person sitting next to him was not rancho and that even so when ranch has got most popularity in the college. did""t Someone realized that he is not the person in his session and why he was sitting in the place of rancho. <br/><br/>VERDICT : MUST WATCH.

","3 Idiots is Rajkumar Hirani's latest offering after his previous socially-relevant Munnabhai series films. This time, he doesn't have Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi. So, this time we have Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi and R. Madhavan playing college students. The hype is tremendous. But what about the movie? Our heroes enter a top engineering college with shining eyes full of dreams, and hopes for a better future. Life gives them a reality check in the shape of Viru Sahastrabuddhe, their dominating principal who believes that life is a race, and that is the only way it has to be lived. Rancho, (Aamir Khan, looking surprisingly youthful, but still older than an engineering student) keeps motivating his friends to learn rather than mug the subjects. While most people refuse to take the path less traveled, Rancho continues to excel on this path, and even beat those who take the conventional track. The frequent run-ins with the Principal, what happens to the friends in college is what forms the crux of the story.<br/><br/>Loosely based on Five Point Someone, the story has been reworked and actually improved upon; but the screenplay loses some of the Raju Hirani charm. To make things understood in simple terms, he sometimes takes the help of measures that are not only over the top, but sometimes unbelievable. Why a principal would not rusticate a student after so many insubordinations and misdemeanors is beyond measure. The delivery scene looks incredulous as well. Some things can be termed cinematic liberties, but others leave you confused.<br/><br/>Raju Hirani the director is in top form again. His affection for socially-relevant comedies sees him unveiling a new phrase 'All eez well' to follow in the footsteps of 'Jaadu ki jhappi' and 'Gandhigiri'. In my opinion, 'Lage Raho Munnabhai' was his best effort to date, and even though he doesn't reach those peaks with Idiots, it is very good work indeed. He is the star of the show.<br/><br/>Aamir Khan as Rancho does extremely well, considering he is the most out of age in this movie. With constantly widened eyes and loose clothes, he gets into the skin of the tireless learner-cum-inventor. Though things he does look incredulous, he mostly makes them feel real. Sharman Joshi and Madhavan as his friends who are on the rote path only to be 'enlightened' by Khan are competent. Joshi is especially good in the principal's office scene. Kareena Kapoor is good in a brief, albeit important role. The real scene-stealer though, has to be Omi Vaidya. The actor steals the show as the stereotypical opposite of Rancho, Chatur. Note his expressions in the speech scene. Hilarious! Boman Irani as the principal is good, but the unnecessary lisp in his voice could have been avoided.<br/><br/>Shantanu Moitra's compositions are situational and complement the narration. Zoobi Doobi sticks out like a sore thumb though, and seems more like an item song. Jaane Nahi Denge Tujhe tides over a tough period in the story, while Behti Hawa serves as an excellent introduction. The background score serves its purpose.<br/><br/>Binod Pradhan's cinematography is commendable. I spent half an hour dissecting the introduction scene with a friend and we still could not figure out how it was done. The set design is good. The special effects, though minimal, are well executed.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: With 3 idiots, Raju Hirani stays in the Munnabhai franchise, albeit with different actors. The story has its heart in the right place, but the execution is far from perfect. Still, I'm going with 3.5 out of 5 for this look at the education system."
"pavan-tirupati","8","1","5","5 January 2010"," A good movie and a clever adaptation
","The whole nation is going gaga over 3 idiots..and heres my chance to do the same but in a more fair way. I would be totally honest with this review. Movie was very good. not excellent. if you are thinking whether to watch the film or not, I would say go watch it ASAP. but why did I say its not excellent? because I have read the book and I couldn't help but notice the scenes inspired from the book. The plot of the movie is different but many things have been restored from the book and that did not give me a fresh feeling about the movie. Also another point I would like to add is that movie was very very predictable. I was able to guess who Phun Suk is..I was able to guess what would happen with Joy and I was able to guess many other things which were supposedly twists in the story.<br/><br/>Music: well it sounds just above ordinary in my car but in the movie the songs blended very well and there was no boring moment during the songs.<br/><br/>Acting: Aamir was brilliant in most of the scenes, but in few scenes I felt he tried too hard to come out as a youngster. Madhavan and Sharman were equally good. Boman's character took some time to get accustomed to but he did a great job of convincing you with his accent and way of talking. Kareena did not have much to do in this movie but she did a decent job. The surprise package in the movie is Omi. His speech scene is going to be a landmark in 2009 for Hindi film industry.<br/><br/>Movie on the whole: Story is pretty good and decent changes made by Script writers after taking off from the book. Direction is also very good with certain aspects coming out really well like the black and white scenes and the way it starts with madhavan getting out of flight etc etc. movie has a good amount of comedy instilled in it which makes the movie enjoyable all along. I personally felt some parts were ridiculous like baby kicking after hearing certain words and Sharman's jump from 3rd floor etc etc. But on the whole Movie is a must watch because of its fresh subject, different story and approach, comedy and good performances by all the cast. I give it 8/10. go watch and enjoy."

","Castings : Rancho (Aamir Khan, The change agent), Raju (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan (Madhvan). Professor Virus. Imperial college of Engineering (ICE). New Delhi. Chatur.<br/><br/>Farhan always wanted to be wild life photographer. But his father had decided that his son will grow up to be an engineer. He was getting the lowest grades in ICE even when he studied hard. Rancho identified his talent and helped him become a wild life photographer. Rancho sent his photos to the famous photographer abroad. In the end of college, he was able to convince his father that his real love is photography and he will never be able to become a good engineer. His father relented and offered to buy him a professional camera.<br/><br/>Raju belonged to a very poor family. His father was suffering from paralysis and mother was a retired school teacher. He also had a elder sister who was unmarried. Prospective groom was asking for a Maruti 800 for marrying her. Her mother was a really sapping character but every sad mother is like that only. Raju is very religious and prays daily. He had picture of deities in front of his study table. In the end, he acquire the right attitude which impressed the interviewers and got him a job offer. He didn't fear anymore. Neither death nor poverty.<br/><br/>Since I made a generalized comment on mothers let me dig deep into it. Mothers are different kind of creatures. Usually one finds fear and greed in people. Like greedy people are always more fearful also and vice versa. But in mothers, fear is accompanied by love and not greed.<br/><br/>Kareena was the daughter of Prof Virus. She was pursuing medicine and was a qualified doctor too. She had a brother who committed suicide unable to bear the pressure of forced studied. He wanted to study literature but his father forced him to take up science and sit for entrance of ICE. Kareena also had an elder sister who got married. The trio gatecrashed in her marriage ceremony and got caught. While convincing Kareena that Suhaas is not the right guy for her, Rancho explains how to know when one is in love. There is a pleasant air, whispering light music and everything happens in slow motion. It's like time has stopped. We do find people like Suhaas in our life who only talk about the price tag.<br/><br/>When the librarian told the meaning of ""chamatkar"", chatur immediately replied that he doesn't want to know the meaning of every word in speech. He will just cram it up and then deliver on the function day. The most common attitude of people on campus. Nobody changes with time but people get to know themselves with time. And that is how, they improve. Chatur remained the same in more than 10 years. He crammed, he farted, he conspired. Later on he became successful. He has a beautiful wife, a $ 3.5 m mansion, a Lamborghini and what not. He boasts it all.<br/><br/>Rancho expressed his disappointment over the system. He had some ideas. Like bookish knowledge should not the measure of learning. Grades should not be displayed in public view. Innovation and experiments should be encouraged and failure should not be frowned upon."

"vaibhav_bhandeo","9","1","5","29 December 2009"," 3 Idiots - Nothing Idiotic About This?
","Give me some bad words, give me some taunts. Give me another chance; I want to be critical on 3 idiots at least once.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I couldn't get a Rancho to fulfill this dream of mine.<br/><br/>If only someone else would have played Rancho other than Aamir Khan, this movie would have been some what mediocre. Its class of Aamir's acting and timing which makes 3 idiots a special movie.<br/><br/>Mind you it's not a path breaking movie like Taare Zameen Par neither a ground breaking revolutionary movie like Rang De Basanti, its actually a mild reminders to those who have lived their entire life for something they never wanted to do. It says out loud ""Give them another chance; so that they can grow up once gain"".<br/><br/>Aamir as Rancho enters to lives of people who always had a dream ready to erupt in their heart but unfortunately their social and moral responsibilities were holding their hands from long. Not only Rancho teaches his friends to live up to their dreams but also teaches lesson of moral responsibility to people like Viru (The principal), this all comes with a brisk smile and amazingly casual attitude.<br/><br/>The storyline has been loosely based on five point someone of Chetan Bhagat but there has been many alteration for good. It's not the story though which keeps you alive but the small bits and pieces which sometimes brings a broad smile (When Aamir & company says ""All izz Well"") and at times keeps your heart overwhelmed (Especially when Raju's father gets admitted to hospital). It has got some moments which makes you crave to give a tight slap to Virus (The principal) when he is at his best, harassing students. There are some laugh out loud moments special mention for the speech at Teacher's Day celebration. This is a complete masala movie with class of its own, some where in league of Munna bhai, No wonder it's coming from the same director Raju Hirani.<br/><br/>What I like about Aamir Khan's movies is although he has central character but all other characters have their fair share of work. You would not see Aamir overloaded on each reel but still he will leave the best footprint. He excels and every time proves why he is known as ""The Perfectionist"". One more feather to his cap, way to go t Other than Aamir, Bomen Irani has played a remarkable role. As a cruel and heart less educationist, he played his role at par to anyone. You will love to hate him till the end.<br/><br/>Sharman Joshi is one man who connects to audience effortlessly. He has played his lower middle class son's role impeccable. Kareena is her short but effective role of Pia is very impressive. She comes as a fresh breeze, every time with her scintillating charm mesmerizing the audience. The role of a jealous and self-centered geek Chatur ramalingam is one of the best portrayal of a non-protagonist in recent time. Only disappointment was Madhavan, with an actor of his caliber this was a very low profile character.<br/><br/>Music is also very nice, specially ""Give me some sunshine""; it surely took me back to my days at college. All izz well is surely a new anthem for young generation. Zubi Dubi is also a nice viewing. Director must be given most of the credit for making such a young movie with lads way above their projected age in movie. Excellent thought process and characterization; he surely is one of the most creative directors we have. Cinematography is also exotic especially when lense captured best of Shimla and Ladakh.<br/><br/>The movie also gives an important message of how growing pressure on performance is driving young generation into depression and makes them to take wrong decisions in life. It also tell you not to run behind success but work for excellence and success will follow. As always Raju Hirani has gone with a message.<br/><br/>Although their are some unnecessary instances towards end which prolongs the end but still It's a must must watch for all moviegoers and special watch for those who doesn't see movies as well."

","Life is all about listening to your heart and chasing your dreams. That's the essence of 3 IDIOTS, directed by the supremely talented Rajkumar Hirani. Let me come to the point right away. There are films and there are more films. And then there's 3 IDIOTS.3 IDIOTS belongs to everyone. But, yes, there's no denying that Aamir makes you forget all his past achievements as you watch the amazing actor play Rancho. To state that this ranks angst his finest works would be an understatement. Madhavan is incredible, especially in the sequence when he explains his point of view to his father. Sharman is outstanding from start to end. This was a difficult role to portray and only an actor of Clare could've pulled it off. Boman is superb as the vicious head of the institute. The scenes between Aamir and Boman are extra-ordinary and it's a treat to watch these two powerful actors clash on the big screen, without getting over dramatic. Boman's appearance, mannerisms and dialogue delivery are exemplary. <br/><br/>The length of Kareena's role may not be as much as Aamir, Madhavan and Sharman, but she registers a strong impact nonetheless. Omi is excellent and the viewers are sure to love his acidic tongue and gestures in the movie. Mona Singh doesn't get much scope. Jaaved Jaffery is competent. Pareekshit Sahani is decent. <br/><br/>On the whole, 3 IDIOTS easily ranks angst Aamir, Rajkumar Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra's finest films. Do yourself and your family a favors: Watch 3 IDIOTS. It's emotional, it's entertaining, it's enlightening. The film has tremendous youth appeal and feel-good factor to work in a big way.

","3 Idiots is an Indian comedy directed by Rajkumar Hirani, with a screenplay by Abhijat Joshi, and produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra. It features stars Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor, R. Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Omi Vaidya, Parikshit Sahni and Boman Irani.Chetan Bhagat's best-selling novel 5 Point Someone makes the leap to the big screen in this comedy about three engineering students whose friendship stands the test of time.<br/><br/>As Farhan and Raju search the valleys for their missing friend Rancho , their memories drift back to the days when they we're all college roommates, and Rancho incurred the wrath of their headstrong dean Viru Sahastrabudhhe by daring to propose radical theories that directly contradicted his teacher's lessons. Later, Rancho begins dating Virus' daughter Pia, and gradually begins to gain the dean's respect. Flashing back to the present day, Farhan and Raju uncover some previously unknown facts about their old friend that leads them to question everything they ever thought they knew about him.<br/><br/>A fabulous achievement across the board. A typical Bollywood confection but also social commentary on a dysfunctional engineering school system that pressures huge numbers of students into suicide.Also,the movie is very much a character-driven piece, which not only makes the laughs bigger but also earns a deeper involvement as the viewer deeply cares for the characters involved.Overall,this is a classic comedy."
"Buddy-51","7","1","6","14 July 2012"," likable if bloated screwball comedy
","When it comes to running-time, why does Bollywood treat every movie as if it were a sweeping historical epic on the order of a ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or a ""Doctor Zhivago?"" A case in point: ""3 Idiots,"" an amiable enough little screwball comedy that has been padded out to a wrist-slashing 164 minutes. It also happens to be the most commercially successful Bollywood feature ever released in India. Go figure.<br/><br/>The story centers around a trio of promising but mischievous young engineering students who rebel against the high-pressured rigidity - both academic and personal - of the exclusive school they're attending.<br/><br/>""3 Idiots"" has two things going for it: its cranked-up energy level and its appealing actors, especially Aamir Khan, who portrays the ringleader of the group. These alone are enough to compensate for the silliness of much of the action, the corniness of the jokes (with irritating cue music in case we couldn't pick up on the corn on our own) and the stickiness of the sentimentality. And, in its own playful way, the movie makes some important points about the intense pressure placed on Indian children to achieve beyond their parents' wildest expectations, and about the need to pursue the path that will make one most happy in life.<br/><br/>It's a pretty entertaining feature, overall; I just wish it didn't take so darn long to play itself out."
"divesh_mistry","9","1","6","13 January 2010"," Now..that's what I call a movie, about time!!
","Well, I guess my sub-heading sums out what I feel about this film! For those who do not know, this film is brought to you by those who gave you the Munnabhai series and for those who have not seen this, would definitely recommend. Once again this team of producers do not disappoint! Add in Aamir Khan to it and you have a masterpiece. Not because of the location of where the film is produced, or because they show every young actor wearing a branded designer garment or using technology (or how i refer to as Sugar coating)to cover up a poor story line, but they actually use a very serious topic that involves the flaws of their education system and tells a story in a unique and clever way that as a film lover you will enjoy, yet you will understand the message they are trying to portray. <br/><br/>Not generally being a fan of Bollywood movies due to its unrealistic story lines and OTT (over the top) acting and agonisingly long movies, I must say two and a half hours for this movie was short as it was very entertaining. <br/><br/>Not being fluent in Hindi, I was being reliant on the subtitles for this movie, so I guess I missed some classic jokes and their meanings, as when translated they probably are not as funny, but nevertheless, when i say that this movie is hilarious, I mean HILARIOUS! Ingenious comedy not slap-stick OTT things that Bollywood is branded for.<br/><br/>Most of the other reviewers have all commented about the movie and the storyline and actors, so for me to repeat all of that wouldn't be wise. But on that note, I would like to mention one actor who of course is Aamir Khan, this guy is a legend! Please do not misinterpret me when I say that he was the only person who made this film a success because that would not be fair, the supporting cast did a very good job and many of the actors have definitely not done their careers any harm but the reality is people paid money to watch Aamir and not the other actors and once again he delivered. He is like the Tom Hanks or Tom Cruise of Bollywood (in their Prime)who is an actor or should I say an artist who always tries to better himself and raise the bar as high as he can, by trying different roles and not being type casted. Aamir has probably played most roles now through from comedy to historical and etc and in each one he grows as an actor.<br/><br/>Similar to the marketing tool, the Maslow Hierarchy of needs, where it shows the stages of life a person has to go on before they are satisfied before moving to the next level, Aamir would be be near the top where the basics of acting and making a name for himself have been accomplished, also making money would now be his least of worries, but to change cinematography, tackle political problems of the country, make a difference to others and to be an innovator/ a pioneer rather then a follower is the steps he is taking.<br/><br/>This film will surely be an epic in years to come and hopefully not just the directors but also fans should wake up and see that this is the sort of quality they should expect and support if they really want to be respected in worldwide cinema. Drop all these fancy locations, Western type of life styles, bad acting and repetition of story lines instead, concentrate on writing meaningful and an innovative story lines that will inspire and make India proud. And what is this with every film trying to be produced in different countries? India is a beautiful country with many riches, great locations, landscapes etc as showed in this film, as some scenery shots are magnificent and breath taking that you wonder what makes people want to film abroad when there is still so much to show of India?..TOURISM IN India..take note! this is your chance to show how beautiful your country is, use this to show the world how great we are.<br/><br/>And with that I conclude, without giving the story away at all where just like the film Avatar, this is the making of a movie that will inspire others and change cinematography forever. WATCH THIS MOVIE on the big screen! To feel the real power of 3 idiots and other people's reactions to this classic!! ENJOY!!"

"ssvikas","8","1","6","6 January 2010"," Intelligent Script plus Munnabhai-esquire fun = a sure entertainer
","Coming from the director of the “Munnabhai” series, on the face of it, 3 idiots is a complete 'paisa vasool' (value for money) comedy. As with his earlier flicks, it has benign intentions at heart, and some lessons for the system. Vis-à-vis a goon do-gooder there, you have an enigmatic genius here who seems turn everything that he touches into gold; which includes smiles, encouragement, healing, love, creativity, tears and some hard lessons.<br/><br/>The system under attack here is similar to that in Aamir’s previous masterpiece “Tare Zameen Par”: Education as he steps up his ire from schools to professional colleges that emphasize on cramming and bagging ranks. One of the gags says: “if you don't run, you'll be like a broken anda (egg)”. Facing the attack is the fictional Imperial College of Engineering, modeled on the famed IITs and shot on campus at IIM Bangalore.<br/><br/>Drawing inspiration from Chetan Bhagat’s ‘5 point someone’, it tracks the lives of its 3 protagonists Ranchhoddas Chanchad or Rancho (Aamir Khan), Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) through their college days, their battles with the dictatorial Director Viru Sahasrabuddhe or ViruS (Boman Irani) and a dabbles into Rancho’s love interest and ViruS’ daughter and a doctor, Pia (Kareena Kapoor).<br/><br/>3 Idiots also tackles issues such as pursuing a stream of education against one’s own creative interests or heart’s calling, teaching a hard lesson to ragging seniors and an odd lesson to slimy nerds. While he goes about things, he gets Pia to fall for him too. Rancho’s bold methods irk ViruS, the similar antagonist from Hirani’s Munnabhai. Of course, as must all movies end, Rancho opens up ViruS’ eyes towards the end.<br/><br/>The funniest scene in undoubtedly is the one involving Rancho modifying Chatur’s speech. While it had to praise ViruS for his ‘chamatkar’ (miracles) in the college, the modified ‘balatkar’ (rape) brings out the reality. With Omi Vaidya delivering it to rote perfection, you’d be rolling on the floor laughing. Here, don’t also miss Hirani’s lesson that mugging up without understanding is ‘balatkar’ of knowledge.<br/><br/>While it’s not all perfect, there are times when the drama is overdone, especially the delivery scene on a TT table! But considering its other goodies, overlooking this is quite easy. The best goodie comes in the form of editing wherein it weaves the past and present events as Farhan and Raju accompanied by a vengeful Chatur try to unearth the whereabouts of the ‘real’ Rancho who disappeared during the convocation.<br/><br/>Aamir Khan is synonymous with quality films. It’s another thing though that I found last year’s ""Ghajini” purely average and it turned out to be a hit. But, with 3 Iditots, his sole release for this year, Aamir, in my reckoning is back to his glory days of “Tare Zameen Par”. If the rave reviews and BO collections are to be believed, 3 idiots is a Smash-Hit. If you have still not seen this meaningful laugh riot, rush now for a bite of its 'gyaan' (wisdom)."

","Aal iz not welleducation system<br/><br/>Rajkumar Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra coupled with Aamir Khan have come out with an ingenious film. The film exposes the fact that the Indian Education System needs to be revamped and how well they do it. Picturized in trademark Hirani style, the film is a must watch for every student and parent. The current scenario where teachers feel that whatever has been taught in class is the only thing that the student needs to learn and a scientific or questioning mind is not welcome in the classrooms is shown in good humour. The student too gets conditioned to this rote learning or falling in line syndrome for earning favours from the teachers. The setting is in a premier engineering college of the country ICE where three students are thrown into the situation because their parents wanted them to do so. This is so true of innumerable students who are just following their parents diktat in opting for engineering. Madhavan wants to get into wildlife photography but is forced into ICE. Sharman has to do it because he has to succeed and support his family which is struggling for survival with an ailing father and a working mother and an unmarried sister of marriageable age.Aamir Khan is the odd man out in the trio with a penchant for technology and a sharp and questioning mind. But these threesome are found unfit by the college director (Boman Irani) . In the leadership of Aamir Khan they thwart the college's efforts to punish their waywardness but to no avail . By the time they reach the final year there are two groups – one the studious , loyal types and the other is the threesome who are mischievous and non-conforming. Time and again they pester the college authorities with their pranks .Aamir is not the serious study variety but is successful in topping the exams . This point drives home the issue that if you have the passion you can do it – you don't need to cram.After being rustigated from college, Boman changes his heart and takes them back because their ingenuity saves his daughter as they help her deliver her child in extraordinary circumstances and with the help of Kareena , who is a doctor and also Boman's daughter. Aamir disappears after his college only to be traced by his friends in what is the ultimate goal of his passion. The gags, jokes, ragging scenes, classroom sequences, romantic scenes, gatecrashing into marriages and all such bits in the movie are so realistic that all of us would have done the same in the colleges. Aamir is superb and looks the college student. He fails to surprise because each time he surpasses himself and has the uncanny knack of choosing the right films.Madhavan and Sharman support him to the hilt as true friends who are ready to crashland flights, gag car owners and ditch the college authorities to support each other. The light-heartedness is there but there are some touching family scenes too which makes the movie one of the best in recent times. Raju Hirani proves to be a master storyteller again. Swanand Kirkire's lyrics are youthful and meaningful. Shantanu Moitra's music is adequate but is the only mediocre thing in an otherwise brilliant film.Boman is his usual hilarious with grey shades . Kareena is beautiful ."

","Rajkumar Hirani has succeeded once again! This film is right up there with, if not over and above, the Munnabhai films. <br/><br/>Everyone played their parts exceptionally well in this must see blockbuster comedy. Aamir Khan has now become an actor who chooses his films and roles with perfection. Boman Irani (the only actor who has appeared in all of Rajkumar's films) failed to disappoint once again.<br/><br/>There were side-splitting scenes that I will remember for life, but I do not want to give these away. They will have to be seen before they can be believed! <br/><br/>With every good story, there is always an underlying and important message. In this film, it is the following: ""Every person in this world is born with a gift and a passion, which cannot morally be forced upon that person."" An inability by Indian families to recognise this fact of life is leading to tragic consequences, which can tear such families apart.<br/><br/>For me, 3 Idiots has made the end of 2009 an ever-lasting memory. May this film win as many awards as possible!"

","The film was brilliant! No words about it! I actually don't have words to praise the movie, but ""All is well"" with the movie! The movie was an excellent piece of cinema and also one of the best films of the decade in bollywood. Aamir Khan has made me his fan! He is the best and the most versatile actor in the world! This guy looked the most young in the movie, being 44 he played the role of a 23yr old! Madhavan looked a little old for his role but his acting was tremendous, Sharman Joshi was mind blowing! Boman Irani was excellent as usual! Kareena was fine! The screenplay & dialogues by Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijat Joshi were hilarious at times (sometimes it made my jaw hurt), but were also eye opening in parts! The movie was a train ride, and the stops were emotion, drama, comedy, suspense (for a while), and much more. The direction was an absolute delight and the cinematography was refreshing and great (especially the aerial shot of the car going to shimla). The music was also excellent.<br/><br/>Points.<br/><br/>AAMIR KHAN 20/10.<br/><br/>DIALOGUES 20/10.<br/><br/>DIRECTION 20/10. <br/><br/>STORY 20/10. <br/><br/>SCREENPLAY 20/10. <br/><br/>ENTERTAINMENT 100/10. <br/><br/>On the whole, the film is a first day first show must watch and if you haven't watched it, go for it today!!! It is the best film released so far in the year, and in the history of films!!! NO FILM CAN BEAT IT. <br/><br/>IF YOU ARE DOING ANYTHING TODAY, LEAVE IT AND GO WATCH 3 IDIOTS!!!"
"vinay1493","8","1","7","30 December 2009"," Rajkumar Hirani creates a Masterpiece !!!
","Well to start off, 3 idiots itself starts of brilliantly by introducing Farhan Qureshi (Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi). Boman Irani is once again at his best playing the Principal of the college Viru Sahastra Buddhe (VIRUS).<br/><br/>Both of those friends are informed that their dearest friend Ranchoddas Chanchad (Aamir Khan) is returning. Shocked by the sudden disappearance long ago, both these friends come to the place where they have been called for, desperate to meet their Best Friend. But something else is waiting for them at that place.<br/><br/>The movie has been wonderfully directed with scenes continuously revolving around the past and present at perfect intervals of time. The story revolves on how Ranchoddas witnesses the scenes of depression and sadness among students who are often dejected due to lack of scoring grades and supporting family pressures. In the mid time, Ranchoddas falls in love with the Principal's daughter Pia (kareena kapoor) very fine acting by her too.<br/><br/>Well, not revealing anything more, the three characters have been wonderfully played by Madhavan, Sharman and Aamir. The movie has loads of comedy at many times but also delivers a strong and subtle message to all its viewers. Even the supporting characters have done their role exceptionally well which adds more to the fun quotient. All credits go to Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijit Joshi for plotting this script and directing it perfectly.<br/><br/>The music can be rated 10/10 as it creates such a high emotion while watching the movie. Well to round it up, get a ticket for yourself now, no matter how high the price is !!! You ll definitely enjoy the movie though it turns out to be lengthy. (2 hours 50 minutes).<br/><br/>Watch it now. It is a total family entertainer. Enjoyable for all ages. A Blockbuster soon to be."

","This appears to be a brilliant, funny movie. But there's a BIG PROBLEM if you don't speak Hindi. At least my copy has less than 10% of the dialog in subtitles. <br/><br/>An entire 4 minute speech, with everyone laughing, had absolutely NO subtitles. Huge parts of the dialog, literally minutes go by with people talking back and forth, apparently with funny, witty dialog, and finally the last sentence just says ""come."" I am enjoying the movie but missing so much. Not sure if I have an early release or what? Actually, even the dialog that is translated is quite poor...sometimes the wrong word is used.<br/><br/>The parts of the movie that I could follow are really charming. The actors have great facial expressions and quirky moves. I love the whole parody of the Indian education process for engineering."

","Excellent movie. Easily one of my top 5 movies of all times. Superb acting by everyone in the movie...especially Aamir Khan, Boman Irani and Sharman Joshi. I hope they get awards for their performances. Script was excellent with a very important message. And despite its comedy genre, it proves to become an easy classic of bollywood cinema. Songs aren't the greatest but still seem to do OK and fit; movie is greatly focused on the plot. Aamir Khan once again proves to have the touch of gold exceeding his excellence in his film. Just when you think he broke the Bollywood records with Ghajini, he does it again with 3 Idiots by a mildstone. He's truly the greatest actor in bollywood history....and deserves the title of King Khan!!!"
"ankitj-pec","10","1","8","2 January 2010"," Contemporary cinema at its best.
","You watch 3 Idiots and realize that Aamir has done it again ! It started with Rang De Basanti which instilled the passion of truthfulness to Taare Zameen par which was a message about child-centric creativity, the similar ideas are propounded in 3 Idiots.<br/><br/>3 Idiots is a mixture of realism and Bollywood Masala which targets a very important, yet subtle issue of our Indian society. Considering that fact that most of the population in India is young and further that most of them pursue sciences as their degree and compete with a gargantuan mass of peers to stand where they are right now, the story just aims to get some saneness in our society, which the old wise men argue and the younger ones forget. Think and learn things for the love of knowledge, rather than the desire of success. It highlights the essential flaw in our system, that the person studying in IIT's and IIM's is not because of his passion for technology/managing skills but because of his academic abilities.<br/><br/>A contemporary theme executed with contemporary brilliance and carefully dramatized masala to keep the audience entertained. If the medium budget films did well last year, mainly because of the realism in them, big budget like this has all the ingredients for a blockbuster. The plot focuses of inventive thinking, engineering design which, I , personally well relate to and share similar opinions. The plot is like any Masala movie, with a protagonist which desires a change in opinions and a climax which shatters the mindset of the pessimist, a love story, a friendship packed with chirps of comic relief. The strong theme just completes the movie and drives the message straight to the eye. Aamir deserves most of the credits for his acting while Vidhu Vinod Chopra and his team have done a commendable job with the sets, locales and editing and lighting. Hats Off ! 10/10<br/><br/>P.S. : before watching the movie, i was shocked to hear a German and a Ukranian going bonkers about the movie. such is the brilliance of contemporary bolly cinema."

Teaches us a lesson about letting students to pursue their dreams not the carrers we assign to them. The scene when aamir changes the word 'chamatkar' to 'balatkar' is rib tickling. I fell off my seat when Chatur started the narration of the text. Changing of dhan into sthan and 'chamatkar' to 'balatkar' is one of the main laughing points of the film.

Now a days many are just concentrating on marks and not interest , but they don't know that if we have interest we get the subject automatically. It was heart touching even in parts when there are comedy scenes. Music is good in the movie the songs like ALL IS WELL and Zoobi Doobi were good as everyone thought but the other songs like Give me some sunshine were heart touching and also very good in timing during the film. Comedy was reasonable as expected but also the ""AW"" scenes were also very good for the viewers. A complete family movie and also a movie for the youth and a movie from which our education system can learn.<br/><br/>All over because of this i give this film 10/10"

"jonah129129","6","1","9","26 May 2012"," 3 Idiots has lots of subtle gay references to it
","The movie has lots of subtle gay references to it, something that is frowned in Indian cinema. While none of the characters are portrayed as gay, the numerous references made to the male buttocks are enough to make one take note. It is referred to as a ""gift that is being requested for acceptance"" at the new students initiation ceremony, with many of the new students strutting and gyrating in just their underwear, including a scene with an underwear pulled down slightly to reveal a side of the buttock, with a stamp of approval on it, like it was certified A+ grade meat, or beef (gay male). In addition the name of the hero (Amir Khan) in the movie is too long to say at the initiation, and is considered to be ""quite a mouthful"". There is another scene in a song where all three lead actors are seated with their backs to the camera, on seats that have the shape of male buttocks, and then turn around while seated in them and rub the buttock shaped seats with their hands while smiling suggestively. There is also a song where the students are taking baths but that could be considered to be as communal shower although with the shorts covered with loin cloths. Other scenes include pants dropped to the ankles from time to time, with some scenes also involving turning of the person to the camera and whacking it to be accepted in defeat with the pants down. It might be overlooked as being funny, but these scenes are heavy in gay overtones. Otherwise just another Indian movie with a strong message of friendship."

","The prospect of a knockabout comedy that lasts for over 160 minutes isn't an enticing one, but luckily the title ""3 Idiots"" is something of a misnomer. There's some broad humour, ""comedy"" characters and lots of scatological references, but also depictions of suicide and reflections on the human condition. Western audiences may find this tonal inconsistency hard to take, as an onscreen suicide by hanging is followed by one of many songs.<br/><br/>The fifth Aamir Khan movie I've seen, he's an always likeable and engaging presence, but one criticism is that his characters never seem realistically flawed (Save for Dangal). Always the wisest person in the room, his ""think outside the box"" method of living embodies many of his portrayals and his passing of philosophy to his fellow students borders on preaching. Khan has the likeability and charisma to pull this off and prevent it from being too cloying, but in a movie where he becomes a famous scientist, redevises an entire system of learning and delivers a baby, it's something of a surprise to see him near a mass of water at the end of the movie and not start walking on it.<br/><br/>Currently on Netflix in the UK, there is some issue with the meaning of words and phrases being changed when translated: I know enough to realise that the subtitled ""ass"" said around an hour into the movie is really ""dog"", but I wasn't aware that balatkar (rape) was said throughout the doctored speech scene, with it changed to a more benign ""screwed"" for the UK audience. An interesting article on how the difference in ratings between men and women could be divided (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-if-online-movie-ratings-werent-based-almost-entirely-on-what-men-think/) shows that this film would be over a hundred places lower if only the votes from women were taken. All, it seems, is not well."

"kmbaruah","2","0","6","9 October 2019"," 3 Idiots: Innumerable Errors and Hollow Theme
","Well this is disappointing. The film's a whole major part is fake and based upon fakeness. The story is about three friends 2 of whose lives were heavily influenced by 3rd one. And that's no doubt will be AmirKhan. The film is irritating in matters of its content. I mean all the false understanding are displayed so confidently and that too with standard technical's that people will believe them to be true esp. the young people. I feel this movie should get out of IMDb top 250 list. This movie proves that INDIANS are still yet to be matured in understanding things. If you don't believe me just look at its number of voters.
The movie doesn't inspire education or any related matters. It inspires blindness and loose moral values. Amir Khan is an expert in cheating the world about his identity and he is the hero of the movie!!!!!. Guess about the rest of the movie. His friends were good at first but in meeting Amir they too were influenced by him and turned to loose minds. This type of loose attitude is not good for education and the director is serious about giving the message through them!!.
The comedy is not at all good I mean it's low standard. Low state minds will keep laughing at that. Raj Kumar Hirani disappointed me in making this because it reflects the negative-devilish-immoral aspect of the society. He spent millions of rupees in this for no good reason. I mean if he wanted to display the true Nature of the IDIOTS he would showed the characters in villainous ways or the dangers idiots lead society to. But he misunderstood the right from wrong and he showed just the opposite. There is no truth in this movie. Sometimes negative Characterization is also displayed in the movie and that is also acceptable but it must be shown in right way just like The Godfather, Requim for a dream, Arth, Legend of Bhagat Singh. Etc. They all depict the negative sides of society and still they reflect the truth. I think 3 IDIOTS is a type of fantasy movie but STILL if it is a fantasy one then there must be some type of beauty or aesthetic sense in its storytelling or in its presentation or in the story-line etc but that is 100% absent. 2/10 is for BomanSir who played Viru Sahastrabuddhe."

","It's so strange reviewing this movie after almost 10 years of its release. But after watching it again for the 50th time (no joke) I knew I had to write a review. I remember watching this movie when it was first released in theaters. As an 11 year-old Indian- American my hindi was pretty bad and some of the comedic scenes such as the one where Chatur was giving the speech in front of his school and made a mess (which i consider one of the best comedic scenes in any movie) went right over my head. Even the central message of the film which was to not follow success, but to do what you love and that success would follow you, was something I had still yet to understand. But now, watching this movie as a 20 year-old college student, really resonated with me. The trials and tribulations of being successful to appease your parents while also still battling the true aspirations that reside within you. All I can end this review by saying is this movie is truly a masterpiece and sure it did have some ridicoulous moments and scenes which could have been done without. But it's essence is timeless and even 30 years later, kids and adults alike will connect with this film."

","I don't remember what path led us to this film except that when we saw Steven Spielberg quoted as loving it we added it to our list.<br/><br/>Enthusiasm waned when we saw the description which sounded like Animal House. A 3 hour long Animal House.<br/><br/>But then we saw it was the highest grossing Indian movie ever when it came out. Courage returned.<br/><br/>Then we saw the movie poster. And we really wondered what we were letting ourselves in for. Coming across Big in Bollywood, a documentary following the American-born Indian cast member, bolstered Tom and Rose's courage. I hadn't seen it but went along for the 3 Idiots ride.<br/><br/>It was something like a cross between Animal House (without the extreme crudeness) and Dead Poet Society. With some song and dance numbers thrown in because it is Bollywood, so of course. And it was surprisingly charming a lot of the time. Uneven but we weren't sorry we watched it. We didn't expect it to tackle very serious themes (that's the Dead Poet Society part) but it was done quite sensitively.<br/><br/>Overall enjoyable as long as you are willing to go along for the ride. And the dance number with the umbrellas is adorable."
"sfahad-46456","9","0","1","26 February 2019"," Best movie in Bollywood industry so far
","First I thought it is comedy movie. But after watching this movie I came to understand that it is a great mixture of comedy plus suspense. This movie actually tells about the lives of the students and the difficulties they face during college and university life. i think students should clear their concepts rather than cramming because if you want success in market you should adopt thoughtful learning and the role of the teacher is also vital. Teachers should be corporative with students. In this movie, when student asked to principal to check his project but principal didn't even see his project that makes student demotivated eventually he suicide. i think this is the most harsh scene in this movie.
As a student it is our duty to promote education and we should help needy students financially so that they will also take part in development of country and its excellence. In this movie Amir Khan pay money to the poor children to start it school so these are the main points of this movie."
"hassanrazakhan-38841","8","0","1","26 February 2019"," Very informative movie for a Student
","The main purpose of this movie is students should get independence from parents when they choose their careers. Otherwise, they will suffer in college and as well as in market. When student student learn in which he / she has interest then he/ she will surely make his / her names.
Basically, this movie reflects our Asian education system. It is a reality that if student crams in school, college or university, he/she will get high grades and positions in his/her class, it is not guaranteed that he/she also get success in market as well. A student that always wants to clear his/her concepts then it is not sure that he will get high grades but it is guaranteed that he/she will be succeed in future when they will enter in market.
The role of teachers is also very important for the building the future of their students. Teachers should cooperate with student every time. In this movie, there is a harsh scene when principal of the college does not listen to his student and as a result student suicide."
"jahangeerk-30240","8","0","1","26 February 2019"," The Best Movie
","3 idiots is a Bollywood comedy movie. The most important role and main character was played by Amir Khan as Rancho. Rancho always believe in his heart and likes to study experimentally. He always tells his friends not to learn by memory(ratta), to learn by heart and experimentally.
3 idiots tells us that sometimes extra hope optimist nature may spoil career and mental growth of a person.Don't run behind the success, achieve excellence first, the success will automatically come looking for you.Be always creative in your answers, work & things you do which helps you become more capable of your own. Learning isn't just about being inside a class room and listening to teachers but its there everywhere. You just need to grab and grow with it.There are naysayers, jealous, stupid, hatred people around us. Ignore them and move on. Remember? ""If you stop and throw a stone at every dog that barks, you will never reach your destination"".
In 3 idiots, There are some scenes which should not shown to children and many audiences. Chatur 's speech may be funny,but seriously think about negative effects on children and uneducated people.The speech also contains explicit Hindi words, which should not be shown like this.Ragging scenes (Jahapnah! Tussi great ho!) is promoting ragging which is an serious crime but its has been seen school children and they get bad impact of it.
At last from my perspective overall movie is good and its shown our educational system. It gives a message learn for a cause and not for applause."
"maliksadia","9","0","3","25 February 2019"," Worth Watching Movie
","This is one of the best movies I've ever watched in my life. A true inspirational, motivational movie and must be watched by everyone especially parents, teachers and students. This movie depicts the life we all live or have lived at some point. One of the best things I like about this movie is that it gives a lot of lessons in a funny way in order to entertain people as well. However, there are many positive and negative points to be discussed. The movie revealed harsh realities of our educational system. No doubt, selecting right field is the most important factor of successful life and career. To excel in your career, one needs to be interested, confident and excited about the selected career and should believe in oneself and talent. So, instead of forcing children, parents should help them to choose the right career by taking care of their interests, skills and abilities. The movie also ensures the importance of knowledge over grades, Learning is much more important than getting good grades to excel in particular field in order to achieve success. The movie contains some adult contents which are inappropriate. This movie also promotes suicide attempt in order to get rid of troubles, hardships and pressure of education which is not a good way to get rid of difficulties of life. Overall, it is an amazing movie that has a lot of messages for the society in which we are surviving and is worth watching."

","The cast, the crew and the story, everything is so awesome. The story attracted me so much like there is innovation, there is fun, there is drama and everything one wants to watch in his/her quality time. The student life is depicted in an excellent manner and I guess every student as well as a teacher must watch this movie for once.
Where there are pros there are cons, the movie and it's message are misinterpreted like all the students are just looking at the fun part and enjoying the student life and missing the original message the movie actually conveys. The movie showed the main actor enrolled in a university on someone else' name and he even passed out with honors, that's a big issue which can lead to these kinds of crimes in our society."
"sidraurooj-99246","10","0","3","25 February 2019"," FUN AND ENTERTAINING WITH MEANINGFUL LESSONS
","The movie '3 idiots' is a masterpiece directed by Rajkumar Hirani. The movie revolves around the lives of three engineering students of Imperial college of Engineering. Rancho, who is gifted, Farhan, who possesses the passion of photography and Raju, who wants to help his poor family by getting a good corporate job. The movie tries to draw special attention to the pressure the Indian education system and the Indian society puts on students. While the engineering discipline is highly glorified by the society as depicted in the movie; disciplines such as photography are degraded.<br/><br/>The movie tries to depict the struggle those students face who are forced into the discipline of engineering. It is a story of almost every student in South Asia who is passionate about something in life however due to family and societal pressure cannot pursue their career choice. They, then lose the battle against the tough, impossible and cruel system and in result lose their life by committing suicide.<br/><br/>The movie shows the unbreakable bond of the ""idiots"" trio. The head of the institute, Dr Viru Sahastrabuddhe also called Virus by his students, tries to break the friendship of the trio by distancing Farhan and Raju from the rebellious Rancho as Rancho becomes a challenge for him. However, he fails to do so as Rancho helps Farhan to follow his passion and saves Raju's father from dying with the help of Pia, younger daughter of Virus.<br/><br/>The character of Rancho is played by the versatile actor Amir Khan who never fails to do justice to the characters he plays. Rancho is a character to amaze people through his thoughts, his ideas, his unusual ways of understanding and expressing knowledge, his innovative inventions, his passion for achieving something in life not through copying and cheating but experimenting and exploring. He builds strong emotional bond with Farhan and Raju. He encourages Farhan to give his passion of photography a chance and try to convince his father to allow him to pursue photography. On one hand, we see Rancho, who believes in understanding, simplifying knowledge, enjoying his passion for science and engineering and implementing his knowledge practically. On the other hand, we see Chatur, often called 'Silencer' by the trio, who Is obsessed with memorizing books and topping the exams. These two types of characters are portrayed in the movie to show contrast to the audience between the two different techniques that the students follow.<br/><br/>The way the director shot the movie is to the point. It is full of fun and lessons. All the actors played their part brilliantly and contributed to the success of the film. The audience of the movie may be anyone. Adults, kids and students particularly those who belong to engineering as they can easily relate themselves to the movie. The good thing about the movie is that it focuses on the issues which are ignored in the society. However, one negative point I noticed in the movie was that it portrayed suicides. Suicidal scenes may affect the younger audience in a negative way.<br/><br/>Conclusively, the lessons that can be learned from the movie are that memorizing the curriculum word to word is not the aim of education however understanding is. Topping the batch does not declare you to be successful. Additionally, the main aim of education should be understanding and to convey meaningful knowledge to the students rather than forcing and pressurizing them to follow a strict, exhausting and punishing curriculum. The movie throws light on the way teachers do injustice to their students and how the pressure that they put on students forces them to commit suicide. The movie emphasizes the need to develop passion for learning in students. Moreover, the students should be given choice to choose their career path and not forced into science and engineering disciplines just because they are thought to be the most successful career choices. Being an engineering student myself, I would rate the movie 10/10 because it perfectly shows the life of students and what they go through."
"zertashiashafiq","8","0","3","25 February 2019"," tells us a life learning message ,without giving depression
","I found this movie relate able to my academic life because I'm an engineering student and this movie also revolves around different scenarios related to three engineering students. It wonderfully tells us some serious messages in a comedy genre, otherwise this movie could become a piece of depression for me. The concept in the movie that I found positive was that it conveys a message of not encouraging cramming in studies. We should be able to understand and implement concept. Another thing that I considered good in this movie is that you should always chase your subject of interest otherwise you might get a good lifestyle and job, but you will surely not be going to enjoy your profession. An issue has also been raised through this movie, that is family pressure on a student along with academic pressure. A student might be able to handle the academic pressure but when it comes to family pressure, he starts giving more focus on good grades instead of good learning. It depicts a teacher student relation but somehow in a negative way. Teacher plays the most significant role in any student's carrier. Due to teacher's behavior, a student can simply hate or love a subject. It also tells us about the awful education system, that has become a trend in our society. But the characters in this movie gives little importance to rules and regulation of university, which is a negative thing for me, because it is not possible for a student to show a careless behavior towards discipline related issues. As student should not only focus on how to become a good engineer, but also focuses to become a good human being for the society."
"pakeezasaleemch","9","0","3","25 February 2019"," A lesson for students
","Basically, I learn from this movie that
1). don't plan a 'career' which we have no idea.
2). The examination system is flawed, The exams are never able to check the true potential of students.And very often, the results hurt them as they make direct comparison with fellow students.
3). It also tell we should learn with 'purpose'.Most time we don't understand the real purpose of learning , how its going to affect us and people around us.
4),Chase 'Excellence' success will follow. :)
Critic:
1). Attempted & Suicide scenes by the students in movie giving wrong message.
2). Ragging scenes is promoting ragging which is an serious crime as per supreme court law.
3). I n this movie , negative image of teacher is shown."
"mkamranali","10","0","3","25 February 2019"," The greatest Bollywood movie of all times ""3 Idiots"".
","I think this is the best movie Bollywood has ever produced. The movie got many hilarious and funny scenes. All the cast in the movie played their roles superbly, especially Amir Khan was outstanding in his role. It deals with the present education system in India as well as in Pakistan where students and teachers think that only memorizing everything is the way for success. The main theme of the movie states that we the students can excel or achieve anything in life which if he/she has interest in it.3-idiots not only entertains, but it also gives us lesson. This movie teaches us forward-thinking and give us hope and courage.
Movie contains many positive aspects of life like it said in the movie that ""we should learn but first by understanding it not by memorizing it.The most positive message that was given in this movie was ""to join that career which you like the most"". The golden rule which 3 IDIOTS teaches us in a light and entertaining way is that ""Whatever the problem in life is, just say to yourself ""All is Well"". This won't solve your problems, but it will give the courage to face it. ""Chase Excellence and success will follow ""and also ""life is not about getting good grades but chasing your dreams"".
But still the movie contains some negative aspects as they have showed some serious content which is effecting our society. They remembered the message of ""following your heart's desire"", but they forgot that only hard work and persistence are the key for success.""3 Idiots"" was passed with U/A ( Under Adult) certificate by Censor board. Still, there are some scenes which should not shown to children and many audiences. Attempted & Suicide scenes by the students in movie giving wrong message. Baby delivery scene was also not appropriate for children. Chatur 's speech may be funny, but it showed negative effects in children. The speech also contains explicit Hindi words, which should not be shown like this. Ragging scenes is promoting ragging in universities which is an serious crime. Kissing Scene by the actors at the end was also not appropriate for children.
But in short, this is must watch movie as it teaches great lesson for the students and also for the teachers as well. I hope everyone who will watch this movie and will enjoy it.
I am giving it 10/10.
Thanks!"

It perfectly reflects the education system of subcontinent. It is also a source of motivation for the students who are struggling in their student life. In movie, there were few disrespectful scenes regarding teachers and I think this is the negative factor of this movie. There is also a learning factor for teachers that they should be careful about their behavior with students.

The story is based on light comedy but serious story is being told behind it. My personal opinion is that first half is a lot lighter then the second as the story begins to unfold itself on the audience in the second half. The story itself is very immersive and funny but sad at the same time which makes it an amazing movie to watch. The story is about 3 college friends, hence the name ""3 idiots"" and is a 3 hour long packed with laughable stupidity and serious heat touching moments. The lead cast includes Aamir Khan, Madhavan, Mona Singh and they played the roles beautifully. In my opinion, its a must watch movie as it won't disappoint. I myself would definitely watch it again someday."

","This was, for awhile, the highest grossing movie in India. Seeing as how India makes twice as many movies as us (we're still at least in the Top 3 though), it really is something most people should watch. The basic story is that these two students are going on a road trip to find their friend, Rancho. As a three hour long comedy, it knows how to use its time. Of course, this can be said for most Bollywood films. For whatever reason, the version I saw occasionally had English in it.<br/><br/>What's great about this movie is that so much is going on and they know how to experiment with so many different genres. We get great comedy, drama, and romance. You could even argue it gets scary near the end. It's a plot that goes everywhere and you're having fun every minute of the day. It's one of those movies where you have to pay close attention. Nearly every joke is alluded to or referenced again in the story. <br/><br/>Maybe it can focus too much on drama, but working in different genres is always impressive. We even get some great lessons learned about serving our parents and how important college degrees can be. It helps that it's so much fun and we're glad to see standard Bollywood dance numbers. It's quite bright and colorful. I love the bits with the pencils in space too. Glad to know this has enough votes to be on the Top 250. ****"

","Cast: Amir Khan, Madhaan, Sharman Joshi, Karena Kapoor Khan, Omi Vaidya and Boman Irani
Director: Rajkumar Hirani
Synopsis: One of my favorite movie, which is funny, emotional and educational. A story of three funny best friends of an engineering college in India, whose family background was totally different from each other. Chatur ""Silencer"" Ramalingam give a call to his college mates Raju Rastogi and Farhan Qureshi for a reunion with Rancho after ten years of their graduation. Chatur finds a rarer picture of Rancho who was not in connection with them since their graduation day did not have any information about him. Now, Raju, Farhan, and Chatur started their journey to meet Rancho in Shimla, India. In a journey to meet Rancho, Farhan is recalling all of the memories from their first - last day of college. Their college experience was challenging in every step but also Rancho challenges his college dean Viru Sahastrabudhhe ""Virus"" every day. <br/><br/>Review: First time I have watched this movie, I think it was confusing, worthless and timewasting until I watch the movie at home with my parents. I had watched the first day, first show with my best friends and we critic whole movie worthless. We used to like action, dramatic and documentaries movies until we have watched this movie for the second time. Since then this is one of my favorite movies forever. One of the take of way from this movie was Rancho dialogue "" All is well"" meaning when ever you have to deal with difficulties movement in your life, forget everything, place right hand in left chest and say ""All is well"" to decrease your heartbeat. <br/><br/>One of my favorite sense from the movie is when that Chatur gives the speech in teacher day in front of the minister, principle, dean of college including teacher and students. Virus advised Farhan and Raju to be aware of Rancho and start their new life along with Chatur. Farhan ignored Virus advice but Raju thinks it was turning point for him so he started a friendship with Chatur. Now, Farhan and Rancho want to give Chatur hard time and lesson to Raju by changing scripts. Since Chatur was born in Uganda and studying in English, he Hindi was very weak. So, Farhan and Rancho take this opportunity to changed teacher day scripts using slang words in the middle of a paragraph. Now, when Chatur started speech, the whole auditorium laughs because scripts were not only funny, however, every word gives negative sense to insulting teachers and minster.<br/><br/>The movie contains the good quality of sounds, mixing, color contraction and animation. They have used animation of human sperms to emphasize Farhan birth and Raju critical condition in hospital. They have used silence as a sound effect in Raju sense where he jumped from the terrace committed suicide after meeting with Virus. The contrast sensitivity of Raju, Rancho, and Farhan drinking alcohol under moonlight looks pure and natural. <br/><br/>Finally, the title of the movie intended to be funny, but also, I viewed the movie as educational, dramatic and emotional. Every character of movie contributes a lot to be one of the best films including the director himself play a varied role including editing and writing. This is one of best movie for college students, parents, and teachers. This movie was rated 8.3 out of 10 which is pretty impressive and I think this movie deserve it."

Simply, brilliant.<br/><br/>Simple but articulate story telling laced with lots of humour and lessons from life. A wonderful experience to watch as every single actor from Sharman, Madhavan, Boman, Kareena & Aamir deliver probably the best performance in a movie this year.<br/><br/>Sharman & Madhavan start off on a journey to seek out their friend Rancho. Together they were the 3 Idiots in college. And they take us the viewers with them on this beautiful journey with such warmth, panache, humour and love, that we don't want the journey to end.<br/><br/>Sharman really shows why he's one actor to watch out for. His acting genes come through in every single scene. He's perfect in his role. Sharman, you rock!I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com. It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly recommended."

It was loosely adapted from the novel Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat. The film stars Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor, R. Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Omi Vaidya, Parikshit Sahni and Boman Irani. The film is distinctive for featuring real inventions by little-known people in India's backyards. The brains behind the innovations were Remya Jose, a student from Kerala, who created the exercise- bicycle/washing-machine; Mohammad Idris, a barber from Meerut district in Uttar Pradesh, who invented a bicycle-powered horse clipper; and Jahangir Painter, a painter from Maharashtra, who made the scooter- powered flour mill."

","Farhan Qureshi (R.Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) are students at the prestigious Imperial College of Engineering (ICE). Farhan's passion is wildlife photography, but he pursues an engineering degree to appease his father. Raju chooses engineering with hopes of improving his family's financial situation, but his lack of self-confidence results in poor grades. Their third roommate and friend, Ranchodas 'Rancho' Shamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), has an immense interest in engineering, and invents in his spare time. After giving unorthodox answers in class, Rancho faces scrutiny from the college's director, Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), known as ""Virus"", whose traditional philosophies on education and learning contrast sharply with Rancho's atypical ideas of teaching. Virus is shown to be extremely strict — a trait that indirectly caused his own son's suicide after putting him under excessive pressure.<br/><br/>Rancho eventually falls in love with Pia (Kareena Kapoor), Virus' younger daughter, who is a medical student in residency at the city's hospital. He also scores the highest marks on exams out of his class, much to the dismay of both Virus and Chatur, an arrogant Tamil student who also despises Rancho. One night, Rancho, Farhan, and Raju drunkenly break into the Sahastrabuddhi household to allow Rancho to profess his love to Pia. After discovering their antics, Virus threatens to expel Raju unless he writes a letter blaming Rancho for the break-in. Unwilling to betray Rancho or disappoint his family, Raju unsuccessfully attempts suicide, and ends up in a coma. After intensive care and support from his friends, Raju recovers just before he successfully interviews for a corporate job.<br/><br/>Farhan has adopted Rancho's outlook and decides to pursue his love of photography. Frustrated at Rancho's influence on Raju and Farhan, Virus conspires to deliberately modify the final exams so that none of them can graduate. However, Pia gives Virus' office keys to Rancho to enable him to get the exam papers. Virus finds them and expels Rancho. The trio, however, earn a reprieve when Virus' pregnant elder daughter Mona (Mona Singh) goes into labour at the same time that a heavy storm cuts off all power and traffic. Despite this, Rancho uses his engineering knowledge to deliver the baby in the college common room. A grateful Virus finally acknowledges Rancho as an extraordinary student, and allows the three to graduate. Rancho then unexpectedly disappears shortly after the ceremony.<br/><br/>Ten years later, Chatur is the vice president of a corporation in the United States, Farhan is a successful photographer, and Raju is married while living a comfortable lifestyle.

They discover that the Rancho they knew was actually ""Chhote"", an orphaned servant to the Chanchad family household in Shimla. When the real Ranchodas (Javed Jaffrey) went to London for four years, his father allowed the servant to fill his son's place - including using his son's full name - and take credits for the degree.

"bhowmickpatidar","10","0","1","20 April 2016"," The best Indian Movie of all time.
","It has to be the most idiotic start to such a fascinating movie. You wonder where the movie is heading to when an airplane returns to base after a passenger(R.Madhavan) suffers a heart attack in an infirm manner. But Rajkumar Hirani soon gets his act and cast together to deliver a stunning product. Education is not about success; it's about pursuing excellence and doing what you are passionate about. In the end, success will chase you. This oft-repeated dialogue is beautifully portrayed in the climax. I have never laughed so hard before leaving a theater and you surely don't feel as a fourth idiot in the theater. <br/><br/>Take a bow Mr Hirani. 3 IDIOTS is a fantastic film, one that every parent, teacher and most importantly students will dig into.'All Is Well', will soon be a craze across the nation. Hirani this time looks at the education system. The respectable, mechanical ways in which education is imparted where students are like machines. The setting is a prestigious engineering college and at the center of it all is Aamir Khan, a genius student who likes to see some fun injected in the lectures. Hirani touches on student suicides; parents pushing students into a field they are not interested ; students silently trying to excel in something they are not passionate about and also human emotions of how when a friend fails, you feel sad but when the same friend tops in college, jealousy takes hold. All these aspects and more are beautifully woven into the screenplay.There is a twist too, to spice up things at the interval. <br/><br/>To get to the story, Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan) Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Rancho (Aamir Khan) are three united buddies. The film starts with Farhan and Raju getting some info on Rancho who has gone missing after their graduation. It's been (5-10) years now. It then moves to flashback. Where did Rancho disappear? Who was he really and what is he up to now? These questions keep you intrigued throughout the movie. <br/><br/>The music by Shantanu Moitra is excellent and dialogue's by Hirani and Abhijit Joshi very inspiring. Although Hirani does not take pains to establish the friendship between the three, you overlook that fact because there is lot of meat in the screenplay. The film has been inspired from Chetan Bhagat's novel Five Point Someone. To knock off almost 20 years and pass off as a 24-year-old is a herculean task, one, which the diminutive Khan does beautifully.I mean, you do not see any persona of the Aamir of old in any angle, in any shot, in any dialogue delivery. A complete, brand new Aamir. You look for flaws but find none. Truly, a mark of a genius. The odd way in which he walks with his feet slightly apart is a delight. Sharman Joshi is excellent too. Madhavan could have taken his role more seriously and tried to fit in as a college student. Kareena, though does not have much of a role makes an impact while Mona Singh who makes her big screen debut does not get enough scope to show her talent. The one who steals the show with Aamir is Omi, the over zealous student who mugs his way to the top. This character is simply hilarious. In fact, it's a serious focus on how most students actually are today. <br/><br/>Boman Irani as the college head for once is not loud and over-the-top. A clever make-up and twist of the tongue is what sets him apart from his other roles, which have become monotonous. <br/><br/>There are many scenes that will grip you and others that will have you laughing silly. Like the last scene and the scene at Teacher's Day when Rancho changes the script."

","I have watched this movie a lot of times and never got bored always enjoyed thoroughly. If we talk about the collections, many Bollywood movies have crossed its grossing though but, they aren't even close to its standards. Getting a 300Cr film in 2009 was not easy. Well, I know one should never judge by the collections but, sometimes when they cross a mark, indicates even the intellect audience is paying to watch it. The narration itself from Farhan's POV keeps you bonded with the movie. All the characters were so strong that you fall in love with them easily. You will only agree with me when you watch it. Simply, Raju Hirani + Aamir Khan = Masterpiece!!!
In one sentence - the best Bollywood movie ever! If you are into movies, then this one is not to be missed. The acting is incredible by the ensemble cast. The script is funny and at the same time. Even the scenery is breath-taking. Although the length of the film is pretty long and has some quirky musical numbers, 3 idiots is a delight.
It is worth the watch! I laughed! And I'm giving this a 10!"

","3 Idiots tells the story of three college friends; Rancho, Raju and Farhan. Rancho disappears after his graduation. When after years of absence a trail to his whereabouts emerges, the two friends set out to find him. During this road trip, the origin and history of their special friendship is told.<br/><br/>3 idiots is a typical Bollywood production with some songs and dance choreography's. The shots are wonderful and the movie breathes an atmosphere of 'joi de vivre' and playfulness. The casting of the main characters is on point and they seem to be enjoying themselves. The central morale/message that is conveyed in the flick is universally recognizable but put on way too heavy to my taste.<br/><br/>I must admit that I am not a frequent viewer of the Bollywoord genre, I came across the title reviewing the IMDb top 250 and became curious because of the high rating. Although the movie certainly is worth your while, I personally feel the rating is a bit inflated"

","10 years after finishing college, the two friends Farhan & Raju go searching for Rancho; a dear friend of them, who throughout college slowly made them realize what matters in life.<br/><br/>Rancho mysteriously disappeared shortly after graduation, and while driving from destination to destination in their attempt to find him again, the old friends reminisce of the years they spent with him.<br/><br/>In a society where the highest honor in life, for women are to become doctors, and men to become engineers, we meet the freshmen students at the highly esteemed college of ICE. Students at ICE all strive to become the best of the best, by following the norms & and endless repetition of the trivia in traditional engineering.<br/><br/>Rancho comes to the college as a free spirit, his mind always searching for alternative solutions, and his heart always thinking of others before himself; and from the very moment he steps in the door things start to change.<br/><br/>on their journey, Farhad & Raju are both reminded of the countless times where Rancho helped them to improve their lives, even if they did not realize it at the moment: like when his quick thinking saved the life of Raju's father, and when he after-wards would rather miss his exams than leave his friend in the hospital alone, or in his constant challenges against the ""system"".<br/><br/>His alternative ways and desire to help everybody ultimately wins over even his old nemesis, the college director Dr. Viru: by also saving the life of his daughter and newborn grandchild.<br/><br/>The title, the picture on the promotional posters, and the description of the movie made me expect a, perhaps forgettable, goofy comedy; something like the ""American Pie"" movies (no offense meant). But boy were I in for a surprise!<br/><br/>The story is very well told, the music is beautifully composed, and even though I didn't understand half of the lyrics; some of the songs are still imprinted in my long-term memory.<br/><br/>There are certain comedic aspects to consider, but what really stands out as my main impression of this movie; is how deep it manages to touch the subjects of social acceptance & friendship.<br/><br/>Well thought, deep & moving.<br/><br/>(The thing holding me back from rating this 10/10, are primarily some of the more goofy scenes, where you, for a moment, are ripped away from the thoughtfulness of the movie, and forced to watch an e.g. ""highschool-musical"" shower song) <br/><br/>But still: Aal Izz Well."

The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would unfold next.There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervals.

","I like Bollywood Films for the most part, and especially ""Like Stars On Earth"", ""Outsourced"", ""Slumdog Millionaire"", and ""My Name is Khan"", but ""3 Idiots"", while certainly entertaining and having a message that is a corollary to ""Taare"", it suffers from uneven storytelling, going from silly, broad, caricatured comedy one minute, to serious, realistic, highly emotional moments that elicit tears. Some characters are so over the top as to be almost Keystone Koppish, and others very genuine, and still others, rather inconsistent.

Besides, if you want to watch a film as leisure, well, this isn't a bad choice either! There are jokes (funny ones, not The Interview 2014 jokes) that make you laugh, like Rancho pretended to be a sheriff and warned Silencer that his life is in danger...if he don't aware the traffic while crossing the road. For me, my favorite part of the film is the ending, while Silencer discovered that Rancho is indeed Professor Wangdu. It is really nice to end a movie and it is really meaningful.

","A wonderful and uplifting if at times cheesy movie. This is quite possibly the first Bollywood film I've ever watched ---I am glad to have done so.<br/><br/>Suggestions:<br/><br/>This would have been a much better film had it been say 1 hr 50m instead of 2hr 50m in length. Cut back on some of the school and antics stuff. (But perhaps a lengthier film is standard in Bollywood? I do not know.) <br/><br/>The 10 years later stuff especially was good and should have taken up half the film rather than just one third.<br/><br/>All the suicides and suicide attempts were a bit too melodramatic and unbelievable. It'd be fine if it were really a reasonably accurate portrayal of school life in India---suppose say the average person attending one of these top schools is likely to be acquainted with at least one person who has attempted suicide primarily because of such matters. But I doubt there is anywhere in the world---even in India, China, Japan, Korea---where things get that extreme."

Will the sky rocketing expectation of the most awaited movie of the year be met? Can Mr. Perfectionist give his second Christmas blockbuster in a row? <br/><br/>3 Idiots does prove a worthy follow-up to the Munnabhai series for the Vinod Chopra- Rajkumar Hirani duo, and a sure-shot extension to the successful streak of Aamir Khan. This might not be '5 point someone' as Hirani promised, but it has all the ingredients to be 'Munnabhai 3' with several sequences, reminding us the classic tale of Laxmi Prasad Sharma.<br/><br/>The film won 40 accolades; among these are six Filmfare Awards including best film and best director, ten Star Screen Awards, sixteen IIFA awards and three National Film Awards.

","3 Idiots is a coming-age comedy and inspirational film directed by Rajkumar Hirani. The story of the film is similar to that of the famous novel Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat. This film is based on our Indian educational system which pressurizes the students and has an obsession for high grades. Aamir Khan as Rancho plays the role of a very bright student who motivates his friends pursue their passion and make a career out of it. R.Madhavan as Farhan who wants to become a wildlife photographer but was forced to pursue engineering because of his strict father . Sharman Joshi as Raju who is pursuing engineering with the goal of getting his family out of extreme poverty. Boman Irani as virus who plays the role of a strict college director who is highly competitive. Kareena Kapoor as Pia who plays the role of virus's daughter and falls in love with Aamir khan . The film goes very smooth. The film's first half includes ragging scene, confrontations with the professor, Chatur's speech and mournful meal at Raju's home. Overall the film depicts a very nice mingle of comedy, suspense and motivational. All the actors and co-actors done a commendable job. The music of the film was very soothing. The back ground music supports the film all through the movie. Overall depiction is fine. Some of the scenes are really emotional. Overall rating is excellent.Its definitely a one time watch."

","Amir Khan is known in Bollywood as Mr. Perfectionist. The movie lives up to his name. Amir does it differently than everybody else. He proved it time and again through movies like Lagaan, Ghajni, Tare Zameen Par etc. And in this movie also, it is Amir on whose shoulders the charm unfolds. This is about three students in India's top engineering college. Amir teaches us through this movie that one can attain all the satiable success and glory in this world as long as he chases his dreams. It is YOUR life so care less about what others have to say and believe in your own heart's voice. At times the movie is emotionally intense, for instance, when Raju (Sharman) tries to commit suicide, and it is also full of LOL moments, for example, almost all encounters of Rancho (Amir Khan) with the principal aka VIrus(Boman). To conclude, the movie is a complete package, arguably the best movie in the history of modern Bollywood. It earned over 200 crores in India alone, the first ever."

Editing was good...! 7/10 ... * ACTING: Its the strongest part of the film!...Its a curious n eventful journey about 3 Friends who got admidmssion to a reputed Engineering College n all the threes were shared equal spaces on screen...So, its difficult to choose the main Protagonist...!!! Mr. Perfectionist Aamir Khan did another memorable n well apprising performance as Rancho... Sharman Joshi sparked as Raju n i think he spent most time on screen with his spontaneous appearance... R.Madhavan as Farhan did an excellent job as well as a narrator n also an actor... Kareena Kapoor was always a pleasure... Omi Vaidya did an amazing debut to the B-Town portraying the character of Chatur (Silencer)... Others were perfect at their roles but the Antagonist Boman Irani was the best among all....He Viru Sahastrabuddhe a.k.a. 'Virus' stood out in every criteria of shades of acting n impressed the audience most...IMO, the character of Javed Jaffrey went impractial sometimes...! 10/10 ... * MUSIC: This film shines with it's melodious n lovely Music composed by Shantanu Mukherjee... 'Jaane Nahin Denge Tujhe', 'Behti Hawa Sa Tha Woh' n 'Zoobi Doobi' are my personal favorites... 10/10 ... In a country where students are driven to suicide by their impossible curriculum, 3 Idiots provides hope. Maybe cinema can't save lives. But cinema, sure as hell, can make you feel life is worth living...& this is the significance of the film...But, the message ""Success nahi,Excellence k piche bhago"" did not seem realistic at all n unable to accommodate with our modern Education system as well as our daily life...! .... Anyway, Kudos to the whole team of the film for giving us a gripping,entertaining,humorous Comedy film with some good messages...A movie to be cherished for refreshing everyone's mind...

","3 Idiots. The greatest director of recent times shows that cinema is magical. He shows, you can club the mainstream masala in a purposeful film flawlessly. All you need is directorial excellence and magical touch of Rajkumar Hirani, supreme performances by as many as six actors in a single movie; Aamir Khan, R Madhwan, Sharman Joshi, Omi Vaidya, Boman Irani and Kareena Kapoor, a story that touches all generations especially youth, a water tight screenplay which feels like a roller coaster ride of fun, emotions, pain, drama, thoughts and new ideas. There are numerous outstanding scenes especially the comic ones. Music might sound a bit below average but in movie it is used intelligently and never holds the fun for you.

The small mannerisms, the walk, the smile, the attitude, the brilliance of a young person who's not restricted by the educational system, his positive attitude towards every thing in life, it's Rancho you are looking at. Not Aamir. <br/><br/>Aamir's ability to transform himself convincingly from the super-huge well-built temporary amnesia patient on a revenge spree in Ghajini to this whacked out college student, which is half the age he played in last movie shows his prowess as a master actor to transcend age barriers to play almost every role in the book.<br/><br/>This is THE best movie of 2009. Aamir again reigns supreme. Thank you Raju Hirani & Vidhu Vinod Chopra.<br/><br/>Cliché word, but I have to use it - FANTASTIC !! 10/10 <br/><br/>P.S. Don't forget to say 'Aal Izz Well'"

","I liked this movie. I watched this more than one when it came on the small screen too. The humor was tasteful,the character scripting was very clever and combined with the story and acting, this movie became the second highest grossing movie at least for today. But the only problem with this movie was trying too hard to make it a romantic film. It was a smart and humorous film, but it lacked romance and sensuality. Th directer tried too hard to make it look sexy, by giving us a Gross out lip lock moment at the end, I mean seriously, there is no chemistry between Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor and putting a kissing scene taking these two actors was not romantic at all. Chuck out the gross romance and this movie is delightful Kareena Kapoor acted really well, unexpectedly she made me laugh at her dialogs and comedy expressions. She really looked like a Science student.The other two actors were the reason why this film was a hit. Boman Irani, you are the best comedy actor of the decade in Hindi cinema. Even when he tried to look like a monster, he was a funny and hilarious monster. Sharman Joshi ! he's good looking, soft spoken and a great actor. And Madhavan though had a very different role in the movie confused me about his sexual orientation here. Madhavan 's movies as I have watched before where he was a power house as a lead role, this time din't really have much to do."

How can a man act both like Rowan Atkinson in his latest movie and like an action hero like Al Pacino in his previous film (Ghajini). He's just irreplaceable.<br/><br/>And the movie's screenplay, Wow!!!!! I should admit that There is still 20 minutes left to watch. But I just couldn't be patient to write a review for such a lovely movie. It is just Laugh Out Loud Movie. I am not Hindi guy and still I can laugh at many places. Watching with subtitles and still not every dialog's are loading. Still I am Rolling in floor. One thing that squeezes my mind is that, how can a commercial action hero do such a comical role without any care about his ""IMAGE""? I agree, Akshay has already done it, but still, Isn't Aamir in a much more higher position than Akshay? (Am ignorant about Bollywood. So please adjust with it) Madhavan & Joshi had a very little scope in this movie I suppose. Yes, I still have 20 minutes left to watch. But I don't think that, this finishing 20 minutes will change my view from the previous 2:20 hours of the movie. This movie is planned to be remade in Tamil (my mother tongue). Sidharth of 'Striker' fame is doing Maddy's role. I don't think he would make some fortune with this character. But it IS sure, that Vijay of Tamil 'Pokiri' fame (which Salman remade in Hindi as ""Wanted"") who is doing Aamir's role, will hold back his Star value in Tamil Cinema after giving continuous flops.<br/><br/>Joshi's role is going to be done by Jeeva who is really a promising upcoming artist. He will be outperformed by Vijay in this movie which can be guaranteed.<br/><br/>Well, Its time for me to watch the remaining 20 minutes and enjoy."

","3 Idiots is a fantastic combination and fusion of comedy, drama, suspense and an unconventional romance.

I actually do not prefer to watch a lot of Bollywood movies but when something as brilliant as this comes along, I don't have a choice! The plot grabs you and keeps you tuned till the last minute. It's full of suspense too and has two time lines running in parallel.<br/><br/>The main climax of the movie will definitely surprise you but the standout points of the movie are it's comic scenes and dialogs and the message it gives out. The comic scenes are actually funny and will make you laugh out loud while not being stale and generic. The message it gives out about the education system pertaining in India today is spot on and accurate! And everyone wonders why it is a favorite amongst us students! The acting is top notch too and surprisingly even Kareena Kapoor acts decently! The standout actors are Aamir Khan for his role as Rancho and Boman Irani for his role as the crazy director of the college, Viru Sahashtra Buddhdev. He is one of the main reasons to see this movie!

","In a late scene from the film, 2 of the 3 idiots zip down their pants and pat their bottoms facing the third idiot. Rather than feeling gross at that instant, you have a lump in throat. For the zillionth time in a Hindi film, a bride runs away from the pheras on her wedding day. But the scene still doesn't come across as clichéd. For a group of all-male engineering students, to 'deliver' means to literally carry out a delivery operation on a woman in labour pain. And when the motionless newborn responds to a goodwill chant of 'aal izz well' in true-blue Manmohan Desai mode, you fail to find a fault in the filmi formula. That's the golden touch of Rajkumar Hirani.<br/><br/>So after successfully dispensing philosophies of 'Jaadu ki jhappi' in Munnabhai MBBS and 'Gandhigiri' in Lage Raho Munnabhai, Hirani incites a new philosophy of 'Aal izz well' in 3 Idiots. And like his doctrine, all is well in his helluva film.<br/><br/>Loosely based on Chetan Bhagat's bestseller Five Point Someone, 3 Idiots takes the plot much beyond the campus confines and the target audience much above the youth, for universal appeal. The story starts a decade after the graduation of college companions Farhan (R Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) who get a clue on the whereabouts of their missing third friend Rancho (Aamir Khan). As they set out on a road trip from Delhi to Shimla to Manali to Ladakh to find their friend, the narrative cuts to and fro into flashbacks as we are introduced to the three idiots in an engineering college.<br/><br/>Rancho clearly is different from anyone else in the college with his individualistic thought-process and rebellious attitude, which invites the ire of the college principal (Boman Irani) and affection of his daughter Pia (Kareena Kapoor).<br/><br/>Coming from Rajkumar Hirani, there was clearly a risk involved in the film's setting and characterizations for having a déjà vu effect with his first film. Boman Irani, as the principal, almost revives his disciplinarian dean characterization from Munnabhai MBBS which is more palpable with his disgust towards the rebellious protagonist, Rancho (akin to Sanjay Dutt) who is furthermore in love with his daughter (ala Gracy Singh). Nevertheless, Hirani's direction is so impeccable that without a conscious effort, the analogy never strikes your mind and the scenario never looks repetitive.<br/><br/>In his trademark style, Hirani grabs your attention from scene one with an unconventional opening to the film. Thereafter every single scene written in the screenplay (by Hirani and Abhijat Joshi) is not just relevant but also has a clear set objective – to be funny or be deeply poignant. Which means it either makes you laugh or cry and at some superlative instances do both simultaneously (which is an achievement). The writers have kept absolutely no room for any intermediate option."
"sghnmbjb","10","0","5","10 January 2010"," The Best Bollywood movie I have seen for a Long Long Long Time
","""3 IDIOTS"" is in my books on of the best Bollywood movies ever made over the past 20 years. The only few movies which come close to matching this are Gadar, Humraaz and Kaho Na Pyar Hai.<br/><br/>I am a bit biased about movies from 2000-2004 period since the BEST bollywood movies came in that period. After 2004 I was increasingly becoming Disheartened by movies which were coming out lacking any reality, screenplay, direction or story.<br/><br/>Before 3 IDIOTS I saw the movie ""Blue"" which signifies what I was talking about.<br/><br/>But 3 IDIOTS has broken all my problems. Bollywood is back with a BANG in making BRILLIANT MOVIES.<br/><br/>And 3 IDIOTS is BRILLIANT, simply and spectacularly BRILLIANT.<br/><br/>Aamir Khan has done it again. This will be his biggest hit since 1989 Starrer QSQT!.<br/><br/>The storyline of the movies represents Contemporary India where Parents decide the future of the children right from birth to selecting careers to even selecting Brides!.<br/><br/>This movie tries to show the unfortunate problems caused by it. Invariably Indian children destroy their careers by the same Parents unknowingly.<br/><br/>Second this movie clearly shows the ""R0T IN THE Indian EDUCATION SYSTEM"".<br/><br/>Indian education system was created by the British to create PEONS and not THINKERS.<br/><br/>The result was the though India got an Army of Engineers and Software professionals (and more recently army of MBA holders).....India was not able to innovate or produce something of SUBSTANCE since that required THINKING.<br/><br/>But unfortunately the Indian education system destroyed the aspects of THINKING among its students.<br/><br/>3 IDIOTS clearly shows the Problems in Indian education system and the need to change the attitude among professors and parents alike !!.<br/><br/>3 IDIOTS is a must watch **********STARS."
"monty_lnct","8","0","5","31 December 2009"," aamir did it again...........
","I waited for 3 idiots more than any movie in my life and watching this movie was a good experience.this movie have all things that a young audience want from a movie. movie raises questions on our education system and our mentality.<br/><br/>the story is based on three friends who got admission in engg. college,and become room mates in hostel.the main character rancho is a very funny and creative boy who do things in its own way and don't care about the system.everyone called them idiots because they were different from others.<br/><br/>This movie was full of fun from beginning to last,not a single lousy moment and did not loose it grip for any time. only at some moments there is lack of maturity and lack of depth in some scenes where they could do well.even they use all the old stuff and jokes but did it very well.<br/><br/>movie was very well adapted from novel""five point some one""which is one of my favorite novel.all actors acted very well specially aamir khan and Omi Vaidya(who played funny boy chatur).<br/><br/>rajkumar hirani did the good job,the movie was not better than munnabhai mbbs to me but still good movie.<br/><br/>this movie cannot be counted as a masterpiece but still i will give it 8/10."
"ranjana-ahuja","9","0","5","31 December 2009"," Awesome movie! Must watch!
","A fun filled movie that takes you back to your college days and at the same time touch upon the age old topic of over-burdening education system in India. I loved it and this a must watch bollywood flick of 2009!<br/><br/>Aamir Khan looks unbelievably cute in this pic and his collection of Tees is awesome! And Sharman Joshi is as adorable as always! You will get some memorable comic dialogues out of this movie - especially the one comparing dhoklas with missiles :) Views of ladakh towards the end are very picturesque. Everyone acted really well and Boman Irani did a commendable job as 'Virus' - director of college. Even though the movie is longer than usual you will not be bored due to fast pace and never ending funny acts of 3 idiots! MUST-WATCH!"
