"Brian Scott Mednick","9","986","1077","12 February 2001"," ""Requiem"" Is a Heavyweight
","You will not so much as want to take a sip of wine after watching this mesmerizing film about the horrors of drug addiction.  I was not a fan of director Darren Aronofsky's debut film ""Pi,"" but with this movie he proves to be a filmmaker of unlimited vision and style.  Four characters in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn are all driven to despair due to their drug abuse, the saddest being Ellen Burstyn as a nice Jewish widow who unwittingly becomes addicted to prescription diet pills that help her lose weight but drag her into a world of hallucinations and paranoia.  Burstyn is superb. It is so refreshing to see such a great veteran like her in such a challenging leading role, one in which she goes through a hell worse than that in ""The Exorcist.""<br/><br/>But this is a director's film if there ever was one.  Aronofsky knows how to tell a story in a way that is dazzling in its use of sound, editing, and cinematography.  The score by the Kronos Quartet and Clint Mansell is the most striking movie music I have heard in a very long time.<br/><br/>""Requiem for a Dream"" is not a movie for everyone.  It is the essence of independent filmmaking, a daring, engrossing, artful film that stays with you long after you leave the theater.  Hollywood bubblegum this ain't."
"Danfish","10","622","684","30 January 2002"," Like being repeatedly punched in the back of the head by Mike Tyson
","It's difficult to know what to say about Requiem For A Dream. I first saw it in the cinema when it was released in England and I have never seen an audience react to a film like this one. The climactic sequence, where the protagonists are effectively destroyed by their addictions, seemed to trigger a bout of heavy breathing in the audience. As it was ending I heard a few people crying. My girlfriend and I didn't say a single word to each other on the bus home.<br/><br/>I bought the film on DVD the day it came out, but it took me around six months to watch it again. And only then because a friend of mine was curious. If anything, the impact was heavier than the first time I watched it and I've vowed never to watch it ever again.<br/><br/>Yet I have still awarded a rating of 10 on imdb and would definitely assert that it's one of the three greatest films I have ever seen. Why? The acting is just amazing. Jennifer Connolly gives the best performance of her career (not too tricky considering the movies she's been in) and remains stunningly beautiful (in a haggard sort of a way) and noble even when she's roped into a gang bang to fund her heroin habit. Jared Leto annoyed me intensely in Fight Club but he's perfect as hapless junky Harry - forever exuding an air of kindly incompetence that endears him to the audience but that will ultimately destroy him. Marlon Wayans is equally brilliant - wearing a beaming smile for the first half of the film and a compelling look of confusion and betrayal for the rest of it.<br/><br/>As for Ellen Burstyn... never has an actress been so unfairly cheated out of an Oscar (and I've seen the atrocity that won Marcia Gay Harden that Oscar for). She is just the picture of sadness the whole film through - a heartbreaking example of what loneliness can do to vulnerable people. The scene where she complains to Harry about being old is honestly one of the most tragic things I've ever seen and it makes me want to break down just thinking about it.<br/><br/>As such, I can only recommend this incredibly important movie with certain reservations. If your favourite film is 'You've Got Mail' steer well clear. If 'Snow Dogs' has been your most thrilling cinematic experience of this year then put this film back on the shelf. Trust me, it'll save the costs incurred by those expensive therapy sessions.<br/><br/>However, if you believe that cinema is an important tool in helping us understand ourselves and that we will only achieve self awareness by plumbing the absolute depths of despair and self-destruction then you must watch Requiem For a Dream."
"eric226","Null","1740","1947","25 November 2002"," Awful and Essential
","I'm not going to waste space with a synopsis, as every second or third review provides one. A good indication of a challenging and original film is the number of 1/10 and 10/10 reviews, where the 1/10 reviews consist of just a few lines.  A pretty sure sign that those folks weren't able or willing to watch with an open mind.  Which is a good sign for casual viewers to give this film a wide berth.<br/><br/>I wish everyone I care about would see Requiem for a Dream.  Not because they will like it, or that it will teach them something they did not already know, but that it's a rare piece of work that will challenge and probably change them.  It's a film that has never been made before, with nothing to compare to it - a rarity these days.  I often find myself recommending films to people that I am unable to briefly describe.  These are usually the most involving and affecting ones. I'd like my family to see this, but can't *recommend* it to them.  I've recommended it to two friends, and they both had the same reaction:  I am glad I watched it, but I doubt I'll be in the frame of mind to watch it again, knowing what you feel.<br/><br/>As I sat watching the credits roll, I began crying, but I'm still not sure why.  Partly in reaction to the devastatingly tragic ending, partly the beauty (yes) of the film, partly my gratitude for good things in my life. I watched it again the same night with my girlfriend, not because I wanted to upset her, but I felt that I had to share it. After the credits rolled, we both were silent for a good ten minutes.  I found that I had thoughts I wanted to express, but could find no words.  This is one of the few films that are painful to experience, but I feel compelled to share with people I care about.  Some others in that short list include The Thin Red Line, Happiness, River's Edge,and The Deer Hunter.<br/><br/>These films all share a quality that's difficult to name.  No one likes feeling disturbed or shattered by a film, a work of art, a piece of music, but I feel experiencing these emotions and being asked to think, not just be entertained, is important now and then.<br/><br/>""Favorite"" does not apply to this for me - this isn't about entertainment. One of the most devastating and beautiful experiences I've had watching a film.  One of the top five films I've ever seen."
"dropthehammer2000","Null","448","506","12 November 2000"," Disturbing, Graphic and Great
","I went to this movie hearing plenty of buzz about how graphic the content was. Over the course of the movie you see just how Aronofsky wants to send his message to the audience. The characters start off with somewhat mild addictions and then next thing you know the four main characters are living in hell. I couldn't believe how low they all fell. This movie may be the greatest anti-drug message of all time. I dare anybody to watch this and to not be touched and frightened by these characters. Before the movie started I noticed the audience was quite loud and garrulous, but as it ended and the credits rolled the whole place was stone cold silent. It was amazing.<br/><br/>As a whole I felt the movie was excellent. The visuals were well done and the editing was outstanding. The actors really put themselves into their roles. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly had very good chemistry, while Marlon Wayans showed he is a talented actor and not just a talented comic. Ellen Burstyn. Wow! She was amazing. I can't believe an older woman would allow herself to be filmed like that. She has some serious guts. Hands down the best female performance I've watched this year, not even close.  I was totally amazed by her.<br/><br/>All in all, I would say Requiem For a Dream is a great movie. It had a profound impact on me and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I watched it on opening night. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. This is a movie everyone should see, but unfortunately not enough will."

","being someone who had a history with drugs, i found this movie to be slightly more than ground-breaking. i saw this film in the midst of a downward spiral, and it turned me right around! having friends with the same plans, such as sell drugs to buy more drugs..it made me look at my life and theirs and see exactly what the future had in store. <br/><br/>now, every time i see this movie since escaping that life, i cry. i cry for my past and those who still live in it. this movie has more to say to people my age than any drug education movie we were afforded in school. honestly, i wonder when the school systems will wisen up to what is really going to get kid's attention; movies that show that pros as well as the cons of drugs, or a movie that shows the complete and utter devastation drugs will bring to your life, and the lives of those around you. honestly, had i seen this film before my sophomore year of high school, i would have never even dreamed of taking more than the prescribed dose of advil. <br/><br/>granted, my little summary or comment of this movie does not entail anything informative about the movie itself, i must say, i feel this is the best way i know to express my views."
"murkyfish","10","529","603","29 March 2001"," Downer Picturesque.
","I just saw Requiem For A Dream and I have to say, I was blown away. Not since 1995's The Basketball Diaries, has a film so accurately portrayed the craving and depravity of a person dealing with(or succumbing to) addiction. It is a beautifully articulated piece of artwork, intricately presented on a silver platter. Director Darren Aronofsky shines in his brilliant direction and style, in this depiction of the downward spiral of the lives of four people, living with their respective addictions.<br/><br/>Jared Leto, gives an excellent, solid performance as Harry Goldfarb, a man living an inch from his life, always in search of a fix. In an emotional powerhouse of a performance, he proves to audiences that he can shine through in a major role as opposed to previous smaller roles in Fight Club and American Psycho. However, it appears to be a Hollywood in-joke of sorts in that it seems he has a penchant for mutilation or at least the roles he seems to take on seem to have for him. In Fight Club, he had his face rearranged and in American Psycho, his head cut off. In Requiem however, it is the mutilation of his life, his whole character, that takes centerstage, ending in a satisfying climax of gargantuan proportions in which he gives the audience more than their money's worth in his power-packed performance.<br/><br/>However, the real star of the film lies in the talent of Ellen Burstyn. Audiences will wonder at her appearance at the beginning of the film, not really knowing if it is, in fact, her. Her performance as a television, sugar and eventually, diet pill-addicted mother of Harry shows that she's still got it after all these years. If you want to make a comparison of her thespian skills throughout the years, watch the revived version of The Exorcist. She can only get better. She takes on the role of Sarah Goldfarb with gusto, never backing down for a second. Totally throwing herself into the role, you tend to forget how she really looks like, given only fleeting moments in the film which suggest her real appearance. I have to say, she's got guts. How many female actresses her age would dare to have a camera strapped to her person(as Aronofsky so creatively did), an inch away from her face with a wide angle lens? She definately deserves her Oscar nomination, if not, the Oscar itself, for her tour-de-force performance.<br/><br/>The other characters themselves hold their own with the two abovementioned powerhouses. Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans both realistically portray their respective roles as Marion Silver, Harry's girlfriend and rebellious suburbanite chick, who degenerates to prostitution for her fix and Tyrone C. Love, Harry's best friend and fellow pusher. Here, Wayans shows that he can lose his comic edge if needed, to portray a boy trapped in a man's body, just yearning for his mother's approval but seeking it instead, in drugs. Connelly as well, who has been taking on smaller roles and projects over the last few years, is finally given enough room to play with her character and gives a winning performance in Requiem.<br/><br/>The cinematography of Matthew Libatique gives total light on the chracterizations of the people in habiting Aronofsky's sick world, from the sliently flickering sick-green flourescents to the exaggerated wide angle shots and the beautifully sad and haunting Coney Island picturesque of the pier which suggests a certain beauty amidst all the sadness and depravity. A Downer Picturesque, as portrayed by the photographs of Robert Frank and the Frank influenced cinematography of Darius Khondji in Seven. In my books, Matthew Libatique has just joined those ranks.<br/><br/>Jay Rabinowitz' editing stands out as well, with in-your-face smash title cards(emphasising the downward crash of the character's lives through the seasons), as well as the close-up constructions of the drug taking process. The latter sequences, edited so tightly and seamlessly, make the moment so beautiful but so fleeting, as is the case with drugs. The sequences are almost like a drug, making you crave for more of them, a fix which you get, whenever the characters get their own fix in the film. Lots of people might misinterpret this as glamourising the drug culture but these moments are so fleeting that they're over before you even know it, and then it's back to Harry, Marion, Sarah and Tyrone's sick and depraved search for the next fix, which very accurately portrays the twisted quest of a true and sincere addiction.<br/><br/>The film is also superbly scored by Clint Mansell and hauntingly performed by the Kronos Quartet. A series of hauntingly shocking, yet mind-numbingly beautiful pieces which linger in your head long after you've left the cinema.<br/><br/>Lastly, the direction of Aronofsky, brilliant, beautiful, empathic. There are not enough words to describe his direction or this film and I think the best way to say it is that I am speechless. Aronofsky has shown me that, jaded by so many films, something can still prompt me to sit up and take notice. To see something that I have never seen before or learn something I don't already know. The ending, is sheer power. A masterpiece of all the elements of what filmmaking is about, mixed together in some sick souffle and thrown into your face, burning hot and scalding. The film leaves a deep impression, in fact, a huge scar. And it is a scar I am proud to wear."
"tdao360","10","774","901","30 July 2001"," Brutal, honest, and a must see movie
","This ranks up there as one of the three most powerful movies I have ever seen in my lifetime (Full Metal Jacket and Grave of The Fireflies being the other two).  This movie shows the brutal honest side of addiction and over-indulgence.  Not just drugs, although it heavily shows drug addiction. Also shows how one addiction can lead to another and how damaging it can be for you.  I watched this alone, and felt so stunned afterwards, I had to call a friend just to calm my nerves.  Seriously, this is a brutal (one more time)  BRUTAL film.  The acting is wonderful - Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely are just wonderful in this movie, and Marlon Wayons was such a shocker in a serious role.  Everyone must watch it, for it's entertainment value, and more importantly, it's educational value.  But it leaves chills down your spine for it's honesty and unforgiving lessons."
"Drakkhen","10","325","375","8 November 2000"," Absolutely Heartbreaking
","I had been looking forward to Aronofsky's follow-up to his critically acclaimed art-house film, Pi, of a few years back and when it did finally open in 1 theatre in Toronto, I gathered a bunch of friends to go down and see it.  Some have never even heard of Pi before.  For others, this would be their first Independent film experience.  However, coming out of the movie, we all agreed that it was one of most powerful piece of contemporary cinema that anyone has seen.<br/><br/>""Requiem for a Dream"" tells the story of 4 people, connected either through blood or some kind of personal relationship, whether it be family, girlfriend, or business partner.  Although the characters lived far from what you and I would consider to be normal lifestyles, they shared something in common with each and every member of the audience; hopes, aspirations, dreams.  Sara Goldfarb (played so wonderfully by Ellen Burstyn) dreams of one day being on a TV show, and one day, gets her chance.  She fantasizes about how she could wear her favourite red dress, that she wore to her sun's graduation, on television.  However, upon trying to wear the red dress, Sara discovers that she has gained some weight over the years and tries desperately to lose her weight, eventually resorting to medication.  All of the characters have drugs (the bad kind) affect their lives, which eventually take over their lives.  The movie documents how for each of the 4 people are effected and eroded by drugs.<br/><br/>The look of the film is extremely  stylized, but justifiably so. Aronofsky uses surreal imagery as a vehicle for realism, something that really works when done well, and done well it was.  By using a combination of slow and fast motion shots, extreme close-ups and more edits than you can shake a stick at, Aronofsky successfully brings the audience into the world and mind of someone with a drug problem.  The audience visually experiences first-hand what it is like to be 'scared' or 'high' - all this in 3rd person; all this in the comfort of the theatre chair.<br/><br/>Of course, all of this effort would be in vain if it didn't mean anything at the end.  The film leads the audience down a spiral of addiction until the grand finale, which features a montage of graphically intense scenes and images with more edits per second than any film.  The pacing at the end, when compared to earlier parts of the movie, was so fast I started to find it hard to keep up, and literally took my breath away as the credits came up.  All in all, the effect was amazing, and something that I have not personally experienced when watching any film before.<br/><br/>As the title indicates, ""Requiem for a Dream"" does not contain a happy ending.  It is in no way optimistic, and only gives the audience faint pieces of hope and happiness.  However, It does show what desperate people are willing to do, and how desperation will change someone's life to its entirety.  It is in the recognition of desperation where hope lies."
"jewinda","Null","657","800","18 June 2001"," The film-making quality is secondary- this film makes you FEEL
","Often hype about films lead to disappointment and after waiting 14 months after release for my local cinema to show this film, I was done thinking about it. Thank goodness too, rather than challenge my brain (not hard to do unfortunately) this film went straight for the heart, ripped it out and kicked it around the floor for 90 minutes. As the addictions plunged further into the depths of Hell, I felt myself more and more arrested by the film. I've never left a film shaking or feeling physically ill- not including Pearl Harbour, of course :)  You want to look away, but cannot.<br/><br/>This movie is by no means flawless, but then again I would like to hope that the flaws add to the gritty reality of the film. The ending was truly the most frightening thing I have ever seen in film- forget the cheap scares of The Exorcist, Psycho and the endless bile of the 'slasher flick', this stuff is REAL.<br/><br/>In a country amid a 'war against drugs' this is a powerful film which could do more to turn kids away from drugs than any measly government ""task-force"" or classroom lecture."
"Rusty-61","Null","220","264","17 November 2000"," Good Lord!
","I was tempted to title this ""Drugs are bad, mm'kay?"" because ""Requiem"" was so sad I was desperate to inject some humor. Man, what a sad, scary, excellent, grim, disturbing, well-made movie. The more I read about RFAD and learned, the more fascinating it seemed. I'm one of those people who, upon hearing a movie is extremely shocking, has a burning urge to see it as fast as possible to see if it shocks me (especially unrated or NC-17), since I'm pretty jaded. So, I eagerly anticipated seeing it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I read so much about the making of the movie that I knew a little too much about the plot going in, so there were few plot surprises. ""Requiem"" concerns four addicts. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly play a young loving couple, Harry and Marion, who dabble in heroin and plan to make a big sale with their friend Tyrone (Shawn Wayans) so they can be set for life and Marion can start her own business. Their recreational drug use turns into day-to-day addiction, and things start to get ugly. VERY ugly. Ellen Burstyn plays Harry's mother Sarah, a lonely widow who wants to lose weight to fit into a red dress to appear on her favorite TV show. She starts out addicted to TV and candy, but has the bad luck to visit a doctor who-in what I thought was the only unrealistic aspect-gives her an RX for 'diet pills', that turn out to be speed. I say unrealistic because, as anyone who's ever worked in the medical profession knows, few doctors will write a new patient a huge prescription for extremely powerful, addictive controlled substances without even an exam.<br/><br/>I found her story thread the most memorable and heartbreaking. Sarah takes her pills and starts losing weight, plus suddenly becoming energetic and chatty. Like any addictive drug, her happy blue pills stop working after prolonged use, so she ups her dose more...and more...and things slowly start getting very weird and scary. In one of the best scenes midway through, Harry visits her --the only visit where he doesn't openly steal her TV to pawn for dope. He's briefly riding high (in more ways than one) and announces he bought her a big-screen TV; he wanted to do something nice for her and figured out that ""TV is her fix"". He looks uneasy when she's babbling happily about how she has a reason to get up in the morning, then he hears her grinding her teeth, and figures it out ...the first time in the movie you see real fear in his eyes. Sarah soon starts having very scary strung-out hallucinations-starting out with subtle things like time woozily slowing down and speeding back up, and when her refrigerator suddenly starts moving on its own, the real nightmare begins. An aggressive fridge may sound Monty Python-esque now, but trust me, you won't be smiling by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>One review I read said that the movie not only pulls the rug out from under you, it drags you and the rug down a long flight of stairs into a very dark basement. Another reviewer compared the experience of watching the film to a drug, and that's not too far off the mark either. Whenever a character gets high, there's a slam-bang fast-cut montage of the same images over and over; a sigh, a pupil dilating, cells changing color. The description I probably agree with most came from Aronofsky himself; he compared the film to a jump from a plane without a parachute, and the movie ends three minutes after you hit the ground. The last few minutes that show the gruesome, depressing, worst-case-scenario fates of all four characters are just as intense, hard to watch, and nightmarish as I heard they were. I don't think I will ever forget Harry's mother's transformation from a harmless, plump, friendly older woman to someone so frightening looking that people cringe away in fear and revulsion at the sight of her.<br/><br/>My only complaints would be that I wished there was more time for character development. The film is divided into 3 segments, Summer (things going fine, having fun getting high) Fall (the beginning of the downhill slide) and Winter (end of the line). I would've liked more scenes of what these people and their lives were like before addiction, as well as their relationships with each other. The cast is stellar- Wayans shows that he has the most range and talent of the Wayans bros- I laughed so hard at him in Don't Be A Menace that I ended up buying it, but here ...wow. I would've liked to see more of his character. I never liked Leto much before, but he's excellent and also almost unrecognizable (he dropped 1/5 of his weight for the role and oh, it shows). Connelly I actively disliked before, but I was very impressed and now know she can act. Burstyn gives the performance of a lifetime- not only convincing, but dedicated enough to let the filmmakers make her look like absolute and total hell; few actresses over 55 would probably be as fearless.<br/><br/>Not recommended if you're easily shocked, squeamish, or upset. If you only like movies that take you to a happy place, stay away. Everyone who left the movie theater looked like they had just been hit over the head with a very large board, and we all who knew what we were getting into. Recommended for those who want to see a movie that will completely overtake you and involve you emotionally. In addition, this film should be required viewing for everyone in the fashion industry that supported/glorified that whole 'heroin chic' crap. Also a good movie if you are having some problems in your life and want to put them in perspective VERY fast. 9 out of 10 stars. I'll probably never look at my fridge quite the same again..."
"bob the moo","Null","125","149","10 October 2004"," Great direction, great acting, great score, great script combine to produce a great film that is depressing but totally gripping even if it will not be to everyone's taste
","Harry and Tyrone are drug users who decide to try and make some money by cutting their cocaine and selling it on. This idea works very well and the pair start filling a shoe box with $20 bills  Harry even buys his mother, Sara, a television to make up for all the times that he used to steal her old one to sell it for cash. Sara has her won good news, after years of being an ordinary lonely widow she has the chance to appear on a television show herself and is actively dieting to try and fit into her favourite dress for it. With Harry's girlfriend pregnant but happily high, things take a bad turn when rival dealers start a war and dramatically cut the availability and up the price  forcing Harry and Tyrone to do whatever they can to get not only a fix but a supply to sell. Meanwhile, Sara's desire to lose weight sees her starting a regime of diet pills, morning, noon and night.<br/><br/>I came to this film with not even the slightest idea of what it was about but only that it was supposed to be 'good'. I was not totally prepared for a story that grabbed me from the start and delivered an intense narrative at breakneck pace with great acting, amazingly stylish directing, editing and production. While this onslaught will not be to everyone's tastes, I defy pretty much anyone not to be astonished by this film although I expect many will find it to be a pretty hard ride. The story sees four characters each getting into addiction and having it cause their lives to spiral out of control  and that's pretty much it. However it is not so much the story but the telling because it is the delivery that makes the film as amazing and compelling as it is; I don't want to oversell it but all aspects of this film come together perfectly. The writing is realistic and, although not containing the speeches that make a cast shine, is really well written and never strikes a bum note. The script writes highs and lows of addiction so very well that it is easy to forget that what you see in the film has come from a script and story boards.<br/><br/>Of course without the delivery then this would have struggled but it is blessed not only with good actors giving great performances but also average actors giving great performances. Burstyn is amazing  and I'm not overdoing that; hers is a fearless performance that is totally, totally convincing. Her descent is so tragic and involving that it is a major art of the story instead of the subplot it appeared it would be. Connelly is the next to stick in the mind, conveying a total peace and beauty when things are good but a terrible sweaty look of inner agony on her face as she degrades herself for drugs  an amazing performance. Leto is not someone I'm that aware of but he was good here and held his own well beside the two actresses. However the actual surprise of the film came from Wayans; I'm so used to hating him in lazy performances that I forgot he can act and he is good here  avoiding all the ethnic clichés that he usually does. McDonald is excellent in his cleverly used segments. It is easy to dismiss his performance as cheesy and easy but he does get it spot on (as the extras on the DVD show). Supporting roles for people of the recognisable likes of David, Baker, Weeks and Naidu only help.<br/><br/>Of course the main impact of the film comes from the relentless direction that not only produces a stylish product but also draws the audience into the highs and lows the characters experience as well as the repetitive rituals of their lives. He also handles the hallucinations really well  making them genuinely disturbing when they come have been silly. I cannot describe it very well but the direction really hits the nail on the head with heavy style and different techniques. Of course, some may feel that they have seen elements of it before and will say of Aronofsky that he has borrowed much of what we see  certainly the front mounted camera on the characters harks back to Mean Streets and Spike Lee to name two, while others will look at the reference to Dark City (even though Aronofsky) or claim that the hyper direction is Trainspotting X10! However to accuse him of just stealing is lazy and nonsensical because he weaves it altogether for the whole running time; this is not a rip off or a fluke, this is a talented director spinning style and substance. The score by Mansell and the Kronos Quartet is perfect and is a wonderful compliment to the images, increasing their impact and making the film feel fast and exciting at times, tragic and moving at other times. These are just two examples but the film is technically impressive  whether it be the different cameras, the make up, the editing, the use of mobile stop motion, it is all impressive.<br/><br/>Overall this is an amazing film but it is not one that will appeal to all audiences. It is bleak, relentless and a hard watch but it is worth it because it grabs you and refuses to let you go until the very end. The film has a simple plot but a great script that is delivered by a collection of great performances  in particular from Burstyn and Connelly. The direction only adds to Aronofsky's reputation and the original score is fantastic. I am rarely left breathless by a film but I was by this one and I honestly cannot believe that this escaped me for so many years."

","I respect and admire this movie, even though (and perhaps because) it is complex, occasionally irritating and often very hard to take.  Frankly, I avoided seeing it for a long time, but now am glad I did.  To complain that the film fails as a realistic portrayal of addiction is, I think, to miss the point.  Far from being the mere depiction of a collective downward spiral fueled by drugs, the movie is in fact a meditation on loneliness, greed, corruption, desperation, and the pervasiveness/banality of media, among many other things.<br/><br/>The subtleties of the text are communicated, first and foremost, by superb acting.  The performances of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are all revelatory.  In particular, I was knocked out by Burstyn, who is almost comically pathetic in the beginning, but who manages by the end to convey her character's utter devastation in the truest, most heartbreaking manner imaginable.  The others are absolutely perfect as well; I was simply astonished by Leto and especially Wayans (may he eschew ""scary movies"" forevermore).  Connelly has perhaps the most difficult role in the film, with opportunity and motivation galore to go over the top, and she delivers not a single false note throughout.<br/><br/>My only real quibbles with the movie have to do with certain instances of the split-screen and jump-cut techniques, which struck me as somewhat gimmicky and repetitious, respectively.  That being said, overall the style of the film is impressive and appropriate.   The cinematography is beautifully conceived and executed, and the score is every bit as haunting as the performances (thanks largely to the work of the Kronos Quartet).<br/><br/>In sum, regardless of whether or not the subject matter itself shocks you, this movie will put the viewer through the proverbial wringer.  Give it a chance, and you will connect with the characters and then witness their destruction (spiritual and otherwise).  It is a punishing but unforgettable experience.  I'm not sure whether I'd necessarily recommend it or not; it all depends on your personal tolerance level with regard to an unflinching portrayal of human nature and behavior at their most extreme and, ultimately, tragic.  For my part, while I don't expect to watch this film very often in the future, I'm sure glad it'll be on the shelf."
"j_mrf","10","298","384","27 August 2001"," Killer Performances by Ellen Burstyn...Darren Aronofsky: Stanley Kubrik has called for you to pull up a chair!
","Oh my, where shall I begin? Experimental film making bursts into mainstream in this dramatic tail of 4 people who find themselves spiraling down the abyss, after experiencing a rendez-vous with the inevitable consequences attributed to drug use and the ill effect it has on its addicts. This one has no happy ending. There's no sugar coating here. Albeit this film packs a harsh, blunt, and sometimes overwhelmingly genuine depiction of the havoc drug addiction can reap on its victims. Despite the disturbing message of the film, I never the less couldn't help but remain fascinated with it's experimental/avant-guard visual style: A smooth, elaborate and languid progression of cinematic eye candy orchestrated to almost resemble a shockumentary, complemented by an impressive and well composed soundtrack. Some of the visual techniques were similar to the ones Aronofsky used in his directorial debut ""Pi"", such as split-screen shots and the use of body cameras filmed at varying speeds. At times, the film seemed more like an acid trip than a feature film. A cry for help is clearly felt throughout the film, from its innocent and promising start, to its hauntingly chilling conclusion. The one scene that really blew me away was the scene where Marion (played by Jennifer Connelley) had just sold her body off for a bag of heroin...As she walks out the door of the apartment, along the corridor, into the elevator, down to the street: one can't help but feel the characters disgust with herself, filthy to the core, what it must feel like at...""ZERO"". The acting performances, especially by both Ellyn Burstyn and Marlon Wayans are simply breakthrough performances that earned critical acclaim across the board. Enough said. If this review alone does not compel you to experience the Film, I will just have to spell it out: PLEASE EXPERIENCE THIS FILM - it may cause an uneasy stomach, but is well worth it - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! 11 out of 10."

","Well, I´ve seen ""Pi"" and was fascinated. Now, there´s ""Requiem for a dream"" and my expectations were very, very high. That can be the downfall for a movie, but in this case I wasn´t disappointed. Aronofsky proves not only that he can direct a ""bigger"" movie, he also shows how one can do so without selling out. To be more precise: ""RFAD"" is one of the most disturbing and depressing movies that came out of the US for a looooong time. From the opening scene to its final curtain it´s...well, a requiem for the characters, who are all perfectly portrayed by their actors. Ellen Burstyn is unbelievable. The power of her performance can only be compared to that of Björk in ""Dancer in the dark"". Aronofskys direction is even more experimental than in ""Pi"" and some of his ideas, like his combination of sound and picture are really innovative and give his movie a musical feel -without creating a long music video. On the downside, you could say that this movie offers no hope, no solution - but then, this would´ve been a lousy compromise."

","Disturbing' gets a whole new aspect with Darren Aronofsky's `Requiem for a Dream,' a horrific film about the descending spiral of drug addiction.<br/><br/>Not since Stanley Kubrick's 1971 classic `A Clockwork Orange' has a film made me feel so awkward, until now. `Requiem for a Dream,' Darren Aronofsky's follow-up to his 1998 cult indie `Pi,' is basically the closest thing you are going to find to a nightmare on celluloid. It really accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is to disturb us with the downward spiral of drug addiction.<br/><br/>Does the film go far enough to maybe even scare some people straight? Yes! The story focuses on four Brooklyn-raised lives, Harry, played by Jared Leto, Marion, played by Jennifer Connelly, Tyrone, played by Marlon Wayans, and Sarah, played by Ellen Burstyn, in one of her top performances.<br/><br/>Sarah is a lonely, overweight, widowed, daytime television addict whose only perks in life are her television and an occasional visit from her son, Harry (even though he's normally there to pawn her tv for drugs). One day, she finds out that she has been selected to be on television. Determined to lose weight and fit into her precious red dress again, she starts taking three diet pills a day. Before you know it, she's popping them down like M&Ms.<br/><br/>Around the same time, Harry and his best friend, Tyrone, are becoming very successful and prolific with their drug dealing on the Coney Island boardwalk. They begin to score pure coke and frequently get high, fantasizing their own dreams. Also through shooting up, Harry and his girlfriend, Marion, experience their beautiful love for each other, but by Fall, business begins to slow down and things take a turn for the worst.<br/><br/>The film takes place throughout Summer, Fall, and eventually Winter. The characters completely fall apart as do their dreams, loves, and health. The beautiful Ellen Burstyn becomes an emaciated monstrosity with these harrowing nightmares which eventually abolishes her saneness. Harry's inability to score well draws Marion away from him and into giving away her body for drugs. And Tyron's All of this leads to a finale that will send chills up the back of your neck and will refrain you from sleep for at least a week.<br/><br/>Everybody in the film puts on the performances of their careers, especially Marlon Wayans who shows us that, behind the comic idiocy of his `Scary Movie' stereotype, he is really a great actor. Still, even with the three other breathtaking performances, Ellen Burstyn steals the screen with her rendition of Sarah Goldfarb which earned her a Best Actress Oscar nomination and probably should have even earned her the award (sorry, Julia, but it's true). Darren Aronofsky shows us with `Requiem' that he could very well be the next Kubrick. To express the feeling of Hubert Selby, Jr.'s 1971 novel, on which the film is based, Aronofsky uses every filmmaking trick that he knows from split screens, hyper edits, speedy and slow paces, and even his famous snorriecam, which he made famous with `Pi.'<br/><br/>`Requiem for a Dream' is one film that should be shown in high school classrooms across the country to give kids nightmares about their futures with drug addictions. Instead, thanks to the MPAA, it has been rated NC-17 which restricts the age group of people from seeing it who sincerely need to see it the most.<br/><br/>Sure, sometimes it can all seem like too much (I for one could have lived without seeing the shock therapy scene), but it is all necessary to get the film's point across, making `Requiem for a Dream' more like a nightmare.

"Theo Robertson","10","43","66","27 October 2009"," Simply Put This Is A Masterwork
","I vaguely heard a few years ago that the director of PI followed it up by making a film based on a novel featuring drug addicts called REQUIEM FOR A DREAM . It got a couple of good reviews but I couldn't help noticing it took another six years for Darren Aronofsky to make another movie entitled THE FOUNTAIN which was one of the worst pieces of pretentious nonsense I ever watched . Still however the cult of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM grew and grew over the years . It is highly rated amongst the prolific voters on this website and has received almost aggressive praise from some quarters . And yet I had serious doubts to its worth as it was ignored by most award ceremonies and only received a very limited release in cinemas . Certainly I had no real intention of watching it until it appeared on a Sky movie channel . How good was it ? Let me put it like this - 72 hours after seeing it I still can't get it out of my mind <br/><br/>!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! <br/><br/>Aronofsky has made an entirely expressionist film . He expresses in visual form what the characters are feeling . This goes all the way back to almost a hundred years ago to a movement in Germany and since then we see influences in productions as diverse as the BBC serial of QUATERMASS 2 to Harvey Keitel's drunken sequence in MEAN STREETS but I can't think of anything where this technique is better suited than here where the mental as well as the physical disintegration of the characters take place . The technique may put off a potential audience but that's the point , the characters are going through a living nightmare that they will never recover fully from and Aronofsky conveys their misery totally <br/><br/>The director also brings a subtle in joke of semiotics . In THE GODFATHER before someone is killed the colour orange is prominent . In CHILDREN OF MEN someone is peeling an orange before they're killed . It's a subliminal code used in films but one that is familiar to pretentious film students and movie geeks . When the characters enter a drugs den the audience are shown a close up of an orange being peeled and then all hell breaks loose . Expressionism and semiotics in the same movie ? Not necessarily the work of a genius , nor is it the mark of a genius for noticing this but should still be appreciated <br/><br/>One criticism the film has is that it's rabid anti drugs propaganda . Such criticism seems to be missing the point since Sara is addicted to legally prescribed drugs - amphetamine based diet pills and barbiuates . It's not a subtle film but does make subtle points that the amphetamine has almost certainly caused Sara to become schizophrenic . Likewise much of the drug taking and destruction is fuelled entirely by self delusion such as Harry and Marion wanting to open a store funded by the money they made dealing drugs . One criticism that is possibly valid is that there's medical facts that are ignored such as electro convulsive therapy being used on a conscious patient or how limbs are amputated but Aronofsky has rightly ignored these facts in order to make a more shocking film <br/><br/>Make no mistake that this is a truly shocking film . Compared to this TRAINSPOTTING is a cartoon for children and no other film has ever portrayed the misery and danger of drugs so potently . Nine years after its limited release the soundtrack by Clint Mansell has become legend and rightly so . However REQUIEM FOR A DREAM itself deserves to become legendary amongst a mainstream audience . It is quite simply a masterwork and a film that whilst I'm in no hurry to see again due to its harrowing content is a film I will never forget"

","One of the anti-drug slogans in the 80s was ""Just say no,"" and it was given to us by not just the then First Lady, but by a slew of actors, many of them neck-deep into their own drug-induced binges fueled by too much money and a total lack of advice. If this movie had only come out then. Darren Aronofsky's powerful film REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is that ultimate slogan who never preaches its message: it just allows its presence to slowly filter itself into the images as the four people at the core of this story slowly begin to rot from the inside out as their ""dreams"" ultimately become replaced by the need to get high.<br/><br/>What begins as just another story of regular people living in relative complacency in Brooklyn, NY, each of them wearing their aspirations on their sleeves -- Sara Goldfarb to go on television; her son Harry and his friend Tyrone to make it big; Harry's girlfriend Marian to become an dress designer in her own right -- starts to go sour almost immediately. Sara, a widow living a lonely life, gets a call (or imagines it as it can be interpreted) that comes as a promise for things to get better: she will be a contestant in her favorite TV show which she watches compulsively as she downs sweets and to get slim for her Big Night she decides to take some ""diet pills"" to fit into her Red Dress. Harry and Tyrone experiment a little with the drugs they are selling and that leads to more and more and more. Into that web Marian is pulled, maybe out of her own displacement in the world, and since drugs passively target towards the displaced and the unwanted, making it all seem better -- we are informed that she is on the outs with her family even as they have given her full use of the apartment she lives in -- she falls under its spell.<br/><br/>One would think, though, that with drug usage things would change, perception would change. That we see Sara going through the motions not once, twice, but for hours and hours and hours on a stretch as the ""diet pills"" -- really speed -- take a hold over her is made more frightening when her own body starts cannibalizing itself and her own mind begins to wander. Her own security, her own privacy, literally becomes invaded one night as her own TV -- it in itself a source of addictive promises -- floods her own living room with a nightmarish game show that sends her screaming into the streets, Red Dress in tatters, a hag, still looking for her dream.<br/><br/>That we see relationships crumble -- Marian and Harry eventually become strangers to one another and any promise they will ever see each other again is hollow; Tyrone and Harry's friendship also collapses -- is only secondary to the power of storytelling and to the degrees that these characters descend in their addictions. At times it does seem too cruel to even watch: there is a sequence involving all of the character's final destiny that takes stomach to follow, but if the rot that addiction was still contained up until now, this final sequence -- the climax of the film -- lets all the pus out and sends it relentlessly out into the audience and not once are we let a moment's breath until it's over. There is a final, haunting sequence, one involving all of the characters crawling into a fetal position, destroyed beyond repair, that is heart-rending. These, after all, were once children and were safe (as Tyrone's last vision indicates).<br/><br/>The acting here is beyond all praise and material awards. Ellen Burstyn does what no actress yet has done in film history: push her physicality to extremes to convey an ordinary woman dehumanized by what she innocently thought were diet pills. She is a woman who could be anyone's mother, caught like a rabbit under a drug. All glamor and star ego goes out the window here -- and in doing so she single-handedly assured her Place in what is called being an Actress.<br/><br/>The same can be said with Jennifer Connelly in a role that could have been underwritten (and at times seems so) but in a move similar to Jennifer Jason Leigh she reveals herself so nakedly I'm almost sure her Best Supporting Oscar the following year was one a ""consolation"" award for being overlooked here. Both Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans come through with their lost yet sympathetic roles, Wayans more so, since we get that glimpse into his past and all he dreams is of being a good son to his Momma.<br/><br/>There is little relief but a painful compassion emerging from seeing REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. The Kronos Quartet and Clint Mansell create an equally tragic score (that has been used in promos for LORD OF THE RINGS), and contains images that already can be considered classic. Some may argue that Aronofsky goes too far with his message, but in doing so he strikes a nerve to anyone who sees this film."
"MaverickMind","7","82","137","14 August 2005"," Unique, but extreme, preachy, and overrated film
","This will likely be the most modest review you'll read of this film in the first few pages of a sea of 10s. I nonetheless, am convinced a 7 is the highest the film deserves. Aronofsky creates a unique film about the horrors of four characters spiraling into a chaotic conclusion due drug addiction. However, his reliance on creating an extreme, hyperbolic film undermines the movie's appeal. The film seems to be an example of pushing the boundaries simply for the sake of pushing boundaries, as no real message. It would be similar to calling a horror movie a 'classic' because the director showed a bloody decapitation after bloody decapitation or a romance movie being considered a 'classic' because it has 1/2 hour of real sex. Nonsense. The best films are the ones that leave the gory or gruesome details to the imagination yet leave you with an extraordinary impact and a message. I really got no message from the film which is heavily focused on torturing four miserable characters again and again....and again and again. What's the point? The four main actors in the film are phenomenal. Marlon Wayans surprisingly gives a stunning break out performance for someone known for starring trivial and mediocre pop culture comedies. He may have given the best or second best performance of the four. Jennifer Connelly gives a credible performance as a desperate and loyal girlfriend forced to do unthinkable sex acts. The actors strengths are their modesty and ability to succumb themselves to the most demeaning things possible.<br/><br/>The music of the film is memorable. The film has one main theme song, but it is the most memorable and haunting theme song ever I've ever heard. I downloaded it immediately after the film. The music emphasized the tone of the film.<br/><br/>The major weakness of the film, despite the great acting, are the characters. There's no bones about it, the characters are pure idiots. The fact that they're idiots leaves me little ability to sympathize with them, and I was trying my hardest. Furthermore, despite other reviewers efforts to paint them as ""tragic heroes"", the main characters are not heroes in any form. It's even a stretch to suggest that they're good people. For instance, Connelly's character initially seduces an older man simply to get money. Leto's character upsets his mother repeatedly by selling her television set. Yes, they all do this to subdue their addiction.. but the term hero cannot be thrown around aimlessly. They're simply dubious protagonists. Yeah, they try to aim to get out of the drug culture and start prosperous lives. The characters have great chemistry with each other, they are somewhat slightly charismatic, but they don't do anything remotely generous or pious in the film to warrant praise as ""tragic heroes."" <br/><br/>You can watch this film and immediately see the end coming. Part of you naively and helplessly hopes the film takes a sudden right turn into brighter pastures, but that is simply not the case. Aronofonsky might tease you in the beginning, but he brings you to the most overly dramatic conclusion like a car crashing into a brick wall. Ironically, while many critics bashed 'The Passion' for overemphasizing torture and maiming of Christ again and again and again and again over other aspects of Christ (and rightly so, that film has its flaws as well), it surprising these critics praise similar methods of repetitive ""how can it get any worse"" torture done to rather shady characters nonstop.<br/><br/>I'm not saying this film needed a happy ending to be a good movie. But if it has a tragic ending, it should have a message. If it's just ""don't do drugs"", than that's a grave disappointment and waste of time for a supposedly deep experimental film.<br/><br/>To his credit, the director utilizes a neat and impressive artistic style known as ""hip hop montage."" The surreal spinning directing was a doozy but a great asset to the film.<br/><br/>This film I guess is worth a watch once. But once is only time I've seen it, and I'll never sit through that film all the way through again. Period. I'm pretty confident in saying that most of those ""10s"" people have only seen it once and will make an excuse not to see it again. The only people who will see this film again are overly depressed and eccentric, pessimistic types.... A classic has to be more than a overly nihilistic novelty act."

","""Requiem for a Dream"" is a film about addiction and the capacity it has to destroy lives. The film explores this idea through the following of four different characters, addiction all gripping them and acting out its malice in distinct ways. Aronofsky produces a highly emotional snapshot into the lives of these characters, and masterful camera work and creative shots display it in full. Aronofsky's use of timelapse, close-ups, and various other imaginative tricks allow the viewer to enter the perception of a drug-fueled mind; which in turn produces greater empathy for the characters as they embark on their downfall. The world Aronofsky creates is deprived and suffocating, prompting the viewer to understand or perhaps reconcile the characters' desire to escape. The acting by Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are true and imbued with vehemence. ""Requiem for a Dream,"" is a difficult movie to watch, but is worth viewing on the basis of the quality of the storytelling."

"NestorForjan","1","341","628","28 November 2002"," Apparently, making sense is optional if you have a split screen.
","It baffles me how Aronofsky has managed to fool audiences and critics to rave about not one but two nonsensical stories in the last few years. If you manage to keep your cool under the barrage of imagery thrown at you from frame one you should be able to spot plot holes in this film so large that they'll make Pi's nonsensical ending look like plausible narrative.<br/><br/>What bothers me most with these, apart from the fact that they make this film essentially pointless, is that they are all there simply to justify some supposedly shocking visuals. I can't help it, I must provide a list.<br/><br/>
SPOILER SPACE (you shouldn't care, but it's the rules)<br/><br/>* * * * * *<br/><br/>1. Harry goes to a hospital to get his obviously gangrened arm cured. A doctor spots him as a drug addict and calls the police WITHOUT TENDING TO THE ARM FIRST. The weirdest thing about this is that the poor guy is later sent back to the hospital to have his arm cut off. The good part for Harry is that he should become a rich man in no time, after suing the doctor, the hospital and probably the police.<br/><br/>2. A dealer won't sell heroin for money, but he will trade it for sex. He could hire all the hookers he wants with the money he'd earn selling the heroin, specially considering he's the only provider for the whole city at that time. Still, all he wants is to see some lesbian sex live. Apparently, this is in the movie only to create tension between the lead and his girlfriend. Well, and to show Jennifer Connelly naked.<br/><br/>3. A previously healthy old lady is allowed to degenerate mentally to the point of being confined and given electroshocks without receiving any help, even though she's been shown previously socializing with many other people. For some reason the only person who realizes she's sick is his son, who doesn't care much for her anyway. Not that he does anything about it, either. Strangely enough, there's a shot of her friends waiting in the asylum looking worried while she receives electrical discharges without anesthetics.<br/><br/>4. Even though heroin can be injected practically anywhere, the lead will do it always in the same place. Even when the spot becomes a purulent wound he'll still do it the exact same position. Not an inch above, not in the other arm, not in a leg. Right in the middle of the wound.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>END SPOILERS (but there are more of these, believe me)<br/><br/>You know, I wouldn't worry about plot holes that much if the filmmakers had set out to create just a series of disgusting images to show them around. The thing is they didn't. They made an attempt to create something vaguely resembling a storyline, they even had a shot at a subtext. They simply failed miserably. Let's see, this film seems to be about addiction. The points made about addiction in the film are:<br/><br/>a) Many people have addictions of different kinds.<br/><br/>b) Addictions aren't good things.<br/><br/>c) Disgusting things happen when people let their addictions go out of control.<br/><br/>and maybe, just maybe...<br/><br/>d) With addictions at first you'll feel good, but then you'll feel bad.<br/><br/>So much for depth.<br/><br/>But we might also have some character development, right? We could neglect story and subtext and still have strong, compelling characters.<br/><br/>Just we don't.<br/><br/>Even the best of the characters we're shown is one dimensional and flat. Everything the characters are or do is put there to be dismantled later, which makes it all feel like a cardboard building in a Godzilla movie. It's fake and cheap. Everything. The leads' love story, the mother-son relationship, friendship between Harry and Tyrone, and between Sarah and the other women. Nothing feels real because Aronofski only cares about the next cool shot.<br/><br/>This film might get you distracted enough the first time you watch it and make you to believe there's some depth behind that nauseous feeling in your stomach. In the end, it's just empty imagery planned to create a nauseous feeling in your stomach.<br/><br/>If you want imagery go and see the latest summer blockbuster. It might at least be some fun."
"majikstl","1","143","257","22 July 2004"," Reefer Madness for the MTV generation...
","This is a film. This a film addicted to gimmicks. SPLAT! Any questions?<br/><br/>The pretentiously titled REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is a film that is dark, depressing, achingly dreary and laughably awful at every turn. It is like watching a drunk or an addict wallowing in self pity, only to have him interrupt his moaning and groaning with fits of uncontrollable laughter. You don't know whether to pity him, laugh at him or just smile and slowly back away. Nowhere else will you find a film so self-consciously solemn and meticulously constructed, yet so hysterically out of control.<br/><br/>The film is about the evils of addiction, so it is ironic that the director is hopelessly addicted to clichés and gimmicks. One thing for certain is that director Darren Aronofsky seems desperate to impress somebody. He's the kid with the thesaurus who can't turn in a book report unless he makes certain that every word is at least 10 letters long. Only now he's a film school kid who just figured out how to use all those cool gadgets on the camera. As such, REQUIEM is wall-to-wall cinematic tricks: split screens, split-second editing, fisheye images, fast forward, time lapse and oh-so many really nifty-crazy-weird camera angles. It all goes for that Oh-wow! factor. But when every scene is a calculated stunt, then no individual stunt has any effect. It's like an opera screeched in only one note or a room where everything is the same shade of blood red. The overall effect is shockingly effective only because it is all so unrelentingly unpleasant.<br/><br/>The idea, I suppose, is to clue us in on how hyper the world must seem in a drug induced haze, but that is rendered meaningless since the film goes hyper even during innocuous moments. Indeed, what passes for everyday reality is presented as being so melodramatically arty or intensely overwrought that at times Aronofsky has to resort to the overtly ridiculous to even get back our attention. By the time Ellen Burstyn, as a diet pill-addicted old lady, finds herself being terrorized by her refrigerator, the film takes on the air of a particularly grotesque skit from Monty Python. <br/><br/>Even worse than Aronofsky's taste for psychedelic overkill (apparently inspired in equal parts by bad MTV videos, trendy TV commercials and grade-C drug movies of the 60s), is the director's self-righteous arrogance in assuming he has something original to say. Drugs are bad! Gosh, who knew? But even the simple nobility of that sentiment is buried under the sludge of his technique. The fates of the four main characters is so extreme, and so extremely presented, that the film unintentionally trivializes the very lecture it so pompously presents. Their fates -- insanity, mutilation, prison and sexual degradation -- are presented, not with an air of remorse and pity, but as a manic cinematic freak show. This is REEFER MADNESS on LSD; scare tactic propaganda served up as if it were from a crazed evangelist. <br/><br/>I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but the poor actors are forced to overact just to keep up with the hectic pace of the film's stylistics. Lost between their obviously phony Nu Yook accents and bug-eyed emoting, there is little room for genuine characterizations. Indeed, the fact that any semblance of a performances even survives is remarkable considering Aronofsky's veg-a-matic editing style. There are poignant moments, however fleeting, when the actors reveal depth and complexity in their characters, but those instances of subtlety are brushed aside as Aronofsky rushes to get back to the grandiose surrealism. <br/><br/>Can there be anything more personal than an addiction? Yet, Aronofsky has made a film that is frenetic, yet cold and mechanical. This is a film by a filmmaker who has no faith in either his message or his audience. Everything is hammered home, amplified and repeated because the director doesn't think we will get it if he simply states the obvious. Had Aronofsky just made a simple little horror movie, maybe his gross-out/creep-out/freak-out stylistics might have been amusing. But he has tackled a serious social issue and reduced drug abuse to the level of being a Freddie Krueger bogeyman. I don't doubt the sincerity of his anti-drug rant, I just find it hopelessly condescending. It is film-making as shock treatment, designed to beat the viewer down to the point of vulnerability, exhausted and ready for brainwashing."

","I really can't see what's so great about this movie. It was a big disappointment to me. I really tried to like it but I just couldn't. I think after seeing the reviews on here my expectations of the movie was way too high. The first 20-30 minutes of this movie was incredibly boring, I thought that maybe it was just to make us get to know the characters so I gave it some more time. Then after an hour had passed I realized that this wasn't going to get any better. (somehow the same feeling the characters have about their own lives in the movie) It seems like the moviemakers didn't want to make a movie, they wanted to make a masterpiece. It's like the movie is saying ""hey look at me, have u seen anything better?!? Look at these cool camera-angles and these amazing close-ups. And I don't only look good I'm deep too."" Anyway I don't buy it. Just because you show close-ups of an eye and pills thrown into mouths it's not automatically a great movie. I'm not impressed. Anyway I've noticed that with IMDB the newer the movie is the higher ratings it gets. If you want to see a movie about drugadiction watch ""panic in needle park"" or the german movie ""christiane f"" both those movies are far better than this one (and rated lower). I don't hate this movie but I can't for my life understand how so many people can love it. I'm giving this a 1. That might be unfair but it's just as unfair as the 8.5 that it has on here.

","The real descent into the quagmire is the last 30 minutes of this film, not the characters within the film. According to this film this is what you can expect from drug abuse: 1. Being force-fed in a public hospital (have these people heard of the IV drip?) and then ECT without any form of anaethesia (every bone in that woman's body would have shattered)- did they take her to a hospital in Eastern Europe?? 2. People with severe septicaemia will be denied hospital treatment and thrown into a cell on suspicion of being a drug addict until they require amputation.  Watch and learn - it's fine to be a junkie as long as you don't get caught. 3. A man will be allowed to vomit into food being prepared in a government run correction facility. If you are bad, you eat vomit. OK? 4. A middle class chick will end up on the other end of a black dildo in order to feed her drug habit. Yawn... I mean, this film says more about what kind of overblown morality Americans are willing to accept in films than anything about drug abuse or its consequences. The anti-drug message descends into hyperbole and farce and I found myself laughing hysterically where I was supposed to be shocked and repulsed. Give me a break. These sanitised stories are just too ridiculous.  As well as this, we are offered the same old, same old routine of white-powder-imagery and colourful-pill-popping. These guys injected something and were bopping around the place, next minute they snort something and they are all on the nod...go figure? And please, the heavy handedness of the junkie losing an arm...spare me, I am not that easily shocked or unaware of symbolism-overkill."

","Remember the anti-drug commercial where a girl points to an egg, says, ""this is your brain,"" and then screams, ""this is your brain on drugs!"" as she smashes the egg with a skillet and proceeds to demolish the entire kitchen, screaming, ""and this is what drugs do to your family, this is what they do to your future..."" and so on?<br/><br/>If you can imagine that commercial going on for two hours, done with great visual style and editing, with acting that ranges from excellent (Ellen Burstyn) to terrible, you can skip this movie. While Requiem for a Dream sells itself as an important movie about important subject matter, it does nothing to explain why REAL PEOPLE do drugs. Its characters are not people. They suffer without reflection on their own states, while the filmmaker attempts to bombard you with visual symbols explaining what they want and feel. While one could interpret the device used to explain why the Burstyn character continues her downward spiral, the game show, as a meaningful symbol for individuals' desires for acceptance and recognition, I don't think it is one. It is a gimmick that condescends to the character by making her desire for acceptance pathetic and silly. The movie tells you what to think about her inner motivations by staging them in a highly subjective way.<br/><br/>This way of revealing character is consistent throughout the movie. Characters are without interior lives, or at least their interior lives are not revealed. At the same time, the movie uses symbols (the game show, the television, etc...) to suggest the reasons for their desires. While real people do drugs for complex reasons which are hard to unravel, these characters are living in a movie-world symbolism which suggests familiar, ""important"" reasons for their behavior that tie into the most materialistic, shallow aspects of our society. And of course the shallow, cheap aspects of our culture are harmful to us all, and we recognize them in the movie. So despite their lack of depth, is not hard for us to relate to these characters, and maybe even feel sorry for them, since they exist only as empty vessels into which we may pour our own self-pity."
"charlz_manson","1","61","109","15 June 2001"," The triumph of form over substance ranks as audience abuse
","This movie struck me as utterly phony, which was surprising as Aronfsky's prior film, ""Pi,"" was amazing. Never once, from the very beginning, did I believe I was watching anything but specific actors play-acting. Ellen Burtsyn's thick slice of ham cut close to the bone was embarrassing, and her New York ""Jewish"" accent coming in a film released in the year 2000 struck me as outrageous! I mean, are we going back to ""The Goldbergs"" and 1950?<br/><br/>
The whole film struck me as ersatz, artificial -- it had this 1950 junkie sensibility of Selby grafted onto this ""hip hop"" style that was simply jarring. The screenplay, which was co-written with Selby, was so predictable I began amusing the woman I was watching the film with by actually giving her the next line. I was right too often for comfort. The massacre during the dope dealing sequence in the back of the supermarket not only was telegraphed far ahead, but was incredibly STUPID. I did not believe the scene for a minute. Is it supposed to be a dream? I ask that as it has NO LOGIC.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest problem were the two leads -- Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly. While their acting was quite good, they looked like they had deplaned at JFK from Beverly Hills that very morning. Connelly is too good looking for the role (she does not look the part of a junkie; in contrast, Samantha Morton, who granted is a better actress, looks the part of a junkie in ""Jesus's Son""); a woman that looks like Connelly could be a call girl making many thousands of dollars a night, which made her ""descent"" into hell ridiculous. What is the problem with her character: she's just plain stupid?<br/><br/>
Leto looks like a male model. (There used to be an old joke when I was a kid: Funny, it don't look Jewish. Leto, whose character I assume is at least half Jewish, looks as pure Irish as Connelly; in fact, they look enough alike to be brother and sister, which I'm sure was intentional but which was downright weird.)<br/><br/>The ending, the denouement of the three main characters' stories, was so over-the-top that my friend and I began laughing out loud. (I will say, Burstyn was excellent during the harrowing scene of the force feeding. The look on her face of pain, humiliation and resignation was haunting -- a great moment in screen acting.) Just intercutting two of the stories, son and mother, would have been enough, but the sexual imagery and situation of Connelly's character was so evocative of a throwing everything in but the kitchen sink mentality, we just couldn't stop howling. I mean -- COME ON! I'm chuckling right now thinking of the scene. It certainly dissipated the power of the son's horror (though not that of Burstyn, due to the great control she displayed in her acting; perhaps Aronfsky should learn the value of SUBTLTY from that part of her performance).<br/><br/>I think people were wowed by the directoral pyrotechnics, but frankly, this film's triumph of form over substance ranks as audience abuse!"
"TxMike","Null","14","21","29 June 2001"," In the tradition of films like ""American History X"", and ""Boys Don't Cry"", a film that needs to be seen.
","""Requiem for a Dream"" is not a pretty movie, most of us cannot identify with the main characters, it does not allow you to feel good at any point, except maybe to think, ""I'm glad I never got mixed up with drugs."" <br/><br/>
I require the title of every movie to make sense, so examining this one I come up with, ""A musical service for the repose of the dead (requiem)"" for ""something of beauty or charm associated with dreams rather than reality."" And that perfectly describes the film.<br/><br/>SPOILERS... There are lots of people in this film, but it is the story of only four of them - Sara (Ellen Burstyn), who gets scammed into sending an application (with money, no doubt) for a TV appearance, then needing to lose weight, getting in with a shady diet doctor, eventually getting hooked on pills and turning into this monster of a person who no longer can relate to the world.<br/><br/>Harry (Jared Leto), her son, along with Marion (Jennifer Connelly), his girlfriend, and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), his friend, all get caught up in the drug culture.  He repeatedly steals Sara's TV set, wheels it down to pawn for drug cash, she goes behind him and pays to get it out of pawn. ""But he's my only son"", she pines when asked why she doesn't call the police.<br/><br/>They get wise, buy some good stuff, cut it, make a good profit, repeat the cycle, eventually hoping to get rich. But their ""habit"" clouds their judgement, they get screwed, they drive towards Florida to get more stuff, are arrested at a hospital stop 600 miles south of NYC, Harry has his arm surgically removed because of use-induced infection, Tyrone ends up in prison, Marion has to prostitute herself to get drug money, Sara has shock treatment and is never herself again. Each tragedy, each shattered ""dream"", a result of drug use. And the whole film is the ""requiem"" for those dreams.<br/><br/>I'm sure some of all these things happen some time, but in all I found this to be just a bit of a caricature of how the drug culture ends the functional lives, sooner or later, of all who get mixed up in it. Thus the title of the film.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly has always been beautiful, but as she matures is also turning into one of our finest female actors. Although Burstyn received the Oscar nomination, I think Connelly's performance was the best in this film. Like most of the ""mature"" voters, I rate it ""8"" of 10, unlike all those ""under-30"" voters who rated it ""9"" and ""10"" because of the ""gee-whiz"" factor, or maybe they could identify with the characters more than I can. I didn't always care for the strange way the movie was filmed, although much of it was necessary for telling this story. The first time I saw Tyrone running in the alley with the camera somehow attached to him, I thought that was neat and unique. However, as they used it for several other scenes, I began to focus on the camera technique rather than the story.<br/><br/>I saw the DVD. It has one of the most irritating menu presentations possible, using a test pattern raster with interference. Cute, but I soon found myself avoiding use of the menu.  However, the picture and sound of the movie itself, in Digital Dolby 5.1, are really first rate."

","My God! ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000), what a movie! It's always difficult to write reviews about perfect movies but I'm going to try. First, there are three adjectives which come to my mind to describe this movie and they're the ones which everyone thinks of: powerful, harrowing and heart-breaking and certain sequences remain engraved in the memories like for example, Jared Leto's wounded arm caused by drug.<br/><br/>To watch ""Requiem for a Dream"" is like being punched in the face. It's the kind of movie which can't leave indifferent. It is impossible to come out of this horrifying movie unharmed. It was made by a young director Darren Aronofsky whose previous movie ""Pi"" (1998) was very hailed. I must admit that I wasn't fully convinced by this indie movie but here, without a doubt, the director entirely hypnotized me and I thank him for that.<br/><br/>The movie was made from a novel written by Hubert Selby Jr. It isn't the first time that a work from this novelist is adapted for the screen. Indeed, in 1989, Uli Edel had shot ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"" which developed a nightmarish and apocalyptic vision of a mankind who lived in hell. Here, the movie focuses on 4 main characters. There's Harry Goldfarb. He, his girlfriend Marion Silver and his best mate Tyrone C Love plan to become high-rolling smack dealers. In the meantime, his mother Sarah Goldfarb has got her head in the clouds. She received a call and she learned that she's going to appear on television. At the beginning of the film, the 4 characters' hopes amazingly answers the shiny weather of the summer. But as we usually say: best things have an end. Summer will go away to leave place to fall and winter. Just like the dreams will slowly but surely shatter and the 4 main protagonists will embark on an endless suffering. A vertiginous descent into hell like we have never seen one and which will reach its climax in winter in the last half-hour of the movie. From this moment, the film presents a flood of incredible pictures; they are so painful so much that they make the view unbearable. However, you watch it flabbergasted with both repulsion and fascination.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky invites us to a climbing in the morbid. ""Requiem for a Dream"" strikes by its visual and sonorous frenzy. Through, accelerated frenetic sequences, hysterical split-screens, parallel images, the director doesn't pull his punches to describe this diving in absolute horror for the 4 characters. However, in his crazy making, there's none form of unwarranted nature. The features previously quoted may be disturbing but necessary to answer several things which aren't pleasant to hear like for example, to denounce the omnipresence of the consumer society. These abuses express themselves, here, by the crushing presence of objects, perfectly representative of this society like the television or the refrigerator. The another goals of the film: to make us share the physical and moral sufferings of a drug addict, notably through the deterioration of their visual and sonorous perceptions. But also to show us in a straight-forward and rough way, the dependence of a drug addict on his drug. Aronofsky's message is simple to understand. There's not only the drug like cocaine or amphetamines that make dependent but also simple objects apparently harmless which can become dangerous like the television or the refrigerator. They can destroy our faculties of reasoning and judgment. In a way ""Requiem for a Dream"" illustrates very well Brad Pitt's key cue in ""Fight Club"" (1999): ""things you own end up owning you..."". On the other hand, if we put the stress on drug, the least we can say is that the moments of shooting, the withdrawal times are showed with a realism and bluntness rarely reached. True, ""Trainspotting"" (1996) had already presented similar scenes but Darren Aronofsky isn't afraid to go further in daring.<br/><br/>It would be unfair to neglect the terrific cast. Beginning with Ellen Burstyn who in all respects gives a dazzling performance. She renders very well the degeneration of her character. In the beginning, she is a normal old lady but in the end, she looks like a senseless living dead. Why didn't she get her Oscar in 2001 instead of Julia Roberts in ""Erin Brockovich"" (2000)? Then, concerning Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly well their sensitiveness and fragility are impressive. But the biggest surprise is Marlon Wayans. Who could have thought that he could be at ease in a comic role (Scary Movie) as well as in a dramatic role? These 4 actors make particularly harrowing the very last sequences of the film which show them forever in the depths of despair or madness where pain, humiliation and misery suffer into them. And then, during the final credits, we can hear the sea with a little of relief as if we had just made a nightmare.<br/><br/>But what is extraordinary in Aronofsky's work is that he manages to find a little place for humor which acts in an efficient way. In conclusion, this young film-maker has shot a film with a real emotional power. I must confess that I almost shed a tear several times. ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a movie I highly recommend but beware! It's not a movie for everyone and for the spectators who didn't watch it, I advise you not to see it if you are in a sad mood. It demands a strong stomach and I think the people who say they weren't afraid during the projection are liars. Don't forget your handkerchief."
"Quinoa1984","10","20","33","22 December 2001"," A unique look at addiction by Aronofsky/Selby; it's the best DARE movie never made (or would be made)
","Mr. Aronofsky's Requiem for a dream definitely is unique- no other film I have seen on heroin and/or speed addiction has been filmed or acted like this. And it helps that I saw it again, because on a first viewing I looked more for the performances, and liked it, but didn't really regard the actual cinematic technique for it with as much un-equaled regard as many others have (at the time I considered it more of an MTV-styled take on a very powerful topic). But now watching it years later (2006 I mean, despite what the date of this comment says) I watch it, having gone through lots of other film-viewing experience, and I like it a lot more. In a way what's really mesmerizing and heartbreaking about the picture is that the contrivances are not based in the actual script or story- not that there isn't one or two that might be hard to not have in there- but rather a sort of fashioning of continuous cinematic contrivance. <br/><br/>In other words, Aronofsky pushes the bounds of everything that can be done with the camera and editing in terms of subjective-viewpoints, ideas through montage, and the power of abstractions in the realm of the main theme of the film- unattainable escapism. One might be tempted to compare to Eisenstein with the montage, but unlike him Arnonofsky isn't putting forward a political message, but a societal one. While the cinematography by Matthew Libatique and the editing by Jay Rambinowitz give the viewer the whole subjective, jarring view of what it feels like in the first person to do these dangerous drugs, some of the time, all this being says, it almost goes by too quickly (if you blink you'll miss the characters actually intaking the drugs, which are done in half second cuts). Not that that's a bad thing, and in fact the techniques used here, which include fast-motion, camera-strapped-on-the-front-of-a-person shots, odd high-angle placements, and wild array of things done that I still wonder how one could think them up, are quite ingenious. Only one scene on a repeat viewing- when Sarah Goldfarb (Burtyn) is going totally off the deep-end in her apartment with the TV show spiraling around her- doesn't totally work for me.<br/><br/>Also, it will be difficult for some people to view the characters in their dissension to demise. Bustyn, (who, if you still believe the Oscars to really be a mark of merit for true achievements, proves this to be false via her loss to the much less warranted Julia Robert) plays an old, lonely woman who dreams of getting on a game-show that she doesn't realize might not be real and decides her favorite red dress is all that matters for the show to the show. It's too small, so she goes to the doctor to get pills (uppers) and they do indeed work, but then she starts taking too, too many and ends up hallucinating that her refrigerator is moving (the first film to use a refrigerator puppeteer by the way) and then things start to spiral. This also goes for her entranged son Harry (Jared Leto) who is slipping into a descent into smack with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) who sleeps with other men and then some in order to get stuff when Harry can, and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans in his best performance to date) who is also descending, but might seem to have it not as bad as the others by the time the film ends.<br/><br/>But like I said, it is hard to view these characters falling deeper and deeper into insanity and desperation and all since it is also difficult to sympathize with these people. Yet, by the end of the film I almost felt like I was going to burst into tears not because I felt sad for the characters but more because of how powerful there journey led then to their destination. Like it or not though, this film begs for multiple viewings- and some extra years of looking at other films, which was the case with me. There is almost no room for true catharsis at the end, and nothing will ever be the same for anyone, especially as they're alive and lacking redemption (though if I had to place who's story is most compelling, and performance-wise as well, it would be Burstyn's)."
"tetsujin28","1","58","110","2 September 2001"," A complete waste of time disguised as ""art""
","Following up his pseudo-intellectual claptrap ""Pi"", Aronofsky gives us another example of his inability to direct anything other than an hour and a half long music video. And a poor one at that. Any comparisons to ""A Clockwork Orange"" are completely off the mark. While I'm no fan of that movie, either, I'll admit that Kubrick had talent.<br/><br/>Basically, rather like some other inexplicably popular movies, such as ""Boogie Nights"", this movie is akin to being stuck in a room full of crackheads for two hours, and we're supposed to find it not only interesting, but tragic. Sorry, but no go. I care not one whit for any of the characters in this movie, and wish they'd all just go away.<br/><br/>For me, this is the filmic equivalent of one of those books you get so mad at, that you just want to throw it across the room."

","There is already a glut of films on drug addiction. Filmmakers love this subject just as actors love to play mentally handicapped characters. In a comment on one of them, I plan to provide a survey of this and how addiction of the subject feeds the addiction it depicts. But not here, because what is interesting about this film is not that Aronofsky started with a notion of a world and might have successfully portrayed it. Rather the interesting thing is that he has a particular style of film-making that seems inflexible, and his problem is to find that one subject that is apt for the style.<br/><br/>Consider Terry Gilliam, the visual pythonista. He's very talented in creating quirky worlds with odd juxtapositions of props and sets. And he understands self-reference, the type found in British humor. But his overall sense of profundity is thin, and his mastery of narrative immature. So while his films are interesting in the sense that unlikely accidents attract attention, they are generally disappointing and messy. That is, until 'Fear and Loathing.' That's because the drugged mind is precisely composed of odd juxtapositions and weak profundities. And Gilliam's sense of self-reference (aided by Depp) is able to combine his condition with Hunter's. It works; it works well.<br/><br/>Now turn to Aronofsky. He comes from a different visual tradition, one where slicing and dicing is the rule. Its not so much what the camera sees but how it sees it that is important. His first product: 'Pi,' was a spectacular mess. That's because he assumed that mathematically induced hallucinations were something drug-like, and that mathematics was arithmetic, and that the connection between mystical cosmologies and axiomatic dissonance was something simple. No one noticed the lemonade-stand approach, because there may only be a couple dozen people alive who know uncontrolled mathematical visual worlds, and there is scant literature on this to be found.<br/><br/>Here, he turns to something that everyone thinks they know: simple erosion of the mind and will from drugs. Here, his cinematic approach is more apt. He shuffles, he jiggles and follows, he splits, he injects a repeating snap when the character does. Burstyn does an Emily Watson and completely bares her pathetic soul, and we are shocked at the supposed cost to her personally. The camera does succeed in intensifying the documentary feel, so the blur between character and actor is increased.<br/><br/>So both Aronofsky and Gilliam have now produced, with the aid of talented performers, the one decent film their styles can accommodate unless they mature. What then? Well, in Aronofsky's case, it could be to develop the other thing he has done here -- he has created a somewhat masterful narrative of frustrated dreams. Personally, I prefer the understatement of 'Stranger than Paradise,' to the continual beating of the obvious we have here. But the self-referential notion of the fabricated TeeVee image defining this woman's hopes, mirrored by the similarly fabricated Movee image defining (not merely reporting) the loss of those hopes shows a promising narrative mastery.<br/><br/>Let's hope he works on that for a few films and takes the Ridley Scott approach to growth on the cinematic side: do stuff you don't understand and develop the ability to adapt the vision to the narrative, not the other around. Not the other way around."

","first off, this movie is a bit repetitive, which is of course on par with the idea of showing people being addicted. (mother likes her chocolates a bit too much first (later on she turns to diet pills), her son and his friends are into harddrugs of various kinds) and all are constantly on the outlook for more of the same kind. the problem with movies about drug-addicts is that however alien their situation may be to a person watching it, the person still needs to feel compassion or have similar feelings towards them in order for the movie to 'succeed'. alas, no such thing here. the main characters (apart from the great acting mother) all look like the lousy but oh so trendy 'actors' you see in commercials or videoclips (there are plenty of references to both, but i can't think of a single one right now that wasn't a cliché or that wouldn't be beaten senselessly by the overall sublimeness of 'magnolia' or the freshness 'trainspotting' had at the time). so, the movie's protagonists are mostly 20+ year olds with nothing on their hands but trying to score and use drugs (and screwing even that simple given up). the characters just don't come alive for me and the obligatory postmodernistic/ nihilistic/ apocalyptic downward spiral which sets in is boring as hell to watch through even though (or just because) the whole thing is cut up much like a flashy videoclip. obviously so to hide the lack of insight on behalf of the makers (though i have to say here i absolutely loved 'Pi', aranofsky's debut which i rate very highly). the crappy finale was partly stolen from kubrick's overrated 'eyes wide shut' and it almost made me laugh because it was so unbelievably unbelievable to see the various plots develop as they did. on a more positive note, the soundtrack is great though, as was Pi's (nevertheless aphex twin would eat mansell any day of the week, kronos quartet or no, but the soundtrack is without a doubt the most intriguing facet to this otherwise one-dimensional fiasco) - go see terry gilliam's 'fear and loathing in las vegas' instead if you want a 'bad trip'. at least gilliam doesn't solely rely on clichés or gimmickry and even when he does, it always shows somehow that he doesn't take himself too seriously or that he uses the right amount of irony / cynicism, something mr aranofsky obviously has yet to master)."

","Requiem for a Dream is a very difficult film to describe, simply because it evokes some many emotions, which says a lot about the power the film has. The power can affect the viewer in different ways, and you really need to be willing to put yourself through what is undeniably a profoundly disturbing experience - as a lot of this film is quite graphic. However, since I'm always ready for a new cinema experience, I saw this film, and when it finished, it left me speechless, I was amazed at what I'd witnessed, and glad in the same way.<br/><br/>The director, Darren Aronofsky (of 'Pi', 1998), clearly knows the effects of certain addictions, and explores three peoples lives (that are in some way connected) from New York City, who have addictions of their own, and how these addictions cause the their simultaneous downfall. Most of them where blessed with a fairly good future in life, however this was completely destroyed after they began to rely on certain drugs to get along. These people are Harry (played by Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are a couple of small-time drug users who get an idea to become dealers themselves. Marion (played by Oscar-winner Jennifer Connelly) is Harry's girlfriend, who gradually gets hooked on their product. Sara Goldfarb (played by Ellen Burstyn) is Harry's mother who receives a call telling her she's won a contest and will appear on a popular television game show. She becomes obsessed with losing weight to fit into an old red dress and becomes hooked on diet pills, after several other diets she experiments with fail. These four fall so far so gruesomely into misfortune, basically ruining their lives...and how this happens is shown so very explicitly, yet it has a purpose, it isn't in any way trying to be pretentious or over the top, and it effectively displays the effects their addictions have had on them.<br/><br/>One of the many things that makes Requiem for a Dream great is its and extremely original visual style, ranging from those amazing signature looks, from rapid-fire montage editing to dizzying shots with the camera strapped to the actor's chest, to show the viewer what the actor may have been seeing during that certain scene. Another film that does a bona-fide job of holding the film up is the dazzling, emotionally powerful performances, especially from Burstyn, who received a richly deserved (!) Oscar-nomination for her performance, in fact, it may be her best performance, along with The Exorcist (1973) and The Straight Story (1999). Hers is the most touching character, the one who takes the highest fall, and the supporting performances from Leto, Connelly and Wayans, who all  I believed  merited Oscar nominations for their own great performances. I could honestly go on and on about what makes Requiem great, and powerful, but I really don't need to, I felt the whole movie was amazing.<br/><br/>All up, I will said Requiem for a Dream is an amazing experience, it had a profound impact on me (but it is all worth it), and I'm sure it will on you, if you see it, which I recommend you do some time soon! Definitely suitable for the most ardent fan of drama.<br/><br/>9.8/10 <br/><br/>See It if You Liked: Kids (1995), Basketball Diaires (1993), Girl Interrupted (1999).<br/><br/>-Luke Rowe"

","Yet another highly praised ""hard hitting"" film that turns out to be quite frankly rubbish. Clever editing can't disguise the fact that this turns out to be little more than ""Reefer Madness"" in fashionable clothes. As inaccurate about the drug milieu as it is about psychiatry (ECT is done on anaethetized subjects - but obviously that does not film as well). Abysmally written and acted - Ellen Burstyns performance is straight out of a 40's b-movie. Immature and flashy - which probably explains the quite ridiculous IMDB grading."

","While the trailer for this movie was seductive, most notably for its MTV-style quick shots from the film & music, actually watching it was an experience in torture.  This film is one big cliche. Perhaps US raver kids (born after 1980) who have never seen a good film might find this to be ""different"" & ""unusual"", but for anyone that's seen non-US or pre-1980 films, this film is one big bore. It's presentation of drug use is no more complex or realistic than the ""This is your brain on drugs"" PSAs that graced US television sets more than a decade ago. If you're into stream-of-consciousness & lots of style in your drug film check out  ""Naked Lunch"", If you're into the drama & humor of it all then check out ""Trainspotting"", or if you need a dose of pessimism & reality then check out ""Drugstore Cowboy"". Hell, even ""Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas"" is better than this mess. The acting is awful, especially Ellen Burstyn.  I was never convinced that her over-the-top performance was anything but acting....if you really want to see a food performance from her check out ""The Last Picture Show"".   What irks me most about the film is that its MTV-style quick cuts & soundtrack really mask the fact that there is really nothing to it.   I could have spent the 90 or so minutes I wasted watching it doing something more productive...like my laundry. By far the most boring drug movie I have ever seen.  Advisory: take some caffeine or amphetamines first if you want to stay awake to the ending."
"mk23232323","1","34","64","10 October 2006"," Absolutely one of the most overrated films of all time
","You know, the problem with this flick is that the director is really good, the actors are really good, but the plot is just too stinking far fetched. I mean, come on, a little girl on girl sex is NOT something to get really upset about. I mean, working in an office for a living is a LOT worse than that. There are literally thousands of women who do that sorta thing for a living.<br/><br/>And then there's the problem with the guy and his arm. First problem with that is that no junkie, NO JUNKIE, would keep shooting into a vein that is that messed up. Junkies are not that stupid. They have their own lore and protocols, that they pass to each other, and that includes using different veins. Aronofsky obviously has never met a real life junkie. And that crap about getting arrested out of a doctors office. ANYWHERE in this country, if a doctor refused him medical treatment, dang, even if a doctor called the cops on the guy, that doctor would get his ass sued from here to eternity. There's something called doctor patient privilege, they're not ALLOWED to call the cops, ever, under any circumstances, barring a direct threat to someone else's life. AND if the was imprisoned, denied treatment, and then lost his arm, attorney's would be lining up to sue not only the doctor, but the state where he was imprisoned.<br/><br/>SO, even if the the incredibly unlikely event that the junkie let his arm go that bad, then the astronomically unlikely event that a doctor would risk being sued and losing his license to practice medicine by calling the cops, and THEN the cosmically ludicrous event that the guy would be denied medical treatment by the prison, he would STILL have lawyers lining up for the fat 50% fee they'd get from suing all those people.<br/><br/>The movie is about as tragic as if they'd all somehow won the lottery and then been struck by lightening the following day.<br/><br/>Requim for a Dream is not depressing, it's laughable."

","Talk about a let down. I had heard nothing but raves about this one in the genre of ""drug films"", but when I finally saw it I realized that the raves were from raving lunatics. You might want to head to a fallout shelter if you're planning to watch this bomb. It only shows that a populace raised on the current standard of unrealistic ""reality t.v."", will buy anything. <br/><br/>Right off the top, the acting is reminiscent of an over-dramatized silent movie. Not easy to do when you have experienced actors like Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayons (whose performances while very good, become almost comical as a result of the script and the director's efforts). While Ellen Bursten does a great job of portraying Harry's rapidly deteriorating and lonely mother, for a film that tries to take itself and it's subject matter so seriously, the comedic aspect of her scenes seem very out of place.<br/><br/>The film's hysteria and sensationalism reach ridiculous heights. It's overloaded, absurd and unconvincing. Camera angles that would serve better in a music video make up most of the ""substance"" of this very gimmicky film. And don't get me started on some of the worst New York accents I've heard since I visited Kentucky.<br/><br/>If there's one positive thing I can say about this movie it's that it is very likely to dissuade the type of impressionable NAIVE young minds that could fall victim to the very real perils of serious drug use (most of which is grossly exaggerated in this farcical film). However those same impressionable minds are undoubtedly the ones that will believe this film paints a ""stark and real"" picture of what happens to everyone who uses drugs, without exception.<br/><br/>Overall, if you have never had a drug problem, known anyone in your entire life who has had one, ever used drugs, or heard anyone talk realistically about drugs, then maybe this is the movie for you. An MTV version of the ""real world"" from a junkie's perspective. It's not even amusing as the joke it ends up being. In the genre of drug movies this one should be filed under ""oregano""."
"rmax304823","Null","13","21","22 February 2003"," Innovative, Wow.
","The story of four people who get too much into drugs, it poses several questions, not all of them about drugs.  One of them is, how stylized can movies become before they are so thoroughly stylized that they lose their narrative roots?  It's rather like music in some respects.  At one end of the dimension, which I won't try to name, there is a simple tune like, oh, ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,"" which is easy to remember, fun to whistle, cute, and rudimentary (although Mozart did some very odd things with it). At the other, three minutes and some seconds of silence.  In movies, at the simple end, we can have, say, a one-hour film consisting of nothing but the same shot of the Empire State Building.  At the other end of the dimension we might get something resembling what one sees in a kaleidoscope while stoned.  (Or maybe we come back to the Empire State Building; maybe it's not a dimension at all, but a circle.)<br/><br/>This one certainly hasn't lost touch with the events it describes but it's pretty highly stylized too, as far as the direction, photography, editing, and sound are concerned.  Sometimes this stylization works to support the narrative and sometimes it doesn.  Sometimes it actually works against it. Example:  all of the drugged-up scenes are in fast motion, including those involving, not just speed, but marijuana and heroin.  The hyped-up action we get while Ellen Burstyn is on diet pills is evocative, peppy, full of accelerated business.  But heroin doesn't work that way.  And marijuana practically ablates one's sense of the passage of time so that, for instance, it sometimes seems to take half an hour to urinate -- so they tell me.  If you stop using speed abruptly you can get some wizard hallucinations.  But no one hallucinates on heroin, although this film suggests they do.  The result is that the stylization is sometimes over the top, not slowing down enough to give us a chance to take a breath.  It's nerve jangling and leaves the viewer a neural shambles.  The performances are fine, by everyone concerned.  In particular, Jennifer Connoley has by far her juiciest role and, somewhat surprisingly, is up to it.  Burstyn is excellent too, her accent pretty well Brooklynized.  But some of that shredding of sensibilities is unearned and unnecessary.  The editing is increasingly jumpy and shocking, though it never leaves us in doubt of where we are or who we are with.  The score is a blend of mostly scratchy, unpleasant electronics and ordinary sounds with the gain on high -- each pill accompanied by a ""plop"" on the sound track, each flick on a lighter by a ""pfft,"" and so on.  (Sometimes it sounds like a Popeye cartoon.)  The photography too is highly distinctive.  Fisheye lenses abound here. Cameras are fixed by harness onto an actor's body so that the actor's face and shoulders are immobile while the background seems to swivel around him and he walks and turns corners.  The effect is so disturbing that it keeps your eyes glued to the screen.<br/><br/>I found Aranovsky's earlier film, Pi, plan irritating and depressing because of the high-contrast photography and other directorially imposed effects. This one is depressing too, but less irritating because, despite the high style, a story is being carried, and the story is about characters we care something about.  They may be self absorbed, like the subject of ""Pi,"" but they're hardly self confident.  Their weaknesses are pathetic but entirely recognizable.  Ellen Burstyn wants to lose weight so she can look good in that red dress, just as she did at her son's graduation.  She pursues the cultural ideal of slenderness and youthfulness.  Her son and his pardners in euphoria pursue the cultural ideal of pleasuring one's self.  The drugs could be a neat stand in for the values that prevail in our community currently.  Why else, except out of a desire to look good, would people buy a three-hundred-dollar simulacrum of a rowboat and use it so regularly? Why else, except out of a desire to feel pleased with one's self, would anyone buy a forty-thousand-dollar ten-gallon-per-mile Suburban Assault Vehicle with a revolving machine gun turret atop it?  Hey!  Look at me, everybody, I'm young, beautiful, and happy!  Of course I can't figure out why I'm alive, but I don't ask myself that question.<br/><br/>This is an extremely innovative film, but the director has made clear his admiration of earlier movies, including ""The Panic in Needle Park"" (the same general idea), ""The Godfather"" (ominous oranges), ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" (""Feed me, Sara!""), and maybe ""Koyaanisqatsi"" (the acceleration of the cuts, tempo, and onscreen movements from moderato at the beginning to molto agitato towards the end).<br/><br/>It left me saddened and panting for breath.  I'm not sure I'd like to sit through it too often, but I certainly wouldn't have wanted to miss it."

However, when all is said and done, that's just what it is... an after school special."
"drtizza","2","36","70","18 January 2010"," This movie is undeniably, extraordinarily... stupid
","This is one of those films that everybody talks about as being so disturbing and shocking... well I finally saw it and I think it's neither.<br/><br/>First of all, it's utterly predictable. It's a movie about a bunch of drug addicts (one character is not knowingly a drug addict, but I'll get to that later). How do you think it's going to end up?! Either they sober up or go through a downward spiral, and the director chose the latter for all the characters to make you just think that ""Drugs are bad, mmmkay?""<br/><br/>Second of all, it's not realistic at all. So many places to start. I'll just break it down. 1) The 2 guys, on a drug-induced whim, make the decision to become dealers. And somehow these 2 (I repeat, 2) people rise up the complicated ladder of heroin trafficking, making tons of money in the process, making it look like a cakewalk, without the director showing any insight into what exactly they're doing other than a few 2-second clips of them standing on a street corner. That's just lazyness on the director's part in my opinion. To anyone who knows even the slightest about dealing drugs (not saying that I do), ""making it big"" is not an easy feat that 2 junkies can just start up.<br/><br/>2) The older lady on diet pills. Presumably these contained methamphetamines. It does not make sense that she's just permanently ""crazy"" from taking them. Sure, you get methamphetamine toxicity from overdose, causing hallucinations and psychosis, but this would have been corrected in the hospital after withdrawing the meth and giving Haldol. She was not on them nearly long enough to suffer any ""permanent effects"", the existence of which are even questionable. Regardless, Etc (Electroconvulsive therapy) would NOT be used for this. And even if they did use it, the patient would sedated, not wide awake. The director just threw this in for shock value.<br/><br/>3) The guy being sent to jail for his arm infection. This is illegal. A physician cannot deny someone medical care just because they suspect a criminal act. Even a serial killer who goes on a rampage and then tries to kill himself but fails will go to a hospital for treatment (with security present) prior to going to jail. And even if they do suspect a criminal act, it's a violation of HIPAA for the physician to just ""tell the police"" unless the patient is an actual threat to himself or others. There is tons of medical literature about IV drug users... they are a unique and special patient population that have their own needs. I gotta say the director really makes doctors look like a-holes. And the sad thing is, some poor junkie out there probably saw this movie and thought ""There's no way I'm going to the hospital if my arm looks likes that!""<br/><br/>4) Pupils constrict with heroin, they don't dilate like the film shows.<br/><br/>As for the ""shock value"", what exactly is so disturbing and shocking about this movie? The orgy/sex scene? First of all, you can find more shocking things on the internet. Second of all, I don't feel bad for Jeniffer Connely's character because despite how addicted to drugs she was, she still willingly CHOSE to go the dudes house and later the party. She know what she was getting into, and had other options.<br/><br/>That's it, I'm done. I have to say, I really enjoyed the cinematography in this movie and that actually makes it worth watching. The acting is great as well. But the plot/storyline is unrealistic making the whole thing suck."

However, I'm speaking in general terms because - warning - a couple of scenes are anything but fun to view. Aronofsky uses stop- action/fast forward techniques, sound effects, hallucination scenes, etc. all to make this a good movie for the senses.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn is outstanding in this film and many people who viewed this thought she should have won an Academy Award for her performance. Boy, if she doesn't scare you away from taking diet pills, nobody can. She's the only one in this film that is actually fun to watch. Jennifer Connelly can be one easily ogled by us guys but she plays so many sleazy, unlikeble roles, it's tough to warm up to her.<br/><br/>Jared Leto, meanwhile, does his best to show us the horrors of what could happen when you hooked on junk which involves needles. In the last 30 minutes there are a few horrifying parts as Leto's infected arm gets worse and worse. People who have seen this film know what I'm talking about, It is grim, very grim but maybe that's what all of us need to see once in awhile.<br/><br/>To watch Bursteyn and Leto slowly disintegrate is unforgettable and for Aronofsky to make this watchable was quite a feat.

","I saw this film for the first time ever just a year ago, and I was mesmerized. I've never seen actors throw themselves into roles the way the ensemble did in this film. Ellen Burstyn was simply amazing and heart-wrenching as the mother of drug user Jared Leto. She is a Brooklyn Jewish mother whose dream is to be on television, and gets it with a phone call that gives her a new-found energy for life. However, her favorite red dress no longer fits, so she turns to diets and eventually diet pills, which she becomes addicted to. Her son, along with his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and best friend (Marlon Wayans), are all addicted to heroin, and become sellers to make money for their dreams. They all become more and more addicted and begin to do whatever to stay in the high.<br/><br/>As I read the other comments about this movie, it is a stark difference in people. Some people found it to be a simply moving experience that they will never forget, while others found it unrealistic and crappy. All I have to say is here's a list of people who won't like this film: <br/><br/>1. People who have great health insurance and think hospitals and doctors are your friends and only want to help you no matter what; <br/><br/>2. Drug users (part-time or full-time) who don't think drugs are addictive and harmful (or in denial of it); <br/><br/>3. Sheltered people who have never done drugs in their lives and think it can't be that bad; <br/><br/>4. Brain-washed idiots who want happy endings and gumdrop smiles for all; and<br/><br/>5. Rich people who don't have to make money to survive the week, and can afford luxuries like food, health care, and vacations.<br/><br/>Anyone who knows about being poor and not having every privilege in life will at least understand the message of the film, and that is the power of addiction, loneliness and poverty, and how it can mess up your life and make you go after anything to change it, or at least to find that one little bit of happiness, a reason to get up in the morning.<br/><br/>I won't give away what happens in the film, but just think this: don't sit there and say situations can't happen because it's impossible and no one would EVER do that because of procedures and rules, because if you can't afford to be taken care of, you won't be. That's all I'll say about it.<br/><br/>To the haters of this film, I'm sure Hope Floats and Pretty in Pink are still waiting to be rented. Let the real people enjoy their movies in peace."

No such luck. This film is universally respected and adored for it's portrayal of drug addiction. Personally I found it to be the most jaw droppingly risible, ham fisted load of old cobblers since Reefer Madness.<br/><br/>Mother, son, friend and girlfriend all descend into their own hell over the space of three seasons. It begins with giggling and dieting and, within 9 months, ends in amputation, dementia, electro shock therapy, imprisonment (black boy in a Southern white boy jail) and the insertion of double ended dildos anally in a lesbo gang bang for a bag of smack. The novel (by Last Exit to Brooklyn scribe Hubert Selby Jr) was written in 1978, and maybe in those far off distant dark ages the events of this film could happen. I dare say they could today. But the combination of all these tales within a 98 minute/9 month span (and a fast edited final ten minutes showcasing the simultaneous final consequences for all participants) makes this a laughable, monotonous and ludicrous film whose audacious visual style only serves to make you feel even more patronised by its didactic hollering."
"mrtimlarabee","10","9","15","10 July 2007"," Devastating, grotesque masterpiece
","When I go to the museum, I am often awed at these still lifes from dutch painters of the 16th and 17th centuries. There were those beautiful still lifes, showing a vase of flowers down to the slightest detail. But oh, it would be the one that captured some sort of devastation or ugliness that would capture my attention. The strange thing was as devastating and grotesque one would be all the more beautiful and engrossing.<br/><br/>What is beautiful about such a painting is the thing that makes Requiem for a Dream such a beautiful film. A true artist captures what he or she sees, lives, or feels. If the artist fails to do this, then they create a sugar coated work. It is satisfying for the moment, but ultimately fails to leave a lasting impression. Too often, ""artists"" compromise their work for the sake of commercial success, painting ""beautiful"" pictures that are often too common in the field. Requiem for a Dream defies this by painting a grotesque, gripping portrait of addiction. Not once does Darren Aronsky flinch in creating this pictures. It is at time ugly, grotesque, sick, and devastating. But like a classic still life, you can't turn away as you stare at every stark detail.<br/><br/>What I love about this film is that you know your own in for a downhill ride when you begin the film. Jared Leto's character is taking his mother's TV to be sold to get drugs. This moment just scratches the surface of the downward spiral we are about to witness. Aronsky's characters suffer and never turn back. And nothing more need be said of Ellyn Burstyn's fantastic performance as she deals with delusion, drug addiction, and an addiction of a different sort, with the television.<br/><br/>The film has a big finish which is one of the most classic scenes in American film. Although I imagine most pointed towards this review have seen it, I dare not spoil it. It's the final detail in the still life. The one that makes you stare and stare - not so much at its beauty, but its sheer unrelenting truth."

","Requiem for a Dream is a movie that has its heart in the right place, but not much else.  Much has been made of the technical aspects of this film. And some of the technique does impress.  The rampant use of split screen very effectively, quickly, and cleverly underscores the selfishness of characters.  They are literally separated from one another within the film frame.  The repetition of certain elements--the rapid fire images that accompany every hit of heroin taken by the characters--is cool.  Less cool are these crazy point of view shots, lots of odd angles.  Why are they there?  They do not enhance the film in any way.  They are as pretentious and unnecessary as any technical thing in film this year.<br/><br/>The other thing about this movie is that I didn't care about most of it. Jared Leto Marlon Wayans and the girlfriend--sorry, can't remember her name--go through all these horrible things.  And we're supposed to sympathize, feel their pain.  Oh, look what drugs have done to those poor creatures.  But look:  these people are junkies and dealers, spoiled brats doing their own thing and paying the price.  As callous as it may seem to say this, they deserve what they get.  But look, here's the other thing. Aronofsky is so heavy handed and obvious about one fact--that these characters WILL BE PUNISHED--that it becomes almost laughable.  I mean, these are cliches that even most hacks would steer clear of.  Simplistic, naive, are the words I would use to describe Mr. Aronofsky's take on this whole thing.<br/><br/>He goes so far over the top--and he does this in the other main storyline, involving Ellen Burstyn--that he undercuts the potential power of his own piece.  It becomes a movie of bombast, a trite piece of audience manipulation.  Look at what drugs have done to this person and that person. I love that Aronofsky tried to make a really powerful anti-drug movie. But I hate how incredibly he failed."

Stuttering muttering and yelling, nothing happens but actors chewing scenery and a once-talented director indulging masturbatory fantasies. There's no there there. If drug abuse was merely an irritant, this film would have some small merit. But it's a problem with more depth than the filmmaker acknowledged. The director went off the rails for this overrated waste of time."

The performance of from Ellyn Burstyn as the loving but deeply troubled mother was absolutely mesmerising - deserving of the oscar nomination and in my view really should have won.
The cinematography and editing were were quite brilliant with a stunning soundtrack complimenting perfectly the mood and emotions on show.

I couldn't empathize with any of these losers, because they were flat, one-dimensional and pathetic.  Most stories of drug addiction give us some glimpse of a character's potential for success--their charm, their attractiveness, their intelligence, a successful career or academic promise--and then show it all going down the drain.  Or maybe we'll see why they turned to drugs, what their problems were, what they need to escape. Here we get none of that.  In this movie they start as loser/addicts and end as loser/addicts.  Everyone gets what he and she deserves.  Some initially neat camera and editing work that gets old very quickly--would've been cool in a music video, but that's about it.  Why does Hubert Selby Jr. have to end all his movies with women whoring themselves in especially degrading ways (cf. Last Exit to Brooklyn)?  3/10"

","I saw this last and thought it was total and utter crap.  The plot seemed entirely unoriginal, as if the screen writer thought that he could just borrow themes that had been presented in previous movies and novels(which had something to say about society not just a bunch of worthless junkies) and throw them over a bunch of rather unlikeable characters and boom, you've got an art house classic.  To throw the viewer off from this we have a bunch of fun and new camera tricks, some of which are also heavily borrowed from other films(Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction for example), but these eventually seem to get boring and repetitive, how many times do we have to watch a closeup of drug preparation, method of ingestion, dialated pupil. As for the performances Jared Leto can't compare to the better written and more likeable characters that are presented by Ewen McGreggor in Trainspotting and Leonardo DiCaprio in The Basketball Diaries.  The other characters are convincing enough but that really doesn't matter because by the end of the film I wanted all of them to put a gun in their mouth and end their wasted lives, especially during the way to long climactic montage of them all hitting rock bottom.

","This review is for those of you who have not seen this movie yet. Please, please, read it all! You may thank me, you may not. I'm not here to change the minds of those who think this is ""the"" gospel of movie telling. I made the mistake of buying the dvd before I had seen the movie because (A) the movie had amazing reviews on here and (B) it was only $12 brand new!<br/><br/>After watching Requiem for a Dream, Spun, Traffic, and The Basketball Diaries, I can safely say that this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I will first review this by comparing it to the latter films.<br/><br/>I acknowledge that alot of the techniques/effects in Spun were ripped-off from this movie, however after viewing both I find Spun to be [oddly] more disturbing than this movie [even though Spun is supposed to be somewhat satirical], and thus Spun does what it set out to do: show you 3 days in the life of a driver of a meth cook. Neither films are really worth seeing but I give Spun credit for making me cringe at the thought of drugs.<br/><br/>Traffic doesn't quite belong in this review, although in the drug genre and a great movie, it's more crime-drama and has a documentary-style-feel.<br/><br/>OK, now people seem to act like Requiem for a Dream, a movie about New York heroin addicts, has never been done before. Ha!!! Guess again, it has been done and 1,000,000 times better! If all the Leonardo DiCaprio haters can get over that hate for just 102 minutes, you'll see what Requiem should have been, plus it's based on a novel, which is based on the true life of Jim Carroll. It's one of my favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>As for Requiem...<br/><br/>[Possible spoilers coming]<br/><br/>It is hard to comment on the plot itself. What's the point of the movie? To tell you drugs are bad... but with unbelievable outcomes? It's a film that's more concerned with artful direction than content. Is Ellen Burstyn a good actor? Yes, but her character is too dimwitted to be believable. Secondly the mother starts using drugs after the son does. My guess from the movie trailer was: mom's a speed freak and her son picks up this behavior from exposure to it. Like a child raised in a bad environment is likely to pick up the same bad habits. Or monkey-see monkey-do, as is the case often in real life... Not so in this plot.<br/><br/>The <>fictional<> plot is mostly about 2 friends and a girlfriend running around trying to get a fix during a time when smack in New York is in shortage...haha ya right! Except its choppy and 90% of the footage is just scenes of people laying around in their apartment strung out, complaining and scheming.<br/><br/>The most coherently told story is that of the dimwitted mother, who receives a call out of the blue that she's going to be a contestant on a game show even though she never applied to be one. So she starts using speed to fit into a red dress to look good on the show, which was a prank call or something?<br/><br/>What's the final result? Mom ends up in a mental ward having shock therapy, son ends up in a hospital, having his arm amputated by doctors [in the most blood-splattering fashion, the likes we haven't seen since the chainsaw scene in Scarface] from an infection stemming from needle injections, friend ends up in jail, and girlfriend ends up doing dirty deeds in a gentlemen's' club. So this is reality? This movie is realistic? I think not.<br/><br/>If you want to see realistic and you are mature enough that you can do without jumping refrigerators with mouths, dildos, and blood-splattering amputations  folks, Requiem has it all!], please watch The Basketball Diaries.<br/><br/>The end."

","When I first heard about this movie, I thought ""nothing could be more heart-wrenching when it comes to showing the dark side of drugs than Trainspotting."" Man oh man, was I wrong! This film absolutely blew me away. It's one of those films that you just can't stop thinking about. The haunting images and emotions I felt during the film stay with me even at this moment.<br/><br/>Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly had phenomenal performances in this film. Their characters were so vulnerable that I couldn't help but feel the strongest compassion for them. Jared Leto's talent really shines through in this film. He proves that he can go beyond acting in a supporting role and really knock your socks off in a leading role. In the scene where Harry and Marion are on the phone when Harry is in the prison, I have never felt more sorrow while watching a scene. I also found the scene when Harry wakes up after having his arm amputated extremely haunting. Though it is extremely short, that scene really sticks out in my memory.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn steals the show in this film. I had never actually seen her in any other films, but after seeing this, I definitely want to see her more! The way she transforms from an addicted television viewer into a crazy, diet-pill addicted, ill woman was phenomenal. <br/><br/>The music in this film really added to its intensity. The theme song played over and over was absolutely chilling and literally made the hair on my arms stand on end. This film would not have been the same without it.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about how phenomenal this film was, but I am going to conclude with this. Requiem for a Dream is a MUST SEE. The direction and cinematography of the film was out of this world amazing and beautiful. I had never seen anything like it! It may be uncomfortable to watch, but it is an incredibly important movie. It is something everyone should watch. The story and the characters are so real that you can't help but feel pain for them. Although I do not believe doing drugs is right by any means, I was able to sympathize with the drug addicts and could actually relate to them (which I never would have imagined would be possible). All in all, this film changed my life."

","This is truly the most tedious, boring, trite, contrived and uninspired film I have ever had the misfortune to sit through.  It was so boring that I wanted to walk out of the cinema after the first hour.  My companion almost fell asleep. I felt nothing for the characters, who were not really established as rounded, believable people. Some of the visual tricks were repeated constantly and lost all novelty or interest after the first hour. At that point the direction of the plot also became utterly predictable and it just felt so horrendously repetitious. I felt like getting up and shouting at the screen ""Die, junkie! Die! Die! I want to get out of here! "", but I didn't want to disturb the other patrons.<br/><br/>***SLIGHT SPOILER *** I was also very offended at the way ECT Treatment was shown in the film.  The participant was fully awake.  Now I don't know about the U.S, but people are generally knocked out when they receive this treatment in the U.K., and have been for at least 20 years (I know someone who has had the treatment).  This is treatment of last resort for people who don't respond to any other kind of treatment. It is not perfect and can have unfortunate side effects, but has saved a lot of people from the slough of despond or even suicide. This was the last straw in destroying any limited respect I might have had for the director. He is just a purveyor of sensationalist claptrap masquerading as deep social comment. *****SPOILER ENDS****.<br/><br/>I don't care that it had a worthy theme - addictions are bad and can destroy your life. The theme has been trawled over so many times that we don't need another attempt, especially one as bad as this. Though it might shock and offend the very sensitive, it didn't shock me.  I didn't seem real for even a moment. If anything the visual tricks were wasted, because they just had a distancing effect. All in all, I can honestly say this is the worst film I have ever seen."

","In my opinion, the best movie that deals with the pain of drug addiction. Multiple aspects of drugs were covered, the dealer who isn't addicted, those addicted to illegal drugs, and the less emphasized in our society, addiction to prescription drugs. The 1st act introduces the characters, establishes what's going on, and introduces the conflict. Act 2 has the characters finding temporary solutions to their problems, until things get worse. Act 3 has the characters taking drastic measures to try and overcome but end up taking huge losses. The realism of the situations and excellent performances make this movie hit close to home whether you can relate or not. Having had friends who've spiraled out of control due to drug addiction, I know what can happen when people lose control to substance abuse. Ellen Burstyn's performance was was exceptional, you can feel her loneliness and angst right through the screen. The montage near the end depicting the descent to the very rock bottom for the characters was a thing of beauty. The camera work was excellent, POV shots, frame shots, hand-held, it all worked seamlessly to bring out the emotions. Definitely not a movie for the weak at heart, but a must see for anyone who likes movies that make you think and feel."

"tieman64","Null","18","38","17 May 2005"," Terribly one-note movie about drugs.
","Tricks and wizardry cannot mask a shallow plot. The audience takes a relentless pounding. The camera whirls, the actors vomit, lights flash and Jennifer Connley snorts crack. An hour and a half of cinematic abuse.<br/><br/>The film's point: drugs take many forms, destroy lives, are all around us and man innately possesses an addictive personality.<br/><br/>Millions of dollars spent making a movie that tells us that drugs are bad. With it's hokey game-show scenes and show-reel like gimmickery, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a Film School geek's wet dream.<br/><br/>That said, I think the film is slightly important. If the target audience is simply ""those who are likely to do drugs"" then this film should have a positive effect. I personally found all the ""trickery"" and ""jolts"" amateurish, and the plot laughably melodramatic, but I suppose this would horrify teens who might be considering doing drugs. <br/><br/>But do drug addicts watch movies about drugs? I don't think so. I think this is all a wasted exercise, with the director simply choosing material and subject matter that would justify the tone initially attempted in ""PI"".<br/><br/>The sole question this film puts on my lips is: ""can art change the world""? Can a work like ""Requiem"" really go out there and shake up the drug culture? The answer seems to be no. Art, mostly, reaffirms the already existent trends and notions of the time. Few pieces of art challenge, let alone are great enough to enforce a change. This film neither revolutionises or reaffirms. It just exists. It's impotent.<br/><br/>7/10 - Once you've seen one drug movie, you've seen them all. Makes a good companion piece to ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", ""Trainspotting"", ""Drugstore Cowboy"", ""Maria Full of Grace"", ""Traffic"", ""Pure"", ""Big Bad Love"", ""The Corner"" (from the makers of ""The Wire""), ""Wonderland"", ""Leaving Las Vegas"", ""BasketBall Diaries"", ""Barfly"", ""Scarface"", ""The Doors"" and ""Panic in Needle Park"".

","Do not see this movie if you don't want to be haunted by it for the rest of your life.  It really should be called requiem for a nightmare. <br/><br/>
It involves the nightmare situation of poor people who do drugs.  It is scary beyond belief and just so, so, so, sad.  The whole family (such as it is) gets torn apart.  The men and women in this movie have no power in the world, and their little fling with drugs costs them everything.<br/><br/>Also the scene with the mother and doctor is a good example of the current scourge of doctors who just don't give a hoot about their poor patients. The inhumanity of man is pretty obvious in this movie because there is NOONE willing to help any of these people out of their plight, even though in some cases it would be pretty easy for some of these characters to help these people.<br/><br/>The way that these people were mistreated in this film is what is the most disturbing of all.

And the cruelty of the police, the ex-boyfriend and the doctor were just appalling."
"zaisjr","2","7","12","31 October 2010"," Not sure if this movie makes me want to do drugs or abstain.
","Let me start off by saying that I will save the spoilers for the end so feel free to read the beginning of my review.<br/><br/>I feel that this movie is just what Hollywood wants you to believe is realistic about drugs and the world. They also want you to believe that this movie is a good movie. It's not very realistic and is NOT a good movie. I have experienced all sorts of aspects of the drug world from user to witness of the South American effect. With that in mind, I will tell you that the movie ""Traffic"" is much much closer to the truth about drugs. I see way too many people saying that Requiem for a Dream is a movie to show your kids or loved ones about drugs. You must be on drugs to think that way or have not thought about how unrealistic this movie is.<br/><br/>Here's my issue. Unlike the movie ""Traffic"", this movie doesn't develop the characters. I immediately couldn't stand the mother, Harry, his girlfriend, his friend.... nobody! I couldn't really identify with them. The mother. She looked and acted like a grandmother. She seemed like far too fake of a character. I actually spent most of the movie laughing at her character. Even now my girlfriend and I crack jokes about ""the refrigerator"". Harry was a selfish jerk of a son who I didn't care if he lived or died. His girlfriend was never really developed throughout the movie. Too little was touched on about his friend.<br/><br/>Now here is where the spoilers come along.<br/><br/>The last half hour of the movie caused my girlfriend and I to laugh and also say ""c'mon!"". I have plenty of experience with people being arrested and admitted with drug problems. Not once have I seen a doctor have a severely infected patient get arrested without being taken care of. Never have I seen a patient be sent right to shock therapy because they overdosed on uppers. The mother and son could have sued and won tons of money for his arm being amputated and for her being sent through last resort mental procedures without ever going to detox. It's like this movie was meant to scare you into abstaining from drugs but at the same time causing so much laughs that you wonder if you shouldn't just do some drugs to understand what is going on. And last of all, the ""ass to ass"" scene. That wasn't necessary. Seriously, how many times is a druggie going to just agree to do ""ass to ass"" in front of a bunch of strangers for just a little bit of smack. This movie took the absolute most unlikely and worst scenario and made a movie out of it.<br/><br/>If you honestly think this is a good movie to persuade people not to do drugs, think again. The people who told me to watch this movie? Yes, all drug addicts. Drug addicts who aren't going to therapy. The people who told me to watch the movie ""Traffic""? They were recovering addicts, addicts in therapy, addicts who had reached the end of their rope and turned back, or police officers. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is just as realistic as MTV's ""the Real World"". Sure it seems real. But it's basically the most wacked out and unlikely scenarios being thrown into a movie. It's like someone making a movie about how you shouldn't smoke cigarettes. In this movie about cigarettes the characters die by accidentally burning down their house, starting their cars on fire, or dying of lung cancer at age 25. Or making a movie about how you shouldn't own guns and all the characters blow off their fingers and commit terrorist attacks. This movie is way over the top. So over the top that many people will laugh like I did.<br/><br/>Please, if you disagree, learn more about the drug world and how you can prevent your loved ones from doing drugs. Don't use this movie as a tool. Now I have to go. I think I hear.... oh my gosh!!!! The refrigerator!!!!!"

Instead we are treated as Pavlov's dogs: drugs=bad, drugs=filth, drugs=pain, drugs=ugly, etc. All this may be true, but does that really suffice to make a film? <br/><br/>No, I answer. For example, why not try to address the question WHY do these people in one way or another do what they do, why do they inflict these things upon themselves? What drives them? And why not try to put drug addiction in a bigger picture? Who gains from this abuse, why does a society accept that many of its citizens are paralyzed at their television sets, doped by drugs, completely consumed by their need or engaged in small gang wars (small in comparison to what governments do)? I do not say that one single film should address all these questions, but a drug film above the ordinary must see beyond the individual. This one fails in that respect, thus making it uncontroversial (the nudity and sex scenes are filthy and terribly voyeuristic, but I do not consider them to be controversial except to a very prude audience), which probably is the reason why it has been so well received... no one in power is criticized, it is the addict which is the loser, end of story.<br/><br/>The film has some inventive visual effects and some good acting, but form can not make up for lack of challenging content.

One thing they teach you in NA (Narcotics Anonymous) is that drugs lead to one of three places. Jails, Institutions and Death. This movie introduces another destination, slavery, but holds up the credo and teachings of organizations such as NA.<br/><br/>Through imagery, conversation, suggestion and the occasional blast of visual information, the creators work very hard to show the viewer the users side of the story as well as the ""outsiders"" views and opinions of the main characters.<br/><br/>We hope for the best as Harrys mom makes her decision to use diet pills to lose whatever iota of fat she thinks she has before her television appearance. We are left feeling sad for her though as she begins her decline into delusion only to end up institutionalized.<br/><br/>All in all, the characters work together very well and the movie is better than many other creations out there.

This alone made the film fall flat, because too much effort was put into a segment that was left unfinished and pointless. Unless there's some message about life being a TV show and dying early through drugs means you will never get to see the end (yes I'm reaching).<br/><br/>My point is this: with this type of anti-entertainment film the only point in watching it is the messages and guidance it may contain within, but this film doesn't contain anything. It's just a crap story about crap characters that the writer decided he wasn't going to end properly.<br/><br/>If you want an anti-drugs film that gets the message across far better, and actually is entertaining then check out Trainspotting. I get the impression from this film that this is an attempt at a `cleverer' Americanised remake, obviously the writer of Requiem For a Dream missed the point entirely.<br/><br/>Pure rubbish - 1/10"
"rick_7","Null","9","17","4 April 2003"," Smoke-and-mirrors. Flashy, overrated drugs movie has little to say
","Darren Aronofsky followed up Pi - a super-stylised near-masterpiece - with this highly-regarded drugs picture which uses almost every visual trick imaginable. Were such technical wizardry enhancing the story (as in Citizen Kane), it would be an admirable achievement, but here it seems to have replaced it. With as many meaningless subplots and unpleasant characters as the similarly-over-hyped Heat, Requiem is not the classic that it has been described as. Rather, it is a deeply flawed piece which loses its emotional impact through a relentless barrage of visual tricks. Indeed, ""trick"" seems an apt word to use, for much of the film's audience appears to have been deceived and led astray by the showy direction and obvious symbolism. Ellen Burstyn is brilliant, but plot and screenplay are markedly sub-standard, and both Leto and Wayans deliver unmemorable turns.<br/><br/>In terms of editing and visual originality, then, Requiem may be judged a success, but in grand terms, simply a mess, despite Burstyn's unforgettable central performance."
"bigguybri","3","15","32","26 October 2001"," Tries too hard.
","Slow motion, fast motion, slow motion with fast motion, spins, split screens.  How many trick camera shots can a director fit into a feature film?  If your Darren Aronofsky, you can fit in about 17 million.  At least that is how many I thought I saw in Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream.<br/><br/>I was excited to see Requiem for a Dream.  I somewhat enjoyed Aronofsky's previous film Pi.  I thought that if the guy that made Pi had more money he might really be able to do something. Requiem is something all right.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream has two main story lines.  One follows Sara (Ellen Burstyn), a loving mother of a bum son, through her quest to loose weight so she can fit into a special red dress to live out her dream to be on television.  The other follows her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) on their quest to live out their dream of making a really big drug score.<br/><br/>Both stories are dark.  All of the characters, including the Sara, the loving mother, take the pathetic, downward spiraling road of drug addiction.  The film follows their stories to the absolute bottom, and then leaves it there.  There is no redemption.  There is no hope.<br/><br/>Requiem tries too hard.  It wears ""artsy-fartsy"" as a badge.  Just because a movie is really dark, doesn't mean it is relevant.  Just because something has a very distinctive style, doesn't mean it is a good style. I didn't hate Requiem.  Burstyn's performance was amazing.  Leto wasn't bad either.  I wanted to like it.  I wanted to be in the group of people that ""get"" this sort of film.  I don't want to be some bumpkin. I don't want it to be over my head.<br/><br/>I didn't like it though, and I don't think that I'm being a bumpkin.  I ""got"" this movie, more like a disease than an understanding.  I don't think that it was over my head, more like it bashed me over the head.<br/><br/>I give Requiem for a Dream 3 out of 10 stars."

","I went to see this movie after hearing all the noise it did, after hearing some of my friends say it was the best picture ever... and I was truly disapointed.<br/><br/>First of all, its photography. Of course, it is great in technical point of view, the shot of the eye dilating is cool, all the visual effects are cool, and technically astonishing. But, it is just that, it is just cool. They do not mean anything, they are put there just to decorate the story, they are useless. And there is too many of them. I went to see a movie, not a parade of technical skills. A movie, not a video clip. What could have been an interesting aspect of the movie becomes boring and excessive.<br/><br/>It is the same thing with the story, which I find extremely moralistic. Of course, drugs are bad, of course they can kill you, I don't need to pay ten dollars and suffer during two hours to understand it. My parents told me that many times before. Besides, the way Aronofsky uses to affect his audience is easy, sadly easy. He wants to shock you, and in the hardest way. And he goes for the easy way. It is easy to make you cry and to make you hate a character showing him kick a dog to death. In the same way, he shows you a rotting arm, gore sex and all the disgraces that can happen to a poor junkie or to his mother addicted to pills and TV. He never tries to say things in a subtle way, he things people who see his movie are idiots who can not understand anything unless he shows it, completely. He made a movie for idiots, I must repeat it.<br/><br/>He does too much and is redundant in his message and in the way he tells it. I could elaborate, give more arguments and examples, but this movie really do not deserve more of my time. I have wasted enough seeing it. If ""Requiem for a Dream"" is worth something, it is just because of the images effects, because its subject, drugs, is the same a teenager would choose  and what he says about it is not much more mature. Drugs are not so interesting and this movie does not tell me anything I did not know before about them. And what irritates me the most is to see that there still are people who have the courage to say this is a classic! Well, I just hope that, with the years, it will be forgotten..."

","I was pretty enthusiastic about both Pi and its soundtrack, and was pleased to see another movie from the same fellow.<br/><br/>However, whereas Pi had an interesting plot and occasional moments of brightness, this movie was almost exclusively about suffering, and the last half of the movie almost gratuitously dwelt on that.  My biggest beef was with the plot, which became a contrivance to abuse the characters, again in the last half.  Whenever chance would have it that the protagonists could have several possible futures ranging from fortunate to dismal, the plot always chose the worst possible future.  After a while, the suffering was completely artificial, loaded with graphic, ugly images; high-strung and irritating music, and a disregard for reality that had hitherto remained intact.<br/><br/>The acting was well-done, the direction had style, the music, save for the grating violins when things were really getting bad (which I suppose were meant to invoke pathos), was interesting and well-suited, but I have to ask myself -- why did I watch the movie if it was completely unpleasant, if I didn't learn anything save for the depths of pain and disgust to which a movie can go?  I am all for intelligent independent movies, but there has to be some spark of enjoyment in it instead of a kaleidoscopic barrage of suffering.  I regret watching this film."

Or maybe it just got a much wider audience than many of those that came before it.<br/><br/>In any case, the film is a good watch, but the highlight by far is the story of the mother and her obsession with dieting.

There have been comments that this film is 'extremely realistic'  and 'what drugs do to you'. These statements are ridiculous to the majority of people who live in the real world.

The hopelessness and despair of Jennifer Connelly and Jared Leto's characters mirrored my own and I was amazed by how well this film captured the essence of life disintegrating into nothingness. The scene when Harry and Marion are talking on the phone knowing they will never see each other again just tears my heart out. The bittersweet music, the unspoken goodbye... it's so tragic.

I'm curious what the opinion of this movie's protagonists would be on this matter. There are so many questions and so few answers. One of the reasons why I love Aronosfsky's films. After one and a half hours you are just left there ... speechless ... with tears in your eyes ... with questions without answer and with feelings so unbearable, you would like to scream in pain for eternity. Requiem for a Dream is something to make you feel and think. Do NOT watch this movie for entertainment. It is more of a spiritual experience. Become aware of yourself by doubting all there is.

Innovation in framing the act of drugging leaves a remarkable impression on the viewer. If you ask me, this movie should be played to children in schools. In that way there would definitely be fewer drug addicts, because I do not know a better way of showing how these drugs can destroy someone's life. The music is also phenomenal, and also is the very end of the movie. This is one of those movies that will not leave you indifferent and for sure it is going to reflect on you long after seeing it.

","What to say about Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream that hasn't been said already? Without doubt it's a film, that in spite of its high standing on the main movie sites, polarises opinions. It's a film that in simple terms follows four people through their addictions until the shattering denouement, but the journey is made more bleak by offering tantalising snatches of hope, the dreams of the protags offered up as some sort of goals for the addicts to cling on to - only for the narrative to stick in its rusty serrated blade to draw the lifeblood from the hapless hopefuls.<br/><br/>Arononfsky brings a multitude of technical skills to the party that emphasise the emotional discord on show. Standard split-screening is married up with rapid cutting, isolated framing, close ups, long tracking and Snorricam, all of which is sound tracked by Clint Mansell's haunting musical composition. All told it's an assault on all the senses and terrifying with it, boosted no end by Aronofsky getting top performances from his cast of actors. Love it or hate it, it's a film that simply can't be ignored, unsparing cinema produced by a most gifted director. 9/10"

It was almost impossible to care about the fate of anyone in the film except for the Ellen Burstyn character.<br/><br/>The other fundamental flaw was the one-note nature of the entire production: ""Addiction! Addiction!! ADDICTION!!!"" Okay, okay; I got it. I got it after the first 20 minutes. I still got it after the next 20 minutes. I didn't care anymore by the third 20 minutes.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, as far as the monotonous roles allow. The direction and editing are skillful and interesting.

It had an impact. It was like looking at my life from an outside perspective. I was seeing what I looked like and had gone through. The acting in it was superb. They really made you believe that that was their lives. The directing was phenomenal as well. The angles, the camera work, the real emotion that you could tell went into this movie were unbelievable.

Without being too harsh, the film did have a few (but only a few) good things about it, mainly visual things. However, the predominant feature of Requiem for a Dream is it forcefully trying to squeeze emotion out of you. I'm sorry, but there's more to a good film than just something which crudely forces you to feel shaken and sick in the stomach.

Don't just go for the easiest, bluntest, most transparent and hollow option!

","I had been looking forward to seeing this film for quite some time and after seeing it's high rating here on IMDb, I finally obtained a brand new copy from e bay. Hubert Selby is an astute commentator on the underbelly of American life and I looked forward to seeing his vision made flesh.<br/><br/>This is a personal opinion, but I thought that this film represented the absolute nadir of contemporary film-making.<br/><br/>The direction was unnecessarily showy and looked like something that would pop-up between music videos on MTV. The characters were completely unlikeable, so no matter what happens to them you can't possibly have any empathy or care in the slightest, in fact, at the end when the girl is gang raped and the guy gets the abcess on his arm (particularly unrealistic that, by the way) I was almost glad that these hopeless emptyheaded hunks of humanity had been erased from their fictional existence.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have commented on the performances of the young leads in this film. Well, they're wrong. They were worse than the performances in the Children's Film Foundation (A foundation run in the UK that allows kids to work in the movie industry). The only redeeming aspect of the whole film was Ellen Burstyn's performance, which was powerful and convincing, but dimmed by the ridiculously OTT direction which is more hysterical than a Prodigy music Video.<br/><br/>What else can I say? This is exactly the kind of gen X rubbish that usually comes with an MTV logo slapped on it and is lapped up by moronic so-called nihilists that think that the repeated litotes of the 'getting high' sequence is a powerful shorthand for their desire to escape the reality of their hopeless existences. It's not, it's rubbish.<br/><br/>Anyway, at least it's not all bad; it does suggest that hard drugs might have some use in ridding the planet of vacuous American teenagers.<br/><br/>I will never watch another Darren Aronofsky film as long as I live. Do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this film. Do some drugs and speed-read some Charles Bukowski - it would give you an infinitely better insight into the mind of those addicted to inebriation and it will be a lot more fun."
"user54","1","10","21","9 July 2003"," No requiem for formulaic anti-drug films: they're alive, well & wearing a new skin
","The reason people keep searching for meaning in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is that there isn't any deeper meaning to be found, aside from a message available in much earlier cinematic work, say, REEFER MADNESS. Whereas that is amusing and once effective propaganda, this is just hot air -- typical Aronofsky -- plenty of flashy style, zero substance. You can understand why he tackled the ""drug issue"": sensationalism and melodrama get attention for an aspiring auteur.<br/><br/>Or perhaps anti-drug films have gone undercover. What else could they have done to spread a message that is now laughed at (THE ROAD TO RUIN, REEFER MADNESS)? Perhaps their answer to the modern, cynical, jaded youth is a new style of propaganda evident in films like REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. As propaganda, this might work, despite the over-the-top melodrama. it's the surrealism, ironically, that sells it so well, as if to say, ""We know our anti-drug evidence sounds preposterous. The reality IS surreal!"" As art, however, it fails unequivocally, and REQUIEM is intended as entertainment, not education. Perhaps, though, this subconscious purpose to the film is what has inspired viewers to find meaning in REQUIEM. But let's stick to calling a film a film, and judge it on that basis.<br/><br/>At best, REQUIEM is an ignorant, inexperienced, preposterous, propagandized claim of the so-called evils of drug use. That is ""at best"" because propaganda can be so masterful it is worthy of artistic mention (e.g. Riefenstahl). REQUIEM, however, is so melodramatic, pointless, unbelievable, and desperate to attract adherents to its false mastery of invisible metaphor and allegory that it fails to even be successful as propaganda, something any after-school special or episode of GROWING PAINS can accomplish.<br/><br/>Nothing is new here in the treatment of the subject matter; nor, even, the style. TRAINSPOTTING brought stylistic surrealism into vogue for (anti-)drug films, and did so much more effectively and without losing all sense of reality and veering into the realm of melodramatic tripe like this. Beyond that, almost all ""drug films"" express the exact same message. I think it's been drilled into your head enough to forgo spelling it out. All REQUIEM does is scream out that message melodramatically, and then add a bit of surrealism to make like art cinema.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be so surprising if the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy (office of the U.S. ""Drug Czar"") actually had a hand in this project, considering the fact that this film was produced in the heyday of ONDCP bribery of Hollywood (exposed by the online magazine Salon in 2000 -- just search for ONDCP TELEVISION SCRIPTS in your favorite internet search engine. America's favorite TV shows were edited and modified to contain anti-drug propaganda, courtesy of bribes amounting to tens of millions of dollars a year for the networks. If it was, I might be more forgiving to the filmmakers for producing such an annoying attempt at faux art.<br/><br/>Marcel Duchamp's prank exhibit and amusing statement (a urinal) for a 1917 art show didn't make it in, but, apparently, if he had written inside the urinal ""the consequence of drug use"" he would have won critical acclaim -- at least by the standards that this film has achieved high regard. The only potentially brilliant aspect of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is that the filmmakers may have realized that fact, and shrewdly succeeded with this project in terms of self-promotion. For art, however, I would rather stare at that urinal."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","6","11","12 June 2009"," Divisive
","I have not read the novel upon that this is based upon. This has gotten very mixed reactions... is it almost criminally engaging and effective, or is it MTV-type manipulative drivel? I have to admit, I can't ignore the craftsmanship of this movie, so if you must place me in a booth, I'd be in the former of those two. The stylization is incredible and fitting. Editing and cinematography are accused of being gimmicky, with jump-cuts and this utilizing quite a few different angles and the Snorricam, but I disagree... they're part of Aronofsky's cinematic language. Whether he is a genius or a madman is open to debate. This is not easy to watch. It is rather cruel to the audience, and entirely uncompromising. It deals with addiction, in general, not only to drugs. The writing is impeccable, script, plot and dialog alike. All the characters are credible. The acting is amazing, yes, including Marlon Wayans, and Burstyn is, simply put, excellent, and utterly devastating in her performance. This has masterful music, the score is perfect and beautifully done. The one complaint that I particularly have is that, for three of the four leads, there is little to no explanation in this for how they came to use narcotics. I can imagine many viewers being deeply emotionally affected by this. The language is strong as it gets, and plentiful. While there is not a lot of violence in this, it's filled with disturbing content. There is also graphic sexuality. This is not something to watch if you aren't already relatively hardened. The DVD comes with trailers and TV spots, two of each, deleted scenes with the option of hearing Darren's thoughts on them, during them, a couple of featurettes, and lastly, a commentary track with the director, and one with Matthew Libatique. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the medium, provided they feel they have the nerves for it. 10/10"
"freemantle_uk","10","6","11","30 March 2008"," The perfect anti-drugs film
","I consider this movie the American version of Trainspotting without the happy ending. This film focuses on four characters, Harry, Marion, Ty and Harry's mother Sara. All four characters have a dream, Harry wants to make money so he and Marion can move out of Brooklyn and have a better life. Marion wants to become a fashion designer and own her own shop. Ty also wants to become someone big and ends up working with local gangsters. Sara has the chance to be on TV and just wants to look her best and loose weight to fit in her red dress.<br/><br/>Harry, Marion and Ty were already using heroin, whilst Sara became addicted to diet pills. In the summer Harry and Ty sold drugs for local gangsters and made a lot of money out of it. Harry and Marion becomes stronger and Ty raises through the ranks of the local gangster mob. When Sara finds out she was going to be TV she becomes the most popular woman in her building and the other women were only too willing to help. As the movie progresses the lives of all four characters breaks down and all their lives end up being destroyed. I felt the most sorry for Sara because it was not all her own fault like the others.<br/><br/>This film has some brilliant acting. All four performances were great, Jennifer Connelly has always been an actress I liked and this is her strongest performance; Jared Leto shows get potential as an actor in this film and Ellen Burstyn was really good in the film. Darren Aronofsky's direction was really key to the film. He got the mood just right, getting the best out his actors, getting a good mix of realism and surrealism, good casting and some brilliant shots and good music. He was from Brooklyn himself so knew the area and therefore got good locations. A shot really liked from the film was when Marion left her shrink's apartment and the camera focuses on her all the way to the outside of the building.<br/><br/>A word of warning about this film is that it is not for the faint-hearted, having some graphic scenes and this movie is a very depressing experience, don't expend an uplifting experience. You need to be in the right mood to watch this film, but it is well worth watching and it's message is very clear."
"mantarayinvasion","3","6","11","27 August 2007"," depressing morality tale with sledgehammer shock tactic approach but nothing new to offer
","Well I finally got round to watching this. I have to say it's rather overrated, and that's putting it mildly. It reminded me of 'Traffic' or any other overblown TV-movie-esquire morality tale over which I've wasted my time in the past. Just because a film is photographed really well (this certainly is) does not make it worth all these 10/10 ratings. I've read in the discussion comments that some people have shown this film to 6-9 year olds - I hope some day they feel as ashamed as they should. Scaring kids with this kind of sub-'Reefer Madness' paranoia-fest is going to ultimately have precisely the opposite effect that you think it should.<br/><br/>Some others here have pointed out some of the frankly unrealistic depictions of drug culture in this film. Here's just a few that I noticed - the mass drug distribution scene in a supermarket storeroom (give me a break!), not being able to score drugs in BROOKLYN (err... hello?), the fact that all the characters look straight out of a glossy teen magazine all the time (there's an easy way out of your money problems guys... join a modelling agency). One of the few traces of snot came with Harry's mom's legal-amphetamine disaster.. oh wait, it's because she's (whisper) 'ooold'.<br/><br/>Can I find anything good to say about this film? OK, it sets out the fact that addictions are bad (who ever tried to argue otherwise?), and that sometimes the most horrible addictions are legal ones (although not as bad as skag because it can make you into a hoe or lose an arm). And it does this powerfully. However the story is, at best, a horrific worst-case nightmare scenario, the likes of which only the truly vulnerable and lost are going to fall prey to - that or the criminally stupid. If this is the case, sooner or later something is going to destroy your life anyway... it's just a matter of what you have access to. Judging by the ratings, I thought this film was going to offer something more real, perhaps something about what causes people to do this to themselves (aside from maternal issues... sigh..). The real tragedy of this movie is that it does not.<br/><br/>Hmm so anything else good about this movie? The acting is at least functional, worthy of the best TV-movies. The photography and general production is, as already mentioned, unarguably great. The thing is, if anyone could be bothered to research such stuff, I think they'd be able to trace the sheer lack of any creative progression in modern western cinema back to the time that jumped-up music video and TV advert directors were first allowed onto a feature film set. That and too much cocaine. If anything this film proves that the film industry definitely needs a whole lot less cocaine.<br/><br/>The director here clearly is fascinated by paranoia/terror and representing it with twitchy jump edits. Technically good and initially arresting but it doesn't make a watchable film, and loses its intensity when it's done as much as it is here. To be honest the director comes across as a pretty negative guy, who prefers to apathetically wallow in tragedy and gloom rather than offer some real positive answers. His first film, Pi, was similar, and similarly over-rated. It seemed to me that he had an unhealthy fascination with the humiliation of the girl.. maybe the only option was to be more extreme than anyone else because this storyline has been done about 5818948923 times? Overall it looks like the director realised that by far the most profitable demographic for DVDs is angst-filled teenagers who thrive on spending their student loans on banquets of melancholy like this.<br/><br/>Sorry to be so brutal but really, there are far, far better films out there about this kind of subject matter which won't try and pummel you into a state of feeble submission ('Trainspotting' is a good example). I guess I'm just annoyed that I wasted my time... seriously, what is the point of sitting for 1.5 hours to be shattered by horrible tragedy that doesn't actually bear any resemblance to the real world, and doesn't offer any answers as to WHY this kind of thing actually happens sometimes? Maybe the thing that really bothers me is that most modern American films, even the so-called 'independents', seem to be so utterly empty and binary in their subtlety - there is no room for anything at all between vacuous air-headed garbage and morose doom-fests. As long as you dress it up with some slick photography and editing, and throw in some beautiful looking people, audiences will lap it up and ask for more."

","For starters, i would like to point out that i don't write comments for movies too often. A movie will have to make a certain impression on me - positive or negative - to make me write one. Secondly, when i see a movie that i like or dislike, i always read the exact opposite comments in IMDb, to see the point of view of the people that think otherwise than me. In this particular movie, the opposite comments would be the ones that i'd agree with 6 years ago.<br/><br/>First time i saw Requiem For A Dream was back when it was released. I was blown away. Totally. I thought that this is what cinema MUST be. That was then...<br/><br/>I saw it again three hours ago. When it ended i caught myself being cold. Not by emotions, by the lack of them. I started thinking that something must be wrong - me or the movie. Obviously it must have been me, because it was the same movie that blown me away back then. So i thought to myself that i had to figure out what has changed since. The very first thing that came to mind was that i found out i didn't care about the characters. There was no depth in them. I couldn't relate to any of them. They were like comic characters. Flat. The only emotion they had was anticipation for the next time they would get a dose.<br/><br/>Was it possible that i had that kind of thoughts about the same movie i saw in 2001? No doubt about it. So, it must be me. I'm getting older and apparently the shock-after-shock theme in this movie isn't convincing for me anymore. And that's all there is to it about the plot. There isn't any. It's just that. Shock-after-shock. Mr. Aronofsky tried to shock his audience because he knew that. He made the film as much as depressing as he could, for the sole reason to bring tears to everyone, so nobody would pay attention to the non-existing script. It's true. THERE IS NO SCRIPT - NO PLOT. Nothing. He made a movie for junkies with nothing in it. Must find a dose and will do anything to get it? That is not a plot. That is absolute nothing. The side story of the mother is the reason for the 2 i'm giving it. Otherwise not even 1 would be enough.<br/><br/>Acting(fantastic job), directing(quite good, i admit), editing, scoring(brilliant music), producing, developing, even promoting. Almost everything was almost perfect. Only one key element was missing. Plot. And that's the single most important part of a movie."
"dbrown-13","10","6","11","20 March 2007"," Much, much more than just another 'drug movie'
","Some of the mainstream reviews I had read about this movie prior to watching it didn't describe this movie favourably. Many of the criticisms were that this was just another 'drug movie', just another tale of hopelessness and despair. Some said that the story of addiction told here was 'unrealistic', some even suggested that this movie and it's approach were glorifying drug use.<br/><br/>After watching this I wondered if these reviewers had just watched the same film I had?? This has to be the most harrowing, unsettling, and yet utterly compelling film dealing with the issue of drug use, and the effects it has on those involved I have ever seen. This is, and I state for the record, in no way glorifying, sensationalising, or condoning drug use in any way.<br/><br/>It tells of the plight of 4 individuals, their respective descent into drug dependency, the effects this has on their relationships with each other, and the eventual lengths they will go to feed their addiction. On the contrary to the reviews I had read earlier, it occurs to me the depiction here is perhaps a little too 'realistic' for recreational viewing. Though this movie is certainly not 'easy going' it is a rewarding experience in the end.<br/><br/>The film benefits from first rate performances (particularly Ellen Burstyn - an acting tour de force), superb cinematography and solid directing. The jump cuts and fast editing work really well here too, setting a suitable tone for the movie, conveying the character's disjointed and erratic perceptions of reality to the viewer effectively. Lastly the haunting musical score composed by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet is as striking as it is original, complementing the mood of the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>There is always a danger when making a movie dealing with issues such as these that the end result may appear contrived or over-sentimental, that the overall message become muddled; conflicting. This isn't the case with 'Reqiuem for a Dream', thanks to faultless execution in all aspects this movie is nothing short of excellent - 10/10."

","If this had been made as an educational video to raise awareness of drugs, it may have succeeded. Although as it stands requiem for a dream is a simple, dull story which glorifies and tries to make us sympathise with some junkies and a woman obsessed with television.<br/><br/>Strong themes of addiction run through Requiem for a dream. Namely the drugs. Though this, which is evidently the films main attraction, becomes boring very soon. We are repeatedly treated to scenes of Marlon Wayans smoking some kind of drug and saying ""righteous man, this sh*t is good."" This is basically THE film. Showing addicts taking drugs.<br/><br/>What makes it worse is how innovative, although ultimately pretentious and drab the camera work throughout the film is. Some of the drug scenes are just close ups of pupils dilating and the sound of a lighter sparking. This looks kind of cool the first time you see it. Though by the 100th time it gets boring and a little embarrassing. Aronofskys attempt at bringing some sort of art-house chic to this boring story, totally backfires and comes across as pretentious and silly.<br/><br/>Aside from the in your face drug addiction, comes the main characters Mother's addiction to a television game show. This for me is the only interesting plot line in the film. Slowly her world is taken over by her preparations to appear on this show that she idolises. The film even manages to strum up some emotion, detailing the Mother's pain, disappointment and desire to be noticed. Though we don't get this story half as much as the boredom of the drug addiction, which fills most of the films running time.<br/><br/>I had heard a lot of people saying how shocking and disturbing this movie was. I regret to say that it was not. Its nothing but a dull, repetitive mess with very brief glimpses of quality, added in to try and interest us in a crappy story which runs out of mileage within the first half hour. Don't bother with this. It isn't clever, entertaining or good. Its true bottom of the barrel Hollywood film making, with a shiny gloss of what could be mistaken for a good movie, and a centre of preachy dumb junk.

The best thing about seeing this movie is ---- that watching it is no longer in my future.<br/><br/>i am bewildered as to how this can be so popular. I believe that people confuse the topic/storyline with its actual quality. This movie is about drugs, a topic with counterculture appeal. Movies about drugs and crime are usually overrated. It doesn't hurt having Jennifer Connelly naked in a few scenes either. But I'm really confused as to what makes this a good film...<br/><br/>The entire storyline of the mother and the gameshow was annoying, boring, uninteresting and lame. These scenes were 50% of the movie. The back and forth between the Connelly/Leto/crazy mother at the end was just unbearable.<br/><br/>Poor writing: <br/><br/>1) I was never convinced that these guys were junkies or addicts. Yet the minute the coke in Coney Island 'dried up', Connelly was turning tricks and Leto was pale, skinny and disheveled. The scene before Leto and Wayans started dealing, they convinced each other to just take a taste in order to evaluate the product just for 'business'. I thought for sure this would turn into a situation where they killed their supply in 48 hours. But in fact, they were controlled and professional and literally just had a taste. Even the supplier in the limo liked Wayans because he 'wasn't a junkie', hence offering the promotion. You can't write in these qualities and then try to make these guys hapless addicts. The world doesn't work like this.<br/><br/>2) I never knew Marlon Wayans was working for anyone and never heard a mention of the names of the gangstas in the limo.. and all of a sudden there is a scene with Wayans in the back of a limo getting a 'promotion', and having his life threatened by hardcore high-level dealers? <br/><br/>3) the scene in the back of the grocery store where they deal huge bags out of a briefcase in plain sight to a rowdy mob... really?<br/><br/>4) the whole Connelly 'art store' business or whatever that was... you can't write in a 3 minute scene and expect it to have any sort of impact. What is the point of all of these undeveloped stories? <br/><br/>5) Who gets arrested for bringing a friend to the hospital?

The photography is excellent for sure, but I could have spent my time far more enjoyably and educationally in an art gallery if that was what I had wanted.<br/><br/>The biggest two problems with this film are its transparent storyline and unsympathetic characters.<br/><br/>The first 10 minutes of the film are surprisingly entertaining, but the film that follows fails to capitalise on the dark wit evidenced before. Around twenty minutes later the storyline can only be heading in one direction, which it dutifully does.<br/><br/>No matter how hard I tried (and I did try) I could not manage to muster an ounce of sympathy for, or emotional involvement with, the mother, son, girlfriend or son's friend. Come to think of it, you can see that their names have already escaped me!<br/><br/>The mother's performance is the strongest by a mile, all others mediocre. Rapid flashes of audio and video accompany the shooting-up of drugs, but fail to liven the pace of the story as a whole. And what about the story? I'll get back to you on that one!<br/><br/>Ultimately the movie includes semi-explicit (somewhat implicit) scenes of a sexual and violent nature which no doubt add appeal to some of the younger voters who are scoring this film most highly, but even at the ripe old age of 26 I have seen enough films to know that this is not a genuinely shocking, ground-breaking or classic film in any way but more of a cliché of a genre which is guaranteed to find favour with the unitiated.<br/><br/>I honestly do not think this is a cynically or commercially made film but just a poor one drastically overrated which leaves you feeling more profoundly disappointed than cheated.<br/><br/>Go and watch ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" instead (yes again!) - it's less contemporary in style but with incomparably more immersion, wit and raw impact."

There are plenty of films that are bad. There are plenty of films that are stupid. But Requiem for a Dream is like a handsome rogue that turns up at a party who tells great stories and looks for all the world on the outside that he has everything. But within he is an empty shell. The film maker believes his film is intelligent and original and visionary. But in reality it is just horrid, convoluted, strange, stupid, ignorant agonisingly plodding and at times just damn right rage inducing. <br/><br/>I don't know how we made it through to the end, but it was an epic chore and we did skip 'yet another one of those stupid fantasy scenes with the bloody TV. <br/><br/>But, at last, like a tortuous trek through the desert, we got to the dismal, depressing and convoluted ending.

","I don't really know how to explain this film, so maybe it will come to me in this review.<br/><br/>The film is shown from the perspective of 4 drug users as they spiral into a mental dystopia. All seeking a better life, aided by drugs, they fall into a state of insanity, demonstrated by a great use of film techniques.<br/><br/>Despite the sophisticated film work, I found watching 'Requiem for a Dream' about as pleasurable as having a pigeon with diarrhoea land on my face. The story... goes nowhere. I spent a good 97 minutes wondering when something was going to happen. There was quite a few 'look at the clock' moments. And as the film progressed I found myself feeling increasingly uncomfortable. The finale was so painful, I was dying for the film to finish, as i was bombarded with obnoxious noise, and a montage of obscene nasty outcomes for each character. I could sense the other people in the room feeling the same, but perhaps slightly less tolerant than me. I was really hoping they didn't think I was enjoying myself.<br/><br/>There was a large portion of the film spent of character development, and were supposed to appeal to different members of the audience as an attempt to cause a bigger impact as you watch their lives deteriorate, however, the characters were so dis-likable i didn't want to even look at them.<br/><br/>The whole thing was basically an hour and a half of saying ""Drugs are bad"", which i think they made quite clear. The film may have been more effective if it had been condensed into about 10 minutes and placed between a plot.<br/><br/>You can tell that it's supposed leave you in a state of amazement, feeling disturbed and changed by the images you have just witnessed, which in many cases probably worked, explaining the amount of credibility it received. However, I have imagined things 10 times more horrible, and I can't think of a reason why i would want to share them with the general public.<br/><br/>In summary: Very well executed, but i do believe in the saying ""You can't polish a turd""<br/><br/>The only thing i got out of it was the ability to read clocks in the dark."

","This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. The story was interesting and I think that it is one of the topics that are extremely hard to express visually so my expectations were low. But the depictions of head trips and hallucinations were perfect. Also the quality of acting was quite high. I think that the storyline was a bit too pessimistic though and I think that there were several glitches. The sexual humiliation of Marion was not too realistic looking at the size of the device and that game that the two girls including the first timer Marion were forced to perform. Also there was a secret message of hate against black people stemming from the way Big Tim abused ""Maid Marion"". Also I could not understand why the main character kept injecting the heroine in his gangrene arm. Apart from that, it was one of the best movies that I have seen."

","I had very high expectations when it came to watching Requiem for a Dream, but was very disappointed. I think it is not a bad movie, it portrays addictions (to all types of things) in a very graphic, surreal sort of way, which in my opinion is an accurate way of depicting them. The entire story of Sara Goldfarb is very well portrayed, especially the haluccinations. However, as the movie progresses, it becomes incredibly dull and uninteresting, even though the director tries hard (too hard) to keep the audience's attention with truly shocking images, but the crappy plot shines right through. The last 20 minutes of the story reveal what the movie really is: a pathetic campaign to show that drugs will ruin your life, which is what we have seen a million times over in ""say no to drugs"" specials....the characters get  stuck in situations like electric shock therapy, amputation and prostitution, which are really not very viable, and even if they were they are shown to be way too melodramatic, seeming too exagerated and ridiculous, ruining the entire tone of the movie. it is sad to say that it is the ending that usually leaves the biggest impression of the movie, so it left me extremely disappointed not only because of that really stupid ending but because it had started out extremely well, and got completely crushed."
"rovescia","3","5","9","21 March 2001"," 'Reefer Madness' with technical flourishes: the subject deserves better handling
","I need not recapitulate the several reasons for many viewers' disappointment in this film, reasons which have already been noted by other users. In my case, having decided to see the movie after reading rave reviews by trusted critics, it was one of those unfortunate let-downs.<br/><br/>One of the film's weak points is its clear-cut division of characters into ordinary folks (going through great suffering), and evil-doers (aware of that suffering and blithely indifferent to it).  Life is more complicated. I also find fault with the film in that it suggests there is something especially degrading about a middle-class Euro-US young woman being sexually exploited by an Afro-American man.  When a film cues viewers to experience revulsion at certain sexual acts in certain circumstances, I prefer this to be done without gratuitously pushing the buttons of race/class prejudice. Call me PC if you like.<br/><br/>Finally, I am not at all 'pro-drugs', but I can't help wondering if this movie will be ridiculed in years to come, just as the anti-hash film 'Reefer Madness' (1936) is ridiculed now.  The subject, I am afraid, calls for a film that delivers more than technical flourishes and some fine acting."

"film-29","1","12","28","6 June 2003"," I'm going to write a couple of those so-called spoilers with the hope that other people be spared the ordeal of seeing this movie.
","I dare to say this is the worst movie I've ever seen. And I've seen almost all the movies. <br/><br/>
Jesuitism Jes""u*it*ism (?), n. [Cf. F. jésuitisme.] <br/><br/>1. The principles and practices of the Jesuits. <br/><br/>2. Cunning; deceit; deceptive practices to effect a purpose; subtle argument; -- an opprobrious use of the word.<br/><br/>
This movie, which qualifies as some kind of paradigm for boredom; could be perfectly described with the second entry for Jesuitism in Webster's Unabridged Dictionary's 1913 edition. It is so biased, that it has flown over the boundaries of plain bigotry and extreme anti-drug-right-wing propaganda. G.K. Chesterton used to say that there are more tints in the human soul (human psychology if you are an atheist) than there are greens and browns in the leaves of a forest. Mr. Aronofosky, of course, would not agree with Chesterton; for him is there's only a colorless, somehow mudded, state of mind, which makes it very easy for people to be taken deep into the bottomless abyss of idiocy and Evil. It doesn't matter how much a person can be loved, it doesn't matter how talented or beautiful one can be; the Devil, (i.e. `The Drug') will get them. The Devil wants your soul and if you try `The Drug' but once, he'll get it. Aronofosky tells the story of four more or less normal and not precisely intelligent people, who in one year are driven to Hell and Damnation because of `The Drug': one of them a very beautiful Jewish girl, who becomes a hooker; her boyfriend, also a Jew, ends up in jail and with one arm cut-off; the boyfriend's mate, a black man, ends up in jail and beaten, called nigger and forced to do forced labor; and the Jewish boy's mother, who also becomes a junkie and at the end of her tether is treated unsuccessfully with electroshock therapy. Why on earth would an Yiddishe-momme become an addict? Simply, just because she takes amphetamine pills to loose weight, that she may wear a red dress in a TV show. Of course, TV is Evil, too. TV is the Devil itself, Mr. Aronofosky. Warns us. In spite of the fact that all the junkies in this film are African-American and Jewish; in spite of the fact that drug dealers are Italian-American and African-American; in spite of the fact that the men who drag Jennifer Connelly's character to prostitution are, again, a Jew and an African-American (she gives herself in exchange of drugs, shrilling, isn't it?). And just when we're starting to ask ourselves: Is this movie a racist movie?  The director or the producers realize what we have in mind and try to mend the whole thing providing us, very underhandedly and sneakily, with some redneck cops and doctors in a state 600 miles south of New York. Somebody should have tipped them that placing a bunch of coarse rednecks makes the movie no less a stereotyped racist movie, quite on contrary. This churlish doctor is so mean that refuses to take care of the junkie-Jewish boy's gangrenous arm and gives him up to the no less churlish racist local police. It must be said that the boy gets his arm in such a horrendous shape after shooting the Devil, I mean `The Drug' repeatedly in the same spot, even when the arm is not an arm anymore but a purple piece of rotting meat. The police first try to make him work and noticing he cannot do anything but stink; send him to the hospital to get his arm amputated. The end is one of those all-out endings; Mr. Aronofosky is kind enough to open the gates of his personal look-alike idea of Hell. And he achieves his goal, we're allowed to catch a glimpse of one of the worst infernal circles, the one intended for tediousness and ennui. I've had a nightmarish idea: What if, from time to time, the damned who inhabit down there are mercilessly punished with the projection of this picture?"

And you've only made two ""wide release"" films (sorry about all the quotes, if I don't put them there people who like the film will debase my review solely on the fact that the words in quotes aren't correct). While I do think that this film is better than his first opus, Pi, it was by no means whatsoever a great movie. Back are Aronofsky's clichés; the ""hip-hop"" shots (the various fast action sequences used every time the characters do drugs), the snorricam, his penchant for the artistic flair. Requiem also borrows Pi's offbeat soundtrack. While good if not great standing alone, the tunes are poorly matched to the scenes (ergo the beautifully slow title song for all the fast-forward sequences). Aronofsky also steals other director's trademark shots. Victims include David Fincher, a great director, among many others. However, the film is not without it's moments. The acting is all around solid, if not breakthrough in some cases. Ellen Burstyn was fantastic as the deluded mother and Jennifer Connelly was equally magnificent as Harry's beautiful girlfriend. Leto's performance is satisfying, if somewhat forgettable. Most people I talk to have never heard of Leto or can't name a movie he has been in. Wayans' does a terrific job of not hamming his role up. Where he easily could have been funny and over the top he restrains himself and accepts his quiet and intelligent rope. Kudos to you Marlon, and you Darren, for keeping the reigns on him. While I may not buy this movie for my personal collection I would recommend that ANYONE thinking about doing narcotics see this movie beforehand (or just don't even consider narcotics). Even Mr. Aronofsky can't ruin it entirely with his mishmash of artistic detritus."

(Hey, this is MY opinion, you can have a different opinion, that's fine with me.) Why Ellen Burstyn acted in this movie is beyond me, she must have needed the money. The portrayals of the drug addicts was a tad too 'black and white' and life is NEVER b/w. As for the portrayals of the medical staff and the police, I don't buy it. I notice they did the 'usual thang' and make the SOUTHERNER doctors/jailers/police the 'bad' ones. Typical. Are there bad doctors, medical staff, jailers and police? Sure, but not as often as 'movie/tv makers' would have you believe. Also, the drug addicts were portrayed more as 'victims' then as 'self annihilators'. The only character I felt sorry for was Ellen Burstyn's. I am thankful I was working on my website when this cr@p was on Amazon Instant Video or I wouldn't have watched it past the first five minutes. UGH is the 'key word' to describe this.

This film could have been better if it actually had a consistent plot, or even the basic elements to a story. It's an anti-drug movie that focuses on one dimensional characters, wow good job.<br/><br/>The characters were very uninspired, except Ellen Burstyn, she was the only one that was remotely sympathetic. I didn't care for any of the other characters. To sum them up, they do bad things and suffer for it. To bad you couldn't get an emotional response out of me, that would have helped. If you want to shock people with drugs, show them a picture of Meth mouth, that would work. But instead we get a film that doesn't even feel like I'am watching a movie.<br/><br/>This film is severely over-rated, it lacks any form of development or imagination. Could have been good if they came up with a better plot and more intriguing characters."
"jacklmauro","2","4","7","16 June 2010"," Sadism as Film Genre
","You don't need to pine for nothing but old MGM musicals to be disgusted by the blatant sadism fueling movies like this. That is to say, I fully accept the tragic decline of characters in keeping with a story, nor do I object to miserable endings when the course dictates that. I'm a grown-up. But. There is something nasty going on with films like this, wherein increasingly grotesque displays of characters undergoing horror are presented as 'reality', or, God help us, art. No good storyteller in any medium actually needs to show us, inch by inch, how low his characters are going. As in this dreadful, pretentious movie. Reviews here sensibly bring out the absurd mistakes, like Burstyn's Etc without anaesthesia or the drug dealer's ridiculous giving away of heroin for a little sex, yet seem to miss that these absurdities are there to serve the director's sadistic purpose: to make everyone suffer really badly, and right in front of us. That is not film-making. That is an adolescent's idea of being shocking and gritty, and it's insulting all around. Give me a story that realistically portrays these very dreams falling apart, with some humanity and not as an exercise in visual cruelty, and I'm on board. This? It's prurient garbage under the guise of serious movie-making."
"bkoganbing","8","4","7","5 May 2010"," No Future At All
","Requiem For A Dream is one of the most depressing films I've ever seen in my life. These poor people from two generations are a lot like Anthony Quinn in Requiem For A Heavyweight. As a boxer Quinn in that film saw his career at an end and faced a very unpromising future. These people have no future at all. <br/><br/>I certainly recognized the Coney Island/Brighton Beach area of Brooklyn, an area of projects and an amusement area that has seen better days. Like Atlantic City, some in Coney Island eventually see casino gambling as the gimmick for a rebirth. If you see Requiem For A Dream, imagine it in that kind of Las Vegas type setting.<br/><br/>At one time Brighton Beach was a template for a working class Jewish paradise of sort with families housed in apartments that partially built with the backing of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Back when I was doing senior citizens crime claims at New York State Crime Victims Board, I can't tell you the number of claims from men and women who listed a small ILGWU pension as part of their income from that area. Such a woman is Ellyn Burstyn playing Sara Goldfarb.<br/><br/>Things haven't gone right for her. As the neighborhood decayed, so did her life and family. Her one son Jared Leto, a promising kid at one time is now a hopeless addict with an addict girlfriend in Jennifer Connelly and an addict best friend in Marlon Wayans.<br/><br/>I've known a few junkies in my time also. After a while they only have one thing on their mind, their particular addiction of choice and how to service it. Even if they want to rise in the dope trade business, they haven't got a head for business any longer.<br/><br/>Which in a nutshell is the position of Leto and Wayans with Connelly in support figuring her own habit can be taken care of by following their lead. Of course its disaster all around.<br/><br/>As for Ellyn Burstyn she gained Requiem For A Dream's only Academy Award recognition with a nomination for Best Actress. She's not just clueless about her son, she's caught up in her own chemical dependency. She dreams of her 10 minutes of fame on some daytime quiz show and gets herself nicely hooked on diet pills. Unlike her son, she does have some memories of better days and talks about them with her peers on the benches outside the apartments.<br/><br/>I recognized a lot of the Brighton Beach/Coney Island area of Brooklyn where this was all shot on location. Requiem For A Dream is a sad film about sad people, definitely one to bring you down from any kind of high you might be on."
"bloodweiser1","4","4","7","10 August 2009"," Over-hyped and Over-rated
","The story of four people and drug addiction and how it destroys their lives. <br/><br/>The above is basically the whole of Requiem for a Dream summed up in one sentence. You don't need any more, because there isn't any more to the movie.<br/><br/>Even though RFAD has received massive acclaim, I just can't understand why people rave about it. My personal belief is that RFAD goes down much better in the US and that the scores it gets here on IMDb are a reflection of the fact that most of the people who frequent this website are Americans. To a degree, I feel that the marks it has received are due to the US attitude to hard drugs and addiction.<br/><br/>As a European, I didn't find anything brutal or shocking about RFAD. The earlier ""Trainspotting"" was THE movie about drug addiction and it portrayed a much more realistic attitude to addiction. It's a case of ""Seen it all before only better"". Realism was a big problem. Really, for heroin junkies, the guys and girls in this movie didn't have a hair out of place. Clean finger nails, tidy hair, clean clothes, dammit, they looked better than most of the people I know! Some of the decisions they made were really ""out there"" (even for junkies) and the plot left a lot to be desired (what little there was of it). There were also many instances where the plot veered off into the realms of being illogical - things happened to characters that just wouldn't have happened in real life - no matter how whacked out on drugs they were. One could counter that the movie's strength was that it was a bleak portrayal using extremes as a way of gaining impact but bleakness doesn't make it a classic and extremes still have to be put into a context where they don't overwhelm logic.<br/><br/>And my other beef? RFAD seems to be a hybrid of Trainspotting and Snatch/Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (again, people rave about the camera-work and music in RFAD, but again, it's something we've already seen done far better in European film long before). <br/><br/>Take away the originality of the camera-work and score, take away the originality of the ""Addiction Story"" and you're not really left with anything else but a mediocre movie.<br/><br/>I've read elsewhere people defending RFAD, saying that the book clarifies this or the book clarifies that and that criticising the movie whilst being unaware of the book's contents means that any negative view is unjustified. But come on people!! I went to see a movie. I didn't want to read the book. The movie really should tell me everything I want to know and if I have to read the book to have a better understanding, that means that the movie has failed.<br/><br/>Believe me, I tried to like RFAD. I looked at the IMDb score and thought, ""It's got to be great"". Then, when I discovered that it really wasn't that good, I thought maybe the problem was with me. But on analysis - no. No punch. No realism. No meat. No originality. <br/><br/>Finally, I'd just like to add, that I didn't relate to any of the characters - they were all annoying idiots. The only one who could elicit any sympathy at all was Wayan's character, Tyrone (although again, his final predicament didn't follow logic). I always find it very hard to like any movie where all the characters grind on my nerves. I'm not talking about just disliking characters - that could be the point of the plot and negative emotions could be the director's intentions, but in this case, they were just plain aggravating and I'd be pretty sure that was never the intended result. Personally, I couldn't have cared less what happened to them and to tell the absolute truth, I actually hoped from an early stage that something bad would happen to at least one of them and that kind of tramples over everything that the movie probably tried to be.<br/><br/>Sorry. For all the raving RFAD is just an average movie."
"galileo3","10","4","7","27 February 2008"," Absolutely devastating
","Requiem For a Dream (2000) <br/><br/>Darren Aronofosky's heavy-hitting film comes at you with its uncompromising nature, and it disturbingly clear message. If this film could be shown to teenagers, it would probably have a more profound and moving effect than any other anti-drug teaching programme.<br/><br/>The plot follows the lives of these four people: The story's main characters are mother and son, Sara (Burstyn) and Harry Goldfarb (Leto), Harry's girlfriend Marion Silver (Connelly), and Harry's friend Tyrone C. Love (Wayans). The novel and the movie both deliberately move through three phases: summer, fall and winter.<br/><br/>We follow the story, as Sara gets a phone-call to participate in her favourite television show and becomes obsessed with losing weight and wearing her old red dress that made her feel so fine. Sara plunges into madness as the amphetamins (diet pills she is taking) give her hallucinations and fervent behaviour. Meanwhile the lives of Harry, Marion and Tyrone are forever changed, as their addictions to drugs grow and they reach any lengths to get the addictive, life destroying substances; Marion even performs sexual acts to get heroin. <br/><br/>The film's conclusion is harrowing as the four characters end up in a state of sheer destruction and depersonalisation. This is rare, powerful stuff.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's film achieves something that very few films do; it manages to rattle, shock and challenge the viewer about problems in our society, issues of loneliness, isolation and drugs. This film comes at you and sweeps you with its devastating story and its profound message.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn's performance is absolutely magnificent, Oscar worthy material. Truly an unforgettable performance.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is something beyond a masterpiece, it is an important, relatable film to everyday issues and problems; how people stuck in the cycle of poverty try to sell drugs to lift themselves outside the poverty circle, but in the way get caught into addiction.<br/><br/>Along with Steven Soderbergh's 'Traffic', these two films complete a spectacular panorama concerning the problems with drugs and their distribution.<br/><br/>Shattering, demoralising, explicitly powerful Cinema.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Beautiful, artistic, haunting movie about 4 people whose lives and relationships are destroyed bye their drug addictions. There's so much to think about and so much symbology. Not recommended for people who like to have movies ""spoon-fed"" to them. Certainly recommended for people who like more from a movie than just a few laughs or a few scares. Certainly not the sort of movie you forget about.<br/><br/>The editing is absolutely beautiful. And note the position each character is lying in for each of their last scenes. I'd love to talk more about the symbology but I don't want to ruin it for people who haven't seen it yet.<br/><br/>Excellently acted. Jared Leto is WAY under-rated. Most likely because he's always linked to some no-talent in Hollywood (eg. Lindsay Lohan).<br/><br/>Marlon Wayans also showed that he's a terrific actor. It's a shame he doesn't do more movies like this, because he certainly proved to be a very versatile actor. A few more serious movies and the man would've had an Oscar under his belt by now."
"ericjams","9","4","7","31 October 2006"," Brutally Awesome!!!!!!
","I love this movie. From the underlying theme of addiction to the social commentaries to the sheer beauty of the cinematography. But ultimately, I like movies that force you to either look away or hold on, squirm in your seat and continue absorbing the visual imagery, no matter how beautiful or disturbing. There is rarely a point in this movie when the viewer does not realize that the main characters, although battling different demons are all entering individual downward spirals. Although the uninformed may label this a ""drug"" movie, drugs are only the catalysts which propel the characters into much deeper and interesting battles with their own souls. When I hear the song that plays during the final and most harrowing shots elsewhere, it always brings me back to the imagery of this movie."
"laxdmcm","10","4","7","26 October 2006"," Incredible
","Requiem for a Dream is not a merely a film but a jagged, unrelenting decent into the desperate world of addiction. Shrouded by denial and a longing for fulfillment, the characters in this story feed their vices and insecurities until they are consumed by them. Aronofsky fuses his creative genius (i.e. ""Hip-hop montages"") with Selbey's macabre and emotionally ravaging writing to produce a work of art that brands itself to the minds of its viewers. Augmented with a stunning soundtrack this is the complete package. Inducing empathy and sympathy for people you would usually scorn, this is a shining example of the modern anti-hero. Though at times the imagery is gruesome, this only amplifies the pervasive motif of desperation. In my opinion, it should be required viewing for all high school drug prevention programs."
"insomniac_rod","10","4","7","16 August 2006"," A key film for the new generation.
","One of the most influential but somehow underrated movies from the new millennium. ""Requiem for a Dream"" is not an easy watch because it displays the real horrors of drugs and it's consequences. The events of the movie perfectly show what it feels like to be under the influence of a narcotic or any kind of drug (even alcohol). Through it's running time there's a feeling of sadness, desperation, and fear. By any means the director tries to state an opinion towards the use of drugs; the movie only shows what really happens.<br/><br/>Anyhow, watching ""Requiem..."" is like being for the first time in a roller coaster because it takes you by surprise and you really feel desperation but you can't stop watching. <br/><br/>The acting is perfect, excellent. Ellen Burstyn's performance always manages to send me shivers. Her performance is impressive, breath taking. Jennifer Connelly also delivers a strong performance. She's always great in her roles. Her eyes have many things to say... She can display deep feelings such as desperation, happiness, sadness, and even confusion. Jared Leto surprised me as the desperate junkie who had potential to be someone in life, but he wasted it. He was very good.<br/><br/>The direction is from other world. I mean, it's genuinely impressive. The director knows how to transfer the character's feelings to the audience. That's not easy even for a movie that is very dramatic. It also blows away the viewer with bizarre and surreal images that are supposedly caused by drugs. Really, some events in the movie truly show what someone can ""think"" or in this case, hallucinate under the effects of a drug.<br/><br/>I can't praise this movie enough and I believe that there are minimal things to spoil. ""Requiem..."" should be watched with regular expectations in order to be 100% shocked and pleased after the ending credits. But don't watch this movie for shocking purposes; I mean, watch it as a serious piece of film making that does not tries to prove anything. The whole viewing experience is an instant impact."

","I viewed this movie while under the influence of many drugs, at a point in my life sometimes I'd rather not remember. This movie was recommended to me by a friend, and I knew nothing about the movie before watching it. By the end of the movie I had completely broken down, and was crying miserably. I ended up calling up my parents and some buddies and admitting I had a serious drug problem, thanks to this movie. Since then I've gone clean, and my life has been improving more and more. I think it takes a terribly powerful and amazing movie to bring somebody to this point. I recommend this movie to everybody, and think that movies like this would help people to stay off drugs more than all those anti-drug campaigns you get to see all the time."
"DonFishies","10","4","7","15 May 2006"," A haunting masterpiece of modern cinema
","Requiem for a Dream was almost six years old before I had a chance to watch it beginning to end. I had seen a few scenes from it on television before, but I'd never seen the entirety until a few days ago. What I thought would just be a standard ""good film"", has turned out to be a merciless, haunting masterpiece, that leaves the viewer changed forever after viewing it.<br/><br/>The film is a parallel story. It jumps between Harry's (Jared Leto) story about trying to score enough heroin with his buddy Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) to live out happy lives, and his mother Sara's (Ellen Burstyn) story about her desperate attempts to get onto television. The film chronicles these four individuals, and their ups and downs through the course of three seasons of a year.<br/><br/>I have nothing but praise for this compelling and thought provoking film. It may be about junkies, but I'd be lying if I, who has never done hard drugs, said I could not relate to any of the characters. Each is played to perfection by their actor. Wayans performance is a total departure from his usual comedic roles, and is only a joy to watch some real acting chops being showcased by the young actor. Leto continues to impress me, and continues to prove why he'll be a heavy hitter in years to come. Connelly is excellent as always, shining through in a role that came just before her Oscar winning role in A Beautiful Mind. Burstyn is absolutely fabulous in her role, and clearly overshadows everything that won Julia Roberts her Oscar that year. Every supporting character, from Christopher McDonald's turn as infomercial king Tappy Tibbons to Keith David as the twisted Big Tim, to all the even lesser supporting characters, all are put to screen excellently and only complement the main actors.<br/><br/>The writing is an absolute marvel. I cannot even begin to imagine what some of the sequences look like in Selby Jr.'s novel, but I can only come to think of them either being nowhere near as good as those created by Selby Jr and Aronofsky during the creation of the film. Watching some of the features on the DVD only helps to make the viewer feel more aware of all the planning and implementation that went into creating these gorgeous and appealing shots from the film. This is a Generation X film through and through, and the way it has been created only helps to make it more of a marvel six years later.<br/><br/>But while the performances are all excellent, it's the style of the film that makes it absolutely unforgettable. Shots are all over the place. From crazy tracking shots, to shots of both characters view points, to the absolutely insane cuts all over the film, it all makes for a fantastic visual pleasure for the eyes. There are a few grainy scenes, but they only make the authenticity of other scenes become that much better. The cinematography and art direction are just astounding. Every piece of digital and normal camera work put into the film is put to the test here, and works magnificently in the final product. Not once does the editing falter, and not once do any of the visual elements not work. They all have been meticulously created to look and feel real, and they work as a result.<br/><br/>This is just one of those films you cannot forget, and cannot keep your eyes off of after it starts. It is brilliant in every sense of the word, and deserved more praise than it ever got. The fact that it was nominated and lost its one Best Actress nomination is an absolute travesty. It is a visual treasure, and a true thought provoker. I was enthralled from the beginning to the end, and just cannot believe I waited so long to see it.<br/><br/>Don't make the same mistake I did. See it now, before the opportunity evades you.<br/><br/>10/10."

I can see what the point is - anti-drugs hoohaa etc. but there is better and more interesting ways of doing it. Trainspotting is the film this film tries to be. It's not big, it's not clever and it's not funny.<br/><br/>The direction is amateurish. A particular scene that is shot 'cleverly' has the old mother sitting at the breakfast table before, in rapid cuts, her breakfast is eaten...yawn! Why use rapid cuts for a scene like this? The drugs scenes don't immerse the viewer in what it's like to actually take drugs, rather all the viewer gets is a quick burst of fancy camera-work and some people dancing while being extremely happy...MDMA one suspects! An opportunity badly missed, this could be totally revamped and probably make a good film but until that day ignore this title and watch Trainspotting...really can't stress enough how disappointing this film is!"

","This movie is as you might suspect given the many reviews which are before and after not quite what it appears to be and that is why whatever it looks or sounds like it is not what you get.The confusing premise is that there is virtually no ability to balance the tables.What does that mean?This movie is not honest,thats what it means.The horrible opening scene has this young white male attempting as we are to quickly learn, to virtually steal his mothers television set and sell it for a few bucks so he might buy drugs.His mother has the television chained to the radiator so as not to lose touch with whatever reality the television represents but passes the key to of all people her son the drug addict who is threatening her from behind a locked door.Here the author establishes a relationship that is in a nutshell what he is trying to figure out.Though this young person,her son is nothing but a liar and everyone associated with him share and provide impetus for his and there lying ways even unto the death of the other through lethal injection.That lethal injection is a main lining shot of Heroin which these characters are guilty of being part of which involves a loss of a limb as well as the death of the lie that they lived under.However the other end of this film is the relationship of the television to this kids mother which as it turns out is made to appear to be selling drugs of another sort.The weight reducing hysteria turns television and its programs into an accomplice to another kind of tragedy that involves the power of suggestion and the extremely cruel and aggressive nature of having influence over society by way of its programing and power as such.The film continues to show such grossly unjust and even indecent characterizations that we are really forced to look elsewhere for the answer as to the reason why this would exist at all,even if it is dishonest.This film is championing getting your way and believing it is indeed your way even as you are about to die of a overdose of heroin.The source then is not a reliable gauge as to value and contributes to the demise of society by providing a influence that is indecent.It is one thing in this world that we live in to be taken advantage of but it is another to be forced into an idealogical state that does not provide anything else but that.How can in all the world a system baring witness to undue influence,unfair power over and a lie to boot be looked at as the source of anything but an inhuman aggregate with gang like assumptions.It is not so smart to suggest that this film is providing the eclipse of life unto death even through its title,""Requiem for a Dream"".The Dream it seams is dead,however that may not be the worst thing because it hardly had a chance in this world of the power of suggestion and here we are touching upon reality and the effect it has had upon the human race.If you get put off by this well this is what this picture is about.It is symbolic of an intent to kill honesty it is also bears witness to a foreign power in the likes of the influence of the technology that bears malice for its victims and is of such a predatory nature as to be a threat to civilization and even world peace.This discourse is not for the benefit of the writer nor does it provide an answer to anything but getting ones way which is why I cannot give the writer credit but can suggest that the influence written of, got what it wanted, credit for getting its way.Everything in its wake is lessened by such an accomplishment and even more so we are provided with a lie.This film has all the earmarks of a spear aimed at the heart of the human race.Just so you will know with so much power you must be selling something?I do not recommend this film outside of its political importance and that I believe you should be warned as well because it is a living breathing reality that made for this film and it is a living breathing reality that made it possible.That is what this film did, it provided an ability to know reality and if your wise enough you will be forewarned of its coming.Don't sell the sell short it means what it suggests and it intends to convince you that it means to get its way."
"FilmOtaku","7","4","7","7 April 2003"," A Frenetic, Visually Stunning Addition to Film History
","I have to admit, I have wanted to watch RFAD for a couple of years now. However, I let other people's opinions keep me from seeing it, which is something I don't normally tend to do.  Everyone who has recommended it to me has said, ""You will LOVE this movie, it is so dark and heavy.  It's REALLY dark and REALLY heavy.""  So for a couple of years, I've had it on the back burner but hadn't actually picked it up. RFAD seems to have become a staple on some of the ""pay"" movie channels on cable, and on Friday night it was a choice of one of my DVDs, Swingers on HBO or RFAD.  I chose RFAD and was cautiously delighted.<br/><br/>I will preface this review by stating that I have not yet seen Aronofsky's first film, ""Pi"" so I am uncertain if the visual style in RFAD is his normal M-O, but I was thrilled.  The use of color, vibrant during the character's high points during these months, and sallow during the more prevalent low times was subtle yet stylishly done.  The frenetic cinematography is something that has been used often in the last couple of years and is becoming more and more mainstream, but I believe at this time it wasn't as overused as it is today.  Even if it is not original, it's effect is very heavy on the viewer. The use of drugs was primarily limited to very quick montages (similar to ones done in Snatch) that got the point across without being too graphic. Additionally, the scene with Ellen Burstyn waiting in the doctor's office in the last act of the film was extremely frightening, due in large part to the brilliant camera work and the sound.<br/><br/>In regard to sound, I am very picky when it comes to music use in films. Being a product of an MTV generation and having studied video production I am sensitive to when music is appropriately placed in films.  The effective use of techno music in films is rare, Run Lola Run is one of the few films that come to mind, but I can add RFAD to this list.  The score is also extremely haunting; it compliments the action and the characters.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the acting.  This movie would have simply been stylish with a decent story without the incredible performances of the four principle players.  Jared Leto was very good as Harry Goldfarb.  He conveyed the struggle between his reality and his drug-enhanced reality very well. I wasn't expecting much from the ""cute guy"" in My So Called Life.  And Marlon Wayans.. talk about not expecting much.  I'm not a big fan of comedic films unless they were made before 1960 generally, so I am not well schooled in the Wayans Family.  Marlon Wayans'character was less dimensional than Leto's but sympathetic nonetheless.  I've never been a fan of Jennifer Connelly. I remember sitting through her C-grade films in the 80's and early 90's with boyfriends who would readily admit she was a terrible actress but that she was a goddess because she was beautiful.  Of course, none of these films included a gorgeous male co-star (Frank Whaley? I think not.) so I couldn't dip into that superficial fantasy world that would make those films more endurable.  This movie was definitely a welcome change.  Whereas I was rolling my eyes during her early performance in the film, her acting drew me in to her character and eventually made me both pity and feel repelled by her.<br/><br/>And finally, Ellen Burstyn.  This woman is not used enough.  I remember when she was nominated for an Oscar for this role, they showed her clip, then they showed her in the audience and I was literally shocked by both her beauty and the transformation into abject dowdiness in this role.  It is Burstyn's performance in this film that terrified me.  Perhaps it was because we actually see the origins of her addiction from beginning to end. Nevertheless, her performance made me ache.  It made my heart hurt.  I've seen Burstyn in several other films, but based on this film alone I want to see more.  She was amazing.<br/><br/>For two days after I watched this movie, I sat back and had to figure out whether I liked this movie or not.   I knew that I liked the technical aspects, and having attended film school that's the first thing I base my opinion on.  During the weekend, the movie was always in the back of my head, but I still was sorting out whether or not I truly liked it.  Then this morning I came to a realization.  I liked this movie in the same light as I liked Schindler's List.  Both movies are brilliantly directed with excellent performances, and they were both extremely thought provoking. However, they are so heavy and compelling that one can't take it out to watch it on a regular basis without climbing into your own Bell Jar.<br/><br/>Bottom Line:  A must-see.  Just make sure you don't watch it before you head to work at your gig as a Clown for Hire at little Susie's birthday party."

Films like 'Crash', 'Fight Club', 'Traffic', 'Babel', 'Hotel Rwanda' all have that in common. I can see through the sleek, transparent surface right through to the disingenuous, morally righteous and self-espousing garbage at it's core. The film tells many stories, with one message: Drugs are bad. Stay away. Bad. All it does is serve as a reminder just how Harvard educated Darren Aronofsky is and how little he knows about the real world and / or drug abuse to craft this fantasy and pass it off as an educational lesson. The film is powdered donut disguised as art. It is a void. There is nothing. Nada at it's center. Just a man, the director, using cinema (the ultimate weapon) as a mouthpiece for a sheltered and one dimensional world view. Having rested on his laurels for years after making this film, grinning with pride at his achievement.. I wonder whether.. he ever.. thinks.. about.. what it is.. he... actually.. made... The characters are non existent, except as purely functional devices to propel Aronofsky's 'cool' vision to his target audience, and boy did it hit the target audience all right, this film was lapped up by every film major east and west, degrading a generation of potential artists into thinking this was how it was done. Sad, sad, sad, sad, and not in the way the director intended.."

","I give this one out of ten to emphasise that I do not think this should be in the IMDb top 250. Undoubtedly it is an honest, somewhat rare and powerful attack on heroin, uppers and cocaine. The acting and pace are good too. What spoilt it for me was the special effects and sound effects constantly over laboured the horrors of drug withdrawal and the psychological impact it brought. As another person has commented I felt I was being bluntly manipulated into a situation where I would feel 'devastated' by the whole experience. Knowing that this was the case I consciously switched off from these bits. I have no objections to a film which leaves me emotionally whacked out, but I prefer it to be done in a more subtle way."
"PIST-OFF","1","8","18","17 April 2003"," Everything that DARE warned you about
","Oh how I loathe this movie! The first thing that came to mind after watching it was the two hours I wasted hoping something would happen. The second thing that came to mind was the line in Trainspotting ""people always focus on the misery, death, and despair around heroin, and that's not to be ignored. But what they forget is the pleasure of it. After all we're not f**king stupid"" This movie does seem to forget the pleasure and just assume that it's stupid charecters are REALLY stupid. I have no pity for any of the charecters who never seem to question their own motives (a quality I quite liked in Renton). The charecter played by Ellen Burstyn is especially nauseating. It took all my mental faculties to prevent myself from fast forwarding through her highly annoying parts. How can anyone feel sorry for a diet crazy, TV addict? And I may not know much about diet pills, but I seriously doubt that you begin to visually hallucinate from them.<br/><br/>
I guess what I'm really trying to get at is how is this anti-drug propaganda any diffrent from the infamous and laughable drug propaganda of the late 1930's????? I'm reminded of Reefer Madness and The Devil's Harvest. While those movies deal with marajuana which has arguably never harmed anyone, and this movie deals with heroin which has helped ruin or at least sidetrack many people's lives, the blame game in either movie sounds the same. Since human beings have a free will and drugs do not, the shift of blame should fall entirely on the humans and their choices. The unanswerable question for the charecters in this lame movie is this: Drugs or otherwise, if these people were this stupid to have gotten themselves in these situations, how far would they have gone anyways??????????????<br/><br/>I'm so disappointed by Darren Aronofsky. I really enjoyed Pi."

","""Requiem For a Turd"".<br/><br/>I can't shake off the nasty feeling that this is yet another thinly disguised attack at modern America (hence Capitalism), presenting it in a hysterically negative light, exaggerating every step of the way with absurdly immoral doctors, cops, and just about everyone else. A bleak mood is all well and fine, but let's not get carried away...<br/><br/>In fact, I checked out Hubert Selby's biography - and ""surprise"": yet another anti-American American. ""Last Exit To Brooklyn"" is also manic, laughable and designed to be controversial rather than intelligent. The fact that this talentless writer has been championed by people such as Allen Ginsberg and Henry Rollins really says it all... Henry Rollins has a brain the size of a peanut.<br/><br/>As if it weren't bad enough that Aronofsky thought that no-one else had covered drug use in movies before - what with same-old-same-old clichés of junkies stealing, dealing, and drooling - but the movie actually uses drug addiction as a cover to criticize the medical profession and law enforcement in a way in which an ignorant, radicalized, and endlessly naive 17 year-old hippie normally would. America - as seen through the eyes of someone who is so very disillusioned with his country. That moves me to tears. Really touching. Please hand me a handkerchief, the tears are threatening to drown me! Maybe the writers should move to Zambia, Colombia, or Mongolia and see how they like it there... See what a cruel life is really all about, the spoilt whining ninnies...<br/><br/>Requiem of a dream? Quite clearly it's the American Dream that is meant here.<br/><br/>I have always been amazed how so many people, both Americans and non-Americans, misunderstand the idea of the American Dream. They think that in theory it guarantees everyone success and a happy and prosperous life. That's utter nonsense, of course. Only Marxists believe in such a JohnLennonian world. All four central characters in ROAD have sub-par intelligence, which is obvious from almost everything they say - and do (especially). America doesn't and cannot guarantee everyone to realize their potential, simply because some people don't have any! Every society is going to have its misfits, losers - and whiners.<br/><br/>It's hard not to see the laughable irony in Aronofsky - a man living the America Dream, for all practical purposes - making a movie in which he proclaims the notion to be dead. However, as far as Selby is concerned, I can understand him to an extent: this man had been bed-ridden and seriously ill for most of his life so I can understand how bitter that can make a person become... This is no excuse, of course.<br/><br/>Sure the States has a health care problem, but to so one-sidedly portray all those involved in it as parasites and lunatics is going a bit too far. ROAD is also complete with the obligatory Southern racist cop who so very predictably hits Wayans for no reason and calls him a ""nigger"". Selby's novel ""The Room"" is about evil cops imprisoning innocent people (according to liberals, a thing that happens 150,000 times a day).<br/><br/>The only reason I gave this pretentious drama 3 points is because there was at least some attempt at experimentation (otherwise ROAT would have been an extremely dull movie) and for the very interesting soundtrack.<br/><br/>I wasn't too thrilled with the cast picked here. Jared Leto, yet another bland androgynous midget, an always overrated Burstyn, plus I also have to question the intelligence in picking a Wayans brother - and Marlon at that! - to play in a heavy-handed drama like this. If you want to make a serious drama, a word of advice: GET SOME SERIOUS ACTORS.

"Spleen","2","5","10","5 August 2001"," Well, THAT was a waste of a good title.
","You need a strong stomach for this film, just as you need a strong stomach to drink seawater.  In both cases, what's the point?  Watching Aronofsky's film isn't so much like drinking seawater as being rubbed all over with sandpaper - a treatment painful beyond belief, yet superficial.  No doubt Aronofsky STARTED with the intention of saying something about the Oprah Winfrey ""follow your dream"" mentality, but that idea was lost or buried in the early planning stages; all that he successfully demonstrates is how bad heroin and those colourful little weight loss tablets are.  For most people it's not worth finding out.  We already knew THAT they were bad.  If a few souls are dissuaded from taking these substances I suppose that will justify the film, more than compensating for my suffering and for the fact that it's a rotten work of art.<br/><br/>In ""Pi"" (which wasn't a rotten work of art) Aronofsky showed that he didn't know how to use black and white; here he shows he doesn't know how to use colour, either.  I didn't know it was possible to get that sewage-filtered look on film - I thought you needed digital tape.  And if Aronofsky wants miserable overcast lighting, that's fine, I really have no quarrel, but he should wait for the sun to stop shining before trying to get it.  It's that modern auteur's disease, the desire to achieve all visual effects by manipulating the camera, without trying first to manipulate what's in front of the camera.  Hence also that jarring split screen effect.  At one point Aronofsky even splits the screen to get both his actors in the same frame, when they're lying together in the same bed.  A director with any sense would have tried asking them to lie closer together.<br/><br/>The terrible thing is that Aronofsky is talented.  The difference between his technique and, say, Oliver Stone's, is the difference between thought and bombast; you know where Aronofsky's going with his visual gimmicks, even if there's usually a better way he could have got there.  This is more true in ""Requiem"" than in ""Pi"".  Aronofsky is getting better at making worse movies.  It's frightening to think how bad his next one will be, if he improves any more."
"danw400","3","6","13","29 August 2002"," over-editing
","Well, i saw this movie and was rather disappointed.  In my opinion, it was gruesomely over-edited with that snappy ""MTV-style"" (i hate the way MTV does it too) editing, flashing all about.  It really makes me think my attention span was too long for this movie... I understand why he (when I use he, I'm referring to the director) was doing it like this, to create a feeling of anxiety and intensity, but like many things, its WAY overdone.  He certainly had good intentions, ""drugs are bad"" and all that, but the way he did it kind of felt blunt and cold like a drugs class at school. I couldn't really relate personally with the sorrows of the main characters, and most of the arguments he presents seem to argue more for legalization of drugs than not doing them.  It seems that most of their problems would have been solved merely by a more accepting open-minded societal outlook towards drugs, and just not being stupid.  (trying not to point out any spoilers...) For example, the lady taking drugs to lose weight? was she out of her mind? not to mention her gradually stepping up the dosage.  As with what happens to her son, i knew what they problem was the minute i saw it, and knew the consequences if he soon didnt get it fixed from that point early in the movie.  The one good point I'd really like to point out is how they dont really distinguish between legal and illegal drugs, as with the lady popping pills that her doctor gave her, anything in moderation wont hurt you, and anything abused will, despite whether or not your doctor recommends it to you.  I've known some people in my time who have become pretty messed up on perfectly legal drugs, and they dont even really exceed the dosage (to my knowledge).  There's not a miracle pill cure for everything, but our society seems to think there is, so pop the pill and everything will be better...<br/><br/>Anyways, I'm off track, point is, the motives were clear, the message wasn't, and the editing gave me a headache, i gave it a 3/10."

This movie reflects nothing, all it tries to tell the watcher comes ready, like an instant noodle, nothing to think about. There is no more than a single point of view here, and a very questionable one. What is the point of this movie, seriously? Screaming stuff like ""drugs are bad"" during 2 hours?

"jorn-truyen","9","3","5","1 September 2014"," A disturbing and memorable cinematic experience
","Disturbing. I suppose that's the best summary of my experience, watching Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem For a Dream' for the second time. This stylish drama has a great deal to give in terms of style and story. <br/><br/>Basically, the film's about four people dealing in their own way with an addiction. Harry (Jared Leto), his companion Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and his girlfriend Marion are heroin fiends, trying to scrap enough money together to escape from it all. Television is Sara Goldfarb's (Harry's mother, Ellen Burstyn) drug, and thinking she's going to be on a game show, she is determined to lose weight and begins a pill-diet.<br/><br/>On the surface, addiction is central in this film. But honestly, I think 'Requiem for a dream' isn't about addiction, but rather about trying to get away from it all, alienation, an escapism which creates a division between the real world and the dreams. All four drug-addled characters strive to escape from reality, which they almost seem to achieve but then fall back into the real world. Sara wants to lose weight so she can wear her red dress and feel younger again. Aronofosky covers these interesting human themes with the motive of drug addiction, and that makes it a very sad film. This film stays with you, and Aronofsky gives you this lasting impression with the great climax. The naturalistic plot of deterioration has a shattering climax, enhanced by the soundtrack. Everything comes together, it is a climactic mix of drama, horror, sadness, relief, acceptance.<br/><br/>Aside from the story, 'Requiem for a Dream' is even more about atmosphere. extreme close-ups of the characters' sweaty faces, long tracking shots and time-lapse photography create an atmosphere of mystery, sadness and tragedy. Aronofsky shows the characters isolation via these devices: Harry and Marion are lying together but the close-ups only show one character; In one of the most impressive scenes of the film, the time-lapse technique shows a lot of people hovering around Sara, while she wanders around the city, isolated. Furthermore, Burstyn's acting performance is just at the right level, the soundtrack is excellent and I mean to give a compliment when the film reminded me of a certain Stanley Kubrick."

Especially Jared Letos work is stunning although other main characters perform excellently as well. One might find the movie very depressing and sad but that might be the aim of Aronofsky the director to get that kind of mood in his masterwork.

","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS<br/><br/>""Requiem for a dream ""obviously has got strong acting . Jennifer Connelly shows much more talent here than in her awarded performance in ""Beautiful mind"" ( by the way it was good performance) . Ellen Burstyn was rightfully nominated for Oscar for her performance as the mother of main hero. Jared Leto isn't bad either and Aronofsky deserves some respect for turning Wayans into a serious actor (at least for one movie).<br/><br/>The music by Clint Mansell is a classic by now . Strong , haunting , memorable. As a visual experience ""Requiem"" is also attractive . The montage took a lot of work and time to look so impressive . They should nominate ""Requiem "" for best editing.<br/><br/>Putting aside the technical strengths and good acting , "" Requiem for a dream"" fails as a movie for me. The whole thing feels like a MTV drama . It's loud , colorful , sometimes shocking and as deep as average music video shown on that channel.<br/><br/>Many people who praise ""Requiem"" admits that they have seen the movie only once , because they were to afraid to watch it again . I strongly recommend that you should watch this movie at least 2-3 times . If you watch it only once the shock might fool you that you have seen something deep and thought provoking . If you watch it again you will notice how cold , calculated and mechanical this movie really is . Drugs are bad – says Aronofsky and that's really the only thing he has got to say . Everything else is just a distraction.<br/><br/>The characters are barely written . The relationship between Leto and Burstyn , love between Leto and Connelly , friendship between Leto and Wayans – it's all incredibly thin and barely touched . Connelly's character is an terrible cliché – daughter of a rich people , she feels unloved because her parents care only about money , she feels lonely , her parents are far away and left her with a guardian , bla bla bla . If it wasn't for Connelly I wouldn't care about her character at all . She was able to bring some soul into such lame character . The movie also never explains or develops Wayans past ( one flashback with his mother and that's it ? Really ?) same as never gives the viewers a little bit more information on Leto's and Burstyn's family life.<br/><br/>""Requiem"" also has got some serious plot problems . Connelly is a daughter of rich people. They give her lot of money , yet when she needs the money the most , in critical situation of the story , they ""magically"" disappear not leaving any trace where they can be . The powerful drug dealer that rules the whole town has incredible money and power . Yet , he's not able to find a girl for himself !? That's a chance for Connelly to get some money ?! In real life he would be surrounded by at least few girl's , but not here . Here Aronofsky needs to break Connelly's character emotionally , so he crates two terribly unrealistic situations for a large dramatic effect.<br/><br/>I think it's stupid that Leto kept injecting drugs in ONE PLACE OF HIS BODY . Even when his arm is ALL PURPLE AND LOOKING F****** TERRIBLE ?! Seriously , how stupid is that ?! I'm not a junkie , but I wouldn't never do that . I've seen also a documentary about junkies . They inject drugs in different places on the body to prevent danger . They aren't retarded as the movie suggest. And it's no way possible that doctor in hospital would call police first and not take care of the sick arm first . I also ""love"" the description of America in this movie. EVERY doctor , cop or prison guard is a cold blooded sadist or uncaring bastard at best . So you see , our heroes are living in such OPPRESIVE country that they HAD TO become junkies .<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is basically an marathon of torture for each hero. Aronofsky plays with viewers emotions in a rather primitive way (4 tragedies combined together instead of one). ""Saw"" has more subtlety. Funny thing – on repeated viewings , when the element of surprise is gone , you will find that there's no heart , no real emotion hidden in ""Requiem"".<br/><br/>I give it 5/10 . Maybe the pure shock will keep some people away from drugs . That's a good thing . Except that , ""Requiem"" is more of MTV video instead of art . Style over substance . More shock than a message. Movies like ""Naked lunch "" or ""Fear and loathing in Las Vegas"" are better movies about drugs."

","A tremendous movie, one of those ones that couldn't be improved in any way, shape or form. The script explores the nature of drug addiction on four different characters, showing how it grips and degrades them in different ways.<br/><br/>Aronofsky, previously only known for indie hit PI, works wonders as director. He incorporates plenty of frenzied editing and stylish flourishes in a way that complements the story rather than distracts from it. Some of his work, like the chest-mounted cameras, is sublime and gets us into the heads of the characters like never before.<br/><br/>Of the cast, Ellen Burstyn towers head and shoulders above the rest in a performance that can only be described as haunting - perhaps one of the most haunting acting turns you'll ever see. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connolly share equally interesting story lines and are both strong, while what a surprise it is to discover that Marlon Wayans can actually act! The subject matter is grim indeed, with imagery that will stay with you long after watching. Pretty much the definitive look at drug addiction, this is a film that should be shown in every school."

If you're looking for entertainment then this is not where you should be looking at because this is certainly not a feel good kinda film. The movie is about four people who become victims of drug addiction. The director has mainly concentrated on misery and the darker side of emotions. From start to finish it's a sad yet interesting and clever film. Darren's style of brutal portrayal of a story is evident.<br/><br/>Coming to the music score, well it's definitely remarkable. It's kept simple and subtle yet so moving. The background score makes the scene even more dramatic and scintillating than it already is and it keeps us hooked to the screen till the end.<br/><br/>The cinematography is simply brilliant. The wide angle shots, the close ups of the characters, the effects is perfect for this genre. Overall, Requiem for a Dream is a hard hitting, depressing, disturbing yet beautifully made which makes it hard not to watch it. So I recommend this movie for anyone because it brings out emotions that you never knew you had it in you."

The main characters mother sitting in a lawn chair, then walking to a mailbox with a bunch of her friends isn't really the appropriate time for a heart wrenching song, with the drive of a scifi theme-song.<br/><br/>After the 15th or 16th closeup of a pupil being dilated, I felt like shouting out ""WE GET THE POINT!"".<br/><br/>Those are the movies only real downfalls. If you're into trendy film making, you will probably enjoy this a lot more than I have. I've seen better movies about drug addiction.<br/><br/>I was pretty reluctant to see this when it first came out, but since about 10-20 people have told me this is their favorite film of all time: I had to sit through it at least once.

","It's a powerful, technically brilliant film, but to me it plays more like a graphic afterschool special than a poignant work of art. I understand the message of showing the negative affects of drugs on the human body, but the film makes everything so extreme that it goes to the point of unrealism and almost humor about how graphic and morbid it has to make these people's lives in order to try to get it's message across. I would have understood that drugs are bad without seeing Leto's arm chopped off, Connelly made into a pathetic lowly whore getting screamed at by old men to shove a dildo in her ass while gyrating the other end with another young lady, Burstyn going clinically insane and being electroshocked (a technique that hasn't been used since the 80s) graphically and Wayans experiencing racism while stirring some potatoes. It just takes everything way too far into the extreme for me to appreciate it anymore. In terms of comparing it to the book, it suffers the same flaw that Fight Club does. It puts all of it's attention on one subject matter (the negative affects of drug use) and leaves the rest virtually nonexistent (the beautiful relationship between Harry and Marion turned into bitter hatred on the surface but remaining deep love internally, the strong connection of Harry and Tyrone turned into a distant mutual understanding of being around each other just so they can get another score, pretty much the entire story with Tyrone and his mother, etc. etc.) It puts little touches on these things, but brings them up and then jumps right back into the anti-drug message for 95% of the duration."

","I echo most of the negative comments, but the main problem I had with the film was my continual questioning of events as the story progressed. Drugs are bad, and that is fine, but they are NOT that hard to find. In essence, the problems faced by half of the cast was a result of the scarcity of narcotics in NEW YORK CITY. Should I find this scenario credible? One can manage heroin addiction using prescription painkillers (which is what folks like this would have resorted to), rather than driving 600 miles away or engaging in an uncomfortable orgy. They could have scored some dilaudid, hydrocodone, oxycontin, or even methadone to get them through the dry streak. Two thousand dollars in hand, and not an idea about what to do? <br/><br/>Actors all did fine. The characters were unsympathetic. The story is depressing but simultaneously leaves one reticent for the fact that there are not many redeeming qualities exhibited by the users. Tyrone and Marion did not have shocking denouements...their path is standard for many users. Emotionally manipulating...visuals were fair...story was simple-minded. I was underwhelmed, and I do not find this film to be particularly artsy, though I will grant that it is daring in some sense."

The plot has been summarized enough here, but suffice it to say that it's one of the grimmest, heaviest films I've seen  and I've seen a fair amount. Requiem plays as an agonizing train wreck that ends without any hope whatsoever for our main characters. This film is full of moments where I wanted to grab the characters and force them to stop their self-destructive behavior. It really is gut-wrenching and is very tough to watch  viewer take caution.<br/><br/>Now that I think about it, Requiem reminds me of the more recent Passion of the Christ. Both are very well shot, edited and produced, but are tough to call entertaining and certainly not the kind of movies you'd pop in on a rainy day. While Requiem for a Dream is very much an anti-drug film, the message I got out of the film is: Your actions have consequences. As I watched the heartbreaking scene near the end, where Sara's two elderly friends sit on a bench outside the hospital and sob after visiting her, I couldn't help but wonder if Aronofsky had people in his own life who were destroyed by drug addiction.<br/><br/>So while I hesitantly recommend Requiem for a Dream, it's not the kind of film I'd care to own, and is certainly not for children or the squeamish. Powerful, brutal, and nightmarish, this film will have you questioning if you drink too much coffee. You may think I'm kidding, but I'm not."
"preg4810","5","3","5","30 September 2003"," Not as good as everyone thinks
","I know I'm in the minority on this, but I found this movie to be more hype than content. This to me, is a classic example that just because a movie ultra-realistically depicts the ups and downs of addiction, doesn't make it good. The acting is fantastic, especially Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto, who in my opinion gives the best performance of his young career, but at times, especially the end, this movie seems to get morbid just for shock value. I find myself not rooting for the character, but just waiting for it to end. While it realistically shows the lives of four people, all reaching out for their dreams, there is really no hope that they'll succeed, they all seems doomed to failure from the beginning, and redemption seems to be nowhere in sight."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","3","5","27 July 2001"," Do not watch while under the influence of ANYTHING.
","**SPOILERS**Drugs, alcohol, painkillers, don't even watch this if you've taken ASPIRIN within the last 24 hours. Requiem For A Dream is extremely moving and powerful and REAL and it could only bring out the worst of any type of mind-altering substance. I watched this film stone sober and in the middle of the night, and when it was over I was almost afraid that the sun wasn't going to come up in the morning. This is one of the most powerful anti-drug movies to have been released in years.<br/><br/>And the thing that really sets this film apart is that it is not a crash course in all of the bad side effects of drugs. There are numerous characters in several different storylines that all converge and deliver a unique message. This is one of the things that made movies like American Beauty so good, there is just so much going on. The film is a spiraling downfall for all of the characters involved, but it manages to have an unusually strong impact because of its realism, which is ironic because one of the film's strong points is its striking use of editing. There is a constant use of creative and disorienting editing and cinematography, which gives the film a feeling of being a little off at all times, but it manages to remain realistic enough not to lose any impact.<br/><br/>As far as editing, I was particularly impressed with the creative use of the split screen. The film starts off with a scene in which Harry (Jared Leto) borrows his mother's television set, and she is so upset that she locks herself in the other room. In the split screen, we see Harry from two different angles, and on one side, we see broken shots, while the other side shows continuous action. This is done with multiple cameras, so it's not the sheer difficulty that I noticed as much as the creativeness. And of course, being a drug film, it is full of interesting and sometimes disturbing editing and cinematography.<br/><br/>Jared Leto is excellent as Harry Goldfarb, a junkie who wants to sell enough drugs to really support himself, his girlfriend, his partner in trafficking (Tyrone), and most importantly, his mother. The relationship between Harry and his mother Sarah is the one from which the majority of the emotion in the film is derived, as well as from his girlfriend Marion's descent into drug-induced prostitution. Ellen Burstyn is stunningly effective as Sarah Goldfarb, Harry's mother, who lives exactly the existence that you spend your entire youth hoping to never have to live. She is alone, she's overweight and unattractive, and she's so obsessed with getting onto a stupid TV show just one time that she goes on such an intense crash diet that she literally drives herself insane. The antagonistic refrigerator, by the way, is one of the more interesting things about the film, and should also be noted for its originality. What was the last respectable film you saw in which an inanimate object like a refrigerator was made to have such a successfully menacing presence? Jennifer Connelly has changed dramatically from the cute actress that we saw in older movies like Labyrinth and Career Opportunities and The Rocketeer. In Requiem For A Dream, she delivers a spectacular performance, proving her skill as an actor. But it is the performance from Marlon Wayans that is by far the most surprising and noteworthy. He plays the part of Tyrone with such amazing skill that it is almost impossible to believe that this is the same idiot that we saw in the god-awful Scary Movies. Way to go, Marlon, but stick with the movies that can be enjoyed by people with more than one brain cell in operation, like Requiem For A Dream.<br/><br/>(spoilers) Another thing that this movie does on more than one occasion is give an example of How People Get Like That. Every time I see or hear about a homeless person or a mental patient (which is not often, I admit) or a woman so strung out on drugs that she would sell her body to get her fix, I always wonder what must have happened in that person's life for them to have wound up like that. Requiem For A Dream provides a perfectly plausible story in which a nice but rather pathetic woman becomes obsessed with her chance to appear on television and winds up getting electro-shock therapy against her will in a mental hospital, and then we see that Marion winds up engaging in lesbian shows for crowds of drunken jerk-offs, and Harry shoots up so much in the same arm that he has to have it amputated. These are the kinds of things that make you wonder how they got like that, and in this movie we see how it happened and its believable.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is not one of the most cheery movies I've ever seen, in fact, it is downright disturbing at many points, but it is powerful and effective and should be noted for that. The film is photographed and edited in creative and interesting ways, which not only makes it fascinating to watch but also enhances the drug element of the film, which was also a technique used with huge success in the must more well known film Traffic. There is a lot of difficult to watch material in this movie, but it is a very well thought out film. Not for the weak of heart, but this is an excellent piece of cinematography."
"Coventry","5","17","51","2 September 2004"," Drugs are bad, mmmkay?
","Requiem for a Dream must be one of the most unnecessarily overhyped films of the last few decades. By no means it's a bad film butis it really worth all the praising it gets and the commotion it caused? After all, Darren Aranofski's film based on the novel by Herbert Selby is only stating the obvious Drugs are bad and they will, eventually, lead you into a downward spiral of madness and destroy your life. When talking about the screenplay, Requiem for a Dream has nothing new or extraordinary to offer. We follow the unhealthy actions of 4 people. Jarred Leto and Marlon Wayans star as two Coney Island junkies who want to get rich fast and easy by dealing drugs. Leto's character Harry is doing it all for his beautiful girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) so she can open her very own fashion store, selling her proper designs. Ellen Burstyn puts down an amazing performance as Leto's TV-addicted mother who gets hooked on diet pills after she's made believe to appear on her favorite show. <br/><br/>I repeat, Requiem for a Dream certainly isn't a bad film. It even is a very well elaborated story with fascinating acting. But the main problem, I think, is that Arranofski too easily thinks that he created a controversial shocker. And that's not the caseIt might look like he directed the perfect ""Anti-Drug-Therapy"" movie to him, but he's about 10 years too late for that. Fans of art-house cinema will merely look at it as `been there, seen that'. The visual experiments often annoy and the characters are a bit too shallow to feel any compassion for. The musical score, however, is simply brilliant and probably even the most powerful aspect about the entire film. Although I haven't been able to find it yet, I'm expecting a lot more from `Last Exit to Brooklyn', which was also adapted from a Herbert Selby novel. Requiem for a Dream is recommendedbut please don't rate it 10 out of 10 here on this site. It's already ranked way too high in the IMDb top 250."

But this was not explored at all.<br/><br/>This film only showed finesse at showing human degradation. Frankly, that's the easy part. And this director definitely looked down his nose on his subjects.

","Requiem for a Dream is an incredibly unique film. Not just because of it's subject matter (drug use is hardly infrequent in films these days), but because of the feeling it gives the viewer during and for a long time after the film has ended.<br/><br/>The best word to describe Requiem is 'heartbreaking'. It is shocking, disturbing, moving and heartbreaking. I won't give too much away but the feeling you get once the film has ended is one of extreme emptiness. I didn't know how to feel after the first time I'd watched it. I cried like a baby, but I felt more than just sadness. The second time I watched it, I watched the first fifteen minutes of the film and then the last fifteen minutes. The contrast is incredible, and it was this that made me feel so empty.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing. Marlon Wayans was excellent in a serious role, Jared Leto was perfect as Harry, who wants to do right by his loved ones and get rich at the same time. Jennifer Connelly portrays strong-willed Marion, who ultimately loses her dignity to get her fix. One of the most shocking things other than the film itself is the fact that Ellen Burstyn was overlooked for the Best Actress Oscar. How the Academy could have thought anyone gave a better performance that year (or any other year for that matter) is beyond me. Her portrayal of Harry's desperately lonely mother is the key to this film being so powerful.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is a tragic film that grabs your emotions from the very beginning, takes them on a roller-coaster, then squeezes the life out of them before battering them to a pulp. The most incredible, breathtaking and ultimately heartbreaking film I've ever seen, and one that will remain at the top of my favourite films list for a long time to come. You may not be able to watch it more than once but I urge anyone to rent it out and give yourself the cinematic experience of a lifetime."

Another music video adapted into a film, how many fancy visual tricks and stupid 'trippy' scenes do you want in one film? Well Requiem has more than you could ever wish for - split screen (done to death better on UK television dramas), computer altered dilating eyes, a snappy 'shoot up' sequence that is used about 50 times, imaginary food falling from the ceiling, fridges that want to come and eat you and hundreds more, it's all so much fun you might wet your pants in elation.

By far the worst, most annoying feature of the film though is the sound track. It's just the same track over and over with the tacky strings section at the beginning and end, boooooring! Also just as predictable and bland is the story, the writer should have taken the same stuff as the director, maybe then he would have thought up some interesting plot developments and characters. The only character who was any fun was Sara while she was tripping out and dancing about like a loony. As for the rest of them, well I was rooting for them to all OD and get off the bloody screen! What a bunch of sappy losers, maybe if their dreams and emotions were illustrated better at the start I would care, but they start chewing scenery and getting high far too quickly and they are then promptly thrown about in the wacky world of the directors twisted vision like so much vomit getting flushed down the pan.

","An unflinching, dark, gritty exploration into the life of an addict with no hope and no positivity. It still holds up as perfect example of excellent film making. Every shot is purposeful and conveys the emotional impact of the situations on the characters. No second is wasted. <br/><br/>The pacing builds with the film, beginning with long, slow scenes and becoming quicker cut as the tension builds. The soundtrack mirrors this progression, starting with orchestral pieces and moving into more aggressive electronic sounds. After about an hour of the slow build the film then just repeatedly punches you in the gut for the remaining 30 minutes and leaves me, for one, feeling empty inside after and I love it. This is what cinema should do make you feel.<br/><br/>The themes of dependency run throughout the film. The addiction to diet pills and television that Sarah Goldfarb suffers from parallels the drug addiction of Harry and Co. and are shown to be equally as destructive, both mentally and physically. Ellen Burstyn's portrayal of Sarah Goldfarb is superb. During a scene where she is explaining her crippling loneliness her lips quiver and break into the occasional, subtle, nervous smile, which is a something that you just don't see from lesser actors. Each scene with the young cast (Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans) is juxtaposed with a scene of Sarah to further show how any addiction has the power to control you and it is the lack of control that ultimately takes your life away.<br/><br/>The film is littered with extreme close up, quick cuts of drug taking which reflect the constant, unescapable repetition that the characters live. <br/><br/>I could probably write an entire essay about the genius of ""Requiem for a Dream"" (I have barely mentioned the cinematography, lighting or sound design) but ill stop here for now."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","2","3","5 April 2017"," The ultimate addiction movie
","""Requiem for a Dream"" is an American 100-minute film from 2000 and probably still the most known work by director Darren Aronofsky, who also worked on adapting Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel for the screen here, actually with the late Selby himself. The cast includes Ellen Burstyn, already an Oscar winner at that point, the super stunning Jennifer Connelly, briefly before her Oscar win, and Jared Leto, a recent Oscar winner, so acting talent is certainly enough in here. Still this is a film that is really a lot more about the story and the overall picture than about individual performances, even if Burstyn managed to get nominated again, which was her most recent nomination at the Oscars, maybe even her final. I find it pretty shocking though that the movie did not get any nominations for other cast members (Leto and Connelly would not have been undeserving), for the direction, for the script, also for the make-up and for the truly memorable soundtrack. It is without a doubt one of the very best films from the first year of the new millennium and besides Gladiator it is also probably the most known from that year.<br/><br/>There are so many excellent aspects about the film it's tough to decide with which to start first. Maybe Burstyn's performance, who is certainly one of the best portrayals of loneliness and delusion I have ever seen. The whole red-dress story-line is extremely heartbreaking and her one scene with Leto is a definite contender for best-acted scene of the year and probably also the main reason why she was nominated for an Oscar. I'd be honestly very surprised if I end up liking Roberts (the winner) more than Burstyn. The main theme is a piece of brilliance and not only utterly catchy, but also very fitting to the story in terms of the contents. I just used the word ""heartbreaking"" and this is pretty much what can be used to describe the fate of each and every character in here. Their addictions to whatever they are addicted to is destroying their lives. The four central characters lose their dignity, their limbs, their sanity, their friends, their businesses, their freedom and a lot more because of how they cannot get away from their drugs. So they lose basically everything except their lives eventually. All the final shots from the characters in their moments of biggest agony are really memorable of course, but I like to mention the one with Connelly's character especially as we see her lying down after this fateful night and we see that it's not Leto's character in her arms, but that all her love is for her drug now which is the movie at its most depressing. And if you see the very final scene with the television appearance and mother and son being reunited as something positive only because Burstyn's character does and she is somewhat happy in her own fictitious right, that's up to you of course.<br/><br/>All in all, I think no matter from which perspective you see this film, it is a true piece of art. I also think it is a really important film because honestly I could not think of a better anti-drug and anti-addiction film than this one here. Is there anything wrong with it? One needs to dig very deep to find flaws here. Maybe Wayans' character is a bit of a filler to be honest as his story was basically a poor man's version of Leto's character's story and did not add too much. But it's not bad either and maybe just forgettable because everything else about this film is so outstandingly memorable. A bit on the filler side perhaps. Anyway, if there are still people out there who have not yet seen these slightly over 1.5 hours more than 1.5 decades after they came out, then it's high time. This movie is a must-see and it has aged brilliantly in a way where you really don't want to miss out. That is if you don't mind the very graphic aspect in here when it comes to violence, drug abuse and other stuff that is not too beautiful to watch like vomiting scenes. But it belongs to this film like everything else and just results in more realistic elements overall, which is definitely another reason to give it a thumbs-up. Nothing about this film is for the sake of it. Highly highly recommended. Aronofsky was only around the age of 30 when he made this, his second full feature film and what an achievement for such a young director."

","I finally got round to watching this after years of hearing all the hype and telling myself that one day I would have to see what all the fuss was about.<br/><br/>I have often heard people talk about this film being an amazing (albeit disturbing) portrayal of addiction - but I couldn't disagree more.<br/><br/>Part of the problem here is the extremes that these characters experience - extremes that are so detached from reality that they end up alienating the audience from the true reality of what addiction actually means for people who live it. It's almost like watching a cartoonish and deliberately over-hyped exaggeration of clichés about addiction.<br/><br/>The problem is that they are so far removed from the reality of your average person, and from the truth about how serious addictions effect most people that it comes across as totally disconnected from the real world.<br/><br/>Another thing that really struck me was the decision to weave in the storyline about the mother's addiction to diet pills and TV, which is compared with a major drug addiction - but in doing so this trivializes the seriousness of drug addiction, while also doing no favors for people who struggle with food-related addictions and other compulsions.<br/><br/>It's almost as if, during the writing process, the primary question that drove the script was: 'what's the most shocking thing that we could imagine happening to these characters - let's do that, and then just use addiction as the Ex Machina plot device to justify including those shocking scenes.<br/><br/>By the end credits, it literally felt to me like the sort of concepts that a teenager would come up with if they were asked to make a film about addiction - it just felt a bit like a series of clichéd stereotypes that were there to hit you over the head, rather than a serious attempt to delve into the reality of addiction and tell a story about those whose lives are afflicted by it.<br/><br/>The true reality is that the very reason addiction can be so much more damaging to people is precisely because it can go unnoticed, or even incorporated into their daily lives for so many years, with such a level of mundane functionality that over time it robs a person of true flourishing and all the various potential they started out with in life. A lifetime of accumulated bad decisions and outcomes caused by addiction is far more serious and damaging to a person than one off shocking events tend to be."

","Finally got to watch this movie after such a long time.<br/><br/>Let me begin with this: You will hardly find any other 5/10 stars review for this movie, this is a love or hate movie for most and I will try to elaborate why it is so without spoiling it too much.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT: I wouldn't really call them spoilers since I won't be talking about any details. But I will be saying things like ""the ending is good/bad"" so please stop reading if you don't want to see any of that.<br/><br/>In short, it is exactly what my summary says: Perfect Artwork, Good Acting, Average Story, Bad Storytelling.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a masterpiece of an artwork, this is the one. Tragically beautiful, and great choice of style and film score. For a 2000 movie, it is almost a 10/10 in this aspect.<br/><br/>Acting was really closer to average for most characters, but Ellen Burstyn's performance alone is more than enough to make up for any blemishes. I would even suggest anyone to watch the movie just for her acting.<br/><br/>Now comes the bad bit:<br/><br/>The story is absolutely nothing new. It's simply a confirmation of what most people already knew: drugs are bad for you. And that's fine. But the major downside of this movie is that it stops at that (drugs are bad). The characters have absolutely no depth to them. The movie shows close to nothing about their inner struggles and compelling reasons behind taking drugs. They are simply a portrayal of a stereotypical druggie, nothing more; nothing less.<br/><br/>What can a person learn from this movie? Nothing at all. Unless you haven't already heard about drugs being bad for you? If you already know drugs are bad, perhaps this movie can remind you that drugs are really really bad, and that's it. No solution, no depth, no hope.<br/><br/>Like I said, it's a beautiful piece of tragic artwork, but absolutely nothing inspirational and nothing new to learn about. Avoid it like a plague if you enjoy transcendental and inspirational movie, but definitely do give it a shot if you are all about arty farty Shakespeare kind of movies.<br/><br/>Personally I regret watching it, because there is nothing educational or entertaining about the movie; just makes the world seems more gloomy that's all."

","Darren aronofsky directs Jared Leto, Ellen burstyn, Jennifer Connelly and marlon wayans in this disturbing spiral of a film.<br/><br/>The story centerers around four ""drug addicts"" the characters played by Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and marlon wayans are all teenagers who start off dabbling in heroin, until it stars to dominate their life and starts to get out of control, the two boys start to get into very dangerous situations and Jennifer Connelly starts to get into prostitution. The key character however is Ellen burstyn, mother of Jared Leto who lives by herself sat in her armchair all day watching a day time television show. She receives a letter one day claiming that she has won a competition to be on television, of course she is over the moon but unfortunately she can't fit in to her old red dress. she comes to the conclusion that diet pills are the way forward but to her peril, she soon finds out that the pills are addictive and unhealthy. Her life starts to go the same way as her sons life.<br/><br/>This film is one of the best examples if not the best of modern society and culture. Aronofsky will get a Lot of stick from some people about this film but he doesn't pull any punches and why should he? There is such a deep meaning here, even if it isn't finding nemo (great film) but aronofsky is saying that don't have a go at kids for drugs, because it is ingrained in our society he shows this by using Ellen burstyn, she is an innocent old lady and she becomes a drug addict, burstyn portrays her sweet innocence well but also the characters deranged side. What is very clever is for most of the film we know that the younger three are on heroin but we don't see them use it exactly until Jared Leto uses it in his infected arm. Perhaps the most chilling scene is where Jennifer Connelly ""performs"" in front of a crowd, just for some drugs, Jared Leto her boyfriend encourages her to do this but she doesn't seem to even hesitate with it. <br/><br/>I'm not surprised that this film didn't win any Oscars etc this isn't a film that the ""higher powers"" would vote for but that doesn't take anything away from it.This film is a huge statement about our culture and one that some people won't like but as a teenager myself I would find requiem for a dream as a greater warning, as opposed to the kind of films they show you at school about drugs, this is nowhere near government propaganda as some of the others are but a realism story about how harmful drugs really are."

"Abalister","10","2","3","4 September 2014"," Still is the best picture I've ever seen.
","I'm sitting here, in September 2014, thinking of my all-time favourite movies, and Requiem for A Dream has been there, on top of my list, for 14 years.<br/><br/>I have never felt such raw emotion watching a movie; before and after Requiem's release. I went through all possible kinds of emotions watching this masterpiece. I've seen it probably 20 times over the years and the result is always the same. It's a jaw-dropping experience. I remember hearing the soundtrack the first time in 2000, while watching the movie, and I couldn't believe how perfect it was added to the 3 seasons of the movie. The soundtrack has been used many times since then for commercials, trailers and whatnot, but to me, this is the Requiem's soundtrack.<br/><br/>The 4 main acting performances in the movie are perfection. I connected with all of them. The cinematography, the editing and the directing are still amongst the best I've ever seen. The movie doesn't age at all. I always wondered why it wasn't up for many Oscars? (Picture, Director, Cinematography, Screenplay, Supp Actor and Supp Actress). I guess not many people saw the movie when it came out in the Fall of 2000.<br/><br/>This is movie perfection, an experience I will never forget, one of the best movies ever made, a tragic story but yet so close to what many humans must go through in their regular lives.<br/><br/>If someone out there has not seen this masterpiece, I envy you. I wish I could re-live the 2 hours I went through the first time I saw this. A moment I will never forget. A must-have in any movie collection. A movie for the cinephiles."
"Mrohnoes","10","2","3","5 April 2014"," Unlike any movie that I've ever seen.
","Over on the ""Noah"" board, I made a thread wherein I expressed my opinion on that film. I also mentioned that it was the first Darren Aronofsky film that I had ever seen, which surprised the people who read my review, and so they recommended a few of Aronofsky's films, and the one that was recommended the most was Requiem For A Dream. And so, I rented the film off of Amazon, and gave it a watch, unprepared for what I was about to witness.<br/><br/>Requiem For A Dream is like no other film I've ever seen, and even now, as I type this, I'm still attempting to figure out what I make of the film, but I will do my best to put my thoughts into a cohesive manner, so here it goes:<br/><br/>I was going to start off by talking about how the film handles its depiction of people doing drugs, but I'd rather you look up Confused Matthew's review of the film, he discusses it better than I ever could, so instead, I'm only going to talk about the performances and the direction.<br/><br/>Everyone in this film gave great performances. Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and especially Ellen Burstyn (who deserved her Oscar nomination) each turn in some of the best acting I've ever seen from each of them, and that helped give each of their characters extra depth.<br/><br/>Then, there's the directing by Aronofsky. The way he shot and edited the film is REALLY trippy and bizarre, but it works, because it gives you the feeling that you too are on drugs, which gives the audience a little bit of insight as to what the characters experience when they, you know, ""do the good stuff"". And you could also say that it helps the audience know why the characters do the drugs in the first place.<br/><br/>Oh, and the ending to the film? Without a doubt one of the darkest endings I've ever seen in a film, and yet it's somewhat poignant in its message. I refuse to tell you what happens in it, just so you know.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, I wholeheartedly recommend it, but I will warn you that you will not, I repeat NOT, be prepared for what you will see."
"powell-yendi","9","2","3","18 March 2014"," Message Received!
","No one can deny that the message in this movie was powerful. It reveals consequences to drug addiction that are unfamiliar to the general public. One consequence that I overlooked until now is that society would rather punish drug addicts than help them. It was interesting to watch those in positions of power as they abused addicts, took advantage of them, and showed utter indifference towards human life and dignity. I would have rated this movie with a 10/10, but one essential element was missing, backgrounds. Out of the four main characters, the movie only delved into the addiction history of one. It would have been nice to learn about the introduction and descent into drug dependence among the other main characters. They all seemed so beautiful and loving, but viewers would be more sympathetic if traumatic events were used to explain how life can take a turn for the worst."
"requiems","10","2","3","9 March 2014"," Beautifully tragic
","Most reviews will either be a 1/10 or a 10/10, those who gave it a 1 never gave it a chance, never opened there mind or saw pass the technicalities of it all. I gave it a 10 because I hate how this movie made me feel, I've never been more disgusted at life than after seeing this movie. When the credits came up, I started crying and stared at the watch next movie sign on the rental screen for a good half an hour. I couldn't bring myself to watch anything or thing of anything but this film. A movie that induces that much thought after the fact deserves a 10. Even those who don't like it because of it's disturbing theme, to admit that it was so powerful to disturb someone is to admit that it is worth the highest rating for being that powerful.<br/><br/>I went in this movie thinking it would be like ""The Basketball Diaries"" I was really wrong. It's not just another story about drug addicts, it's not trying to shove it's meaning down your throat and it's not meant to scare your children out of taking drugs as we all know doesn't work. This movie is a piece of art. The way it's shot is one of a kind, the music helps every scene to be more powerful and the acting is so down to earth you really believe the struggle they are going through. Jared Leto, playing Harry Goldfarb gives the best performance of his career and in the end you will cry for him because you sympathize so much with him. Ellen Burstyn gave an incredible performance as well and her story is the most haunting because it's her story that makes you realize this can happen to anyone and everyone.<br/><br/>I can't honestly say I'd recommend this to anyone but I can honestly say I could, at the same time. It's a movie so powerful and haunting I could never watch again but I feel as if everyone should see this. It's a story about life and the craving you have. Whether it is sugar, TV, sex or drugs, we all have cravings and they can bring out the worst in us and this movie shows how they can go terribly wrong if we don't realize our addictions."
"neppie","8","2","3","31 December 2013"," Not much glamorous here
","Too many films dealing with alcohol and addiction are in the ""28 Days"" camp. They glamorize use and recovery rather than take on the reality. ""Requiem"" does not fall into that trap. It accurately portrays what it is like from the perspective of the addict and from the outside. <br/><br/>The emotional grip this left me with was similar to ""Leaving Las Vegas"". What that movie did to present the life on alcoholic is what this does for addiction. Unfortunately its rating might prevent those who might most benefit from ever seeing it. <br/><br/>Recovery rhetoric says the only possible outcomes of continued addiction are jails, institutions or death. That cliché is aptly captured in the paths these characters follow."
"pedro_fernandes_nunes","9","2","3","29 December 2013"," One of the most dangerous movies indeed
","This movie was considerer by Premiere as one of the 25 most dangerous movies, and i really feel like it is. Darren Aronofsky gives us a amazing movie about drugs, how it changes our lives, by showing how time can go faster or slower with the more than 2000 cuts that make us always be on the edge. It also reveals the dark side of the human condition who prefers a drug induced utopia than to do something meaningful to change their lives. It shows dramatically the pain of the characters and their endless search for something that at the end they always knew they wouldn't be able to achieve. The futility of current society is showed on the shallow goals of the characters who prefer a tragic ending than to choose different things for their lives.<br/><br/>Although all the performances are very good, there's no shadow of a doubt that Ellen Burstyn gives a performance of a life as Sara Goldfarb, we feel her pain, we understand her needs, we feel her desire...Ellen makes totally drawn to a character who gets what she wants and no one deserves. And i believe everyone's heart gets broken when we see when she finally got in the red dress and that's the only thing that she now has in her live, a red dress who fits<br/><br/>A great movie that i highly recommend"

However, it is a major downer, cannot seem to hold interest, and the message is a bit heavy-fisted throughout. I feel the suffering, but much of it seems overblown. <br/><br/>I would not recommend this to anyone, but still feel it to be a technical marvel. I guess if you're really curious you could see it, but it is too disturbing for most and will not resonate strongly due to the way the message is portrayed. <br/><br/>The five stars you see in the review are just for convenience so I know I've seen it.

","I was thinking a lot about this movie after having watched it. some people say this is what a good movie has to be like. well, I don't.<br/><br/>this movie is completely nonsensical. honestly, every single action, even the introduction makes no sense at all if you think just a little bit about it.<br/><br/>this movie is not about drugs. because its to stupid to be able to show you what drugs actually do. the only goal of this movie is to make its viewer feel bad. and it succeeds greatly in this. thus my 2 points out of 10.<br/><br/>there are two possible reasons for the rating on IMDb:<br/><br/>1) I guess there are lots of people who just want to feel bad. I can come over and slap you in the face to make you feel even worse.<br/><br/>2) its all just a prank, like the ""adobe air"" prank in the google play store for android<br/><br/>two small examples of the nonsense:<br/><br/>a) introduction: son (who his mother is afraid of in the beginning but happy as f* to see him next time she sees him) steals mothers television to sell it. mother knows exactly where he will sell it (it is always the same dealer miles away, as the son is doing this regularly) and gets there to buy it back. --> think a little bit about this. the whole setting is stupid.<br/><br/>b) end: the two boys get in Jail for, well, taking drugs and having the intention to buy more. nothing more. I'm not from the states, but I think having taken drugs and wanting to buy drugs is not a reason to be put in Jail (without a trail and while dying from an injury of course, as this has to be as realistic as possible)<br/><br/>well and everything that happens in between is nonsensical as well."
"MoviesRT","6","2","3","23 October 2013"," Typical Hollywoood - effective, but not very realistic.
","I know there have been a lot of reviews written on this movie and I agree with many at the many holes in the plot. It's very artistically done with the sound effects and special closeup filming, but it goes way out in left field on content.<br/><br/>Perhaps that's on purpose. Just like Reefer Madness was created to scare pot smokers, this will scare drug users of any kind.<br/><br/>I think it started out good and built up very nicely, but towards the end it got to be too much to believe.<br/><br/>Firstly, how many doctors will put a woman on 4 different weight loss pills and not care to monitor her progress or stop her from taking too many? Secondly, any drug user would have to have the sense to know to use a different vein after a while, wouldn't they? And thirdly, why does a perfectly attractive young lady end up being forced into prostitution when she could work for a living? Lastly, no health-care system will take an old lady and force feed her and then put her on electroshock treatment without really knowing what's wrong. At least not in the US, but that may be changing soon.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is where health-care in the US is heading now. Who knows?

"user-271-555103","2","2","3","29 September 2013"," Soul-destroying
","(Before everything else, I want to say that I have no problem with difficult films, and try my best to work through them and process them with more than just emotion. In other words: I tried to like this movie.)<br/><br/>This film does to the viewer what the drugs do to the characters. It eviscerates. It grinds down. It leaves you feeling hollow and unsatisfied. The thesis, from what I can tell, is: ""Drugs are bad."" And this becomes extraordinarily, horrifyingly clear during the extremely punishing final minutes of the film. But what is the viewer supposed to do afterward?<br/><br/>Is the point that drugs will leave you feeling the same way the film does? If so, fine. It is a masterfully constructed (but otherwise useless) public service announcement that subjects you to hell for 102 minutes in the same way a fire-and-brimstone preacher might.<br/><br/>If not, it is a work that delights far too much in breaking the viewer apart, using every trick it can find to beat us over the head with the depravity and brokenness of man, to no discernible end.<br/><br/>Having seen Black Swan, I expected a disturbing experience, but this was a far darker film than I imagined. Black Swan, at least, celebrates something (the perfect artistic work), and explores the self-destructive obsession that seems to follow perfection and genius. It is cautionary and morbidly fascinated, like Requiem, but much more measured. The penultimate scenes of this film, cutting between the destruction of the four main characters, made me wish I could turn off all sensory input-- or at least punch Aronofsky in the mouth.<br/><br/>This may be a naive notion, but I believe in the power of art to uplift. To challenge and empower people toward higher vision and accomplishment. Obviously not every film needs to attempt this, but I truly do not understand the point of making a work that only has the capacity to crush the soul. As a creator, why simply grind people into the ground?<br/><br/>If you are the kind of person that wants to ""get something out of a film,"" you will probably be best served by steering clear of this one. It will only take from you."

In parts questions were asked on the necessity of such flourishes which felt tedious come the end.<br/><br/>Writing - If something needs to be said, it deserves to be said right. Clumsy dialogue left the whole film wanting. More bite needed.<br/><br/>All in all - Pretty film without guts. Seemed stuck in a murky middle ground unable to bridge either side unto which it could have been a decent film. Less direction, greater character progression, deeper storyline and weighty dialogue would benefit this film in my opinion."
"Desertman84","10","2","3","16 October 2011"," An American Masterpiece
","No question that Requiem For A Dream,which stars Ellen Burstyn,Jared Leto,Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans, is an American cinema masterpiece.It is the ultimate film about drugs and its effects in a human being's body and soul. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Hubert Selby, Jr.The film depicts different forms of addiction, leading to the characters' imprisonment in a world of delusion and reckless desperation that is subsequently overtaken and devastated by reality.The film charts three seasons in the lives of Sara Goldfarb,her son Harry,Harry's girlfriend Marion Silver, and Harry's friend Tyrone C. Love.<br/><br/>The story begins in summer; Sara Goldfarb, an elderly widow living alone in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, spends her time watching infomercials hosted by Tappy Tibbons. After a phone call announces that she will be invited to be a participant on a game show, she becomes obsessed with regaining the youthful appearance she possesses in a photograph from Harry's graduation, her proudest moment. In order to fit into her old red dress, the favorite of her deceased husband Seymour, she begins taking a regimen of prescription weight-loss amphetamine pills throughout the day and a sedative at night. Despite Harry's warnings about amphetamine addiction, she passionately insists that the chance to be on television has given her a reason to live. When her invitation does not arrive over the fall, she increases her dosage but begins suffering from amphetamine psychosis and having delusions of reference, hallucinating that she is the principal subject of the game show and that her refrigerator is a menacing, living monster.<br/><br/>Harry is a heroin addict; together with fellow addicts Tyrone and Marion, he enters the illegal drug trade around Coney Island in an attempt to realize their dreams. With the money they make over the summer, Harry and Marion hope to open a fashion store for Marion's designs, while Tyrone dreams of making his mother proud by escaping the street. However, at the beginning of fall, Tyrone is caught in the middle of a drug gang assassination, and Harry must use most of their money to post bail. Increasing drug-related violence and arrests begin making it hard to obtain drugs, throwing Harry, Tyrone, and Marion into a state of deprivation. Growing more desperate, Harry convinces Marion to have sex with her psychiatrist in exchange for money, causing a rift in the relationship. Meanwhile, Harry's arm is becoming infected from unsanitary injection techniques.<br/><br/>As Sara's sanity unravels, she takes the subway to visit the television studio in Manhattan. The secretary at the studio calls a hospital and Sara is involuntarily committed to a psychiatric ward where she undergoes unsuccessful medicative treatment, followed by electro convulsive therapy. Harry and Tyrone set out for Florida to obtain drugs, but Harry's increasingly infected arm forces them to visit a hospital in South Carolina, where they are arrested for skipping bail. Tyrone must deal with hard labor, racist prison guards and drug withdrawal, as Harry is taken to a prison hospital to have his arm amputated. Harry has a recurring dream of Marion waiting for him at a pier at Coney Island, but awakens and realizes that he is alone in jail with just one arm. Back in New York, Marion meets with a pimp ""Little John"", who gives her drugs in exchange for sex and puts her in sex shows at his apartment suite to provide for her drug habit.<br/><br/>Lost in misery, each character curls into a fetal position. In Sara's dream, she wins the game show's grand prize and meets Harry there. In her fantasy, Harry is a successful businessman and engaged to Marion. Sara and Harry hug and say how much they love one another through the cheers of the crowd and the glowing stage lights.<br/><br/>No doubt,this is one of the best films ever made in Hollywood.It examines how drugs affects the very being of the each person as explored in the main characters of the film.Although this is far from a traditional film that intends to entertain the viewer,it nevertheless presents its theme in its most powerful way possible.Aside from that,the performances of the actors/actresses are powerful especially Burstyn,who no less deserves her Oscar nomination."
"pisarenco-a","2","2","3","22 September 2011"," One of the worst stories
","The good: Actors did a splendid job. So did the director. Scenes were wonderfully filmed. In fact, the whole movie is a masterpiece when it comes to visuals. It kind of reminded me movies by Guy Ritchie. It is filmed in a similar manner. Also, I think this movie is great for teenagers. It contains nudity in some scenes, but I think that in the context this movie is presenting it, the whole message would be a good one for the kids. After all, they've seen nudity all over the internet. One little movie won't hurt their innocence, however it will build up an emotion inside which I think will help them renounce the wish to try drugs.<br/><br/>That's it. What about the movie itself? What about the story? The conflict? Well, I am afraid, there is NONE. The whole movie was extremely predictable, just like a teenage horror movie. It was incredibly hard not to know what was going to happen. A little drama then *sniff*. A bit more drama and again *sniff*. And the drama escalates as the *sniff* escalates. Which is all so obvious, that it became very boring to watch. I've read a few reviews, that this movie is about addictive dreams and stuff. Yeah, I guess it is. But all dreams are addictive. There's nothing special about this movie. All I saw was seriously weak people. Their weakness combined with their stupidity made me predict the ending right from the beginning. Of course not in details, but in general it happened like it should have happened. Actually there is no drama (in a good sense) here. Drama is when Al Pacino becomes the Godfather and he swears not to kill, while his men kill every opponent. That's drama. Nothing even close is seen here. My brain was corroding into jelly while watching this movie. It's pure nonsense. It's a world outside my world. One which I don't really wanna see in details. One which is boring, ugly, full of despair and stupidity. The whole movie was about this world. Nothing else.<br/><br/>I want my 2 hours back."
"ElMaruecan82","10","2","3","20 March 2011"," When Ambition is driven by Addiction ... Prepare Yourself for Alienation ...
","""What's the meaning of life?"" I candidly asked a friend. His answer resonated in my mind as the truest words of wisdom: ""To give it a meaning"" ... and it's true because it applies to every human being. Call them dreams, plans or ambitions, we all give a personal answer to the eternal ""Why?"". It can be selfish or altruistic, whatever we do should serve a purpose. Even the devoted mother lives for her children, even the bum drinks to escape from his reality and die like the religious fanatic dreams to meet God in the Holy Heaven Dark, mystical or optimistic, we're all driven by dreams. <br/><br/>But if I can use a metaphor to define life, I would say that the road is the meaning, the destination is the ambition, we're the car, and the gas is nothing but  addiction, addictions driving our lives in order to fulfill our ambitions, and if there's one film that perfectly illustrated this, it's Darren Aronofky's ""Requiem For a Dream"". This masterpiece relates in spell-binding visuals, the stories of four protagonists that basically went ""out of gas"", and exploded the car. It's life in microcosm, in its most pessimistic approach  and the soul of this movie is Sara Goldfarb, portrayed by Ellen Burstyn, in one of the greatest female performances ever. <br/><br/>Because living without a meaning is synonym of waiting for death, Sara Goldfarb embodies the tragedy of people with empty lives. Old, lonely, they try to fill their routine with friends, food, anything that could ""give it a meaning"". For Sara, it's TV, especially a creepy reality TV show that gives ordinary people a unique opportunity to be acclaimed and to make a surprise to their beloved ones. For Sara, TV is just a filler, and Harry, his son, played by Jared Leto, is the only precious thing she still has in this world. But when she receives a convincing phone call inviting her to the show, her new objective is to get thin to fit in her beautiful red dress, to be the prettiest, to be a ""winner"", like the previous participants.<br/><br/>Being thin and pretty, will drive her life until it turns to obsession, the more she'll try to get thin, the more extreme will be the means. Sara's challenge will be to be a ""winner"", a dangerous catchphrase indirectly underlining the fallacious hypocrisy, that ""the others"" are losers. But a loser, Sara is not because she has a dream. In a heartbreaking speech to her son, she explains that she wants to be loved, to have the chance to be someone, at least for once. Who can blame her? Not Harry anyway, whose addiction to drugs will also lead to the worst. <br/><br/>Harry wants to build a future with Marion, his girlfriend, Jennifer Connelly, while Tyron his friend, Marlon Wayans, also needs money to help his mother. These stories all have a common link, a noble ambition driven by a dangerous addiction. We all know they're doomed. The beautiful music of ""Requiem For a Dream"" inhabits the tragedy from the start, in fact, the third of the film's emotional impact is incarnated by ""Lux Aeterna"" unforgettable violin's theme, one of the most impacting and iconic scores of the last decade.<br/><br/>Combined with the music, the editing created the feeling of redundancy all through the film, the repetitions of the same shots with the eyes' dilatation, the opening of the box letter, the colored weight-loss pills etc., highlight that addiction is only a dangerous routine replacing a monotonous one. The editing is so captivating we predict this hellish spiral will go crescendo until reaching a breaking point. Sara always found the box letter empty, she got so used to her pills, she starts taking one, two, three... at a time  <br/><br/>Additions supposedly driving the ambitions of meaningless lives create other habits within the addiction. It's as if without them, we condemn ourselves to get sucked into the normality, and prevent ourselves from being what we want to be, which inevitably leads to alienation. Because wanting to be different is also the best way to become our caricature, or worse. In the incredible hallucinatory scene, Sara imagines herself laughing at her own image as if she wanted in fact to be so different she would be among the one who laughs at the kind of people she is. Hubert Selby's book is so ahead of its time it explored the alienation of a society where we want to please people so bad we lose self-respect. <br/><br/>That's what happens when you get dependent of your dreams, you kill your inner self to become more socially acceptable  because when you destroy your inner self in order to construct a false image, you ultimately lose everything  whether you want to be famous, thin, sexy, popular, rich, whatever  you fail, you're the ultimate loser.<br/><br/>And the four stories are four failures. Sara, let herself down in a pathetic tear-jerking breakdown in the TV studio, Marion started selling her body to get the heroine, while Tyron and Harold tried to find the drugs everywhere until they got finally caught. These four destinies finally converged in one of the most vertiginous climactic montages ever, illustrating how an addiction can make you lose at least four precious things. Sara lost her mind, Harry lost his infected arm in a particularly disturbing shot, Marion lost her dignity, and Tyron his freedom. Reason, body, dignity, freedom, the pillars of lives that addictions, driving ambitions or not, can destroy  and poor Sara paid the biggest price.<br/><br/>So, this film put my friend's answer into perspective, if ""life's meaning is to give it a meaning"", I guess we should just remember the words of John Lennon : ""Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans."""
"MBunge","8","2","3","28 February 2011"," Beautifully horrible
","Requiem for a Dream is a mesmerizing and ultimately startling look at the horrors of addiction. Its visual electricity and propulsive dramatic decent make you feel like you're on a roller coaster that's going up and down at the same time.<br/><br/>This film covers three seasons in the lives of four people. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is an old Jewish widow living in a Brighton Beach apartment. The story begins in summer, as Sara's junkie son Harry (Jared Leto) takes her old TV for the umpteenth time to pawn it for drug money. Sara has become terribly afraid of her son, but Harry is too wrapped up in himself to recognize his mother's fear or his own awful behavior. Harry uses the money from pawning the TV to get high with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), while Sara sits in her apartment watching the same weight loss infomercial over and over and over.<br/><br/>Then two things happen to send the already unfortunate lives of these four people down a dark and vicious path. Sara gets a call that she's been selected to be on a game show and Harry and Tyrone decide to become drug dealers in addition to junkies. Sara becomes obsessed with showing up on TV looking exactly like she did in Harry's high school graduation photo, so she dyes her hair and goes to a quack doctor for ""diet pills"" that will let her fit into the red dress she was wearing in the photo. Meanwhile, Harry and Tyrone start selling heroin on the street and are so wildly successful that Harry makes enough money for Marion and him to start a clothing store.<br/><br/>But as summer turns to fall turns to winter, things go from bad to worse to horrific. Sara becomes addicted to the ""diet pills"", gulping down more and more and being battered by mood swings and disturbing hallucinations. Tyrone gets caught up in the middle of a drug killing, forcing Harry to use most of their money to bail him out. That puts them in a hole they're never able to crawl their way out of. As madness chews up Sara's mind, Harry, Tyrone and Marion are forced to consider and then do more and more awful things to get the drugs and money they're convinced will fix their lives. When the end finally comes, Sara and Harry fly completely apart while Tyrone and Marion keep grinding away through their torturous livesand it's not clear which are worse off.<br/><br/>Requiem of a Dream is based on a book of the same name. The author, Hubert Selby Jr., helped co-writer/director Darren Aronofsky create this film. But most movies adapted from books face the same challenge. Motion pictures are, by their very nature, all about motion and things happening. That makes them very sensitive to plot. A lot of very good books, however, don't have very good plots and emphasize other aspects of storytelling. When you take the story from the book and try to make it a film, those poor plots usually become much more prominent and the story suffers for it.<br/><br/>Aronofsky faces that threatening obstacle here. The plot of Requiem for a Dream is no more complicated or involved than this - ""A woman, her son and his friends get caught up in drugs and progressively more and more terrible crap happens to them"". That's not a lot to sustain a 102 minute long movie. Aronofsky confronts that problem head on by using a dizzying array of visual techniques to substitute mental and emotional movement for physical action. He uses split screens, extreme close ups, slow motion, fast motion, stop motion, montages, special effects and blends and divides the images of this film in just about every way you can imagine. Instead of it being about what the characters are doing, it becomes about the imagery is showing us how the characters are experiencing their own increasingly sad and sordid lives.<br/><br/>Requiem of a Dream is about how addiction, and not only to drugs, takes a hold of those who turn to it as a respite from their own unhappiness. Not only does the respite turn out to be brief, but the addiction ends up magnifying and intensifying everything that made you unhappy in the first place.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's superb direction is complimented by some very good acting from the cast, particularly from Ellen Burstyn. She got an Academy Award nomination for this role and it's as deserved a nomination as any actress has ever received. Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans are no slouches, either. There's a deep vein of desperation running through each of their characters and they show you how each character's nature deals with that desperation in different ways.<br/><br/>Now, watching 4 human beings destroy themselves in rather gruesome detail is not everyone's cup of tea. This movie is definitely NOT casual entertainment. If you're looking for something that explores human darkness without wallowing in it, while dazzling you with virtuoso filmmaking, Requiem for a Dream is a must-see."

","This film is excellent, I felt intense and could hear my heart beat right until the very end. The visuals where excellent and the story and character build was great. I personally felt Ellen Burstyn was so convincing as she became more and more addicted to her prescription diet pills you could feel every moment as she went deeper into a psychotic state from being so happy to being plain crazy! However on the other hand I was not as impressed with Jennifer Connelly in the film as I felt her character to seem a bit hazy she never really looked as though she was getting heavily addicted to the drugs and I felt during some periods of the film it seemed like she hadn't been on anything then all of a sudden she has to prostitute for drugs.. Felt confused by her character..<br/><br/>Overall the film left a lasting impression which left me feeling rather scared afterwards! Really enjoy these types of films that make you feel things that may be uncommon in everyday life."

","Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream is one of the movies that would never win an Oscar(just like American History X e.t.c)for obvious reasons.<br/><br/>It is about four people located in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn;Sara Goldfarb and her son Harry,his girlfriend Marion and their friend Tyrone.Sara is an ordinary housekeeper-widow who's only pleasure in life is her television while her son Harry as well as his girlfriend Marion as well as Tyrone is a drug addict.One day Sara is informed that she will be a guest in her favorite TV show and starts thinking how she will be looking as great as possible,and because she cannot stand taking up a diet,she starts taking ""special"" pills in order to become as thin as she was young.Harry,Marion and Tyrone are organizing a plan in order to get money and their fix while in the back of their mind is the hope to quit drugs.As the days go by and Sara is not being called to appear in the show,she increases her fix and becomes an addict .Harry and Tyrone are suffering because they can't get their fix and are forcing Marion to become a kind of prostitute in order to be able to buy drugs.In the end Sara gets totally insane and is being closed in a clinic,Marion is being dragged in an inhumane world of total degradation and humiliation in order to get her fix,Harry and Tyrone are being closed in jail and Harry loses his hand due to Gangrene.<br/><br/>The acting is perfect,the direction is one of the most innovational,pioneering yet amazing seen in cinema's history and the messages are more than the movies' industry would prefer... To sum up this movie is one of the most dramatic and sensation films of all time and the worst of them all;it does happen in the real world each and every day..."
"LuxNatalis","5","2","3","16 October 2009"," Disturbing for the wrong reasons
","This is a film I'll remember. Disturbing and brutal - essential piece of work on a serious subject; the human addictions.<br/><br/>I wish the actors and music were kept, but this was made in a different way. With less superficial advice and characters I'd connect with. Characters compatible with the real world. With no exaggerations and taking into account that various drugs, are used by various people, at various times in their lives, for a variety of reasons. It's really a complicated subject, people who do drugs end up in jail, people who do drugs become murderers, people who do drugs die from depression, people who do drugs become artists or prime ministers and sometimes they live happily until they die.<br/><br/>''Requiem for a Dream'' is a film that will stay in your mind for a long time after you first see it, it's solid and well-executed, but it is going to be shallow on the very topic that it's trying to be instructive; the topic of addictions. <br/><br/>People-failures controlling the viewer's depression is the main idea. There's much more about the dangers of drugs; the diversity of people guarantees that our life is not monotonous - and drug users are much more than a couch potato with an eye that glows.<br/><br/>My vote is 5."
"VANILLAxxGORILLA","10","2","3","20 September 2009"," Raw, unflinching, and so realistic it's unbelievable.
","Never has a film been made that captures the disease of addiction like this one. It will haunt you for days. And if you're an addict, it will haunt you for the rest of your life.<br/><br/>This film knows its subject. Knows what most of the world don't. Drugs are not the problem. They are a temporary cure, or maybe just a symptom of a devastating disease that manifests itself whether you're using or not. You can see it in the subtle behaviors of the characters that are brilliantly acted by the films four stars. You can see the sadness in Marlon Wayans's character as a child, long before he ever picked up his first drug. That scene with his mother is one of the most powerful aspects of this film, as it shows that addiction is a disease that is ever present long before the use of drugs becomes an issue. Reaffirming that no matter what you think, will power cannot save you.<br/><br/>The film is criticized for extensive cuts and repetitive images. But I know better. I'm a recovering addict, and not some, but all 12 step programs define insanity as this: doing THE SAME THING over and over and over again; expecting different results. The films ability to show this visually, constantly darkening with every repeat, is metaphoical genius.<br/><br/>Some may like the endings to the laughably unrealistic, Clean & Sober, or even the Basketball Diaries( which if you read Jim Carols second diary you'd know that his story didn't end that way). And like Requiem's sad conclusion, the truth is the ends are ALWAYS the same; jails, institutions, and death. Because if you pull any four addicts out into the spot light, there chances of recovery and survival are most likely a dream."
"Funnyman1235","3","2","3","20 July 2009"," An interesting project that disappears up its creative arse
","Don't get me wrong! Darren Aronofsky is a talented man. I adored The Wrestler and admired the squandered philosophising of The Fountain but this film, which was also my first contact with Aronofsky, is a train wreck.<br/><br/>It's a film that I can best describe as the cinematic equivalent to losing your soul. While some of the performances are admirable (particularly Ellen Burstyn and Marlon Wayans, who I had previously written off as the most untalented man in Hollywood) and some of the technical flourishes Aronofsky employs are impressive the problem is that there's too much flashing before your eyes to care about the characters.<br/><br/>One scene stays in my mind that I can't help but admire. A simple quiet scene between Mother and Son, with Aronofsky actually letting his cast do something that resembles a dramatic scene, but either side of it are just 100 minutes of untrained focus. Nothing is really given any weight or rather the weight of the message is diluted by technical trickery.<br/><br/>Watch Trainspotting instead with characters you care about, a story that is by turns tragic and equally hilarious, a brilliant script and performances that undeniably unique.<br/><br/>This is the US cutting-edge version of Danny Boyle's film - and guess what - its dull and ultimately depressing."

Every scene is direct and captivating; almost like a bullet shooting out to all your senses.<br/><br/>The whole idea of ""drug is bad for you"" has long been lessons for our health ed class; but aside from this, the director intelligently snuggled many more of society immoralities into the scenes.<br/><br/>Rather than spoiling, I'd just say to all ""Watch It""; and i'm sure you'll be in for ""wow""s like the way i am now!"

I feel this movie had aspects that could have boosted its popularity among popular culture and increased ticket sales at the theaters. More advertisement prior to its release would have aided ticket sales in my mind. Over all this movie is one of my favorites for so many reasons that lie deeper than actor and actresses performances.

","Not a whole lot of movies these days get you to actually think.<br/><br/>Luckily, Requiem for a Dream is one of the few that require thinking and feeling.<br/><br/>This movie is not for the faint of heart or feeble-minded.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of 4 people who have big dreams of happiness only to have them ruined by drug addictions. Sara Goldfarb, a TV-loving widow who is addicted to diet pills, her heroin-addict son Harry Goldfarb, his coke-addicted girlfriend, Marion Silver, and his drug-dealing friend, Tyrone Love.<br/><br/>You learn a lot about each character and begin to sympathize with their situation as they begin to spiral downward with their addictions.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn was excellent in The Exorcist, so I knew she would give a good performance as Sara Goldfarb. I had never seen Jared Leto in other movies, but he sure didn't disappoint here as Harry Goldfarb. Marlon Wayans is usually in bad, over-the-top comedies, so I was really surprised with his excellent performance as Tyrone Love. I personally do not care for Jennifer Connelly, she wasn't bad as Marion though, just wasn't great either. And Christopher McDonald was perfect as Tappy Tibbons, the icon of Sara's TV addiction, who runs a talk-show talking about how he managed to lose weight and gain his life back.<br/><br/>This movie wasn't perfect, but was still great. It claws into your senses and burrows in deep, making you really get the full-blast of what this movie is trying to tell you. This movie could be a weapon in fighting against the mass drug-use in this country.<br/><br/>9/10."
"TOMNEL","9","2","3","13 March 2008"," An emotional, very stylish look at drug use.
","""Requiem for a Dream"" is not an uplifting film in any way. Nor does it have a traditional story line, so if you don't like movies like that, then don't watch this. If you're looking for a good drama, this is it. I felt glued to the screen at times.<br/><br/>Four people live their lives addicted to drugs. Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a heroin addict and lets the drug take over everything. His girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) loves her boyfriend, but she'll do anything for the drugs. Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) is a friend of Harry, who wants to live the way his mother wanted him to, but can't quit the substances either. Sara Goldfarb, played by the wonderful Ellen Burstyn, is the mother of Harry, and just wants to lose some weight. She begins an addiction to diet pills, and a dream to be on a TV infomercial. All four of these stories are sad, and all four are amazingly written and acted. Ellen Burstyn is the stand-out actress. Every scene she was in, I was sucked in. Her acting is amazing in this. The direction is great, and the cinematography is beautiful.<br/><br/>This great drama reaches near perfection, and should be touted as a classic, as it seems to be by it's cult following.<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. R for sexuality, language, drug use and violence."
"blubb06","9","2","3","25 August 2007"," Why people die alone
","It's fun to read the ""Hate it"" comments, and usually they have a point. Surely, this is a morality tale with worst-case-scenario ending, not a documental feature on drug abuse (for that, take a look at the German film ""Christiane F."") or an investigation into the American health care system (although after watching Michael Moore's ""Sicko"", I think anything is possible).<br/><br/>The comments I read all overlooked that this is a very moving film about loneliness and alienation - the best I've seen yet besides ""Blade Runner"" and far above ""Collateral"" and the like. If you watch a lot of movies, you'll get a spooky sense of the screen looking back at you. Ellen Bustyn as the mother lives inside an incoherent TV dream, until she completely vanishes into that ""brighter world"" where she is not only loved, but adored. The kids have high hopes and seem to be more firmly on the ground, but Marion needs to pump up her courage and Harry loves to go easy. All three are junkies who keep the world at arms length or behind locked doors while they artificially enhance their feelings. They're not only addicted to uppers and downers, but to more-than-life-size dreams.<br/><br/>By contrast, reality seems drab and without purpose and the individuals utterly alone. Like true average heroes of modern society, they are frantically trying to keep up happy, successful faces. Nobody takes the time to listen to or check on the old lady. The world doesn't care, and they in turn refuse to need it until it's too late and they lose limbs, minds, relationships, freedom, self-respect and finally the will to care.<br/><br/>Jonathan Demme has laid a finger on a rift in society's fabric that's not easy to expose without boring the audience or adding thriller elements, and the shocking imagery gets more people to see it (as the comments confirm). Definitely a recommendable film that provokes nagging questions and engages even those who don't ""like"" it."

I did not know Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans could act, but they can, and they were fantastic.  That leaves Jared Leto, who was just as good as everyone else and breaks your heart several times as well, especially his last scenes.

Do not see this movie if you don't want to be haunted, moved, sickened, and utterly amazed.<br/><br/>This movie did for smack what even ""Trainspotting"" failed to do.  Although ""Trainspotting"" had a definite anti-smack message, and some people died, and it was pretty disturbing it pales in comparison to this movie. ""Trainspotting"" had a few really disturbing scenes, but even they were ""prettier"" than half of what goes on in ""Requiem For A Dream"".  Renton crawls down a toilet; Harry shoots up into a festering wound and has his arm amputated.  And while no one dies physically in ""Requiem"" (at least no major characters), in the end everyone is left with a large part of their soul missing....not to mention their mind.  There are other comparisons and contrasts to be made, but the point is: if you can still think drugs are ""cool""  or anything other than ""mind bending-ly terrifying"" after watching this movie you are scary.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I loved ""Trainspotting"" and I know that it wasn't meant to be what ""Requiem"" was.  But the similarities were too obvious for me to ignore.  ""Requiem"" isn't meant to tell a story as much as ""Trainspotting"" was.  ""Requiem"" is meant to put the fear of God into you, and it succeeds. And Ellen Burstyn is INCREDIBLE!<br/><br/>Yes, the movie has flaws.  But I still haven't seen the ""perfect"" movie yet, so that can hardly be held against it's brilliance.  Darren Aronofvsky is going places.  ""Pi"" was really good, ""Requiem"" is great, I can't wait to see what's coming next...<br/><br/>
So don't watch this movie if it sounds too hard to watch (and it is very hard to watch) and don't watch it if you don't want to be depressed (in a beautiful way).  But if you do decide to watch it, don't do it alone.<br/><br/>I don't usually give stars, but just to show how much this movie moved me: 9 out of 10.  And it only got 9 because I'm still sane."

","Darren Aronofsky is one of the craziest filmmakers working today. His latest film, mother!, was crazy but Requiem for a Dream was on another level.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream follows four characters and the effect their drug addiction has on their physical and mental state.<br/><br/>When the credits started rolling, I was in a state of shock and horror. I don't think a movie has left me feeling so disturbed. I breathed a sigh of relief as this film gives an experience that's completely anxiety inducing. This is most certainly a film NOT for the faint-hearted.<br/><br/>The way Aronofsky handles this film is perfection. We start with each character at the best point of their life and then see their addiction slowly spiral out of control over the course of the runtime makes the film engaging from start to finish and shows Aronofsky as a master of build up. The camerawork and editing is very stylish and fast paced, not allowing you to take a breather at any given moment. The quick edits and close-ups puts the audience into the state of mind of each character creating a more terrifying and immersive experience. The soundtrack is also great. It's filled with music that's ominous which fits the tone perfectly.<br/><br/>What makes the film even more horrifying are the fantastic actors on-screen. Jennifer Connelly delivers a solid performance for a role that requires a lot from her and Jared Leto proves to me he's a capable actor with a powerhouse performance here. Marlon Wayans really surprised me as I'm used to seeing him in comedies and I wish he would take on more serious roles as this film shows his talent. However, the winning performance here was done by the excellent Ellen Burstyn. Especially for her age, her role was very challenging and demanding and she gave the performance of a lifetime here. It's sad she didn't win an Oscar for it.<br/><br/>If there's ever a film that deters you from taking drugs, it's Requiem for a Dream. It's definitely a challenging watch but if you're up for it, I would highly recommend it."

","Being someone who had a history with drugs, i found this movie to be slightly more than ground-breaking. i saw this film in the midst of a downward spiral, and it turned me right around! having friends with the same plans, such as sell drugs to buy more drugs..it made me look at my life and theirs and see exactly what the future had in store.<br/><br/>now, every time i see this movie since escaping that life, i cry. i cry for my past and those who still live in it. this movie has more to say to people my age than any drug education movie we were afforded in school. honestly, i wonder when the school systems will wisen up to what is really going to get kid's attention; movies that show that pros as well as the cons of drugs, or a movie that shows the complete and utter devastation drugs will bring to your life, and the lives of those around you. honestly, had i seen this film before my sophomore year of high school, i would have never even dreamed of taking more than the prescribed dose of advil.<br/><br/>granted, my little summary or comment of this movie does not entail anything informative about the movie itself, i must say, i feel this is the best way i know to express my views."

","Like a lot of people, I'd heard the music from 'Requiem for a Dream' before I'd actually seen the film. Indeed it was that classic soundtrack that drew me into watching it. Based on the music, I was expecting something dramatic, haunting and disturbing, but I never expected something as powerful and meaningful as what I watched.<br/><br/>'Requiem for a Dream' is an outstanding film in every respect, in fact it quite comfortably makes my 'all-time best' list. The reason this film is so effectively disturbing - even uncomfortable to watch at times - is because the characters and their stories are so accurate of real-life. Tyrone, Harry, Sarah and Mary Ann are not fictional characters, they represent the millions of people in the world who have lost their freedom, body, mind or soul due to drugs. It's a harrowing watch, but essential viewing at the same time.<br/><br/>On a side note and mainly just for personal reference, this review marks my 500th on this site - hard to believe given that I only signed up (almost four years ago now) to vent my frustration about a dreadful TV show that I'd seen.

","One of my favorite movies. From one of my favorite directors. Each character descends into their own kind of drug hell. It's a beautiful train wreck you can't look away from. Sara Goldfarb's joyous need to fit into her red dress is doped into a psychosis that consumes her. Marion Silver surrounds her clothes-designing talent with heroin until only heroin is left. Her descent is painted on her face as her make up becomes more garish with each scene. Tyrone C. Love loses his freedom and Harry Goldfarb loses his very arm. The gut-punch is so real - the heartbreak so well communicated. It's kind of hard to believe that this movie is so beautifully wrought, but it is."

Immersive universe, you get to know everything the characters do for fun, how they work, how they get what they want, etc.

Truest tragedy I've ever seen, so terrible to watch these well built, relatable characters just suffer horribly for a third of the movie<br/><br/>Cons:
Jared Leto's voice can be annoying
Slight overuse of main theme song<br/><br/>Best part: Sara's monologue to Harry about being old and wanting to get on TV, an excellently acted, written and shot story of emptiness and want, most powerful scene in relation to the themes
Worst part: the TV characters coming into her apartment, not too effective compared to the rest of her story, accompanied by some slightly crappy special effects"

I feel like good movies are becoming hard to come by and this one, despite becoming quite old, grabs your attention and holds it for the full time.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why people are leaving 1 star reviews, I feel they are unable to just appreciate a film for what it is.

","In the summer four residents of Coney Island dream of better times. Widow Sara Goldfarb spends her days watching self-help programmes on television; then one day she gets a phone call inviting her to be on a show... she is determined to go on wearing her favourite red dress. Unfortunately she is a little too large for it; dieting doesn't work so she turns to pills. Her son Harry and his friend Tyrone are regular drug users who have a plan to fund their habit and raise money for a better life by turning to dealing... all goes well till their supply is shut off. Harry's girlfriend Marion is also using and resorts to prostituting herself to get her fix.<br/><br/>It must be stated that this film isn't easy viewing; in the opening scene we see Harry taking his mother's television to pay for a fix. Then, even as things are getting better for him, we see his mother drawn into a different but no less dangerous addiction... prescribed by a doctor. As summer turns to autumn things get much grimmer and one wonders just how bad things will get... and it gets worse. Director Darren Aronofsky's use of rapid cuts captures the manic urgency of the addicts' lives. The cast is impressive; in particular the four leads; Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb; Jared Leto as Harry; Jennifer Connelly as Marion and Marlon Wayans as Tyrone. They really make us believe in their characters as their lives descend into a nightmare. Overall I'd certainly recommend this but prepare to be disturbed."

","From a viewer point of view, sometimes you like movies not to be so frank. Sometimes you prefer movies lie to you and let you get away from this ,somehow, ugly world. But if you are looking for this you should never watch this ""requiem for a dream"". This is a truely honest story of poor poeple engaging themselves with drugs and start destroying their not-so-beautiful life, second by second through the film. Like othe aronofsky films, the atmosphere is bothering in almost every scene, specially in the first 60 minutes. You might feel nothing about the film and want not to continue. But then the final 30-40 minutes arrives, everything changes, the atmosphere, the composition, the rhythm, everything, and it engages you with the story, with the characters, and then you can't move away. You want to find out where these people gonna reach. So you will stay with the film and you will follow it. To be honest the atmosphere remains bothering, torturing your mind and soul. But you are somehow surprised and you can't just let it go. So surely you will be more satisfied with yourself for choosing this film to watch when the final credits apear with that amaizing soundtrack in comparison to when you were watching the opening scenes with the same soundtrack.
Finally, perhaps this film is a little bit overrated with that 82 position among toprated 250 movies. But no doubt it is a very good, dark but honest movie you should watch. But only once because you can't and I think you don't want to watch it again. But you will always remember its amaizing brilliant soundtrack and you may want to listen to it again and again."

"hashishtripathi-76937","9","1","1","14 November 2018"," Requiem For a Dream - A Review
","It takes a considerable degree of cinematic madness to venture to make a movie like Requiem for a Dream. The reckless psychological thriller by Darren Aronofsky stands tall and bold in its title of the 9th most disturbing movie of all time according to esteemed sources. Only having been the director of Pi before Requiem, it seems to have been a leap for Aronofsky to take up a project about dark subjects like those the movie reeks of.
Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) receives a crank call about having won a spot on one of the electrifying commercials and lucky draw shows she obsesses over out of fascination. Being the spick-and-span old lady she is, she unknowingly begins speed pills to lose weight and struggle into her favourite red dress. Meanwhile her son, a spoiled junkie called Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), opens a drug business with his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) to help his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) set up her own boutique. The three miserable youngsters and Sara slip into grave miseries and ricochet into the darkest mirage of their dreams in a requiem that plays its purpose effectively.
Believe me, there is not one performance in the movie that fails to compete with the other three. Leto and Connelly are perfectly successful in their chemistry and tragedy. Burstyn takes up a terrific makeover since her The Exorcist role years ago and her performance never lets you get comfortable in your seat.
Aronofsky and his hip-hop montage are amusing portrayals of the movie's disturbing theme. The exactitude of the pressure created by Hubert Selby Jr (also the author of the novel of that inspired the film) and Aronofsky's screenplay and Clint Mansell's music and Matthew Libatique's cinematography are what keep you interested enough till the movie takes a deep dark drift. A drift which will make every conversation about drug films excluding Requiem for a Dream incomplete.
Here is a movie so unabashed, so heavy, I say it should be a lesson to all those teenagers looking to experiment. Because it explores the dark side of the dark world. Because it tells you how you face the music after the fun. How letting lose into an addiction can cost you your freedom, body, mind and soul."
"garethcrook","6","1","1","27 October 2018"," I have a bit of a hot and cold thing with Aronofsky
","Pi remains one of my favourite films if not my favourite of all time, but then he's made plenty of rubbish too (The Fountain, Noah). Despite the acclaim that Requiem for a Dream gets, I always put it on the cold list, it quite literally left me cold. I thought it was time I gave it another chance though, maybe I'd just caught it at a bad time, perhaps I'd been unfair to it all these years. Mansell's score right away is something to enjoy, it's rich, immersive, ever present and it's superb. Picking right up from where he left Pi. The style that Pi had though is lost a little, but it does have something about it. Simple neatly composed shots, it flows like it's been storyboarded meticulously. The camera kept tight, often abstract. All that. I like. The jump cuts and split screens, spinning overhead shots get tiresome though, it's relentless. BUT that I think is the point, it's a war of attrition, beating the viewer down as the world of all the characters falls apart. There are several shared actors with Pi, in fact I think the entire cast is present, but here the characters portrayed, I simply didn't care about. It's heartless and distressing, packed with (now dated) 90s visual effects, fisheye lenses, speed ramping, audio distortions. If Lynch were in charge it may have worked, but where Lynch carefully crafts this stuff, Aronsofsky goes for the full kitchen sink. Ultimately it's just bleak without the artistry. A damning portrayal. Of drugs. Of society. Of America. Of celebrity. Of television. Of addiction to what people think they need in life. Slaves looking for the high, looking to be accepted. It is utterly depressing and for all its positives, that's the reason I don't like it. That all said I don't think I hate it as much as I once did."

","This is one of those movies which leaves a deep impact on your mind even weeks after you have watched the movie. The plot is simple and might have been told many times - drugs and it consequences. But the storytelling, cinematography and the splendid acting(each and every actor was simply superb in their role but it was Ellen Burstyn who stole the show) makes you feel as if you know the characters. You feel their addiction, you feel their pain. And if this was not all the background score amplifies all of the emotions during this film. The result : a MASTERPIECE."
"labellejon","10","1","1","10 September 2018"," Sticks with you long after the movie is over
","This was my favorite movie in high school and it still remains one of my favorites. Pi set the tone for what was to come with Aronofsky films. Requiem for a Dream absolutely solidified his film making vision. Then you add the collaboration of Clint Mansell with the Kronos Quartet and you have a disturbing masterpiece of cinematic art. That is no easy accomplishment. He has only achieved more since then and continues to use Clint Mansell for his scores, and I would have it no other way. This can be a hard one to watch for most, but I do believe that is the point."
"VAndolini","10","1","1","8 September 2018"," Real, raw, and a descent into addiction hell
","I do not know what to say. As one who knows addiction, let me say, even with Aronofsy's flair for bizarre, that this film is the most realistic portrayal about the hell of addiction in film history. Someone here said it is like a modern day Reefer Madness, but that reviewer sounds like a person who kills kittens for fun. No, it is not that stupid film. It is an ALLEGORY for the devastation of addiction. That means, even with the director's unusual way of filming, that watching this film is akin to watching addiction personified. Over the top? Sure, but that is addiction. Weird and dark? Yep, addiction. Lastly, let me say that legend Ellen Burstyn gives her best performance in her heartbreaking portrayal of addiction of the elderly. Good God, how the heck did that moron Julia Roberts win the Oscar over Ellen's work? You need a strong stomach for this film, but that is addiction. Period."

It will get under your skin, and make you think for days. Nothing is predictable or derivative. Rather, it is just mind blowing creativity. I watch most movies and can think of at least 10 ways they could have been better. When I watched this one, I realized this guy was a master, there was nothing I could have done to improve this. It was very humbling in that regard. It really takes you deep into the mind of an addict in a manner that changed film making for eternity. Standing ovations for this one.

It works at every level. As a message about drugs, as we see the self destruction of four lives in a slow and excruciating demonstration of addiction. Also as an experimental film with weird editing and cinematography and a great score.<br/><br/>Also at acting, because we watch a clear descend into drug madness and all the changes the personalities of the characters go through as they fall.<br/><br/>It might be a bit over the top here and there, but it is mostly grounded.<br/><br/>One of the best decisions was not to pay too much attention at the ""fun"" the guys were getting with their hits. They skip the ""fun part"" that 90% of movies about the subject get so enamored to.<br/><br/>And with that, Darren Aronofsky created a masterpiece that is a punch in the face to Hollywood usual and glorifying portrayal of drugs... the punch goes also to our stomach."

It scared me profoundly, but more than scaring, it made me very melancholic about life for some reason. I loved it how Aronofsky used the fridge as a character and the fridge puppeteer is also part of the cast in the final titles. This shows the great imagination of Aronofsky.<br/><br/>Another scene that really stuck with me is the part where the boy is running towards Marian, but as he ran, I imagined a vertigo effect, of the bridge getting further and farther, symbolising that he would never reach her, that pure and beautiful dream. <br/><br/>This film did not bore for even a second, and I even watched it the second time."
"Gresh854","10","1","1","27 August 2018"," The Most Traumatizing A Movie Can Possibly Get
","Requiem for a Dream is the most psychologically brain-damaging drama of all-time. The finale of this film is like watching your soul get squeezed, as your heart slowly shatters, and once it's all finally stopped, you're left only with a gutless and empty feeling inside. Now this is why Aronofsky wins. Say whatever you want about the guy glorifying everything in his films, but at least he does it with a passion that can not be matched by any other director. He will get his message out no matter the odds-in this case, the odds being his choice to insert some of the most stressful sequences ever put to film. The first time I saw this film was somewhere around my mid-High-School experience, and it's frightened me away from ever even remotely thinking about doing hardcore drugs, ever since. FYI, to teachers who are trying to teach kids not to do drugs, don't show your lame-ass, cheesy, cheaply made, 90s-released, ""Drugs Aren't Cool!"" documentary videos, just show them Requiem for a Dream, and I guarantee every single human being who sees it will be scared of doing drugs for a solid and long amount of time. The fact that this movie didn't even get nominated at the Academy Awards for best editing is an absolute sin, cause the editing in this is some of the most effectively creative but also stressfully poignant, quick-cut mastery ever achieved. And when you add the impeccably dreamy cinematography and EPIC original score by Clint Mansell with the editing, voilÃ , you have yourself a technical masterpiece. It's no surprise that Ellen Burstyn got nominated for an Oscar for this movie, she brings home a marvelous performance, and so does Leto, Connelly, and quite surprisingly Wayans. Whenever someone asks me-and this is rhetorical, nobody really has asked me this-""What's the most screwed up, repulsive, nerve-racking, and unorthodox movie you've ever seen?"" Typically I answer with Requiem for a Dream (or mother!, but that's for a whole other review/discussion). But trust me, when I say this, I mean that as the upmost apical, and positive compliment. If there was such thing as an A double or even triple plus, I'd reward this movie with it, but since that doesn't exist, I guess we're going to have to rate this the proper way: (Verdict: A+)"

One way or another, it succeeds at both by showing the horrible effects of crime and addiction can have on people.<br/><br/>Some of the acting and camerawork can come off as sub-par at times, but it's easy enough to get past since the vast majority is spot-on. Many scenes use time lapses and multiple shots playing on different parts of the screen. These kind of effects are used to amazing effect and add a lot more artistic flair each sequence.<br/><br/>Something a lot of people neglect to think about when talking about movies is the sound design, and I don't think I've ever experienced better use of sound design than in Requiem. Music is playing nearly constantly throughout the movie, and makes scenes that are already very intense and emotional have even more potency. At one point, I actually nearly fell out of my chair because I thought something had shifted in my room when a sound effect was positioned perfectly.<br/><br/>The problem I have with Requiem is that for about 20% of the movie, I just felt sick from just how horrible the situation was. I suppose that really is the strongest thing about Requiem, and why I think a lot of people would really hate watching it. I'd say that anyone who likes drama or tragedy would likely enjoy it, even if it's a bit much to take in at times."

","One of the most inspiring and authentic pieces of film I have ever had the privilege of seeing.Original close-ups , great pace and rhythm , excellent score , as well as capturing the viewer and emmersing him/her withing the world of hardship that exists in life ie drug abuse , survival,....Mr Aronofsky is by far one of the most influential Directors of all time in my opinion taking film to another exciting level."
"nbfcblog","9","1","1","1 October 2017"," A Disturbing Masterpiece
","While watching Aronofsky's uncompromisingly bleak journey into the downward spiral of four individuals living in Brooklyn, I couldn't help but think of the famous Nine Inch Nails tune Hurt.<br/><br/>The lines, ""The needle tears a hole, The old familiar sting, Try to kill it all away, But I remember everything"", bring to mind Harry's (Leto), one of our protagonists, heroin addiction.<br/><br/>In a way both Hurt and Requiem for a Dream (RFAD) deal with similar themes regarding individuals engaging in self-harming activities (in this case, drug use) as a means to escape their empty lives.<br/><br/>This isn't to imply that RFAD is just a simple anti-drug PSA because while the four main characters such as the aforementioned Harry, his grandmother Sara (Burnstyn), his girlfriend (Marion) and his friend Tyrone (Wayans) are each addicted to different types of drugs; what truly drives their actions are their obsession with achieving the idealistic American Dream in order to find happiness.<br/><br/>RFAD MW<br/><br/>With Sara it's being on TV, with Harry and Sara it's starting their own clothing store, and with Tyrone it's the simple desire to be loved by someone like his mother did when he was a child. Protagonists with obsessions that eventually lead to their downfall is a common theme in Aronofsky's filmography whether it's clinging on to their 80's glory days (The Westler) or perfecting ballet dancing (Black Swan) and RFAD is no exception.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has also never been afraid to get weird. Much like David Lynch, Aronofsky uses surrealism and unorthodox film-making techniques as a tool to help externalize the emotions and state of minds of the characters.<br/><br/>This is on display with the film's then revolutionary ""hip hop montage"" technique (previously used by Aronofsky in Pi) in which a large number of rapid short cuts are used to illustrate the character's transition from sobriety to intoxication.<br/><br/>While there are plenty of crazy camera techniques and visual elements utilized throughout the movie such as body cams shots (Ex. Tyrone running away from a gang hit) and rapid visual distortion to showcase the characters suffering from withdrawal, by far one of my favorite moments is a quiet moment that features Harry and Sara talking face-to-face while lying in bed together.<br/><br/>Instead of being in the same shot, both of their faces separated by a split-screen format. Despite saying they love each other, the cold dialogue delivery and the separation by the editing serves to illuminate the hallow-ness of their relationship. Harry and Sara are more in love with the idea of each other if anything else.<br/><br/>There are many other tricks being used in order to immerse the audience into the subjective emotions of the characters, none more so than with Sara who as the film progresses experiences more vivid delusions of being on a potentially non-existent game show in addition to increased stress from trying to lose weight. Let's just say you will probably never be more scared by a refrigerator than when watching RFAD.<br/><br/>Speaking of Sara, it would be a crime to discuss RFAD without mentioning Burnstyn's magnetic transformative performance. This isn't to minimize everybody else because the acting quality in general is great, heck, even Marlon Wayans (playing against type in his only dramatic role so far) more than holds his own against the likes of Connelly and Leto. If there was any weak link in the cast (if any because once again, everybody is awesome) it would be Leto due to his uneven New York accent in the first half of the film. Despite all the characters having less than admirable qualities, the acting gives each of them a level of believability that works in conjunction with the guerilla-style cinematography to lend an air of authenticity to RFAD.<br/><br/>RFAD Sara<br/><br/>However, seeing Burnstyn going through her transformation from absent-minded white- haired grandmother to a pill-popping anorexic red-haired wreck is both horrifying and an awe-inspiring testament to having dedication to one's craft. Out of all the characters, Sara is the one I had the most sympathy for since she was the most innocent out of anybody. She sincerely cares for her son Harry and wants nothing more than for him to be happy. This is what makes her ""nothing is left for me"" speech to Harry simply heartbreaking. Burnstyn gives some of the best acting I've ever seen because the sadness in her delivery and expressions was so moving that even cinematographer Matthew Libatique broke into tears while shooting the scene.<br/><br/>Needless to say, RFAD is far from an uplifting film and is easily up there with Grave of the Fireflies as being one of the saddest films I've ever seen, but it's also a great Greek tragedy-style psychological character study that isn't afraid to show the ugly side of humanity."

","Darren Aronofsky's directing and Hubert Selby Jr.'s screenplay combined created this riveting visual masterpiece!<br/><br/>Top it all off with excellent cinematography and editing, and you have a film that is jaw-dropping.<br/><br/>My regret is seeing the trailer first - of which did not really give the jaw-dropping scenes away, but still set the stage of what I'd expect.

","Requiem for a Dream is a 2000 film by Daron Aronofsky which deals with one of todays many problems in society, drug & Heroine addictions. The movie its self actually centers around 2 separate story lines one of which deals with an older woman chasing her dreams and does anything to do it, and second of her son who hit jackpot with drug distribution loses it and tries to get it back. Throughout both story lines there addictions become more and more of a key role, too the point where its causing them too lose sense of reality and whats morally right and wrong , but at the same time they cant live without it.<br/><br/>The Cast does a brilliant job delivering these characters and the Director definitely makes the mood of the story as haunting as possible. Throughout the movie you care about them even through out the the things they do that will normally make a person cringe. But this is where Requiem of a dream Most definitely Excels.<br/><br/>But through out the sheer Brilliance of the story and atmosphere itself its almost impossible to recommend it too everybody. This movie is downright depressing beginning to end which will turn some people off. Also its worth noting that it Definitely deserves is R rating. This isn't a film too watch if your having a good day because it will leave you depressed for the rest of it. But if your in a mood to sit down and watch a extremely well made modern day Shakespearian like tragedy, then I see no reason why you will not find this anything less then a modern classic"
"Willie-12","9","1","1","7 September 2010"," Powerful And Heartbreaking
","I just finished watching Darren Aronofsky's Requiem For A Dream. I don't know why it has taken this long for me to see it. It just has. And now that's it's over, I feel like I just got punched in the face. Maybe even kicked there too. Now I'll admit it. I like the Academy Awards. I do. They may get things wrong often. But if I'm being honest, they get many things right too. However, every now and then they make a mistake that is so egregious, there's no justification for it. And not, at the very least, nominating Requiem for best picture is one of those inexcusable mistakes. Don't get me wrong. I liked Gladiator. In fact, Gladiator (which won best picture for 2000) is a film that exceeded my expectations. There was far more depth found within it than I could have imagined. But when we're talking about the realm of overall societal and cultural relevance and importance, Gladiator does not hold a candle to Requiem...plain and simple. All too often, films get labeled ""important"" just for being edgy and willing to test the boundaries of a difficult subject matter. Well Requiem doesn't just test the boundaries when it comes to portraying the destructiveness of drug addiction, it obliterates them. This really is one of the most important films ever made. Aronofsky pulls no punches here. He is determined, with this film, to lay bare any and all deceptions that are attached to drugs. And he exposes them for what they really are. Slow, painful, and methodical killers. The downward spiral that is exhibited by the characters is both heartbreaking and disturbing. And the acting is phenomenal. There's no doubt that Ellen Burstyn deserved her Oscar nomination. Her performance was just about as realistic as it gets. But I think other nods could have been given as well, especially in regards to Jennifer Connelly. I really don't even have words to describe her performance except to say that it was mesmerizing. I can't imagine how difficult it had to have been for her to prepare for this role. The content is raw and uncompromising. And to be completely honest, some of the scenes are difficult to watch. However, in the end it is the message that rings loud and clear. It is the message that trumps everything else. And it's the message that maybe, just maybe will make someone who is thinking about dabbling in drugs change his or her mind."

","Requiem for a Dream is probably the most powerful film I have ever seen. Everything just fits here, the road to h*ll for each character just couldn't be portrayed any better. Visuals, acting, plot, message, pace...everything just hit me like a full-speeding freight train! Brutal! <br/><br/>It is a horrible, devastating, gruesome to watch. And that's exactly how it should be, cause that's how drugs are! Drugs WILL kill you, and they'll do it slowly, painful and messy. First they'll destroy your brain, then your body and just slowly drag all life out of you. Drugs are most definitely one of the most horrific things on this earth. And still, I couldn't keep my eyes from it. I just had to follow Harry, Sarah, Marion and Tyrones destroyals of themselves, to know the end. It was a very special feeling to be both repulsed and fascinated at the same time.<br/><br/>Another thing that fits 110% is the soundtrack. Wow! It's a fabulous score in itself, it's somewhat beautiful, scary, horrible, sad and addictive all at once, just like the picture is.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is perfect. Personally, I think this H*LLRIDE should be shown to every 13-year old on the globe. If that wouldn't drastically cut down the number of addicts I'd be surprised. Thank you Darren Aronofsky, thank you every person involved for giving us such an extraordinary powerful anti-drug movie! 10/10"

","First, let me say that this is an outstanding film and I have nothing but awesome to say about the actors performances...Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leno in particular being incredible.<br/><br/>I have a slight issue with the story.  Being a doctor, I found it too much to accept the ending of this story.  Also, I am hard pressed to believe that any licensed M.D. or D.O. would continue to prescribe amphetimines to a lady in this state (or even that they would contemplate starting one).<br/><br/>I have to mention that electroconvulsant therapy (""shock therapy"") is painless when administered these days, it is given under sedation and has shown to be beneficial in cases of refractory depression (in treating amphetamine addiction, I do not know of any trials or studies).

","This is not a bad movie, but it is completely overrated. The plot is rather flat, predictable and the characters remain superficial.  OK, the message that drugs are bad may need to reach every generation in a new mantle, but it is not that revealing for most people that got out of their teens.  The fast cuts and comic-like style elements are not really new or original, ""run lola run"" used them more efficient and a few years earlier (and maybe some even older movies I don't know or cannot remember).  *minor spoiler*  The very elaborate images of the mother's drug induced psychosis are interesting, but not very realistic.  Yes, the movie may be disturbing, but only for viewers that are not alienated by its flaws.  Apparently the majority."

","*Spoilers*<br/><br/>""Requiem for a Dream"" is a movie that, at first, may seem hard to understand (there were many things I was confused about when I first saw it), but it is nevertheless a very movie with a very powerful message.  Just a warning: If you like happy, uplifting movies or movies with a nice ending, do not watch this.  Though it is powerful and moving, it is also sad and depressing because it depicts the true reality of drug use.<br/><br/>Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is the mother of Harry (Jared Leto), and she is addicted to food and a certain TV show.  She receives a phone call saying she is going to be on this television show.  Excited, she goes to her closet and pulls out the red dress she wore to Harry's graduation.  Realizing it doesn't fit, she tries a diet from a book one of her friends gives her. When this doesn't work, she goes to a doctor who gives her diet pills.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Harry, his girlfriend Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are distributing drugs to others in order to support their own drug habits.  When their shipment runs out and they have no drugs for themselves, Harry and Tyrone drive to Florida to score a big deal.  This leaves Marion so desperate that she turns to prostitution to score some drugs for herself.<br/><br/>As all this is happening, Sara's addiction to the diet pills is becoming stronger and stronger.  The diet pills, in a way, have the same effect that the drugs do: they give her a temporary ""high,"" but also cause her to have dangerous hallucinations (the refrigerator moving).  It eventually becomes so intense that she has to be hospitalized.<br/><br/>The ending of this movie is one of the disturbing things I have ever seen. I'm not an extremely squeamish person, and I've witnessed relatively graphic material in other movies, but this was extremely difficult for me to watch (I almost fast-forwarded through the parts).  It's one of those situations where you don't want to watch it, but it's so powerful and mesmerizing that you just can't take your eyes off the screen.  I won't spoil it for you; it's something you have to see for yourself, but it's EXTREMELY DISTURBING.<br/><br/>An especially exceptional performance was given by Ellen Burstyn.  I'm surprised she didn't win an Oscar.  I believe this movie should be shown in every high school (elementary is too young, and junior high are not mature enough to understand it).  The sooner kids are exposed to this while they are still impressionable, the less likely it is for them to use drugs in the future.  <br/><br/>Now I'm not a parent or teacher preaching this, surprisingly enough, I'M A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL.  The sad reality is, there are kids in my school, and probably most high schools, that use drugs.  If they had been shown this movie even their freshman year (I don't believe freshmen are too immature; some are, but I know some very intelligent ones), I bet about 90% of those kids would not touch drugs.  Sadly, because of the graphic sexual content and drug use, both of which only serve to heighten the impact of this movie, many schools will probably not show this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, a chilling, but effective portrayal of the effects of drug use and how they ultimately lead to self-destruction.  9/10"
"lbinder","Null","1","1","16 August 2002"," A Complete Film.
","Spoiler Alert Aronfsky delivers a troubling work about drugs through, what I consider, the true use of film.  He has managed to take advantage of every aspect of filmmaking available in order to drive home his vision.  There is not a single component of this work that is not additive.<br/><br/>The title: think of the subtle meaning.  Requiem, a song for the dead. I love the implication and foreshadowing.  I can read two interesting interpretations: (1) The dream is dead before it begins; (2 -- and the one I believe) the people who are dreaming are already dead.<br/><br/>The acting: a beautiful performance by each actor.  Not a single expression or characterization is wasted.  Each breath seems to be in sync with the pace of the editing.<br/><br/>The lighting: the most glaring example is when the camera trucks across Sara Goldfarb's apartment, from the cavernous bedroom, to the multi-fluorescent living room/kitchen -- I love the green halo around the fridge.<br/><br/>The editing: while, I agree with an other commenter, that some of the editing at the front of the film is obvious, the editing in the last third is powerful.  The editing manages to keep your mind where the director wants it.  I would certainly call this a lesson in Eisenstein's montage theory.<br/><br/>The script: the language phases in and out of quality and derangement in the same was as the various ""push-offs"" in the story.  The accents are never over used.<br/><br/>The score: I think enough has been said -- it's amazing!<br/><br/>I really only have one problem with the movie, the end.  I can read the end in two ways.  A major let down, in terms of the fact that the mother ends happy (at least in her mind).  And while deranged, and left with the vision of her friends crying, we never learned to care for her friends anyway. Also, I don't feel like Tryone's (Wayans) torment is serious enough, relative to the others.  I was expecting him to be raped by an inmate; in the same style he had sex with that girl earlier.  And, finally, I don't believe that Marion (Connelly) is delivered into a deep enough hell -- but, maybe I'm too American.<br/><br/>The positive way to read the end of the movie, is it is purely anti-climatic, much the way drug use is.  And so the pace of the film as a whole might be analogous to a use.<br/><br/>Bottom line is this is a remarkable movie, which made me feel physically ill by the end (as it should)."

","When I decided to start my DVD collection, I decided it had to be composed by only the best available titles.  I did not want to fill my cases with summer blockbusters which lacked storylines, but wasted special effects. I wanted true filmmaking, preferably independent.  We all know that Hollywood has their stars and their money, but most of their movies lack everything a real movie should have.  Someone recommended Requiem for a Dream, so I read reviews about it here on IMDB.  I proceeded to purchase it and view it with some of my friends.  We were absolutely impressed.<br/><br/>The story is so strong it leaves deep marks in those who view it.  Hubert Selby Jr. wrote a great novel, and he and Aronofsky did a terrific job in turning it into a screenplay.  The decadence of human beings of different ages, races and sex is true in everyday life, and the movie does not hide it.  It is strong and is shown as it should be.<br/><br/>The performances are brilliant.  Ellen Burstyn gives her best with the role of Sara Goldfarb.  Jennifer Connelly, besides her beauty, portrays a perfect Marion, who takes advantage of that beauty in pursuit of a dream.  Jared Leto and Mr. Wayans do not fall behind, not to mention Christopher MacDonald as Tappy Tibbons.  Their interaction onscreen is absolutely marvelous and they never let the story fall apart, unlike the lives of the characters they play.<br/><br/>The music is great.  Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet provide a solid musical background in every scene.  The soundtrack is so good everybody I know comments about it and some, including myself, have it constantly playing in our computers.  It is strong, it is suspenseful, it is brilliant.<br/><br/>The directing by Aronofsky is excellent.  I saw Pi after seeing Requiem and I was impressed by how much this director can put into a movie with so little experience, but not little talent.  It is directors like these what films need, not greedy producers who want to make money out of the dumbest ideas.  Filmmaking should be an art, not a business.  Picasso didn't paint or sculpt to live in riches.  Neither did Beethoven or Mozart when they composed their symphonies.  As a matter of fact, most of them lived rather normal lives, contrasting with the opulency of those who now buy their belongings or works at auctions.  Thank you, Mr Aronofsky, for being a true artist."

"allisonnack","Null","1","1","6 December 2000"," A harrowing depiction of the addiction process
","Requiem for a Dream, the latest film from Darren Aronofsky, the acclaimed director of 1998's Pi, can be described with a word that is not often used in conjunction with today's film offerings - that is, groundbreaking.<br/><br/>Aronofsky, a meticulous director, uses distinctively innovative techniques to set the tone and convey the themes within this dark, beautiful, complex depiction of the nature of addiction. Aronofsky makes use of split screens, revolving cameras, extreme close-up, distorted angles, blasting sound, and repetitive symbols, all in an effort to convey the actual experience of the substance user under the influence. The film is a visceral experience, unrelenting in its portrayal of each character's descent into their own personal abyss.<br/><br/>The film focuses on three main characters: the Jewish mother from Brooklyn, Sara Goldfarb, played by Ellen Burstyn, the son, Harry, played by Jared Leto, and the girlfriend, Marion, played by Jennifer Connelly. Mom is addicted first to television, and as a result of a proposed appearance on her favorite show, decides to lose weight with the aid of diet drugs, prescribed by an unethical physician. Harry and Marion are fond of heroin, but they will settle for something amphetamine in a pinch. All three start out as casual users, but as they persist with their addictions, each character's environment deteriorates and they all sink deeper into unreality. Aronofsky portrays this by having the characters interact with each other in a relatively normal way at first, focusing on the familial relationship between mother and son, and the romantic one between Harry and Marion.<br/><br/>The early scenes are brightly lit and pleasant to watch, with many shots of the gorgeous Leto and Connelly lying head-to-head, looking remarkably alike, awash in drugs and love. Even the screen-wide use of the symbols and sounds of drug use seem exhilarating and exciting at first, and it is not until the viewer is bombarded with them relentlessly that they become uncomfortable to watch and hear. Aronofsky splits the film into three parts, subtitled Summer, Fall, and Winter.  The seasons change along with the characters, and as time progresses, the characters split from each other, each advancing more deeply into their own addiction and despair. Their individual descents parallel each other, which Aronofsky represents by quick cutting from one character's current predicament to the others, all the scenes infused with garish colors, murky lighting, and disquieting music. At one point Aronofsky unites the characters by showing the visual similarities between the bloodshot, bruised, and terrified eyes of the mother, the heavily made-up, smeared and bleary eyes of Marion, and the infected, bloody and blackened wound that Harry grows on his inner arm.<br/><br/>The performances in this film are very strong, especially from Ellen Burstyn, as a perfectly realized suburban junkie. Her character is really the sympathetic one, caught not in a desire to get high, but just to be a little more attractive. Her plight is the most saddening. Also notable in his role is Marlon Wayans, playing against type in a non-comedic role as Harry's drug buddy.<br/><br/>In a conventional drug film, the addict usually dies, as a morality play, or to accomplish some finality for the storyline. Aronofsky refuses to go for the easy way out. The last twenty minutes of this film possess some of the most harrowing footage I have ever seen, and there is no respite for the viewer or the characters."
"MichaelHoward","Null","1","1","2 December 2000"," Dreaming for an Audience
","The Beginning<br/><br/>Hubert Selby Jr. wrote a novel in 1979 about four addicts on a downward spiral entitled Requiem for a Dream.  Working alongside young writer/director Darren Aronofsky (Pi), Selby co-wrote the screenplay based on the novel.  The film is now in select theaters.<br/><br/>The Movie<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream follows the life of four characters, (Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely, Marlon Wayans, and Ellen Burstyn) connected to one another by family or friendship, trying to live a happy life.  Leto is a young man trying to make a lot of money selling drugs with Wayans in order to start a real business with his girlfriend, Connely.  Burstyn plays the mother of Leto's character and she dreams of being on television and losing the weight she has acquired over the years in order to do so. While Requiem is obviously an anti-drug film, it goes one step further and is more about addictions and self-destructive behaviors.  The characters are trapped in a vicious circle of behaviors that are impossible to escape and only grow deeper as time moves on.  The dreams fall further and further away as they enter a downward drug spiral. When people hear a movie is NC-17, they automatically think of hardcore sex or excessive violence.  And most of the time, they're right.  But Requiem is about the realism that goes along with drug use and addiction and the hopes and dreams that are shattered because of it.  The film should be seen and appreciated for the message it presents.  But because it's NC-17, many people won't even give it a chance.<br/><br/>The Review<br/><br/>Amazingly powerful and poignant. Now, marijuana is one thing.  Folks who say, `drugs aren't that bad, I've smoked weed here and there and I'm fine' don't know a thing about big time drug use.  Watching the characters in this film use hard drugs and then watching as their lives are slowly destroyed is not an easy thing to sit through.  Director Darren Aronofsky makes sure that you don't take it lightly with his quick editing and extreme imagery that is sure to stun. This film truly shows the horrible life that drugs can lead to.  And for you weed aficionados out there, this isn't nearly the same thing. Ellen Burstyn is absolutely remarkable.  I have not seen much of her work but she is top notch here.  This was not a simple role and she was completely convincing as well as touching and diverse.  Jared Leto and Jennifer Connely both shine in their roles.  They share a sweet relationship even through the rough times as drugs lead their lives in terrible directions.  Marlon Wayans was terrific.  After seeing his comedy sketches and Scary Movie, I was unsure he could pull this type of role off but he did it well.  As we hope for all of the characters to pull through, Aronofsky gives us the realistic resolutions that happen in the life of drug users. The cinematography is wonderful as it changes with the seasons in the film and the characters ever darkening lifestyles.  The soundtrack is mesmerizing and perfectly suits the film.  Many argue that the editing of the film is pretentious or down right excessive.  The difference in shots and, most importantly, the drug use scenes are critical parts in the delivery of this film.  See it and you'll know what I mean. Because this film is NC-17, theaters will not allow admittance to anyone under 17, even if the parent is there and approves.  At the age of 22, I got carded trying to see it.  Hell, I had to travel an hour to Denver to see it because conservative Colorado Springs won't show it.  And even in Denver, it was only available in one theater.  There is a big spectacle about young people seeing this.  I would rather it be Unrated or NC-17 than to have seen it cut down to an R rating.  Cutting down this film would take away from the entire point and the true affect would have been lost.  I also think that this movie should be seen by a younger demographic because in many instances, that's where drug use and addiction begins.  Sure, there are many scenes of gratuity and brutal honesty in the depiction of drug use and the surrounding life but that's the point.  And this is the type of film that can stop people from pursuing that type of life.  And instead of turning teenagers off to that type of lifestyle, we're keeping one of the biggest reasons for them to avoid drugs away from them.  But hey, they can always watch flicks like Natural Born Killers, right?  Since we forbid them from seeing a gripping film about drug use, we'll make it up to them by letting them watch all sorts of films filled with sex and violence everywhere else. Bravo. No other film I know of can compare to the reality that Requiem for a Dream portrays and the emotional turmoil surrounding such events. Trainspotting and The Basketball Diaries, to name a couple, don't even come close.  The film is hard to stomach for many people because the images are definitely disturbing.  But so is drug use.  This film spares nothing in showing the viewer the lengths people will go to in order to feed their addictions and the results that come from it all."

The user comment summary on the main ""Requiem For a Dream"" page says:<br/><br/>""Killer Performances by Ellen Burstyn...Darren Aronofsky, Stanley Kubrik has called for you to pull up a chair!""<br/><br/>I mean, please, Stanley Kubrick, apart from being dead, has definitely not said anything about pulling up a chair.

Anyway, allow me to continue.<br/><br/>The movie has to grip you on a deeper level than purely superficial which me, my bro & my mate all agree it does not.<br/><br/>That does not mean I don't agree with the movies message, that addiction leads to a downward spiral of destruction, I just thought the movie wasn't that gripping or as interesting as I had hoped.  I also do not think this is a ""drugs are bad"" movie per se, the movie is just impartially illustrating a case scenario of addictions on various levels.<br/><br/>The movie loses momentum, and the continual intermissions of cocaine snorting, pot smoking and heroin injections disturb the flow of the movie after a while.  By the end of the movie rather than be shocked at how appaling the situation has become, I was just glad the predictable and inevitable ending was over.<br/><br/>A word from the wizard: ""there's more to a good movie than original directing and shock stories"".<br/><br/>Overall i was left disappointed by the movie, expecting more from it. 5/10."

This is the failing of Requiem For A Dream.<br/><br/>It's an interesting concept, but looks far too clean and stylized to be taken seriously. There could've been many more ways to approach this. And personally, I feel Aronofsky should have chosen a less gimmicky one. By constantly attacking the viewer with ferocious images, Aronofsky defeats his own point. He wants to show you that what's going on is real, but the way he shows you seriously detaches you from the film after a while. He takes several camera and editing techniques that were great in Pi and runs them into the ground. This movie tries to be gritty, but the fancy camera tricks ultimately just propels the cinematic quality way over the point. Give it a try, you might like it, but I personally felt it simply tries too hard to be real and ultimately comes off as fake."
"tom_jones2","Null","1","1","22 October 2001"," Ugh.
","Glad I saw this film.  Never want to see it again in my life. I'm not sure why Hubert Selby Jr. has taken it upon himself to present us these basically likable people and subject them to such nerve-ripping torture and misery.  Sadism, perhaps? This is not to say that there aren't beautiful elements in the film.  I could go for miles on the ""Summer"" section.  Ellen Burstyn's speech on growing old and being alone is extraordinarily sad, and the friendship between Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans is a true joy.  Wayans' energy is simply wonderful.  And Jennifer Connelly?  Oh, my.  It truly is a shame that there aren't more women out there with her looks and her energy, and confidence and sexuality.  It's even more shameful that the ones who are are all spoken for. But I digress. I can understand the point this film makes:  addiction is bad.  (Boy, never heard THAT before!!)  But it also points out many of the legal addictions that many commentators seem to have forgotten:  chocolate, coffee, television, drink, food...longed-for letters in the mailbox, the desire for money, music, sex, love, hope... It would be nice to have some kind of light of hope to hang on to.  But it seems as thought Aronofsky just wants to subject his viewers to nausea, revulsion(do we really need to see a needle jamming into a festering purple sore?  or a sexual degradation done THAT explicitly?!?), and a depression so intense, you just want to jump out the nearest window. Ugh. Nice vision of ""Summer,"" Darren.  And incredible artistry and editing.  Now, PLEASE, for the rest of us, give your sadism a rest and give us images of real beauty. I'll settle for ninety minutes of staring at Jennifer Connelly in that red dress at the edge of the pier, or just have her staring at me. But keep me away from movies like this one!"

This is not a happy film.

"Heavenly Creature","8","1","1","31 August 2001"," The most affecting film of all time?
","Requiem for a Dream is not a film I will be watching again.  Not because I didn't find it absoloutely stunning, both visually and psychologically.  I did.  It's because of those reasons that I will not be watching it again. <br/><br/>
Some films touch you in a way that the standard Hollywood blockbuster yawn-fests can't.  They ground you, force you to take a look at your life, and the lives of others around you.  They show you what is going on in the world, a world which many of us have been protected from all our lives. Requiem for a Dream is one of these rare movies.  <br/><br/>From the claustrophobic opening sequence, to the horrific finale, the film takes you on a journey that you will never completely recover from.  It shows us the lives of four addicts who want to become something better, but merely become shadows of their former selves.<br/><br/>The acting is simply breathtaking.  At times, it feels like you are watching a documentary because of the impressive casts realistic performances.  Jared Leto is fast becoming one of my favourite actors, taking roles which fight against the ordinary.  His Hollywood good looks (thankfully hidden in this film) mean that he could become the new Leo Dicaprio or (God Forbid) Ben Affleck if he wanted to, but his roles in Fight Club, American Psycho and now this show his true acting abilities.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn is the real revelation, though.  She is absoloutely astounding the gameshow-obsessed mother who wants nothing more than to fit into a little red dress for a TV appearence.  Her scenes with Jared Leto brought a tear to my eye everytime - the two had a real connection. <br/><br/>
If I have one gripe about this film, it's Aronofsky's complex and much-heralded use of camera angles.  There is no denying that this man is a technical genius, and there are times when these camera shots are genuinely effective.  But most of the time they distract from his amazing cast.  The film works much better when he simply takes a break and lets the superb acting take precedence.<br/><br/>Like I said at the start of this review, I will not be watching Requiem for a Dream again.  My one viewing of it is enough to last me a life time.  But everyone from fifteen upwards should be forced to watch this film once, if only to highlight the awful price of addiction."
"jonathandoe_se7en","9","1","1","15 August 2001"," A hard pill to swallow (No pun intended)
","SPOILER WARNING<br/><br/>When I first saw Requiem for a Dream on the cinema, I gave it a 9 rating, having since bought it on DVD I am not sure weather I should change it to a 10. Everything about this film fits the tone of the material - yes the stylish ways in which the film is put together do distract at times, but I commend Aronofsky for putting the audience into the perspective of the characters. Darren Aronofsky first came to attention with the Sundance hit Pi (1998), but with Requiem for a Dream he pulls out all the stops. Every film technique is used in order to make you feel every high and every low that these characters go through, Hip-Hop montage, digital shots, crash cuts, triple exposures... All of them help create one of the most dizzying a distorted views of life ever put on screen. <br/><br/>I don't want to say too much about the plot, because I think there has already been so much written about it, I would like to say that I admired the use of each season the film used represented the feelings of the characters e.g. Summer  Warm optimism, Fall  The beginning of the fall of the characters, and Winter  Cold and detached. Another reason I haven't mentioned the plot is because too many people are hailing this picture as a ""drug film"". Yes drugs play a part but I would say it's more about the ""dream"", as demonstrated in my favourite scene in the film when Harry (Jared Leto) goes to visit his Mother Sara (the underrated Ellen Burstyn). Everything Sara says towards the end of the conversation is what Requiem for a Dream is all about. Being thought of as someone, having a reason to make the beds, wash the dishes, to have a reason to get up in the morning... All of this, this wanting of something more is what this film is about.<br/><br/>But this film is not for everyone, there are moments in it when it felt like I was being suffocated, the images add up to a barrage, making the viewer as disoriented as the characters. There are also some truly disgusting moments, at times you think that Aronofsky has gone to far (Shooting up into the infected arm and the sex orgy were pretty brutal), but it all makes sense, Aronofsky knows that by the end of the film we care about the characters, and this is really needed if we are to ""get"" the ultimate message of the film. Way too many people dismiss Requiem for a Dream as depressing or disgusting (Hey life is not pleasant people), and those who call Aronofsky a glorified MTV director basically are to shallow to take the time that is needed to fully take in the impact of this remarkable film.<br/><br/>9/10 maybe 10/10"

I have never seen her go through such a transfermation of character as she did in Requiem.  She is truly fit for the role, and she should be given her due kudos.  Not to slight any of the other actors in the film.  Marlon Wayons and Josh Leto give great performances as well and the women that plays Leto's mother in the film is stunning.

","You know Darren Aronofsky is a great director when you see his name above the title in large letters, and it's only his second picture (the first being the excellent Pi).<br/><br/>Requiem follows the tale of four people's journey into spiraling into addiction, whether it be food, cocaine, weight-loss pills, etc, etc. The message hear is clear: Addiction can come in any form, any shape or size. But the movie NEVER becomes preachy, and does not hesitate to show graphic images (if you are looking for lots and lots of nudity, you will sorely be disappointed) of the drug's effect, using what Aronofsky appropriately, 'Hip-Hop Montage', which is basically quick images and sounds thrown at the viewer, along with many fast-forward parts, during the drug scenes. All of this style really shouldn't work with the subject matter, and turn it into nothing but an MTV film (cough, The Cell, cough, Hallow Man, cough, cough) and is probably the first serious drama that used so many special effects shots (keep your eye out for the revolutionary 'Snorrie Cam', which is a camera attatched to a person's body part, like the head) but...the whole thing is successful.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn plays an overweight mother who just gets a call to be on a game show. Excited, she tries on her 'red dress', which doesn't fit, and ends up resorting to weight-reduction pills (which are really speed) and the red dress is her source of the addiction, she wants to get in the dress, but the pills have horrible consequences.<br/><br/>Then, there are three drug dealers (Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly) hoping to make it big on a sale. Their own paths change, for the very worst.<br/><br/>The plot's simple, the charcters are four-dimensional. In fact, all four actors probably give their best performances ever, and Burstyn actually deserved that oscar more than Julia Roberts - her character is the most human, and, like the whole cast, totally believable. Marlon, fresh off of Scary Movie, also shows that he is indeed a great actor.<br/><br/>The Bad?<br/><br/>The whole thing is very dark. Too dark for some. If you are a little squemish, or faint of heart, please avoid this film. You may think, ""Hey, it's just a movie"", but some people have been actually pretty disturbed by its dark nature (It was released to only a few theateres because Artisan knew the NC-17 would give it the flush. It should have been called ""Requiem for a Nightmare"".<br/><br/>Overall, if you find it at a store, pick it up (the DVD is especially great) and watch it with a high school student or by yourself or whatever (this is definitely not a date movie), just watch it.

","Much like ""Leaving Las Vegas"", which also deals with addiction, this film relies on disturbing and shocking elements from which to draw its power and effectiveness. No, I didn't think it is a film with a ""just say no"" message. Neither this is a ""Trainspotting"" clone, because here you are not an outsider taking a journey with a psychedelic twist through the world of heroin-addicts, but are, on the other hand, thrown right in, without the safety line. ""Requiem for a Dream"" is an ""as is"" portrayal of drug addiction and its consequences, most of which you will recognize, as they have been done before.

","I think the people criticizing the film for being ""style over substance"" because of the fancy editing have missed the point. The director seems to be using these effects for a purpose, to portray psychological time accurately, and in my opinion he succeeds. By slowing down time in some scenes or by speeding up events, he is showing us how it feels to be his characters, either under the influence of a drug or in a hurry to the next fix.<br/><br/>Also notice that he does not hit us all at once with these devices. He starts out slow and gradually builds to the horrifying climax.

To make us feel the agony of this poor woman, Kurosawa has her scraping her fingernails on corrugated metal.  It's torture to the audience to listen to.  I've never seen a more effective way to make an audience feel a characters pain than that.  <br/><br/>Aronofsky comes very close.  His method is to alter time.  What's so effective and scary about this film is that there is no comfortable turning point in the script that triggers the descent into destruction.  It just happens.  And when the audience realizes that they're are being dragged down into hell along with the characters without any warning, it could result in a number of reactions and emotions.  There was one point when I realized that my fist was clenched.<br/><br/>I can highly recommend this film to most anyone.  It should be seen by every junior and high school student.  The party/sex scene should be cut for that though. But if it can scare kids away from drugs, I would label it as an IMPORTANT film. <br/><br/>Lastly, I wish to address the controversy concerning Ellen Burstyn's performance being head and shoulders above Julia's Robert's in Erin Brockovich.  Well,........it is.  However, anyone with a brain in their head can see that this is not a film that the AMPAS can give their blessing to. Jeremy Irons didn't impress them with his role as a drug addict in Dead Ringers either.  Just be grateful that we have this wonderful performance on DVD to watch as often as we want.  We intelligent movie lovers who demand stronger stuff in our entertainment can fully and emotionally embrace this courageous woman for literally altering her physical appearance to play this pathetic character.  It will only be with the passing of time, that she will be revered and recongnized for giving the best performance by an actress in 2000.

After you've seen the movie, check the web site, which is as different as the film itself."

","I was skeptical of seeing this movie because I have to admit Pi was not exactly my favorite movie.  But after seeing Requiem, I left the theater stunned.  This was an incredible movie, with beautiful imagery and the entire cast was amazing.  Ellen Burstyn definitely deserves an Oscar for her role as a lonely and unknowing speed addict, and who knew that Marlon Wayans could act??  Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly were great as usual. The last few minutes of the movie left me horrified, but in a surprisingly good way.  You MUST see this movie."

I will never, ever, forget this film.  A definite must see."

","I just watched Requiem for a Dream at a sneak preview.  Going into the film I had high expectations, but let me just say that the film surpassed all of them.  This film WILL GET TO YOU! Watching the main characters slowly destroy their lives from drugs is not an easy thing to sit through, especially the way it is portrayed on screen.  Anyone who is taking drugs or is even considering taking drugs should view this film.  I know people who are faced with the reality and consequences of drug addition and drug abuse. Sadly, this film accurately portrays the affects.  It is an important film that needs to be seen.<br/><br/>The writing, directing and acting is the best.  Even Marlon Waynes brings his acting status to a new level. But when Oscar time rolls around, I don't know how the film will sit well with the voters.  But one thing is for sure, the editing and cinematography should be shoe-ins for nominations as well as Ellen Burstyn's performance!  My God... she HAS TO BE NOMINATED to say the least.  The haunting images and fantastic score will forever be in my mind.<br/><br/>After my friends and I left the theatre, no one was talking... we were still absorbing the film.  This film is truly an EXPERIENCE unlike any other. It is shocking, scary and horrifying- several people covered their eyes during scenes. Be careful going into this film and keep an open mind. Remember, it was going to be rated NC-17, but Artisan decided to keep the film as it was and release it as ""Unrated."" This was smart on Artisan's part b/c if the film had been edited down to an R rating, the affect wouldn't have been as great thus the entire point of the film might have been lost. Bravo to the filmmakers and everyone who worked on this film for taking the chance and making an extremely risky film. It is truly in a class of its own.<br/><br/>Unless you have no soul, I guarantee it will move you and leave you stunned by the time the end credits roll.  It is a very, very TOUGH film to sit through and IMPOSSIBLE to forget. One of the best films of the year, right next to Almost Famous.  I highly recommend it- with caution."

","(I originally wrote this review for a journalism class. It's my first film review, and i hope to write many more in the future.)<br/><br/>I have a theory that the longer it takes me to utter a word at the close of a film, the harder it has hit me. After walking away from Requiem for a Dream, it took me forever to utter even a sigh. I felt as if I had just watched a car accident, and I could remember every gruesome detail.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is terrible, haunting film; the kind of film that's dark images that might chase me into nightmares. The film is a nightmare. When I say this I am not speaking from a critical standpoint and this is not a `horror' movie in regular context. However, this piece, about the horrors of drug addiction, is not for the faint of heart. The film was critically a masterpiece, perhaps the best I have seen this year.<br/><br/>Requiem was written and directed by Darren Arnofsky, better known for another dark film about life, Pi (1998). Requiem revolves around a young dreamer named Harry Goldfarb, (Jared Leto of My So Called Life, Fight Club) and his widowed mother, Sarah (Ellen Burstyn of The Yards, Deceiver). The film also features Marlon Wayans (of Scary Movie, In Living Color on television), and Jennifer Connelly (of Dark City, Labyrinth).<br/><br/>This isn't the average, run of the mill `Drugs are Bad' stereotypical film, despite the fact it was Arnofsky's mission to create a film that dutifully rendered the theme of the book it was loosely based on, Hubert Selby's Last Exit to Brooklyn, A book about the ills of drug addiction. Instead, the extraordinary cinematic technique of Arnofsky makes it hard to look away. He uses sped up sequences, split screen shooting, and various camera angles as a few `brushes' to illustrate the film's basic storyline.<br/><br/>Harry Goldfarb (Leto) and his best friend Tyrone (Wayans) have big plans. By getting hold of a fine score of Heroin they are able to cut it themselves and sell it on the streets. With Harry's end of the profit he wants to assist his girlfriend, Marion (Connelly) in making her clothing boutique a dream come true. Somewhere along the line major complications arise, the three frequent the drug more often, and the three are thrown into a wild mix of various trouble with drugs, violence, and the police.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Harry's mother, Sarah, (Burstyn) has settled into a painful and lonely routine of cooking and cleaning.  After a phone call from a television game show scout, Sarah wants to diet and look her best. She has even picked out her best dress to wear on television. When her diet seems certain to fail she enlists the help of a doctor. Without so much as a care he prescribes her pills in the form of speed. At first these pills work, yet she slowly becomes addicted, abusing the medication. As time drags on she eventually loses track of herself and reality.<br/><br/>Requiem is a shocking look into the world of addiction and denial. The film painstakingly focuses on a mere heartbeat of the lives of Harry, his mother, Tyrone, and Marion. It glorifies and downplays their personal day to day struggles, their fears and hopes, and the eventual destruction of everything around them through their respective addictions.<br/><br/>Arnofsky and his cinematographer Matthew Libatique have put the film together is such a manner that time races by when it's characters are on their drugs, yet it seems to drag when they're not. The feeling that the characters believe that life between highs is dull, and they are waiting for the next hit becomes hauntingly evident. In addition the scenes of drug induced highs are bright and busy, while those without are seemingly drab and clouded. One thing that got to me was how dimly lit each of the character's apartments were how little sun came in, the emptiness, and openness of each. In one scene Harry is walking out a pier in the beautiful summer sunshine to Marion, who is waiting patiently in a red dress. I found it interesting since in one of Connelly's latest films, Dark City, she is featured in a similar sequence. It is also interesting to note that Ajay Naidu, Sean Gulette, and Samia Shaoib, who appear in small roles, were also in Arnofsky's film, Pi.<br/><br/>One of the most influential techniques in this tale is the music. Clint Mansell (Who worked on Pi as well) employed The Kronos Quartet to perform every song on the soundtrack, such as aptly titled pieces `Ghosts of Things to Come' and `The Beginning of the End.' Each piece is as haunting and nervous as the images on screen, and the music is impossible to ignore as a reminder of the tension and collapse. It is equally as powerful as the film in haunting the viewer long after the final fade."

"shoddy","5","6","15","4 March 2004"," heavy-handed drugs fable
","A useful comparison could probably be made between 'Requiem' and the far superior 'Trainspotting'. Both are based on novels and both attempt a no-holds barred depiction of the consequences of drug abuse.<br/><br/>'Trainspotting' delivers a forceful message with a cunning collection of comedic set-pieces interspersed with some of the grim realities of urban squalor. The use of comedy and the film's refusal to patronise or preach both lend weight to its impact. Viewers are left to make up their own minds and most will be left in no doubt that heroin use is no laughing matter.<br/><br/>'Requiem' adopts a more hard-line approach. The viewer is shown a dark descent into oblivion, without a single spark of humour to light the impending gloom. Its characters start off impossibly beautiful and wind up horrifically ugly. All subtlety is lost in favour of driving home the message that drugs will rob you of your dreams and your dignity as well as your dosh.<br/><br/>I respect 'Requiem' for its uncompromising stance but I fear that in telling only one side of the story it fails to provide a balanced account of drug use. It deals in grotesque caricatures and while these provide a heightened sense of drama, they bear little relation to reality and so I feel the film's message is lost."

"MartinHafer","10","4","9","23 August 2016"," A visual assault on the senses about the hellishness of addiction.
","Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all star in this incredibly painful film about four people who are chemically dependent. When the film begins, the first three folks are all using heroin yet seem to be reasonably functional. Over the course of the film, their lives begin to disintegrate badly. At the same time, Burstyn plays an older woman who becomes addicted to amphetamines because of an irresponsible doctor who tosses out pills like candy...and she goes from a relatively normal lady to someone who seems like she's crossed over the line from sanity to oblivion.<br/><br/>""Requiem for a Dream"" is an exceptional movie and there's nothing else like it. However, it's a film that I am happy did not spur on other similar films, as it's also a visual assault on the senses and very difficult to watch...and I would hate to see film after film made like this Darren Aronofsky project. Using rapid intercutting (far, far more than normal) of scenes, fisheye lenses, exaggerated sound effects, shaking lenses, multipanes, television characters that come popping out of the screen and other strange gimmicks, he makes the viewer feel as if they, too, are stuck in the throes of addiction and, eventually, insanity! It's mesmerizing as well as unpleasant...and it's appropriately so considering the subject matter. In fact, I don't think a better film has ever been made about the hellishness of addiction...it sure captures it in all its vivid awfulness!<br/><br/>In addition to the incredibly clever use of all these films techniques, the movie has a lot going for it. The script, though very episodic, works well...and is made all the better thanks to some amazing performances, particularly by Burstyn. My only complaint about the film, and it's very minor, is that Jennifer Connelly is just way too pretty to be playing a woman who is that addicted. Sure, over time she falls apart...but she still looks model beautiful during most of the film. She would have been better looking skankier...or an uglier actress might have worked better!<br/><br/>So who would I recommend should see this film? Well, anyone who loves films and longs for something different should certainly see the film. Also, despite all the nudity, violence, vomiting and nastiness, I actually recommend parents consider showing it to their kids (especially if the teens have begun dabbling in drugs or thing it looks cool or fun). It will do far more to discourage them from using drugs than any pat message or sermonizing!! It shows drugs in all its sleazy awfulness....no holds barred. I challenge you to find a film THIS difficult to watch and effective when it comes to presenting the effects of drugs. I am not sure how the film received an R rating, as it seems more like something that should be NC-17. Horrible to watch...especially as the film progresses, so don't say you weren't warned!! By the end, I was in tears...<br/><br/>I should note that the Etc (electro-convulsive therapy) they show in the film is similar to the type done decades ago. They do NOT do shock treatment like this today and it is a relatively benign sort of treatment for folks who simply won't respond to other treatments for depression...thank goodness."

One of the main messages is the illusions and hallucinations people experience due to drugs. The only one developed sufficiently enough is Ellen Burstyn who imagines she is on a game show and her acting is very good. The other dreams are shambles, this uninspired film follows the lives of 3 junkies trying to make a score. It really conveys nothing and is extremely dull, your trip to the supermarket was probably more meaningful and eventful. <br/><br/>The hallucinations for Jared Leto are barely developed to ascertain the concept of a dream or illusion nor is the illusion of Marlon Wayans. This movie is an absolute and utter waste of time, it is beyond comprehension how such a piece of worthlessness has this rating. If anything, it proves you cannot always trust critics.

I haven't known anyone that has done drugs of this magnitude, but seeing this film could prevent any young mind's ideas of how 'fun' shooting drugs into your arm looked.<br/><br/>Personally, I feel this movie should be featured in schools everywhere; with heavy editing and censorship, of course.

","Shallow, narrow minded, opinionated and a overall heavy-handed opinion on drugs. Aronosfsky's 'Requiem for a dream' manages to holds our attention with interesting and unique cinematography which is used to paint a subjective experiences of several drug-addicted/influences characters. Unfortunately, this is done in such a extreme anti-drug sentiment that it leans more towards some sort of anti-drug propaganda than true, insightful art.<br/><br/>Empty of sub-text and any sort of thought-provocation, Aronosfsky holds our hand through this highly implied story and suggests that if we touch a drug, we could end up having our arms amputated, or working as a prostitute for cash. Was this Aronosfsky's intention? I cannot say - but this is what seemed to be implied in the film. If he had high ambitions for the films overall impact, it certainty fell short. I found this film like Riefenstahl's Nazi-propaganda piece ""Triumph of the will"", great cinematography, masterfully crafted - but it's overall message highly disagreeable.<br/><br/>This could have been a great film if the story was handled more carefully without these disgustingly over-the-top vilification of drugs.

The absolutely brilliant soundtrack (yet again delivered by Aronovsky's long-time cohort Clint Mansell, this time with The Kronos Quartet) delivers a massive backdrop to the unpredictable scenery. Avant-garde quick clips between iconographic imagery are used to punctuate movements in time (e.g. person getting high on drug). The acting is acute and good.

","This movie, without question, is in my top 3. The only two that top it are the first two Godfather movies, which I see as classics in the overall genre of film. But, for those who only see Requiem for a Dream as a drug related movie, I say ""Wake up!"" The movie focuses on four main characters: Sara Goldfarb, an aging elderly woman who has no one special in her life but her son, and is a widow, and tries to fill the void in her life by watching television. After receiving a phone call (most likely a hoax) from a television company which 'discovers' (ha yeah right....just like i win a free laptop by picking out a picture of Paris hilton) stars and talents for television stars...finally finds some meaning in her life aside from her only son, Harry (Jared Leto). Meanwhile, three drug junkies....Harry Goldfarb, Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wyans, in my opinion, the only worthwhile performance he's ever given) and Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) each face different dreams: Harrry's dreams of making it big, to not have to haul off his mother's TV every week to make bread to deal with his increasing drug addiction and to put it in his own words, to just make his mother happy.....Tryone's dream of becoming something more than just a street peddler, and Marion's dream of being loved by her parents', to replace her parents love of money with something tangible...like their daughter. Each dream is shattered by a complex unraveling of the said dreams....ruined and drowned by their own addictions. The cinematography is the best I have ever seen...and the acting is by far, superior. I won't give away anything else...only to let reader's know I have been a serious viewer of movies for 10 plus years now...and I find ""Requiem for a Dream"" to be one of a kind and my third favorite movie of more than close to 500 I have watched. For the love of GOD watch this movie if you haven't before. It will change your perspective."

","""Requiem for a Dream"" (hereafter ""Requiem"") may be well-acted, expertly-directed, and perfectly explicative of the situation drug users find themselves in but I'm not in a position to tell you about any of those things. I know nearly nothing about making movies and know even less about drugs. So instead of singing praises for how well this film portrays a certain kind of lifestyle, or for discussing its artistic merit, I'll restrict my comments to experience watching the film. In short, it was boring.<br/><br/>The film has very little plot. It's quite evident from the beginning that it sets up a parallel between drug abuse by the mother of the main character, the main character himself, and his friends. The film makes it quite clear that it'll track their comings and goings as they sink further into addiction and watch the substance of their lives slip away. It tries to weave these parallel stories together in a way that dramatizes their experience. It turns out that this is not a really engaging way to arrange the events of an film. It's kind of, well, boring.<br/><br/>The film uses lots of dizzying imagery to, I suppose, express what the drug-influenced characters may be feeling. These effects irritate the senses. There's nothing interesting about watching a character on screen act kinda crazy and see his fridge come to life. Similarly, it's not fun to be subjected to erratic camera movement or any of the film's other visual effects. When time is condensed and the camera moves about the scene swiftly, the viewer is often left remembering why he or she doesn't spin in offices chairs for fun: because being dizzy is not enlightening or interesting, it just makes one feel sick.<br/><br/>Let me close by saying that I really don't understand the drug film genre. Films of this type often seek to tell us how awful our lives can be if we become addicted to drugs. But I don't think this is such a valuable service. I, for one, I already knew that; reason helped me conclude such without Hollywood's help. I therefore cannot imagine that films like this can actually be deterrents, instead they stand as documentation of what it must be like to live a horrible existence. These films can't really be artistic, per se, they can just give us a look into a much worse life than reason allows us to pursue. If that kind of thing gives you your kicks, by all means watch the film. If, however, you prefer films that tell stories about complexities inherent in living reasoned, well-examined lives this film will prove to be just a bore. Skip it and watch a film that offers substance instead of pseudo-experience."

"bill-987","10","3","6","3 October 2006"," Robbery, pure and simple!
","Let's get this one downer out of the way first. That Ellen Burstyn lost the Best Actress Award was a horrible travesty. That she lost it to an above average actress in a marginally average film about an incident of below average interest actually takes a little of the sting out because it demonstrates the political b-s- which is the Academy's voting process. Burstyn delivers the performance of her career as Sara Goldfarb, an older woman whose loneliness drives her to a dependence on diet pills. Had Burstyn won the award I'd probably be complaining about the inadequacy of the honor.<br/><br/>I don't believe in the concept of any artwork being 'definitive' of its style or subject matterÂ…but this one comes pretty close. I can't think of any other film about drug addiction which deserves to be in the same conversation with ""Requiem"". It's depressing, horrible, tragic, powerful, and intensely compelling.<br/><br/>I really want to avoid including anything which smacks of a 'spoiler' and might lessen the power of the rabbit punch a new viewer will inevitably receive but I can't help returning to Miss Burstyn's performance. My first reaction was to feel for the tragic young lovers Harry and Marion but their plight was really of their own making. Sara just wanted to be popular. She wanted to be on TV and be envied by her friends. She wanted to turn back the clock and fit into her best red dress. I know, I know, the doctor's prescription for amphetamines flies in the face of common sense and gives us a convenient heavy, but it in no way diminishes what Miss Burstyn did with the character.<br/><br/>There should be lots of other kudos attached to this film; Jennifer Connelly's delivered her best ever, as has Wayans, Leto, and Darren Aronofsky and Hubert Selby, Jr. put a lot of love into this screenplay. Selby's hands on to the point of living on the set and acting in a minor role.<br/><br/>Films are supposed to entertain us. For many of us the surest way to entertain is to evoke strong emotion. If this film can't make you feel, you've 'accidentally discorporated' (Heinlein) and haven't noticed yet. Ten stars!"

But don't get me wrong these two films are nothing alike.Darren Aronofsky brings to life Hubert Selby Jr's novel like no other director could, Fastpaced, great dialouge, trippy music, great acting (especially from Ellen Burstryn).<br/><br/>The film tells about 4 people trapped in the horrors of addiction. The beginning starts off somewhat happy, but the more you watch the darker and more disturbing this film gets. As the characters fall into their own personal oblivion they refuse to let go of their dream.<br/><br/>This film should be shown to all high school kids.

","The first time I saw this movie was in shock. I was so moved by Jared Leto's performance and Ellen Burstyn's. They choose the right people for the movie. The last fifteen minutes are painful to watch, NOT because it's bad acting or boring but because it's so real and gritty that I feel sick when I see Jennifer Connelly on the table ""dancing"", Jared Leto in the hospital, Ellen Burstyn in the ward and Malon Wayans in prison.<br/><br/>The movie made me realize how far people are willing to go just to be happy. I always knew I would do whatever it takes, legally, to become what I want but to see on the verge of life and death running toward what they believe to make them happy so sick you can really see how far people are willing to go.<br/><br/>I think everyone should see this movie AT LEAST once in their life. When I bought I took it over to my friends house and we watched it in his living room with is 12 year old sister and I told her ""watch this. just don't leave until the end, and you'll feel something inside."" She watched and felt different, even if it was just about never injecting drugs at least she would take something away. I think she realized how power human's will is when it comes to happiness."

","As I watched the end of the movie, I was just shocked. When people say ""boys don't cry"". I felt the exact opposite. All the pain and suffering the characters had to go through showed lots of emotions. In my opinion, the message the movie was trying to tell me was that anything can be addictive. TV, Drugs, Junk food, Internet. The movie was breathtaking and changed me in the inside. The message wasn't an anti-drug message, but more of a message to tell you everything should be used in moderation and that everything has to be balanced out or things will go whack. Whether it's TV, Substances, Food, even Working or gambling. These can be bad for you by law, health, life, etc. I would'nt recommend this, but really want to tell people about it."
"EvLauster","10","3","6","27 May 2006"," Burstyn's performance will haunt you to the last tear jerking scene, possibly the strongest movie ever made
","**** Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connely, Christopher McDonald, Keith David, Louise Lasser. Directed by Darren Aronofsky<br/><br/>I'll start off by saying that ""Requiem"" is possibly the strongest, saddest and most well acted movie I've ever seen. I wish there were more adjectives for the word ""astonishing"" just so I could have more words to compliment Ellen Burstyn's captivating performance. Never in all of my life of watching movies have I felt so connected with the character study or let alone believe what is being done to these poor people.<br/><br/>The four stories of a few patrons in New York city consisting of an ailing, old mother Sara (Burstyn) and her dead beat, junkie son Harry (Leto), his pal Tyrone (Wayans, a surprisingly great performance) and Harry's lover Marion (Connely). When their drug addiction warps into something unimaginable it renders them helpless and scrounging for a way to live through the day with just one more taste of that sweet sweet drug they begin to crave. <br/><br/>Hubert Selby is a great writer, he did a well adapted screenplay of his book (which I am still reading). The lines are beautiful, everything down to that look on their faces when the realization of their dreams being crushed apart is there. And what is so shocking, what is so engaging of ""Requiem"" is that it is believable. I even began to care for them, for their lives and the effects on each action. <br/><br/>Aronofsky has met his high point, since ""Pi"" wasn't that great, but ""Requiem"" will be the one he'll be remember for. And Marlon Wayans who never astounded me, does a great job his character as well is played perfect. This is by far one of the best ensemble casts in a movie that all work well and function through out since I can remember. <br/><br/>And I have never been so outraged as when Burstyn did not win the Academy Award, those people must be out of their f@#&%ng minds to not see the beauty in her performance. This movie will in fact haunt you to the very last frame with Clint Mansell's ""Summer Overture"" playing in the background. Mansell's beautiful sounds add to the effect, making it a perfect tear jerker. And this is part of the very elite list of movies that made me come so close to actually shed tears at the sight and sound of the last scene. So in one word if I had to describe ""Requiem"", that would be REAL."
"teh_mode","9","3","6","26 March 2006"," Purposefully hideous tale about a far too real journey
","You will come out of Requiem For A Dream feeling like you've just seen your children die. It's a heart crushing experience that runs on flashy paranoia and vomit inducing grit. If you don't feel sick you will definitely be upset. It's such a powerful film that features inspired performances and spot on direction. This is a film that utilises every ounce of material it is given to put it's audience through a torturous yet utterly compelling voyage of why drug addiction is anything but glorious. It's not the easiest film to watch, but it is certainly an important one.<br/><br/>Harry and Ty are partners in petty crime. They both dwell into cocaine and heroin which leads to increasingly gruesome consequences, sending them on a long road trip to Florida. Harry goes out with Marion, another recreational drug user who along with Harry, is having money issues, and sets out to degrade herself in order to avoid freezing to death in the New York winter. Harry's mother Sara is a lonely, weight-obsessed TV addict, who is naively given speed pills in order to shed her pounds and get on a TV game show. All of them are spiralling out of control.<br/><br/>Two things that amazed me about Aronofsky's film: Marlon Wayans, that really unfunny bloke from such laugh riots as White Chicks and Don't Be A Menace... is excellent here. Secondly, a film this bleak and raw is actually one of the most visually stylish films I've ever seen. This is all done with purpose in mind. Whereas other directors have used hazy cinematography and quick-fire editing for solely experimental purposes (I'm thinking mostly of Oliver Stone) Aronofsky creates a style that is every bit as flashy as it is meretricious. One minute Marion and Harry are lying together in a stoned haze of ecstasy, professing their love for each other in poetic, yet disturbing words. When the characters are on the move, everything illuminated, and sized up to show New York at it's most gruesome and low-key. This style makes for an incredibly watchable experience, without ever adding a lighter touch to the drama. Similarly themed pictures have had comedy touches such as Danny Boyle's Trainspotting or Scorsese's Goodfellas. Requiem owes a lot more to the horror genre, as in many ways it is an endurance test, one that kicks it's audience in the head with it's visuals and pierces through to the heart with it's narrative. The soundtrack is by Kronos Quartet, who also provided the music for Michael Mann's Heat. It provides a simmering sound wave that always suggests danger, and then goes full tilt along with the narrative's varying crescendos.<br/><br/>It is a career high point for all concerned. Jared Leto continues to eschew his heartthrob aura by dirtying himself up as much as possible, and choosing an intelligent project, when he so easily could be Michael Bay's poster boy. Marlon Wayans really surprised me here. I'm tempted to forgive him for all his previous misdeeds, as I see a really good performer trapped behind the shtick. But the standouts are the females: Jennifer Connolly is great as the self-degrading girlfriend of Harry and Ellen Burstyn delivers a gruelling performance of an isolated woman slowly walking the line of sanity and insanity, and delivering some of the films most heart-shattering moments.<br/><br/>There isn't much room for hope in 'Requiem'. The screenwriter, Hubert Selby Jr., has never been one to shy away from the less-than-cheerful, and we are presented with a story full of darkness and repulsion. There is too much power in this tale to make it depressing. It is more than tragic, but serves a very pertinent purpose. It has to be seen."

It focus a lot of things in the past, present, and future of our world, shows how drugs are addictive and how they destroy you, and everything that is around you.. and shows that dreaming too high sometimes can be bad.

I don't want to say, I wanted to see a good movie and that's what I did. This movie, is, like another translation, Desilusion over Addiction. A perfect narrative and a magical sound. My favorite sentence of this movie is when Sara says ""My name is Sara Goldfarb"". Oh, what a great movie. I don't know what to say. Another topic of the movie is the relationship between a mother and a son, both destroyed by the drugs and their addictions.<br/><br/>It's obviously that the story and destruction of Sara Goldfarb is real because of her loneliness and the death of his husband. All the actors are fantastic: Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto...<br/><br/>The music is always perfect, always the melody, stunning, powerful, taking us to the end of the character's nightmares...<br/><br/>The only thing I disliked was that Ellen burstyn didn't won the Oscar for Best Actress.

"Juggertrout","10","3","6","29 January 2005"," Nightmares Come True
","My god. Where to start with this? Darren Aronofsky's follow up to indie hit Pi could be one of the most brilliant and emotional films ever. Aronofsky has managed to adapt Hubert Selby Jr's magnanimous novel to the big screen Â– and he's done a superb job of it.<br/><br/>The cast is amazing. Ellen Burstyn's TV addicted, speed taking mother was robbed of an Oscar by Julia Roberts' frumpy, irritating Erin Brokovich. She gives one of the most emotional performances you will ever see, her passionate monologue about what it's like to be old, and her paranoid acting makes you truly believe that acting is an art. Jared Leto, as her drug addicted son, also gives very worthy performance as does Jennifer Connely as his girlfriend. Marlon Wayans, too, delivers an amazing and serious performance that belies his slapstick comedy notoriety.<br/><br/>But this is a director's film; Aronofsky pulls out every directing trick in the book to make this a truly original experience. The shot of an overjoyed Sara Goldfarb as she runs out of her apartment and walks across the street with her old female friends as the camera swoons in front of them, creating a strangely eerie shot is one example. But it is the editing that shines, Aronofsky never leaves the viewer board with his unique style of hiphop montage editing and special effects.<br/><br/>The music in this film also shines, the classical score is wonderfully composed and highly dramatic in a film which demands it so heavily.<br/><br/>Although disturbing, this is a film that everyone should see, it is full of great acting, editing and truly memorable story."

Forget the monster-slasher movies, forget the bloodstained battlefields, if you want to shudder at the horrors of human existence, you have but to watch this.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing, everyone is good, and Ellen Burstyn is so good I will no long watch the academy awards. I will not go into the plot except to say it's about drugs, that's all you need to know. This film is creative, using split screens and wonderful camera work. It never feels hokey, and most importantly it makes you really want the characters to succeed. The tragedy is so great that it overwhelms you, dulling your senses. The musical score is haunting, and sticks in your mind for hours after the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best proof of its greatness was my physical reaction.

","A punch-in-the-stomach, kick-in-the-rear, slap-in-the-face of a movie that is as heart-breaking and difficult to watch as a Super Bowl involving the Buffalo Bills. ""Requiem for a Dream"", along with ""Traffic"", was bar-none the best film of 2000. Both deal with the hidden drug war this country faces. ""Traffic"" is an epic that has a wide scope while ""Requiem for a Dream"" has a very exact focus. Coney Island is hanging on by a thread and so are four of its inhabitants. There is elderly widow Ellen Burstyn (in an almost unrecognizable role that is her finest performance which garnered her an Oscar-nomination), her young-adult son (Jared Leto), his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend (Marlon Wayans). Burstyn gets a call one day explaining that she has been chosen to be on her favorite game show (hosted by the priceless Christopher McDonald). Burstyn is lonely and wants to go on television in her old red dress (which she cannot fit into anymore). She learns from a friend that a shady doctor will give her diet pills to help her burn off those pesky extra pounds. Meanwhile Leto, Connelly and Wayans are addicted to cocaine and heroin. They support the amazingly quick high they get from the drugs by pushing nickel and dime bags all over the city. However they get a bit more ambitious. They decide to buy in bulk in order to get more money in order to get high more often. The three want the simplest things in life. Leto wants a life with Connelly, Connelly wants to open a store that sells designer clothes and Wayans wants a woman to provide the love and compassion that his late mother gave him. It appears for awhile that the dreams may indeed come true, but drugs are not the answer and the trio soon learns this in a vividly disturbing way. Burstyn, addicted to supposedly legal drugs, will head down a path of destruction just like the three young people. Darren Aronofsky's (of ""Pi"" fame) haunting film is the wildest cinematic experience I have ever had. The film makes ""The Exorcist"" look like ""Sesame Street"" gone stark-raving mad. The revolutionary camera techniques and wild sequences make the film feel like the most death-defying ride at any amusement park. Hubert Selby, Jr.'s intense novel comes to frightening life (he also has a small role as a wise-cracking guard at a jail) due to a really smart screenplay, tight direction and revolutionary performances by the four key players. Burstyn goes beyond the best work she did in great films of the 1970s (most notably ""The Last Picture Show"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Harry and Tonto"" and ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore""). Wayans proves to be a really solid performer after being in silly productions that had little merit. Leto also proves to be an actor that can do much more than just stand in front of the camera. Connelly's performance (a role that is hard as nails to play) just continued to show what a versatile and risk-taking actress she is. She should have been Oscar-nominated here at the very least, but the Academy did make up for their mishap with her Oscar for ""A Beautiful Mind"". Not a joy to watch, but an immensely important film that should be experienced at least once by all individuals who are of a mature age. Rated NC-17 (that is warranted), ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a sledge-hammer of a film that will leave you visibly shaken long after you first see it. It could best be described as a guided tour of Hell on Earth. 5 stars out of 5."

","This offering about the downward spiral of a couple of drug addicts has the critics effusing wildly, but that's basically because it uses innovative film techniques to tell what would otherwise be a boring and depressing tale. Unfortunately, unless the techniques alone ring your bell, it's still a sad, boring and depressing tale of two drug addicts because the director relies on fast editing and other similar gizmos to make you ""feel"" what the druggies are going through. This is all very well and good one day, when he's learnt the basics of movie making and can perhaps add such ingredients with subtlety and restraint, we'll have a good film.

Anyone who is thinking about trying heroin, might find this movie to be a useful deterrent, but my prediction is that if you are stupid enough to try such a harmful substance, this powerful message may not even do enough to dissuade you.

","I don't know how great of an anti-drug impact director Darren Aronofsky and screenwriter Hubert Selby, Jr. hoped to make (or if that was their attraction to this theme in the first place), but the spiraling downward of four addicts, each from his or her own perspective, is detailed in such brutal terms, climaxing in a fury of sucker-punch editing and unmerciful film-composition, that I found I had to look away. The four main characters (a pair of reckless young lovers, the young man's television and weight-obsessed mother from Brooklyn, and their drug-dealer buddy) hit bottom fairly quickly, and with dire consequences. As a movie-maker, Aronofsky seems to have learned from the best, pulling a Kubrickesque barrage of tricks from his cinematic manual to create both a narcotizing and a nervy effect. The lulling daze these people fall into isn't romanticized--it's seen as a trap--and soon they're just rats in a maze (with Aronofsky filming them through a distorted fish-eye lens). We get insight into the sickness of drug addiction, but little sympathy--and perhaps that's why the film isn't moving on a hearty level (Ellen Burstyn's Brooklyn mom, for instance, already lives in what looks like lower-middle class hell, and the kids have no direction right from the beginning). As a case study, the movie does falter due to the content of style over substance, yet as a visceral experience it's a predictable triumph. **1/2 from ****"

","Being an admirer of Aronofsky's debut 'Pi' and a fan of Hubert Selby Jr's novels 'Last Exit To Brooklyn' and 'The Demon' I was expecting this to be the first GREAT movie of the decade but I was bitterly disappointed! What we have is a gimmicky directed, emotionally UNBELIEVABLE waste of a good idea. The only character who is half way realized is Ellen Burstyn's pitiful Sara Goldfarb. The other main characters are so thinly fleshed out and averagely acted that you end up with absolutely NO interest in their fate. In fact I couldn't even see any reason for Wayan's character to be in this movie at all, unless it was some PC reason to counter-balance Keith David's scummy role. All Wayans does is stare wistfully at his mother's photo and that's about it. <br/><br/>I found the direction (unlike 'Pi') to be flashy, irritating and totally unnecessary! One shot of drugs being snorted and a close up of pupil's dilating was fine, but over and over and over?! And the fast motion sequences only reminded me of the chase scenes in 'The Benny Hill Show'.<br/><br/>Lastly, what exactly is 'Requiem..' saying that we don't already know? If you take drugs you might get addicted and have to do ""bad"" things?? Is that as profound as it gets? Aren't we all adults here? I fail to see what I'm supposed to think is so outstanding about this movie. And if you find this ""distressing"", ""confrontational"" and ""too difficult to watch"" then all I can say is that you must live in a safe, Disney-fied world! Stick with your Julia Roberts movies..."

","I cannot deny that Aronofsky's film had a major impact on me. The night after I saw the film (election night, as it turned out), I woke up twice with nightmares directly relating to the film. While many critics have said that the film is powerful because it graphically depicts the horrors of drug dependency, I'm not convinced that Aronofsky isn't more interested in creating characters whose plummet into unspeakable degradation becomes an excuse for aestheticized gruesomeness, showy montage experimentation, and take-it-to-the-brink filmmaking for its own sake. The characters in REQUIEM never struck me as altogether real; rather, they are emblems of waste and desperation, put through their paces in order to provide grist for a callous, moralistic, and ultimately exploitive film. This is a shame, because my hopes were high. There is no denying that Aronofsky's images pack a brutal punch -- I still can't shake them. But I think a slower, less bravura execution of this set of stories might've conveyed human loss, instead of ""Look, Ma! Watch me cross-cut!"" Not recommended, unless you want to be pummelled for what strike me as dubious reasons."

"bibeaultj","6","2","4","3 January 2015"," A Mixed Bag
","Darren Aronofsky, who would go on to direct masterpieces like ""Black Swan"" directed this sophomore effort which is ultimately better than his debut film ""Pi"" but considerably less attractive than more of his recent efforts.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is quite simple, Jared Leto has a girlfriend played by Jennifer Connelly and a mother played by Ellyn Burstyn. He also has a friend played by the surprisingly good Marlon Wayans. Basically, each of the characters (including the mother) spiral into some sort of drug addiction, whether it be addiction to diet pills or heroine. This addiction causes them to end up in some very disturbing circumstances.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good.<br/><br/>1.The acting. Every actor gives it their all and the performances can be powerfully moving in the correct circumstances.Like I said, Marlon Wayans is probably the most surprising of the bunch, and this movie only gave me another reason to love Jared Leto. Burstyn is also quite good, although I'm not quite sure her performance was ""Oscar worthy."" Not to discredit her, it's hard to act when most of your lines consist of ""my red dress."" <br/><br/>2.The direction. It's a Aronofosky movie, it's going to look good. Every shot looks so well composed and some of the bleak images in the film have stuck with me for weeks.<br/><br/>3.The score. Despite only consisting of pretty much one song, this song literally fits every situation in the film and is just plain epic. This is the kind of song I would listen to YouTube on loop for hours on end.<br/><br/>4.The message. Anti-drug films are definitely hard to come by, since most movies that feature drugs are usually about partying. This film shows the darker side to drug use and how it can ruin somebodies life, or multiple peoples lives. It was a much needed message that films usually do not convey or do not convey properly. Ultimately however, I think the anti-drug message was much more well done and less preachy in ""Trainspotting"" but that's just me.<br/><br/>And now, the bad.<br/><br/>1.The plot. Why is this film so over the top? Somethings were just so melodramatic and insane that it was hard to get the full effect of the scene. Take for example the scene where Burstyn ends up in the hospital for taking to many diet pills. They stuff food into her mouth and force feed her. This took me out of the film because this would never happen in an actual situation like this, they would put an IV in her and give her the needed nutrients. Also, why did they use electric shock therapy on her? It didn't make any sense and ""he was trying to convey a message"" isn't an excuse. You can convey a message without making a film over the top.<br/><br/>2.The ending. Every character ends up in some negative situation that shows the effect of their drug abuse. This is supposed to be emotionally draining and leave the audience trembling in fear of the consequences of doing drugs. However, it was really hard to care about these characters as everything that led them to their positions was extremely over the top. It doesn't help that the characters aren't very memorable either, besides maybe Burstyn.<br/><br/>3.The message. I know I said this was a positive, but the message is a bit of a double edge sword. The film gets a bit to preachy with it's anti drug message, especially towards the end, and I think the message gets lost in all the melodrama that happens along the way.<br/><br/>4.The dialog. I can't remember a single line from this film. Usually I'm able to quote whole scenes from a movie after I finish it, but I just can't remember anything. The dialog isn't terrible but I don't think I would really call it realistic or pretentious. It's somewhere in that gray area. <br/><br/>""Requiem"" is a good film. But it isn't spectacular and it didn't change my life or make me depressed for several weeks like some people may have you believe, and it's certainly not the best film of 2000 (that would go to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.) Overall, if you're just looking for a movie with some powerful performances, a great score and some exquisite direction, you'll find it here. Just don't expect too much from the films plot."

They both go through all these twists and turns and their journey is one that anyone can connect to. We all have moments in our lives that we dream about happening and we'd do just about anything to make them happen. This is that story.

","Excessive drug use inherently destroys human bodies, destroys human lives, destroys human minds, and kills human dreams. We all know it. But people habitually do it anyway. What follows is a bleak downward spiral of decay and despair.<br/><br/>That's exactly what this film entails: four characters who suffer from their habitual addictions. By the end of the movie, it seeps nothing but bleakness and sorrow off the screen and really pounds it into the viewer. Combined with an extremely stylish visual style, the film has the power to grab you and stay with you long after the credits roll. It is that powerful (at least to me).<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple and is populated by acceptably well-developed characters (ones who seem fairly realistic though). What makes it stand out is the presentation; the photography is vivid and always interesting to look at. Editing techniques are just as varied and wild, especially in seeing rapid-fire successions of close-up shots. The use of sound accentuates the wild visuals very well. The music is freaking epic.<br/><br/>By the end of this film, I was thoroughly saddened. It is definitely a bleak and sobering look at addiction and obsession, and it has affirmed my resolution to never pollute myself with drugs or meds.

The climax of this movie is one that people will never forget, not only because it completely blows one's mind away, but because it is in fact impossible to do so. I strongly advise that anyone who watches this movie must be mature enough to do so, because the cruel reality of drugs and its effects on the lives of people in this film were something that even I ,an adult, was not fully prepared for. Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto, and Ellen Burstyn put on amazing performances that in my opinion are almost impossible for them to top.

"strangla35","10","2","4","30 March 2008"," Left at a loss for words...
","The very best movies, in my opinion, are the ones that stir up so many different facets of your thoughts and emotions in such a way that your verbal abilities are left at a loss. That was exactly how I felt after watching this movie, and writing this review the following day, it is somewhat how I feel still. I suppose that in order to give a truly comprehensive review, one that dissects and analyzes all of the wonderful aspects of this movie in the way it deserves, I would need to watch it one or even two more times(which I will probably end up doing anyway). Nevertheless, I will do the best I can.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream starts, appropriately, at a point in time where all the main characters are pursuing, in one fashion or another, the dreams that they each have for their lives. We are introduced to Sara Goldfarb, a widowed woman who lives alone in Brooklyn, and her son Harry. The movie opens with Harry stealing his mother's television amidst a fight between the two of them. Harry and his mother have their differences, but they clearly love each other dearly. We understand without having to be told that Harry and his friend Tyrone are heavily involved with drugs (heroin in particular), and that Harry's girlfriend Marion is no stranger to them, either. All four of them have goals and aspirations. Sara simply wants to lose weight and look good for an upcoming TV appearance, and as she impatiently waits and obsesses over it, it becomes the central focus and seemingly all she thinks about in her lonely life. <br/><br/>Harry and Marion want to open a business someday, and with the money they make from selling heroin, it seems to the viewer that it is well within the realm of possibility. They too, love each other and are supportive of each other's goals. <br/><br/>What I realize now is that one reason the movie was so tragic is because each person's dreams are mostly realistic, and could have been realized. Yet as each one of them progressively spirals downward and becomes more and more entangled by the web of their addictions and the damage it causes them, it becomes clear that these fleeting dreams that each of them have will never come to fruition, and yet, through it all, we are still hoping that in some way they will.<br/><br/>As each character is slowly destroyed by the choices they have made, they are degraded lower and lower until they are mere faint outlines of what they had once been, not even recognizable to those who loved them, or to the audience. They never stop desiring their dreams, but as the lives they knew come to a catastrophic halt, their dreams become mere wishes. <br/><br/>I could say without hesitation that this is probably the best movie I've seen in close to two years, maybe more. It is a movie that shuts you up while you watch it, and it has that effect on you long after it is finished. The camera work, musical score, and acting are all outstanding, which definitely helps the movie to deliver its message.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is a sad film, a thought-provoking film, but above all, it is one that deserves careful consideration. Because, it is not merely a film that stirs your emotions and makes you think; it is a film whose lessons can apply to all of us."
"jackharding89-1","10","2","4","6 March 2008"," Simply, one of those films that just refuse to exit the confines of your mind...
","Shocking. Is the first of many words that come to mind when reviewing Darren Aronofsky's controversial cult follow-up film to Pi. Others include; hypnotic, audacious, bleak, bold, rapid, and brilliant. Not only is Requiem for a Dream an enigmatically masterful showcase of contemporary film-making that blares cinematic success, innovation and awe with a heavy dose of drug fuelled melodrama to spare, but it's also the best anti-drugs film ever made. Yeah, yeah, stop scowling at the back, Trainspotters.<br/><br/>Staggering into our cinemas some 8 years ago; groggy, rancid, looking for a fix, Requiem left wave upon wave of horror-struck spectators stumped, wide-eyed while clutching certain bodily limbs in utter disbelief. It's an exploitation film of love, loss and lunacy. Of fame, fear and failure that precariously weaves high entertainment values and culturally imperative content into an indie film of immense aesthetic stature, intrigue and unique visual style.<br/><br/>By mixing an operatic yet ace underground rave soundtrack with a semi- surrealist edge, the film itself is by no means easy on the ears nor eyes. In fact, it's damn difficult to watch, even harder to swallow, but emerges a triumphant piece of modern cinema that remains etched in the minds of countless critics, fans and movie-goers afar. Users or non.<br/><br/>Based on the equally titled seventies drug novel by Hubert Selby Jr, Requiem is powered by a quartet of compulsive Coney Islanders' and their pipe-dreams, desperations, drug addictions and gradual descents into personal hells of psychiatric admission, prostitution, prison and amputation. In other words, it examines the human consumption of illegal drugs in a way never previously attempted on screen. Through an intense use of uncanny film-making techniques including split-screens, intercuts, wipe-cuts, hip-hop montages and over three times as many individual cuts as your average length feature, Requiem is truly as much a film on drugs as it is about them.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofksy deftly succeeds in crafting a severe and visceral sense of how drug use and abuse degrades not only the human body, but also the mind and soul. Through a dynamic combination of cutting-edge direction and heartfelt screen performances, we're forced to sympathise with all of the four hapless characters to the bitterest of bitter ends. Some viewers may even be able to empathise (well, to an extent). Predominantly, though, the admirable film-making tactics employed by Aronofsky are what give Requiem its kick. Sure, the content is horrendous, but the visuals demand that we endure every last frame and cinematic nuance to the absolute max'. Whether we want to or not.<br/><br/>Over the course of a somewhat undersized body of work consisting of a mere three features, Aronofsky has emerged as one contemporary cinema's finest makers of surrealist yet intellectual psychological dramas. Clearly drawn to self-isolated and David Lynch-like character driven plots, Aronofsky's Requiem stands firm as the pinnacle of his three- pronged feature portfolio. ""I wanted to make a freefall where you jump out of an airplane and about half way down you realise you forgot the parachute,"" recites the Brooklyn born director. ""The film is the moment you hit the ground"". And it is. Requiem for a Dream is visual, vicious and vital. As paranoid and intoxicating now as it was then. Quite simply, a innovative filmmaker's film whose complex theses ring so true in a global community ravaged and maimed by illegal drugs."

'Requiem' is thoroughly twisted, dark and scary as all hell! It is beautifully detailed and ingeniously shot, and slowly builds to a climax that eases you into a state of almost shock. As for the soundscore, think of the Chariots of Fire score tweaking on heroin! A year after the death of Kubrick, Aronofsky literally re-defines film as an art medium, yet 'Requiem' also consistently entertains, gradually pushing you to the edge of your seat as the imagery has a massive attack on your very senses... No joke, you may feel like pulling a Malcolm McDowell and fleeting from your bedroom via window! ~ Grab your bong and some bud, smokers, 'Requiem for a Dream' equals total buzz enhancement!!!"

","This is, perhaps, one of the most frightening movies I have ever seen; however, it is also really, really, amazingly good.<br/><br/>""Requiem for a Dream"" takes you through the lives of four people, all somehow addicted to drugs, and how these drugs break them down, slowly destroying the dreams they have.<br/><br/>I was told that ""Requiem for a Dream"" was a good movie, and many people who have similar movie tastes as me seemed to have enjoyed it, so a couple friends and I rented this movie and watched it.<br/><br/>As the movie ended we were all visibly shaken. It is horrific, and yet brilliant.In a way, my feelings about ""Requiem for a Dream"" are ironic; this movie scared me in a way unlike any other movie, and at first I was convinced it was an awful movie. However, by the next day I was convinced it was amazing.<br/><br/>So, while ""Requiem for a Dream"" is riveting and sad, it is also, quite strangely, beautiful. The atmosphere of the movie is perfect, eerie yet oddly compelling, the setting is perfect, the music is exceptional, and the characters do an extremely good job. It is a movie that is impossible to forget, yet easy to be unsure how to feel about. For people who want to see a challenging, thought-provoking movie, this is an excellent choice. I'm still not positive if I hated it, or loved it, but it is brilliant."

","Plain and simple, Requiem for a Dream is about Addiction. All of the main characters are addicts in some way, whether it be for drugs, money, or beauty.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is about the lives of four people who are connected whether be by blood, business relationship, or significant other. This film chronicles the events which occur in the main characters' lives when put in extreme situations, with life-altering consequences.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream was shot beautifully, from the amazing editing, and the realism of being 'high.' The characters of Requiem give highly believable performances which add to the authenticity of the film. This film takes you for a ride through the eyes of people with out-of the-ordinary lifestyles which we seem to overlook in everyday life, and frightens the viewer by taking reality to your front door. Occurring in middle America to seemingly ordinary people with regular problems, such as self-consciousness, or making ends meet. These are problems which occur to real people in the everyday world, and allow the viewers to relate to the characters.<br/><br/>Requiem left me disturbed, breathless, and in tears far after the credits rolled. From the amazing soundtrack, to the extraordinary acting, to the unique plot, there are no words I can use to describe what I felt during this film. I can tell you with confidence, this the most moving film I have ever seen, by far. Aronofsky truly outdoes himself. <br/><br/>10/10."

","Our dreams... Our lives... So connected... Requiem for a dream is something more than a movie. Maybe it's cliché but it's true. Darren has seen the problems we face everyday and transformed them in art. Art by the mean of opening peoples' minds. By the mean of opening new horizons and new points of views. Requiem is a movie so violent yet so familiar, so cynical yet so unreal. All of us had, have and will have dreams. From the very unimportant to the highest of a ""happy"" life. Dreams scattered from a society that discourages dreams. Dreams destroyed by human weakness and greed. This masterpiece of Mr. Aronofsky shows with the highest of brutality and reality that we would need. That our lives would need..."
"kentuckyfriedpanda42","10","2","4","22 August 2007"," Film Of The Decade!
","I don't say the above summary comment lightly. <br/><br/>""Requiem For A Dream"" is by far one of the most brutal, honest and incredibly uncompromising films about drugs and drug abuse ever made. <br/><br/>Films about drugs tend to either glamourise or preach. ""Requiem"" does neither; it manages to stay impartial. The only other films about drugs I've seen that have managed to do this are Gus Van Sant's wonderful ""Drugstore Cowboy"" (1989) and Danny Boyle's flat-out masterpiece ""Trainspotting"" (1995).<br/><br/>Essentially, ""Requiem"" follows four characters over the course of three seasons, starting at summer- Tyrone, Marion, Harry & Sara. What I admire about this film so much is that it has the guts to show how and why people are attracted to drugs. In Sara's case, to lose weight. In the case of the other three, because they like getting high and, in the case of Harry & Tyrone, making money. This is where the illusions to the concept of the so-called ""American Dream"" are clearest for me.<br/><br/>Aronofsky also shows what happens when everything spins out of control with drugs;the downward spiral. Using an arsenal of cinematic effects such as fast cuts,split screen and Snorricam (where a camera is attached to the actor), Aronofsky and his cinematographer Matthew Libartique really put the viewer in the headspace of a user. The film has a strong emotional resonance to it. You feel every misfortune and blow that these characters are hit with. The overall effect is simply devastating. This is filmaking from a very psychological pont of view and not the ""MTV"" filmaking style that it has been accused of.<br/><br/>The performances from all four of the lead actors- Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Waynes (in a rare dramatic role) and Ellen Burstyn -are outstanding and display a commitment to the material rarely seen on screen these days. <br/><br/>I must make mention of Ellen Burstyn as Sara. This is one of the most electrifying, heartbreaking performances ever committed to film. Her performance is truly the beating heart of this film. If, as a viewer, you're not moved of affected by Burstyn's phennomenal performance in ""Requiem"", you truly have a heart of stone. It shows why she is considered on of the greatest actresses working today.<br/><br/>Be warned. This film is not for the faint of heart. My wife said she felt physically ill after seeing it due to both subject matter and the way that it was presented. It is one of the few films in recent memory that has left me physically shaking after seeing it for the first time. I've known too many people who have had their lives affected by illegal drugs in some way or another as well as facing my own demons on that front many years ago. This film rings all too true.<br/><br/>It is a shame that the film is restricted to an over-18 year old audience in Australia. I would suggest that this be mandatory viewing for anyone around the age of fifteen or so. If it could stop one person from doing hard drugs, that the film has succeeded at what I feel it was trying to do.<br/><br/>This is an essential and truly timeless film.<br/><br/>Thank you, Darren Aronofsky. Thank you."
"Det_McNulty","5","2","4","2 June 2007"," Visually Arresting and Emotionally Devastating, ""Requiem for a Dream"" Strikes The Viewer With Audacious Pragmatism
","Director Darren Aronofsky's first feature-film, Pi was his critically-hailed and disturbingly warped vision of a troubled genius. Requiem for a Dream is just as troubling and carries even more critical acclaim, with its powerhouse image of spiralling drug abuse. Commonly referred to as a ""drug film"", Requiem for a Dream does not take the same path as other drug films, instead it is an entirely different way of looking at a harrowing situation. Adapted from Hubert Selby's novel, Requiem for a Dream focuses on four drug abusers, who are all in some related to one-an-other. The film illustrates their decaying lives rapidly turning into both mental and physical turmoil. While the film's main focus is the affect of drug addiction on a person's mind and body, it is also a film studying other forms of addiction and self-denial.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is a film which succeeds in being an excellent anti-drug feature, depicting the utmost devastation of drug abuse. Packed to the brim with some of the most innovative film-making in modern cinema it is impossible to deny the film's audacity and glaringly distinct nature. The kinetic, music-video style editing helps to convey a fractured existence, even though at times it is somewhat indulgently overused. The editing, one of the film's most infamous features is undeniably great and is clearly the film's primary technical achievement. Along with the images of the protagonist's dilated pupils the film feels entirely distorted, which is a magnificent method of creating the surreal environment which the film quite literally imposes upon its viewer. Even with its ""MTV editing"" the film still does not feel as though it is trivialising its content. The cinematography of Requiem for a Dream has an almost hypnotic feel behind its fierce, polarising images of self-destruction through deprivation, which I believe suits the mood of the piece. With the addition of its haunting score -which certainly feels relevant to the film's environment- Darren Aronofsky succeeds at crafting a film which goes against the generalised mould.<br/><br/>Arguably, the film could be interpreted as nihilistic, however I simply see Requiem for a Dream as attempt to express the lack of hope for the character's addictions, and their denial is evidently making their addictions more dangerous. What is special is how the viewer is able to pity and feel empathy for foolish degenerates who have cast themselves into squalor. The performances are painstakingly heartbreaking and horribly honest. Both actors and actresses display their talent in Requiem for a Dream, particularly that of Ellen Burstyn, who gives a nerve-shattering performance of a women who is both addicted to the ideas of fame (the false American dream, something which the film subtly attacks through the subtext of its script), popularity and weight-slimming drugs which give her a reason to ""get up in the morning"". Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and even Marlon Wayans (a surprising casting choice) all give the performances of their careers, which emphasise their talent to perform in extremely challenging, sadomasochistic roles.<br/><br/>It is a fact that the film takes too long to achieve saying what it wants to say, as the first 30 minutes pontificates, rather than giving the viewer anything to contemplate. Plus, there are some ludicrous moments, such as the mailing scene with the old ladies, which feels highly inappropriate. Nonetheless, along with Trainspotting (which is irrefutably superior) Requiem for a Dream is one of the best anti-drugs films to be released in modern cinema. It is amazing to think that the first ""drugs film"" was the exaggeratedly peculiar Reefer Madness from 1936, which is now considered hysterically stupid. How times have changed, along with cinema because it is quite apparent that Requiem for a Dream is, and never will be, a laughing matter."
"RaiderJack","9","2","4","21 May 2007"," Harrowing to say the Least - Remarkable Film!!!!!!!
","""Requiem for a Dream"" offers an absorbing, terrifying, yet fascinating look at the downward spiral associated with drug addiction. While the picture certainly doesn't tell us anything we don't know already, it is an unflinching look at the possible consequences of drug addiction. Amazingly enough, while you certainly don't condone even the reasons (excuses?) of each circumstance, you cannot help but feel empathy for the four lives depicted.<br/><br/>The standout performance, hands down, is Ellen Burstyn who was cheated out of an Oscar. Her performance is quite simply spellbinding. Even more so are the supporting players, most notably, Marlon Wayans. Because he has previously been cast in comedic roles, it is quite surprising how well he handled such a dramatically demanding role. He should invest in more dramatic parts as he proved to match his stellar cast members.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where you immediately need to take a walk and ""shake it off"" or merely have a nice long cigarette. This is an intense movie experience following the results of drug addiction on 4 hapless souls. Even more harrowing is that the movie offers not one shred of hope. In that instance alone, it should be applauded because it implies there is no hope as long as you do not possess enough responsibility to recognize dangerous behavior and do something about it.<br/><br/>I highly recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","Drugs kill and the death is not necessarily physical. They kill focus, they kill the wish to live, they kill the humanity of attitude but most damningly they kill hopes and dreams. Ironically enough, the lead characters of Requiem for a Dream are drawn to drugs seeking a short cut to a life which is beyond them but which they yearn for. Eventually this very short cut paves the way for their downfall.<br/><br/>An old lady's dream to be on TV, a young man's urge to be rich and happy, his friend and girl friend's need to tag along while aspiring to live a rich life - all these dreams die an untimely death. However, the audience is not subjected to any drama. The narrative is evenly paced, and realistic with some exceptional cinematography making the viewing experience a delight. The end is tragic, realistic, and painful but every bit true. Conforming reality to art is as much a challenge as conforming art to reality and on both counts this movie comes out on top.<br/><br/>A must watch movie for the young aspiring generation regardless of which air they breathe in."

This is a portrayal of what addiction (not just drug, but all addictions) can do to a person. It displays how desperate and hopeless addiction makes up. I love that it stayed gritty and unapologetic about the situations. There was no happy ending and I like that. There is no glorifying the addictions, it is real and haunting. The visuals were potent, the characters appearances deteriorated as the film progressed. The actors all did a wonderful job as they each found their characters falling deeper into the depths of insanity brought on by their own vices."

Aronofsky doesn't fear the ugly and cruel reality and through it he gives us a masterpiece. he makes us feel bad and think. think about his film and after a while think about what the film is trying to tell us. 4 people who end up really bad because of their addictions. 4 unforgettable performances from all the actors. Burstyn's monologues with her son and her lunatic acting at the end are going to stay in you for ever. they made me cry. but what makes this movie special is its ending. it's not a happy one. it shows the protagonists' decay. one ends up with a cut arm. one ends a lunatic. one ends in prison. only the girl is happy. but she's happy after she has participated in a private peep show with other addicted girls. with a huge bag full of her love. so this isn't really happy either, is it?... and there is more. Aronofsky did not stop at finding a touching and sad theme to make us cry. this movie is the experimentalism on its peak. he is using his techniques so beautifully like when he uses small cuts to show that the protagonists are taking drugs, because he doesn't want to stick to the process but to the conclusion. i absolutely loved it. it's my favorite film and I want to thank Aronofsky for his creative genius!"

It's also about love - unconditional and conditional but the best thing is it tells the tale very straightforwardly. There is no doubt at any time you have no idea what is happening and why the characters are in the positions they are in.<br/><br/>This film is not fort the kiddies, but I would not exclude certain teens from sitting down and watching the girt and horror of all of this. The cast of Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn are top rate as well as the supporting casts around them that add more than ambiance but a real dose of human emotion, sexuality and reality.<br/><br/>There are parts in this film that will be hard to watch, hard to believe and hard to forget, but that's what makes this film one of the best and should take it's rightful place among the top 50 films of all time."

","To just call it a drug movie is totally missing the point of the movie, in my opinion. A requiem is a song that is played in mourning for the dead. Therefore the title literally means a song mourning the death of a dream. Listen to the soundtrack and you will hear what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I always thought it was interesting that Jennifer Connelly's character Marion Silver and Marlon Wayans' character Tyrone C Love are very much like opposites of each other. Marion comes from a rich family who gave her money but not love, while Ty is from a poor family that gave him love but had no money. Marion is very fragile because no one ever cared for her and she lacks the self confidence necessary to succeed. Inversely, Ty's mother didn't care if he was rich or successful but he always felt that it was the only way he'd be worthy of her love.<br/><br/>They're all chasing a dream, and they all want someone to love them, but it's strange because they already have that.

The cinematography was of a style that I hadn't witnessed before, but it was definitely great.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is a simple yet powerful combination of techno beats with the Kronos quartet, and it's simply a great soundtrack. The songs are the types of songs that really bond to the emotion of the overall movie and continue to astound you if you listen to the soundtrack much later.<br/><br/>Simply stated though, the movie was overall a great and painfully truthful movie. What begins as a harmonic situation and relationship among the characters turns to a symphony of discord that's filled with grief. And the way that it plays out is heartbreaking, for each characters' situation.<br/><br/>Anyway, all in all I loved this movie but it definitely made me feel depressed.

The implications in my consciousness are massive... The movie shows the reality in the most genuine way, and the consequences of social deviations are dramatic. It's unbelievable! Both the creativity of the author of the book and of the producer. The movie involves psychology, social psychology, psychopathology, picture art and great music.

This doesn't mean that Requiem for a Dream is hard to understand nor that it contains any big, hard to predict, surprises. Nonetheless, Requiem for a dream is not just another movie about drugs, in my opinion the drug use depicted in this film is just a framework that helps to the exposure of the characters and to intensify their problems and emotions.

"killerking_dave","10","2","4","18 December 2006"," Highly entertaining. Brutal. Beautifully made. Educational. In my mind, the perfect film...
","I rate most films I see based upon the acting, the direction, the score, the sound, the amount I think about the film after I've seen it, how well I remember it after-wards and finally, the how much the movie effects me. I believe that a great film satisfies all of those. I have seen about three films in my life (Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, Donnie Darko and Lantana) which satisfy all of these categories, and I was really beginning to wonder whether or not I could come across one which I thought was perfect...<br/><br/>I watched Requiem For A Dream about a week ago when I had chickenpox, and just as I am when I watch any film of its caliber, I was cautious. But it did something to me which no other film ever has and probably ever will. It left me so amazed, shocked, terrified, saddened and intrigued that I proceeded to watch it another three times after-wards before I couldn't watch it anymore...<br/><br/>It has a brilliant ensemble cast, probably the best I've ever seen in a film. Ellen Burnstyn had me crying quite hard by the end as I watched her truly sweet and charming character of Sara Goldfarb slowly deteriorate because of an addiction. I cannot believe she was denied an Oscar for this role, because it's among the best on-screen performances I've ever seen.<br/><br/>It would be a crime in my mind to not commend Jared Leto on his performance. The job he does in the film seems to be quite underrated, but his role as Harry Goldfarb came out as my favourite character. His acting is superb in all senses, and its clear to me that his research into the role paid off. Big time. Because he's put me off drugs of all forms with his depiction of an addict.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connely could've very easily made her character of Marion Silver a melodramatic, difficult to watch hunk of s***, but thank the good lord she didn't. It takes a great actor to walk the fine line between real and fake, and she does it so wonderfully well. She may have been playing a supporting role, but it never seemed that way to me. Her performance will stay with me for a long time to come.<br/><br/>Before this film, I didn't know who Marlon Wayans was or what his filmography was like. But I finished this film amazed at the performance he gave, and the fact that he managed to make me remember his character of Tyrone C Love (who I believe I could've easily forgotten if it had've been played wrong). Amazingly well done.<br/><br/>The directing is nothing short of amazing. Darren Aronofsky creates an excellent mood, making great use of cameras mounted to the actors, hallucination sequences, split camera shots and shows he his artistic sense in a brilliant montage at the end of the film, which was one of my highlights, and the score is beautiful, and makes the mood even more hostile at times.<br/><br/>All up, Requiem For A Dream is not for the squeamish or faint of heart, but it's a film that everyone should see at some time in their lives. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that you may never see another film that leaves you more scared, shocked and effected mentally than Requiem For A Dream.<br/><br/>For that reason I give it 10/10. I loved it...<br/><br/>Sincerely, Dave Ward."

","Well an 8+ rating on the IMDb site does raise the expectations for any movie. Add to that some good recommendations by friends and I was really wanting to the see the movie. 'Hard hitting' is what I will like to describe this movie as. A work of a genius.<br/><br/>The movie is about drugs and their effects on young lives. I haven't seen a better movie made on the harmful effects of the drugs. It hits you hard, in your face. Brilliant performances by Ellen Burtyn, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly. Ellen is simply superb in the portrayal of a single, lonely aging mother of Jared. She even won an Oscar nomination for that.<br/><br/>In the end, its a sad movie. But that is what a movie on drug addiction should be. Sad, Lonely and Frightening. It serves the purpose. I would highly recommend it to all. Especially to those who think that having drugs is fun. Watch this movie and you will leave drugs for good."

''Requiem for a dream'' is very different.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn are a great actress, you believe her character and feel her dream, her solitude, her pain. I only saw once it to her in a movie: '' The exorcist''. Jennifer Connelly was another actress who i saw just in one movie: Labyrinth.

"seen-deadly-sins","10","2","4","10 October 2006"," Heartwrenching
","I had unfortunately already spoiled this film for myself by going to Wikipedia but decided to be a good sport and watch the entire movie as well. The actors give superb performances. Ellen Burstyn is tragic and realistic (that Oscar was stolen from her). Jared Leto as the gaunt Harry Goldfarb is amazing. To those that never pictured him as a good lead actor, he will awe you to the point of tears. Which is exactly what happened to me. The impact of the film hit me on the head like a board. This film is not for those looking for light-hearted entertainment or a little action flick. This explores the intense reality of drug abuse and addiction and the consequences it brings about to the four protagonists. A difficult film to watch but a must-see for everyone."
"ace_m","10","2","4","16 August 2006"," Powerfully exacting, emotionally wrenching
","I first saw this film when I was about 14. It really blew me away. It is superbly edited, with Aranofsky transforming otherwise mundane daily rituals like cleaning or moving into intriguing expositions. Every character is completely, utterly believable and each performance is quite nuanced, to varying degrees. If for nothing else, don't just see this movie to be convinced of what you already - drugs, especially hard drugs like heroin and speed, are terribly dangerous, but for Aranofsky's daring, original, provocative style, the well-paced plot, and the excellent performances by the ensemble (especially Ellen Burstyn in a truly frightening, unique performance)."

","This movie is #4 on my top 10 list, and although you most likely will not smile once during the entire film, it is still phenomenal. A realistic look at what drug addiction can do to a person. I am a big fan of movies and i recommended this to a few friends, most of them said it ruined their day, but if a film makes you feel that bad it has to be good. The film is so realistic, once it sucks you in you almost feel as the characters in the movie do and thats what a good movie should do. This movie should be shown to teens when they get in high school or maybe even 8th grade. Instead of d.a.r.e class or teachers and parents preaching to their students to not take drugs they should just show this film, if i would have seen this i probably would have never even touched pot, the movie frightened me and i was 23 when i first saw it.

","This is the best anti-drug movie I have ever seen. Although the messages are fairly simple, they are presented with competence by Aronofsky. The imagery is horrific and disturbing but so powerful and real. The four actors (Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans) are all outstanding. The score is brooding and haunting, as is the direction.<br/><br/>On Coney Island, there are four ambitious people. Sarah Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). They all have hopes and dreams, but they are soon shattered as their addictions to different drugs spiral out of control.<br/><br/>This is probably one of the best casts I have ever seen, they all are brilliant and have great chemistry. Burstyn was robbed. What the Academy did was an outrage. Her performance was perfect and haunting, if ever there was an injustice with the Academy, it was her losing. Leto, Connelly and Wayans are all fantastic as well. The music is haunting and adds to the effect of the final scene.<br/><br/>What we are presented with is raw, disturbing, haunting and real. The images of what these drugs can do are horrible. The last few minutes of the movie are extremely sad and ever so powerful. This is taken the place as one of my favourite movies.<br/><br/>5/5."

Having been recommended this film, I checked a few reviews here on IMDb, all of which claimed that the viewer would be in tears by the end. I was very doubtful; I've never cried for a movie before that I can remember, and I didn't expect to be moved that much by this film. Nevertheless, I sat down to watch it.<br/><br/>By the end, I was sobbing so hard I couldn't believe it - for around ten minutes after the film ended. The haunting score and miserable outcome would not leave my head for a moment the rest of the day, and lingered in my mind for the next few days at least. This film is brutal, tragic and relentless, and you will not forget it remotely soon after viewing it. I certainly won't, and I don't think I'll ever be able to watch it again - not within the next few years, at least.<br/><br/>Everybody should and must see this film, which simply cannot be described accurately in text.

I don't know how many times I've seen this movie. it has been times that I watch this movie everyday for a week. first of all the story is so chilling that you may never want to try hard drugs ever again after seeing what these people went through and what they had to do to get the drugs and just to live. even though its a fiction, but it can easily be reality. even if u don't like the story and think its to depressing and hard to watch, still the art and talent that went in to this movie is beyond anything that I've seen before ( and I see A LOOOOOOOOTTTTTT of movies, and I study film). the editing is amazing, they show everything without showing anything, I know its hard to imagine but u just have to watch it. the music is perfect and is the best original score for a movie so far. maybe the most surprising thing about this movie is Marlon Wayans, who knew he could be so serious and good. to me this movie is just perfect and I don't understand why it got only one Oscar nomination without any wins. 10 out of 10."

It's a good movie about addictions! A movie about the addictions that change people's lives, destroy a family, destroy relationships, destroy a person. The drug scenes were incredible. The way that pupils go bigger each time they take drugs. I think its a good way to show people that the addictions can ruin a person's life & a good way to show how dangerous an addiction can be!the title is related with the movie in a perfect way because in the movie all of them have their own dreams that ended in a bad way. That is why the movie is called 'requiem for a dream'. There is a sadness in them because they know they do something for their dreams but the thing they don't know is if they are doing the right thing.the songs in the movie is in a great harmony with the movie.The theme song has depressing parts,the parts that are more lively than the other parts just like the movie.I think it is a masterpiece about addictions.<br/><br/>>DENIZ<"

","The reviews of this movie on this site are great, and I don't want to belabor the point that this was an astoundingly wonderful and incredibly disturbing and upsetting film. I have to say that this movie upset me and affected me more than any other I've seen. Just to think about the fact that people really do this to themselves really gives me the creeps. The film was beautifully done and I especially loved the split screen scenes. This film is unique in every way. In the most beautiful scene in the movie, our two lovers are in bed together talking, and the camera shows in such a magnificent way their love for each other, by panning over their bodies and showing them tenderly touching each other. This is when you really learn about their relationship and their love for each other, and it just kills you to see the heroin addiction rip them apart in so many ways as individuals and as a couple. Actually, just about every aspect of this movie kills you. It will leave you speechless, breathless, and really make you think about your life in a different way."
"lastcallforalcohol","10","2","4","15 February 2006"," Speechless
","I almost never give a movie a 10 out of 10. If any movie I have ever seen deserves it, it is Requiem for a Dream. I had heard all the hype about this movie prior to seeing it. About its intensity, about the infamous final scene.... everything. Consequently, I expected to be let down. This was ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE. Requiem's ferocity is not due to explicit drug use, but to its intense depiction of the effects. The film follows the dark journey of a lonely widow named Sarah Goldfarb (Burstyn), her son Harry (Leto)and his two friends (Connelly and Wayans) as they struggle with drug addiction/ achieving their respective dream in a dismal Coney Island backdrop. The dismal tone of the opening scene with Harry and his mother set the stage for a film that, if anything, shows the devastating and indomitable control drugs can have on a person's life. Whether they are together or separate, Aronofsky intertwines the experiences of each character so brilliantly and artistically that I was almost unconscious in terms of the transition between scenes; they seem to bleed into each other. The camera work and ultra-fast montages don't come off as abrasive or excessive.... they left me breathless.<br/><br/>Each character in the story has a dream. They look to drugs to help themselves get there, and in doing so lose sight of the fact that everything they truly desire is right there in front of them. There are several moments to the film where I found myself frustrated with the characters. Why can't they open their eyes? Drugs. That's why, and like the characters in the movie, Aronofsky's brilliant direction leaves us feeling helpless.<br/><br/>The characters are enthralling, despite screen time being divided up. Harry (Leto) is the central character because of his direct relationship to each protagonist, and the plays the role unbelievably, seemingly with ease. Ellen Burstyn shines as Sarah, taking on a challenging role at her age that certainly doesn't pull any punches. Connelly is convincing, seductive and gorgeous, so appealing at times that it's almost understandable why Harry seems to think hes unworthy of her. Wayans' role is the most minor of the four, yet he exudes the desperation of addiction as well as anyone else.<br/><br/>When I see a movie, I often ask myself ""Could anyone have played these roles better than the casted actors?"" To me, this movie answers that question with an emphatic ""NO."" These actors absolutely nailed these parts to the floor. They convey their pain with such conviction that it's difficult not to squirm.<br/><br/>When the movie ended, I turned to my friends who had already seen it. All I could do was shrug my shoulders and shake my head. LITERALLY, I swear. Never had a movie left me so literally speechless. This movie will stay with you, haunt you, lift you up, drag you down, and hit you where it hurts. Its a film about false promises, the pursuit of a dream, and the crash landing that drugs bring to such a journey. Go out. Rent it. Right now. It will change you, I promise."
"bulleetz37235","10","2","4","14 February 2006"," Stunning.
","This is one of the most astonishing films I have ever seen. For starters, what a title. Requiem for a Dream, isn't that just the best sounding film title ever? I'll say it again - Requiem for a Dream, with a title like that you know it'll be good. And it is.<br/><br/>Starting in Summer with Harry Goldfarb (A never better Jared Leto) stealing his mother's TV set to satisfy his heroine addiction it sets the scene for four people inextricably tied together in similar events. <br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly plays Marion Silver. Harry's girlfriend who has been brought up in a rich family but yearns to be free, and so flees with Harry and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) as they try to make the big score and makes some money for a great future.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn is brilliant a Sarah Goldfarb (Harry's mother). A lonely, old widow fixated upon appearing on television and on a diet so she can fit into her favourite red dress. To satisfy her desire she goes on diet pills, but as she faces more loneliness and fear of dying a nobody, she decides to take her diet into the insane and takes more pills than she is supposed to.<br/><br/>Elsewhere Harry and Ty's drug deal goes sour with the street drying up with no means to buy and no means to get rich. They fall apart, and the midpoint of this film is the key part.<br/><br/>With summer drawing to a close things start to turn bad noticeably, particularly in the scene in which Harry visits his mother. They sit and at first they have general chit-chat about marriage and happiness, but then as Harry realises his mother is on pills, and is grinding her teeth and being quite jittery through their effect, he says: <br/><br/>""Hey ma. You on uppers?"" The camera swings inside, from what was once on the light side of the characters face, is now on the dark as the camera (ingeniously by the DA, and quite unnioticably - you must listen to the commentary) switches to show the darkness on the other side of Harry's face... It's quite a simple yet rather good technique, and the motive for the camera swing is quite elementary but the way it is pulled off is something else. Your average film watcher wouldn't have seen the relevance in such a movement, but now some of the motives are understood, thanks to the excellent commentary on the disc, it brings the whole rating of the film soaring. It really is that good, it is made with flair and imagination up there with the greatest of all film-makers, it is superb and original. It also sets the stage for the whole theme of the film, the notion of each person moving forwards as each one tries to hunt for their vision of happiness, but don't realise that by holding onto it so hard they lose their sense of reality and danger follows, and as summer fades into memory, the problems start to appear, and they begin to FALL. How far from their dreams they become is almost unbearable. But this fall makes for totally mesmerising and fantastic viewing pleasure. It is excellent. And the whole rise and fall is marked upon with fantastic skill. The contrasting, before and after is sublime.<br/><br/>Set to the tone of the Kronos String Quartet and some excellent pieces by Clint Mansell this film is backed up by powerful direction which incorporates a souring mood that gets all the more sombre scene by scene. <br/><br/>I can honestly say you won't find much better in the year 2000 and it is in my opinion the best film of the last two decades. Darren Aronofsky shows deep imagination in adapting Hubert Selby Jr's novel, but he makes the film his own, and it is a case of film being better than book. It is a truly harrowing accompaniment of fantastic acting, mind bending direction, shocking imagery, totally great dialogue and moods that have not been more powerfully portrayed in any other film ever. It is a true definer of the genre Drama, and all films of similar character can be judged alongside it. I suggest, beg and implore you to watch it and I tell you with total confidence that this is an absolutely, 100% bona fide marvel of cinematic perfection.<br/><br/>Maybe I went too far, but I feel it. It's totally brilliant, on a great disc to match. If it was free on the NHS then it would be the best ever. :)"

Brilliant characterisation and a very believable plot makes this film enjoyable - it's all about drugs and addiction; how it can corrode your soul and mind. The story is based in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, New York and we follow a year in the life of a trio of twenty-somethings and the main character, Harry's mother. The story reveals how people can get sucked so easily into a dark and complicated vortex, where there seems to be no escape. Few films show the truth about what can happen with drugs and don't just glamoriser the whole scene, this is an exception, well worth the watch - wish that I'd seen this as a teenager!"

","I still remember the first time I saw ""Requiem for a Dream"" at Michigan State several years ago. I think this film will always stick with me for one reason or another. The film is hardly pleasant, but in many ways it is about as perfect a modern film as I have seen. Yes, this is high praise, but it is well deserved. The acting especially by Ellen Burstyn as the ever hopeful Sara Goldfarb is amazing in its seductiveness and completeness. Burstyn was Sara Goldfarb, a lonely woman longing for past memories and future moments. The actors suck us right into the story and combined with Aronofsky's direction, Clint Mansell's haunting use of the Kronos Quartet, Jay Rabinowitz's editing and Matthew Libatique's camera-work the results are spell-bounding. The story about 4 people and their battles with addiction is heartbreaking, but it is the way it achieves this effect that sticks in my mind. The last 15 minutes are an exercise in editing, cinematography and craftsmanship by the cast and crew. This is an unforgettable film about addiction and longing that made me think for days after I saw it. A 10 out of 10."

","...you MUST see this film.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has much going for him. He has recently completed and released the critically acclaimed graphic novel entitled ""The Fountain"", with a movie of the same name, starring Hugh Jackman, soon following, easily making it one of 2006's most anticipated films. His directorial debut was an acclaimed indie film called ""Pi"". The movie, shot for only $60,000 was a critical success and led to the next step; the masterpiece, Requiem for a Dream. Based on the book of the same name, this movie is a very grim, mature, and dark tale of the lives of those addicted to drugs. The addiction becomes more and more severe as the movie progresses, causing the downfall of each of the characters. They each become desperate and begin to not only become mentally unstable, but also financially, and securely unstable. There is no happy ending here, just a stone cold look at the reality of what one's life might succumb to if one were to become addicted. Requiem for a Dream was hard hitting for me; it changed my life. This movie is one of the few movies that I am able to look beyond the surface and really be affected by. It is not meant for pure entertainment, it is an artistic and original vision of addiction brought to us by the genius Darren Aronofsky. Although this movie is not for everyone, I would still absolutely recommend it to everyone. Not everyone will enjoy it, but as I said, this isn't a movie for pure entertainment. It's the harshness of reality."

Just like the many drugs used in this movie REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is addictive. But for some strange reason this movie relates a lot to so many of my friends, constantly in the drug scene. So I guess if you don't know anything about drugs to begin with, you will get a massive shock. Because this is the utter truth. But it makes me really sad because, well I wont give away any plot lines but it just tears you inside to see these people wrecking themselves and how horrible and scary their lives become.

"george.schmidt","Null","2","4","23 July 2004"," Bravura film-making - genius all around ; superbly acted, adapted and conceived on all counts - one of 2000's best films; in a word: harrowing
","REQUIEM FOR A DREAM (2000) **** Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, Christopher McDonald, Louise Lasser, Keith David, Sean Gullette, Dylan Baker. Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky's sophomore film endeavor and adaptation of Hubert Selby, Jr.'s cult novel (co-scripting the screenplay with the novelist) is in a word: harrowing. Brilliantly realized with state-of-the art film editing (kudos to cutter Jay Rabinowitz) and photographed with acrobatic elan and verve by cinematographer Matthew Libatique. Drug addiction is the central focused theme between junkie Leto (in a surprising display of low-key sublime perfection), his aspiring fashion designer girlfriend Connelly (ditto for the sexy actress) and his partner in crime Wayans (in his first dramatic turn) who conspire to score some pure heroin to make their dreams come true. But it is hands-down Burstyn's film in a virtuoso Oscar caliber performance (arguably the career defining one) as Leto's doomed, widowed mother in her trappings of her Coney Island (a fine metaphor of what was once a wonderland now a weed choked wasteland) apartment whose ritualistic watching of a frenzied TV infomercial has visions in her head of being on the show leading her to take prescription uppers to lose weight with only her sanity clearly dwindling away. Her genuinely moving and convincing flesh and rotting bones performance eats at the heart and is truly wrenching to watch her downward spiral into utter madness. Depressing and at times shocking to watch the horrors unfold until its chilling, nightmarish climax the film succeeds in displaying just how unerotic or glamorous the subject matter has been perceived and skillfully ricocheting its fast-cut of fixing the drugs makes it even more resonant. One for the film vaults: Leto's sudden discovery and confrontation with Burstyn that her drug intake is on a path to self-destruction is a thing of brutal beauty in her long-standing close up confessing to her son just how meaningless her life is; priceless. One of the millennium's best films and the year's bar none."
"atwana2000","Null","2","4","26 April 2004"," An unforgettable film
","One of my friends recommended this film to me in July.  I rented it and watched it with him and a friend from out-of-town.  After we watched it, we sat in my room in silence for at least an hour.  This film is the most dramatic, terrifying film I have ever seen in my life and I love this film. Since then, I've recommended it to many people and have only watched it again once.  I mean, this movie has a story that could possibly happen (a few things added in for drama though but I won't mention anything in particular).  It's amazing what kind of hell four individuals go through just to live their dreams, only to pay for them later on.  Everybody loses.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing.  Ellen Burstyn stole the show, with her obsession with being on television.  I feel she terrible for her in the film, since I feel that she was the one who was hurt the most.  Jennifer Connelly did an awesome job, showing what people are willing to do to feed their addictions. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans did an excellent job as well, but not as good as the two leading female characters (in my opinion at least).<br/><br/>The camera angles were awesome.  Some of the ones in this film I had never seen before, where the actor/actress was following the camera, while walking forward (kinda have to see it to get my point).  It helped pull me into the film, relating me to all the troubles the characters were going through.<br/><br/>The music is probably better than the acting.  The tracks range from a soft orchestra to techno to creepy, loud, and sudden noise.  The music helps the viewer delve deeper into this dark universe.  The music flows well, going from soft music during tender/non-active moments to hightened, intense music during intense sceens (especially near the end of the film).  The soundtrack was so good I went out and bought it.<br/><br/>Although I don't plan to use drugs, this film single-handedly shows why you shouldn't.  This story of addiction is not to be ignored.  I recommend this film to anyone and everyone.  Addict or not, watch this film!  It might not leave you silent for an hour, but it is a good, artistic film that demands watching.  I personally give this film a 10/10!"

They are annoying low life drug dealers who are getting high on their own supply.  They are sloppy, sick individuals who seriously need and N/A meeting.  These are the type of people that I make a point of avoiding IRL. I tend to avoid drugs, the drug scene and the parasites that it attracts.<br/><br/>I do like some drug movies like The Basket Ball Diaries, Blow, and Wonderland.

","I went to this movie hearing plenty of buzz about how graphic the content was. Over the course of the movie you see just how Aronofsky wants to send his message to the audience. The characters start off with somewhat mild addictions and then next thing you know the four main characters are living in hell. I couldn't believe how low they all fell. This movie may be the greatest anti-drug message of all time. I dare anybody to watch this and to not be touched and frightened by these characters. Before the movie started I noticed the audience was quite loud and garrulous, but as it ended and the credits rolled the whole place was stone cold silent. It was amazing.<br/><br/>As a whole I felt the movie was excellent. The visuals were well done and the editing was outstanding. The actors really put themselves into their roles. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly had very good chemistry, while Marlon Wayans showed he is a talented actor and not just a talented comic. Ellen Burstyn. Wow! She was amazing. I can't believe an older woman would allow herself to be filmed like that. She has some serious guts. Hands down the best female performance I've watched this year, not even close. I was totally amazed by her.<br/><br/>All in all, I would say Requiem For a Dream is a great movie. It had a profound impact on me and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I watched it on opening night. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. This is a movie everyone should see, but unfortunately not enough will."

"daniellawson-14-787057","9","0","0","27 June 2020"," A haunting film that will stay with me for life
","POSITIVES:<br/><br/>1) The four central performances are fantastic; especially Ellen Burstyn. She's superb and completely steals the film. Her one-take monologue to Jared Leto about being old and having nobody that needs her is one of the best scenes of acting I have ever seen
2) The direction and cinematography are so unique. The film is shot in an almost pseudo found footage style that makes it feel completely gritty and realistic. This realism increases the power of the disturbing story
3) The idea to have Ellen Burstyn's character addicted to diet pills was a stroke of genius. It shows that drug addiction isn't all about illegal drugs, it can in fact be about drugs that you can get with ease from a doctor. In fact, the ease in which Burstyn gets these drugs is demonstrated brilliantly by how her doctor never even looks away from his clipboard before prescribing them to her
4) The score is completely epic and iconic
5) None of the characters get happy endings and that is exactly how a film of this nature should end. It demonstrates the havoc that drug addiction causes to people's lives and doesn't glamourise it at all, as a lot of films unfortunately do<br/><br/>NEGATIVES:<br/><br/>1) There are far too many mini montages of heroin taking and pupils dilating. I know you could argue that they are present to show the regularity in which they are taking heroin, but by the end it came across as just beating you too hard over the head with the message that they are drug addicts. Also, heroin should shrink your pupils, not enlarge them
2) The hallucination Ellen Burstyn has where her tv self and the tv host come into her apartment, which is then transformed into a TV set, was a bit too over the top and silly for me"

","A true cinematic tragedy. Trust me when I say to all you lovers of cinema, that this is not an easy viewing. The only redemption to this film are Ellen Burstyn's splendid solo scenes. Not only does the acting quality of the movie vastly improve - do not forget that this is Ellen Burstyn - ,but Aronofski changes the visual aesthetic to something that is reminiscent of Fincher's and Lynch's, which without saying is much more appealing then Aronofski's own style that he pursues throughout most of the movie. The rest of the movie is filled with bland and ineffective camera angles, and above all else terrible acting from Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans.<br/><br/>Another bone I have to pick is the repetition of the same montage, it makes what the character's are doing less symbolic, you see it so many times it becomes ordinary. The film is also unrealistic in terms of it's action and dialogue. The soundtrack is great, unfortunately it didn't belong in this movie. The scenes simply did not - for the most part - merit the songs that they got.<br/><br/>The last 30 minutes were the most enjoyable parts of the film.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you are looking for a great performance by Ellen Burstyn I without a doubt would recommend this movie. However, if you are looking for a good film about characters with drug addictions, I suggest you go elsewhere.<br/><br/>May I recommend Drugstore Cowboy, Trainspotting, Enter the Void or Less Than Zero."

","Alcoholics or drug addicts feel wrong when they don't feel right. Eventually they feel very wrong, and must feel right, and at that point their lives spiral down into some sort of final chapter--recovery if they're lucky, hopelessness and death if they're not.<br/><br/>What is fascinating about ""Requiem for a Dream,"" the new film by Darren Aronofsky, is how well he portrays the mental states of his addicts. When they use, a window opens briefly into a world where everything is right. Then it slides shut, and life reduces itself to a search for the money and drugs to open it again. Nothing else is remotely as interesting.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is the director who made the hallucinatory ""Pi"" (1998), about a paranoid genius who seems on the brink of discovering the key to--well, God, or the stock market, or whatever else his tormentors imagine. That movie, made on a tiny budget, was astonishing in the way it suggested its hero's shifting prism of reality. Now, with greater resources, Aronofsky brings a new urgency to the drug movie by trying to reproduce, through his subjective camera, how his characters feel, or want to feel, or fear to feel.<br/><br/>As the movie opens, a housewife is chaining her television to the radiator. It's no use. Her son frees it, and wheels it down the street to a pawn shop. This is a regular routine, we gather; anything in his mother's house is a potential source of funds for drug money. The son's girlfriend and best friend are both addicted, too. So is the mother: to television and sugar. We recognize the actors, but barely. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is fat and blowzy in her sloppy house dresses; if you've just seen her in the revived ""Exorcist,"" her appearance will come as a shock. Her son Harry (Jared Leto) is gaunt and haunted; so is his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). His pal Tyrone is played by Marlon Wayans, who has lost all the energy and cockiness of his comic persona and is simply trying to survive in a reasonable manner. Tyrone suspects, correctly, that he's in trouble but Harry is in more.<br/><br/>Sara's life passes in modest retirement. She joins the other old ladies out front of their building, where they line up their lawn chairs in the sun. She's addicted to a game show whose host (Christopher McDonald) leads the audience in chanting ""We got a winner!"" She's a sweet, naive women who gets a junk phone call that misleads her into thinking she may be a potential guest on the show. She obsesses about wearing her favorite red dress, and gets diet pills from the doctor to help her lose weight.<br/><br/>She does lose weight, and also her mind. ""The pills don't work so good anymore,"" she complains to the druggist, and then starts doubling up her usage. Her doctor isn't even paying attention when she complains dubiously about hallucinations (the refrigerator has started to threaten her). Meanwhile, Harry talks to Marion about the one big score that would ""get us back on track."" Tyrone can see that Harry is losing it, but Marion, under Harry's spell, has sex with a shrink (Sean Gullette, star of ""Pi"") and is eventually selling herself for stag party gang-gropes.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is fascinated by the way in which the camera can be used to suggest how his characters see things. I've just finished a shot-by-shot analysis of Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" at the Virginia Film Festival; he does the same thing, showing us some things and denying us others so that we are first plunged into a subjective state and then yanked back to objectivity with a splash of cold reality.<br/><br/>Here Aronofsky uses extreme closeups to show drugs acting on his characters. First we see the pills, or the fix, filling the screen, because that's all the characters can think about. Then the injection, swallowing or sniffing--because that blots out the world. Then the pupils of their eyes dilate. All done with acute exaggeration of sounds.<br/><br/>These sequences are done in fast-motion, to show how quickly the drugs take effect--and how disappointingly soon they fade. The in-between times edge toward desperation. Aronofsky cuts between the mother, a prisoner of her apartment and diet pills, and the other three. Early in the film, in a technique I haven't seen before, he uses a split screen in which the space on both sides is available to the other (Sara and Harry each have half the screen, but their movements enter into each other's halves). This is an effective way of showing them alone together. Later, in a virtuoso closing sequence, he cuts between all four major characters as they careen toward their final destinations.<br/><br/>Burstyn isn't afraid to play Sara Goldfarb flat-out as a collapsing ruin (Aronofsky has mercy on her by giving her some fantasy scenes where she appears on TV and we see that she is actually still a great-looking woman). Connolly, who is so much a sex symbol that she, too, could have disgraced herself in ""Charlie's Angels,"" has consistently gone for risky projects and this may be her riskiest; the movie is inspired by Hubert Selby, Jr.'s lacerating novel of the same name, and in her own way Connolly goes as faras Jennifer Jason Leigh did in ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"" (1989), an equally courageous, quite different, film based on another Selby novel. Leto and Wayans have a road trip together, heading for Florida, that is like a bleaker echo of Joe Buck and Ratso Rizzo's Florida odyssey in ""Midnight Cowboy."" Leto's suppurating arm, punished by too many needles, is like a motif for his life.<br/><br/>The movie was given the worthless NC-17 rating by the MPAA; rejecting it, Artisan Entertainment is asking theaters to enforce an adults-only policy. I can think of an exception: Anyone under 17 who is thinking of experimenting with drugs might want to see this movie, which plays like a travelogue of hell."
"b-96875","10","0","0","9 June 2020"," Requiem for a Dream
","I didn't enjoy watching this film. Darren Aronofskys direction is so horrific and tragic, and Ellen Burstyn's portrayal of Sara in particular is equally so. The film chronicles the lives of four addicts with shared experiences of addiction and RFAD captures that in its most brutal form, resulting in a film so inherently unwatchable it carries the most emotional resonance if only watched once.<br/><br/>However, my previous comments regarding the horrific nature of the direction and acting performances are not criticisms at all. The direction is purposefully designed to be horrific and unsettling; these moments are captured with such brutal honesty and Sara's accelerated descent into insanity in particular is so uncomfortable to watch that this film can be considered to be one of the true masterpieces of the 21st Century, and it can also be considered to be Arenofsky's magnum opus. I cannot criticise this film in any way whatsoever, and I wouldn't even try to look for criticisms."

","Although I may have recency bias, I think that this film is masterful. From the great cinematography to the now iconic score, there's a lot to appreciate.<br/><br/>The strongest emotion I had during the film wasn't fear, or joy, or even shock. It was sadness. And I think that was the goal of the film, as the film is purely about 4 characters self-destructing at the hands of their addictions. It pains me to see an elderly woman grasp onto the hope that she can have a chance in the spotlight, eventually loosing all sense of her surroundings. It's incredibly cathartic to witness a girl sell her body for a score, even though she has the financial backing of her family. It's upsetting to watch the strong relationships and dreams of a couple crumble over the films duration.<br/><br/>I've never had any addictions towards drugs in my life, and I never want to.

","This is one of the most brutal and shocking movies I've ever seen since it describes drug's impacts in an exorbitant way. When assuming heroine or any drug the first time, I'm sure that everyone thinks that it would be the first and last time, but this movie opens our eyes about the consequences that drug dependence can have. In particular, each character's conclusion represents a possible consequence of drug dependence. It may look exaggerate, but it is not.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is one of the directors I appreciate more. He has the capacity to establish an authentic relationship between characters and spectators. Everyone who watches this film suffers with Harry and Marion, even if we are not drug dependent. Everything is so dramatic, but I want to focus on my favourite character from the movie.<br/><br/>Sara's scenes are really breath-taking. Her character is not only about drug dependence. It is about loneliness, an empty life without purpose. What is she living for? We can't expect from a genuine old woman like her to become just an annoying blabbermouth who spends her days talking carelessly with neighbours. She needs to escape from her life, she needs a refuge: the TV is the only weapon she can use to fight her emptiness. The red-dress dream is just a necessity for her to have something to think about in her life. But because of her innocence, she becomes soon a media terrorism victim. I know this is not the point of the movie, but sometimes people feel alone, insecure, underappreciated, and the outside world (here the TV) responds just by offering you the easiest way to escape, and the easiest way is tremendously dangerous. Sara's decline really touched and shocked me, more than other characters', and this is due to Ellen Burstyn's outstanding performance. Also Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly's interpretations are remarkable.<br/><br/>On balance, I think that the strength of this movie is the empathy which is amplified by a brilliant direction and a sublime soundtrack. When I hear that music, I still get goose bumps after many years."

Brief Review -<br/><br/>An outrageous drug-mania that will shake your mind, brain and body from top to bottom. A Cinematic Masterpiece ! Requiem For A Dream is such an ordinary story as it depicts four characters affected by drug addiction and how it alters their physical and emotional state but have you ever came across the term called 'Director's Cinema'? It simply means, you give any kind of ordinary story to the director and he will turn it into an Extraordinary film. Well, THIS IS Director's Cinema. An ordinary story of drug addicts is turned into a disturbing Cinematic Masterpiece by director's brilliant mind and skills. The film shook me from inside as well as from outside just by the proper use of display and sound. The footage is drawn as such in the film with an outrageous use of background score that the cumulative result lefts you with Goosebumps. Especially in the last 40 minutes this film is like a Film-making course to everyone who wants to learn about quality cinema. Darren Aronofsky gets a salute from me for his Directorial brilliance. He presented this story with realistic gimmicks, brutality, abusive content and filth so that it shows you real damnifications of drugs. He made Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans go wild, crazy, nasty and abusive but it all worked and thier performances looked so freaking real. Clint Mansell deserves a special mention for his stunning score because without him this experience wouldn't have been the same. I can assure you, once you watch this film then you will never ever dare to touch or even think about drugs. This is an brutal assassination of drug freaks and a lesson to all those who either suffer from it or thier relatives who just endure them. Watch it to learn Cinematic genius and how to make a solid film from a decent content. I am still shivering while writing this review, that's says all i guess.

","The film is depressing , but it has a great meaning. The movie gives you a dose of hope, not a lot of movies did it bsfore . The movie deserves to be watched every time. The movie wants to tell you a great meaning, but in a harsh style. Everyone has a dream you have to make an effort to achieve it, but if you don't your dream will die. This fatigue literally means effort, hardship, and sweat. You have to be at the end to achieve your dream. This is the meaning of the movie. It warns you with the utmost directness, do not underestimate the stage of your trouble or wash your brain that you are passing this stage with minimal losses. All this will be understood if you see the movie through the characters and their dreams. The way of directing in this movie is fantastic , which you will not see in many movies, for example a film shot is that two characters are together at the same time and place, but the screen is divided, and this has a very great meaning, and that you are separated from your dream. Music is more famous than the movie itself, so I will not say anything about it. The performance of the actors: What was required of them is not very high performance, but they were required to perform a variety, beginning with a dream with joy, the period of drug use, loss and remorse. All of them performed well except for Sara Goldfarb . She performed above the splendid between the mother's tenderness in the beginning and then being happy in her dream, and in the end the case of madness that reached her at the end, and to any actress that could have come out of the tragic performance of the comic comedy. Simple hair and will separate the two performances, but she stood with all greatness on the edge of tragic performance. If the movie was bad in the beginning and the end is beautiful and great, the whole movie remains great. Imagine the whole movie is great and the end is greater than what you imagine. This is what Darren Aronofsky did when the events reached the end. All this in order to receive all suffering on your chest and feel it.
A rare, great, fantastic movie!"

"zeekwunlau","8","0","0","27 April 2020"," Personal perception
","To the extreme, it is the most direct feeling after watching the movie. The twigs and branches of loneliness and desire closely intertwined the characters in the play. In addition to eating, her mother only had to chat on TV to comfort her. The sudden notice became a ray of light in her darkness, which pushed her deep into her heart and revealed her morbidity. After taking drugs, the mother wore a fisheye lens in a red dress and lipstick, shaking the magic, like a poppy flower swaying before the audience years ago. The real magic may be the refrigerator that was always thought to be blown, and it will only be destroyed by a sound.
Throwing away the coat of funeral, the film gave me a new ""experience"" of drugs. I do n't think depression or nausea are enough to accurately explain the ""chic"" of the film. It is more like a natural disgust and rejection after investigation. A series of shots such as drug powder, injection, pupil dilation, etc., the corresponding blood veins, manic anxiety and even unscrupulous means allow viewers to experience the dizziness, despair and hysteria directly through rapid editing and soundtrack. Behind the unusual editing and dazed soundtrack seems to be the manipulator of the puppet, making you struggle and nervous in front of the screen. Finally, there is a kind of ""see through"" and resolute resistance. Such a rich level of editing and equipment compulsively makes this ""anti-drug movie"" artistically unparalleled!
After watching the movie, I have been immersed in the depression of the characters in the play. They all have good wishes, the mother's arms, their own clothing store, and their family lovers, but they all embarked on the path of destruction. Is it the necessity of drugs? I do n't think so. I think the director wanted to insinuate a whole morbidity and frustration. After drug use, they started to have a bit of ""enjoyment"" and ""satisfaction"", which was beyond ordinary feelings, because maybe they had Happy satiety and sense of attainment. Mental barrenness and lesions are silent but pervasive in every cubic air of breath. As the medical staff at the end feeds the mother but discusses the winning or losing of gambling, perhaps the overall morbidity is more terrifying than the actual flu and the machine is lethal."

","""Requiem for a Dream"" looks into the lives of four people who have entered into a world which they have become attached to but ultimately pay the price as once they've walked in it is next to impossible to escape. Jared Leto stars as Harry Goldfarb who along with his girlfriend Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) go into the drug-selling gig. At first it was intended to make a quick buck so that they could open up a new business because like life itself you have to spend money in order to make money. While this is happening, Harry's mother Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) becomes addicted to television and sweets, she becomes fixated on losing weight so that she can get into her little red dress so that she could become famous and become a national star on television. This leads her to an unhealthy addiction to diet pills. The four central characters end up meeting their fate that comes to the conclusion that their lives will never be the same, their reputations are shot and once they get hooked on drugs, their addictions would eventually end up taking over their lives that they'll never fully return.<br/><br/>Under the direction from Darren Aronofsky, and based on the 1978 novel from Hubert Selby Jr, ""Requiem for a Dream"" was met with extreme controversy as many critics have claimed that the movie was glorifying drug addicts by using various close-up shots as our principal four characters give a grim, in-your-face depiction of becoming a drug addict and making each character spiral to a boulevard of no return as each scene is panned out repeatedly. These people are way out on a limb, the fact is just the opposite. In fact this movie is a two hour PSA about the dangers and effects that happens when you take drugs and how it affects the lives of other people who's loved ones are also under the influence. The details are severely graphic, but very effective use of imagery to tell its story and the acting was overall really powerful with Burstyn getting an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role.<br/><br/>When I first came into watching this movie, I was in a naturally good mood and was curious to see if the viewers were right that this film is powerful but severely intense. Well it turns out that were right, in fact that were so right, my mood changed for the worst to the point that I needed to watch 20 cat videos on You Tube to get me back in a better mood.<br/><br/>Even though the ""drugs are bad"" message is shoved down our throats, Aronofsky succeeds in not making his moral message preachy. Instead he lets the performers do all the actions to get his point across. Aronofsky gives us the truthful but unpleasant task of taking us on the ride where you are living their lives and the ride you're on does not have a light at the end of the tunnel.<br/><br/>Though the performances stand out really well in this movie, the performer that stands above everyone else is Ellen Burstyn. Her story of her fixation of getting on television and losing weight to fir into her red dress can be something we could all relate to. It's relatable, sad, tragic, but most of all, it's powerful albeit dark. It's a shame that the Oscars gave the Leading Actress win to Julia Roberts for ""Erin Brockovich"".<br/><br/>Though there are few and far between flaws about ""Requiem for a Dream"", that doesn't mean that this movie is perfect. Though it shows its purpose as to why drugs are bad, it would have been nice to see at least one of the principal four to pull through this ordeal. But to have them all suffer an unhappy ending is pushing the envelope way too far. Although it was great to see Marlon Wayans push his boundaries beyond that of the silly cartoon like comedy movies he's been in to attempt to go beyond typecast, he is still badly miscast because Tyrone is just a one-dimensional character who's a mere sidekick to his friend Harry. Of the leading four performers, his story is the weakest.<br/><br/>The editing is quite innovative with the film using up to 2000 edits which is in compared to most films that use 600-700 edits. After the success of his debut film ""Pi"", Aronofsky came up new, creative visuals that was also dded into the story as well. Like his predecessor Stanley Kubrick, Aronofsky is quite the perfectionist. So much so that he brought the right to a Japanese animated film ""Perfect Blue"" as a way to visualize the scene where Marion is screaming in the bathtub."

","This is a harrowing watch in places. But it is also well constructed. Camera angles are distorted, as are the images, to create a sense of the disorientation that comes with drug use. Edits are used to show the repetition of the drug taking itself, as well as the various arrests. And the various stories, none of which end well, are convincingly told, so that the downward spiral they all take - some due to choices to get high, some due to bad choices over dieting pills, are all convincing, if neccesarily going to the worst extreme. The soundtrack also adds to the disjointed ness and disorientation of the film. This is not for the faint hearted, but it is well acted, directed and written, to add up to an excellent piece of cinema."

What the characters do in order to get their drugs just makes you sick, sad and disturbed all at the same time.<br/><br/>The movie is all about feelings and emotions of the viewer. With sound effects, music and surreal settings you are put in a disturbing mood from the start which also changes and escalates throughout the film - Really Brilliant way of getting the audience not just watch, but also feel the agony of the main characters. I also liked how the drug addiction starts with some ""good times"" where they enjoyed getting high, ending up with desperation and having to do literally anything to get the necessary drugs just to not shake from abstinence.<br/><br/>This is the first performance I've seen with Marlon Wayans where he's not in a comedy and man is he good! Most actors a great, especially Ellen Burstyn.<br/><br/>This is my first view now in 2019 and I do feel that there are some flaws. Jared Leto is good but some of his lines felt forced like the repeated phrases ""Ma!"" and ""...for Chrissakes!"" which is too bad. The style of the movie reminded me of the TV show ""24"" which is also an early 2000's work which for me feels a bit out dated.

","Directed by Darren Aronofsky. Starring Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, Christopher McDonald, Louise Lasser, Keith David, Mark Margolis, Marcia Jean Kurtz, Sean Gullette.<br/><br/>Unflinching portrait of addiction focusing on four desperate characters: a widow hooked on amphetamine diet pills (Burstyn), her son (Leto), plus his friend (Wayans) and girlfriend (Connelly), the latter three all heroin junkies. It doesn't take long for director Aronofsky's arresting filmmaking techniques to either electrify or repulse (depending on the viewer's tolerance for his method), using hypnotically rapid-fire editing, symbolic split screens, musical leitmotifs (composed by Clint Mansell), filters, film speed variations, and more to both simulate narrative and character urgency as well as mimic (but absolutely not glorify) the intense kick and all-too-quick dissolution of a drug high. There's no judgment or piety here, just an intense, skin-crawling examination of dependency, of degradation, of lives shattering; an inevitable result, but still painful to witness. No slackers in this cast, but Burstyn is especially good, delusion segueing into hallucination, all recorded in her physical expressions and cracking voice; hers is the most affecting tragic arc since she was the closest to innocence before the talons sunk in. A bit too lurid and cynical at times, with only a few veritable angles on theme/plot to set it apart from a dozen so-called ""drug movies"" before it, but it's the way it's told that sticks with the viewer and makes it a harrowingly unforgettable experience. Originally slapped with an NC-17 rating and then released unrated into theaters; avoid the compromised R-rated home video copies.<br/><br/>91/100"

","""Requiem for a Dream"" is one of the most immersive and shocking films of all time and in the end the movie turns into a feeling, an emotion- of unescapable sadness. One can say that it works as a complete drugs-do-bad movie, but the film is far more than that. It is a sad and tragic story of lost dreams and self destruction.<br/><br/>At first, the way this is filmed adds so much to the experience. We get sthe same close-ups and fast transitions (it's like Edgar Wright was in the edit room) everytime the characters consume their ""thing"".We also get some split-screne sequences and uring the climax the film enters deeper and deeper into the human mind and a couple of sureal sequences are shown.<br/><br/>
All these make for an immersive and ""ugly"" experience that is ment to be desturbing. The only stilistic choice that I found too much was the some split screen moments whixh i think do not add a lot to the experience.<br/><br/>But afar from the tremendous filming endavour...this film tells so much about the human condition and the black holes that a peron can fall into. In the film, all of the four ""vicitms"" want sometihng, have a strong desire and they all fall in the same pitfall in order to complete their want.
A lonely widow who wants to be ""someone"" and gai happyness by being loved and famous<br/><br/>Her son who wants to find a money, make some money and have a girl
His girl who loves modeling and clothes and wants to make her own shop
And the man's firend who believes that by being succesful at a field he will make his mother happy and proud.<br/><br/>All these dreams are shattered by their addiction to drugs. They lose their mind, their sanity, their love, their life.And it all eels so tragic and nightmarish.<br/><br/>I mostly loved the more sutle scenes , like the conversation between mom and son about their situation. But the sureal sequences during the climax where pretty affecting too.<br/><br/>Also, I really do not thing that this film is only about drugs, but cna be seen as a showcase of the consequences of our obsesions and addictions in general. And even the film is centered around drugs, we notice other addictions and obsesions too. Being mad for sex, for money, fame, recognition, love and acceptance, mad for food or for a calm life without worries are all addictions presented in the film and are all dangerous. The film shows that the only one that can destroy us really is our own self and our inability to control our desires which gradually become more and more monsterous.<br/><br/>The characters are nicely written, they feel like real people,tohugh i think the young femal character was kind of underdeveloped and lacked a second layer. The performances are all exceptional, somobody give the actress playing theold womn another slice of grapefruit because she truly deserves it!The score is haunting and I liked that the movie used it corretly.<br/><br/>You have to see this film and i might wreck you o pieces or make you rethink your small, unimportant existance but in the end eveything will be ok.<br/><br/>Just kidding. No one can save youo of your doom except of you."

The downfall can't be stopped anymore. In the end the protagonists are just helpless and so is the audience. It's a knightmare that became a movie and has the same effect too.

","Many of the techniques used in this movie (a lot!) would now be very familiar to watchers of music videos and horror, whilst others would be similarly familiar from other sources. However given this movie is now over 17 years old one has to wonder at the genius who created it. The techniques never throw the overall continuity or conformity to style out of whack, and strangely, despite the radical nature of the techniques, the movie never really descends into farce or comedy, attaining a satirical line above that perhaps, especially because we sympathise with the lead characters all of whom are basically good, but more than that, telling its story with heart, sincerity and determination. It's almost operatic toward the superb end. The important message comes across thanks to the casting characters and their very honest performances, from normal to disintegration. It's an eccentric movie, a joy to be swept away in. It's also seriously disturbing by its end and not suitable for children of any age. It's a timely swipe at the times it represents as well, the dangers of suburban isolation and loneliness in New York in 2000, and has a profound cultural importance. For movie buffs this is a must see."

Respectable people like doctors, shrinks, cops and execs are shown to be highly manipulative, exerting their power and getting away with it. And our characters feel the constant need to escape this gritty world of power abuse through their choice of drug (heroin or television), and sadly, become victims of their choices.<br/><br/>Barring the mother, I felt the movie lacked character sketches.

","A common question that is brought up in film discussions is, ""What is the saddest movie you've ever seen?"" A common movie that is said is Up, Toy Story 3, Marley and Me, and Schindler's List. I have to agree that all of these movies are sad, but not nearly as sad as the movie I will be reviewing today, Requiem For A Dream. I, personally, think this movie is the saddest movie I have ever seen. The only time I saw it was months ago, but it is still fresh on my mind. I get the chills everytime I think about it, heck, I'm getting chills thinking about it right now.<br/><br/>I don't want to get into much spoilers, but Requiem For A Dream is about drug addiction. A few people get addicted to various drugs, and it ruins pretty much the rest of their lives. That's all I'm gonna go into in terms of spoilers. The presentation of this movie is in your face, at times it's very fast, and at other times, it wants to make you remember very disturbing scenes. This movie is pretty disturbing as well because drugs are represented as the worst thing that can ever happen to you. The first act wasn't too dramatic, it essentially builds the characters so that you know what they're going through before drug addiction. Then the drugs come in and the movie gets more and more miserable before the third act. The third act is so intense and sad at the same time, it gives me chills typing about it.<br/><br/>Jared Leto is one of our protagonists and he is the first character that is introduced in this movie, and his acting is outstanding. Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are also in this movie, and their acting is also really good. Especially Ellen Burstyn's acting, she blew it out of the park and also earned an oscar nomination for her performance. The movie has a low budget esque feel, and it utilizes it so well because the presentation feels dirty and raw, just like many of the things happening in the movie.<br/><br/>The famous Lux Aeterna song is in this movie, and I freaking loved it. This movie has impacted me in so many ways, it's probably one of my favorite movies that I will never watch again. It was done so well and I think Darren Aronofsky blew it out of the park with this movie, and I'd give Requiem For A Dream a 10/10."

","Requiem for a Dream follows the impact that drugs have on a group of four people living in Brooklyn. The characters, Mother, Sara Goldfarb(Ellen Burstyn), Son, Harry Goldfarb(Jared Leto), Girlfriend Marion Silver(Jennifer Connelly) and best friend Tyrone Love( Marlon Wayans). 
Sara feels trapped in her apartment with no real identity. Her son Harry takes advantage of her for his drug use, along with the help of his friend Tyrone. The girlfriend Marion of Harry, is a spoiled and detactched rich girl with a seemingly good heart. <br/><br/>The theme of this film is one of despair and lost identity. Sara has the opportunity to be on a game show she watches daily. As she tries on her favorite dress from Harrys graduation she sees that she cannot fit. The memories of the dress remind her of a happier (and thinner) time. Her neighbors encourage the use of diet pills and thus starts her decent into mental instability, weight loss and paranoia of her refrigerator. The director makes use of loud metal grating sounds as the refrigerator taunts her. <br/><br/>Harry and Marion are polar opposites in class and choice of drug. She is affluent and uses prescriptions to party, where as Harry is chasing low cost heroin to support his high. The lost identity of Marion as a poor little rich girl in Harry's world further highlights this despair as she attempts to fit in his world. Including varying degrees of prostitution and self degredation. <br/><br/>Tyrone and Harry plan to buy drugs, cut them and sell so they can make it out of the despair their constant search for drugs costs them. A deal gone wrong takes the money they have been saving and forces Marion to see that her escapisim with drugs requires actual action on her part. <br/><br/>The lighting used for interior scenes in Sara and Marion's apratments are low and stark. The colors of grey, black and white do not change even when the drugs are in their system. The jump cut of getting the drugs ready, the dialated eyes and heavy breathing share the viewer as a participant in the rush. <br/><br/>The despair and lost identity in this film are mirrored by Valley of the Dolls. Another film where despair is supplemented by drugs and the lost identity they try to replace. The mania, outbursts and destruction have the same feel to the viewer. <br/><br/>Requeim for a Dream is a more than appropriate title for this movie. The despair and chase of the illusive dream life are haunting to watch, yet riveting to the emotions the film brings to life"

","Darren Aronofsky is a problematic director for me to categorize. I can honestly say that I've liked all the films I've seen from him, but none of them are something I'd casually recommend to a friend. Some are even such that I doubt I'll ever rewatch them.<br/><br/>Partly that's Aronofsky's scale. His films range from a deeply symbolic examination of time, love and pattern, where a man flies in space on a literal flying tree, to a pseudo-realistic portrayal of ballerina's struggles with her life. With Requiem for a Dream landing somewhere between these two extremes.<br/><br/>The easiest theme to find in this film is that of addiction. The film follows four Coney Island people, three of them heavily addicted to heroin. But it's the fourth, the character of Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), that provides the echo wall for this obvious addiction. The word addict immediately brings to mind mind-altering substances, but is someone so bound by media that she cannot live without it truly any different. And if she isn't, what does that say about the rest of us. We all have our vices, our favourite things. And those addictions can run deep, to places we don't care talk about.<br/><br/>It's an unpleasant film to watch. Not in a way such as Trainspotting, which is mainly just filthy and unclean, though this film has heavy shades of that as well, but because Aronofsky focuses on the weirdness side of drug use. How taking heroin or other pills shatters the dream-reality barrier and shatters it in such a way that's scary beyond belief. It's dream, but in a way that lurks just behind the corner of your eyes, waiting.<br/><br/>The best films are those that make you think. The ones you keep returning to in your thoughts. And this clearly belongs in that elusive category."

","Requiem for a Dream (2000), directed by Darren Aronofsky, kind of makes you wonder about the filmmaker's past, and just what spurred him to make a movie as dark and depressing as this. It practically screams ""Don't do drugs, kids!"" but it does so in the artsy kind of way that keeps you enthralled and never even approaches the area of preachy. In fact, it just makes you downright scared of addiction.<br/><br/>Ranging from three of the seasons, summer to fall to ultimately winter, the film represents how the characters' lives get darker and colder with each season that progresses. Obviously, summer being the brightest and warmest, and winter being the darkest and coldest.<br/><br/>Addiction is a real thing, and throughout the film, you'll see through Aronofsky's eyes the kind of effects it can (will) have on you. Throw in a beautiful, melancholy score, and you get a touching motion picture that you'll never forget. I can actually hear the Lux Aeterna melody as I write this, but that's probably because I'm listening to it right now.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream hosts four main characters, Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb, a more serious than normal Marlon Wayans as Tyrone, Jennifer Connelly as Marion, and Jared Leto as Harry Goldfarb, who has ties with each of the other three characters (mother, friend, girlfriend). Each of them is or will become addicted. And each of them meets different, yet terrible, fates in the end.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn brings the character of Sara Goldfarb to life so well that it makes me never want to grow old. Starting out as a sweet, (if a little kooky) lonely old woman, her quest to become beautiful again for her game show appearance that she can't wait for causes her to become addicted to diet pills, and everything in her life spirals out of control from there.<br/><br/>This film is not for everyone. If you'd rather watch a feel-good movie where the protagonist(s) prevail and everybody is happy in the end, you should probably stay away from Requiem for a Dream. Everyone else – come into this movie with an open mind and just enjoy the ride (if that's the correct phrase) that Aronofsky is about to take you through."

","Thsi movie is about a mother and a son who always use stimulant drugs. It is decided that the mother appears on a TV show, so she decides to lose her weight. When she hears about the medicine losing weight easily, she starts to drink it, but it is a drug. The son always use drugs, and he tries to sell the drug with his friend. This movie shows a lot of realistic scenes. For example, the son amputates his left arm, and blood splatters on his face. Besides, the mother is given electric shocks to treat the addiction to drugs. I think these scenes are effective to show drugs are dangerous and we should not use it, but I cannot forget them because of the shock. I was also impressed with the scene that she has a hallucination. As hallucination escalates, her mental goes collapsed. Her confusion and horror expressions convey the danger and risk of drugs. I do not like this movie because I cannot feel well when I watched it. However, it is important to know drugs make our life break. This movie is a good example to tell it.

","Darren Aronofsky is anything but conventional, and this is another in that line. There have been various excellent movies on the inner workings of drug addiction (e.g. Trainspotting), but there are countless stories to tell and this is another that ranks highly. Centres round a circle of drug addicts who are caught up in a downward spiral, with the mother of one of them finding herself unintentionally mirroring their errors.<br/><br/>There are many facets to recommend this movie to any adult. The story is well written, the direction is sharp and intriguing, and the acting is peerless. One of the most surprising parts is that by Ellen Burstyn in a role that just blows everything out of the water in this film as the mother who gets caught up in the drug addiction of her beloved son. She was just wonderful and heart breaking to watch. The rest are also excellent, and Jared Leto is unlikely to ever better this.<br/><br/>The film direction is very sharp, with cuts/redirections very quickly to provide an unsettling feel. It works and unsettles you.<br/><br/>We are watching the rapid inevitable decline of this circle of people, and it's uncomfortable to watch.

","ared Leto, gives an excellent, solid performance as Harry Goldfarb, a man living an inch from his life, always in search of a fix. In an emotional powerhouse of a performance, he proves to audiences that he can shine through in a major role as opposed to previous smaller roles in Fight Club and American Psycho. However, it appears to be a Hollywood in-joke of sorts in that it seems he has a penchant for mutilation or at least the roles he seems to take on seem to have for him. In Fight Club, he had his face rearranged and in American Psycho, his head cut off. In Requiem however, it is the mutilation of his life, his whole character, that takes centerstage, ending in a satisfying climax of gargantuan proportions in which he gives the audience more than their money's worth in his power-packed performance.<br/><br/>However, the real star of the film lies in the talent of Ellen Burstyn. Audiences will wonder at her appearance at the beginning of the film, not really knowing if it is, in fact, her. Her performance as a television, sugar and eventually, diet pill-addicted mother of Harry shows that she's still got it after all these years. If you want to make a comparison of her thespian skills throughout the years, watch the revived version of The Exorcist. She can only get better. She takes on the role of Sarah Goldfarb with gusto, never backing down for a second. Totally throwing herself into the role, you tend to forget how she really looks like, given only fleeting moments in the film which suggest her real appearance. I have to say, she's got guts. How many female actresses her age would dare to have a camera strapped to her person(as Aronofsky so creatively did), an inch away from her face with a wide angle lens? She definitely deserves her Oscar nomination, if not, the Oscar itself, for her tour-de-force performance.<br/><br/>The other characters themselves hold their own with the two above-mentioned powerhouses. Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans both realistically portray their respective roles as Marion Silver, Harry's girlfriend and rebellious suburbanite chick, who degenerates to prostitution for her fix and Tyrone C. Love, Harry's best friend and fellow pusher. Here, Wayans shows that he can lose his comic edge if needed, to portray a boy trapped in a man's body, just yearning for his mother's approval but seeking it instead, in drugs. Connelly as well, who has been taking on smaller roles and projects over the last few years, is finally given enough room to play with her character and gives a winning performance in Requiem."

Besides physical ecstasy it bring on, one more important function of drugs for kids is the psychological sedate, which in most of the cases is an effective way of curing emotional isolation or domestic abuses,etc. As we can see from this movie, three characters have their owe problem, Sara, who dreamt of a glamour performance on a TV show, is under a motivation of self-esteem achievement in order to grip her memorable charm. But her son Harry with a more complicated intention of his drug addiction and dealing, on one hand, he tries to make money to prove his value to his mom, one the other hand, it is a only way he can though to support his girl friend's garment business. His girlfriend Marion is a real tragedy, in the beginning, she totally screw her life after initial attempt of helping her boy friend. Harry's friend Tyrone, as director repeated mentioned in the screen, he simply want to be a big man as his mother hoped. <br/><br/>Therefore, we can see that they were all motived by very positive intention, but end in bleakness.

The casting was quite good - from the main characters, in my view Harry and Sara, to the secondary ones (Marion, Tyron), all play with a pretty good dynamic making the movie and storyline believable. I found the idea of making a parallel between street drugs and controlled drugs a very smart base for this story - In one hand, Harry goes down a trail of addiction, business from drug then go onto a swirl down to hell ... while Sara on weight loss pills become addicted and end up hallucinating and being hospitalized. Both and a the characters are in search for happiness, success, recognition ... they never get. This is a MUST see."

","One of the more terrifying things about Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream is how numerous extras appear to just 'exist' amidst proceedings and merely get on with their own lives, fleetingly mentioning the odd happening from recent times, as they intermingle with the film's core characters whom are witnessing their own existences fall apart at their very seams. Watching these people going about their business on screen reminds us of the same way those figures, or people, in our nightmares mingle around in the background as we dream on; we're aware of them, much like the central characters are aware of them here, but we cannot really make them out nor indeed really work out what it is they're saying or plotting. Often, we feel at the mercy of them; we pray that they're not speaking or plotting against us. Such are the situations the numerous leads, in this rather eye-opening urban drama that does carry an hallucinogenic, nightmarish quality, eventually come to bury themselves in; a sad, sorrowful film depicting the gradual falling away from reality of a number of people because of drugs or drug addiction in varying forms as well as falsified dream chasing.<br/><br/>What is most admirable about the film is the manner in which how, the now somewhat renowned American director, Darren Aronofsky manages to take an idea one might surmise with a one-sentence pitch and manages to spin a tale out of it all that's cinematic and with a distinct, applied aesthetic which engages without ever glorifying and never at once feels like a lecture. The film revolves around a handful of disparate New York-based characters, their tales running parallel in a multi stranded fashion with their coming into contact with drugs, or the drug trade in some form, making up the meat of film's core. It is, much like 1996's Trainspotting, a smart and cunning drama applying a post-modern spin to what might constitute as what the British used to refer to as 'kitchen sink drama' in its depiction of predominantly young, attractive people destroying their lives through the lust for a drug fix. In this sense, Aronofsky has made a 'whizz-bang' film guaranteed to keep those of a younger disposition in their adult lives occupied whilst tell a tale systematically demonising the activity within, and yet retaining enough intensity for it to appeal to those well beyond the dangers of slipping into drug addiction.<br/><br/>Jared Leto plays Harry Goldfarb, a young Brooklyn based man with a penchant for class-A drugs, which his girlfriend Marion (Connelly) additionally shares, and constantly on the look for ways into the narcotics trade operating out of this shady corner of The Big Apple. Living not so far away from Harry is his elderly mother, Sara (Burstyn); a woman living in a decrepit apartment with a flurry of other elderly women, of whom spend most of their time sitting outside in the summer's heat on the pavement, and whose lone item in her flat that's worth any money at all is her television. The things in life to which she holds dear lie in the form of one of her son's school photos, depicting the kid at better and more affluent times, and that television through which she gradually observes herself becoming the newfound star of a kind of reality TV show following a phone call from the network inviting her in.<br/><br/>The film dances between the two strands with the sort of consummate ease that would have you think it were were a piece composed by a filmmaker seemingly nearing the height of his game; Marlon Wayans' local lowlife Tyrone Love filtering into proceedings on account of being good friends with Harry and later heading his own story of grief when things reach a hilt. Aronofsky seeps a sense of repugnance through proceedings; a 'sickness in the stomach' feeling; an aesthetic feeding off what can only really be likened to that of the drug-induced, nauseating aesthetic certain American films from the turn of the 1970s, in the form of Easy Rider or Midnight Cowboy, carried with them. There is a gross repetition to some events that unfold which, rather than frustrate the audience, has feel the clammy, grotesque sensation rife throughout. Sara's gradual obsession with weight loss pills and the necessity to essentially look as thin, and therefore ill-mindedly beautiful, as possible dominates her story; the film, as it depicts her seemingly withering away to a desired size, rears the other way in its depiction of her surroundings by gradually bulking out her apartment into this medieval chamber of filth and mould – a locale in which she looses her mind; hallucinates inanimate objects coming alive and suffers premature proleptic shifts to stardom plus the conclusion of this celebrificated process she desires.<br/><br/>Harry is a good looking boy with a good looking girlfriend; both of whom admit they love one another very much and we sense in an alternate world, they'd be able to settle down away form all this. Their brief, gentle early embrace is a hundred-times more erotic than the depths toward which young Marion will have to later plunge for her drug 'fix'. Then there is Tyrone's path formulating out of the events, a strand more akin to being a gangster film or drugs trade thriller which might have made a fascinating short all by itself. The film, in spite of being driven by a very simple message or core thesis, is constructed around the incorrect use of lens' deliberately done so to induce sickness; excruciatingly low camera angles and cinematography encompassing good uses of extreme close ups of objects that aren't nasty to look at, but evoke reactions of disgust anyway. The film is a hardened and substantial peek into the crevasses of drug addiction merging uneasily with mental illness; a peek that is studiously executed in what is a highly effective drama."

","Requiem for a Dream-**1/2-See it- Directed by: Darren Aronofsky, written by: Darren Aronofsky and Hubert Selby, Jr., Starring: Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, Christopher McDonald, Louise Latcher, Keith David, Sean Gullette.<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky teams up with mainstream actors for his newest feature based off the disturbing and jarring novel by Hubert Selby, Jr. The plot covers the story of a New York drug addict (Leto) who finds his world collapsing due to his overuse and perpetual need of drug influence. As he falls into his self-inflicted hell, his elderly mother (very well played by Burstyn) who is obsessed with a television show becomes hooked on prescription diet pills. Connelly plays Leto's girlfriend who gets caught up in the drama of drugs and Wayans plays his dealer who goes into a hell himself.<br/><br/>Hallucinatory storytelling with lots of clever dream sequences throughout given the extra boost by a lot of firm acting. Burstyn is incredible in her role and Leto fairs pretty well too. Wayans is not too shabby himself in an uncharacteristic performance in a film that is a change for the comic. Aronofsky is a clever storyteller with firm stylistics and a good eye for hellish fetishes and images. His portrait of contemporary drug addicts is pretty much well-done for all intents and purposes.<br/><br/>The question is where did Aronofsky fail? His biggest problem is his insistent use of quick cuts. That is what separates this drug film from Cronenberg's Naked Lunch or Boyle's Trainspotting. He is intent to make this more like an MTV made for television film than anything. If it was not for his talent as a director, it probably would be one of those. This is an addict film made for pop houses, not art houses. That is the weakness of the film as a work of art.<br/><br/>If we define films based off clever style, Aronofsky would have made a masterpiece. To the misfortune of the young director, that is not what makes a great film great. The stylistics are the best the crew has to offer, but the actors certainly give it their all. Each actor is in great form and inhabit their roles well. His pop style may be thin as air, but Aronofsky's use of actors is as prevailing as ever. Each actor is used incredibly well and Burstyn is so frighteningly realistic that I have a new image of this old woman. We can use style and we can use great actors, but the writing and the storytelling is still the most important aspect to any film."

","Like ""Black Swan"", another compelling masterpiece by Darren, ""Requiem For A Dream"" is a descent into madness. Only this is even more depressing, as the characters begin on a high (no pun intended) with there dreams seemingly close to their grasp and feeling great but end up plummeting down to the bottom thanks to addiction, with their dreams coming right down with them. ""Requiem For A Dream"" is a masterpiece by Darren Aronofsky, it combines everything often overlooked by other film-makers (visuals, sound etc.) to make an unforgettable film that punches you right in the stomach and eventually pushes through right after the credits roll.<br/><br/>So what makes ""Requiem For A Dream"" so great? Well, firstly, it comes down to Darren's flawless direction. Just like ""Black Swan"" you feel as if you are going on a harrowing journey with the characters. Instead of just limply watching them, you feel almost as you're there with them. It is startlingly involving. Some of the visuals are very intense, the last half hour is dizzying in its intensity thanks to Darren's manic quick-cutting and Clint Mansell's incredible score. Darren also shows that he has balls by taking risks, the scene in which Ellen Burstyn goes crazy is incredibly well done and was quite risky in the way it was executed. Some might say the scene seemed daft or even quite funny, which is probably intentional, drugs may seem fun at first but they soon consume you like the fridge. Darren also makes clever use of split-screen which brings you even closer to the characters mental-state.<br/><br/>Sound is a medium film-makers often over look, whether it be diegetic or not, Darren uses both to absorbing effect. Clint's score is a staggering masterpiece in itself, it's haunting and always gives me chills (though it doesn't when they use it on ""Britains Got Talent""). In fact, music is almost always played over each scene which adds to the hypnotic nature of the film. Sometimes the music will change quite suddenly to give the effect of disorientation, making us as an audience dizzy and slightly insane (I am already). Darren uses diegetic sounds inventively as well, by often using them as a sting over quick cuts, like when the camera slowly zooms in to Ellen Burstyn and randomly cuts quickly off to her popping pills. Darren's inventive style really adds to the intensity of the film. It is edited perfection.<br/><br/>Darren also shows off his writing skills along with the other man who wrote the novel. It perfectly demonstrates each characters descent into complete and utter madness to the point where the emotional barrel is over-flowing. The final scene made me nearly well-up and leaves you in complete awe as the credits roll up. Each character is written in detail as well, it's in-depth which is also why the whole film is so compelling and absorbing.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn's performance is also incredible. She deserved that Oscar which Julia Roberts (looks like Coops :) robbed off Ellen. What i don't like about the Oscars is the way they don't go on performance but on nationality or if you've won one already. I'm guessing because Ellen had already won one, they weren't giving her another. I'm sorry but Ellen completely deserved it, her performance is so compelling and realistic. It's obvious that she put a lot of work into her character. In fact everyone puts on an excellent performance which is always great to see.<br/><br/>Some people complain that ""Requiem For A Dream"" is far too depressing and leaves you feeling ""bad"". I can guess that most of these people are American wanting a Hollywood happy ending. The sad truth is there is no happy ending to drug addiction, which is why ""Requiem For A Dream"" is frighteningly honest and truthful. Would it really be realistic if everyone recovered and all there dreams came true? No. If you want to stop, don't start. Although it has an 18 certificate for it's graphic use of drug-taking, shocking images, and sexually explicit images, I honestly think this film should be a 12. Those images are deliberately put there to shock people into not taking drugs, all minors should see this film.<br/><br/>I always know if a film is good if I get chills at the end and I just awingly stare as the credits roll. I defy anyone to come out of ""Requiem For A Dream"" without feeling any emotion at all. ""Requiem For A Dream"" is simply a rare masterpiece. It's directing is flawless, with awe-inspiring music and visuals. It's painfully honest and truthful and a harrowing masterpiece. Films like this don't come around very often so make the most of it. See it now!"

","(unrated version)<br/><br/>We meet Harry, a young and ambitious guy, who keeps on stealing and pawning his mother's television set to earn some quick cash. With that cash he and his buddy Tyrone score some drugs. And pretty soon also his love interest, the beautiful Marion, gets involved. <br/><br/>On the other hand Harold's mother, Sara Goldfarb, is hooked to her television and keeps rebuying it back from the pawn shop. In fact, she's so obsessed with the television, she would do anything to appear on stage in her beautiful red dress. But in order to fit her dress, she's to lose a lot of weight. On the advice of her 'friends' she tries a diet first, but pretty soon she turns to colorful pills, prescribed by a doctor. Not only does she lose weight, but also her mind. Not only because of the pills, but first and foremost because of the sugar withdrawal. And little by little we witness her downfall into isolation and hallucinations. <br/><br/>Aronofsky uses multiple techniques very effectively. Using close-ups in fast-motion he shows images of drugs, be it pills, coke or heroin. Then the way it's administered, be it swallowing, sniffing or injecting. And finally the dilatation of the user's pupils. It's all done very fast and loud, just like a quick fix. Furthermore he uses split-screen and headshots to really put the focus on the characters and their expressions. And as if that's not enough, some top-down views seal the deal. <br/><br/>Another special treat is the score by Clint Mansell. His soundtrack is just unforgettable. It gives chills down your spine every time you hear it. And since it's been used many times in different movie trailers, commercials etc, you probably have heard it a lot. <br/><br/>The performances of the actors are great as well. Not once does it feel like acting, it seems as if they've been using drugs for real. And as the story unfolds, their desperate destinations come closer inevitably. As a viewer you'll be touched and have a hard time not feeling sorry for them. <br/><br/>Rating: R/16"

","This is one of the most dramatic and compelling movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching. After Aronofsky's PI made a bit of a splash I was really looking forward to what he'd do with some top Hollywood talent and a bigger budget. I was not disappointed! This is not a ""feel good"" movie by any stretch of the imagination. But if that's a requirement for a good movie then this is the wrong film for you to begin with. <br/><br/>Arofnosky's direction in this movie is flawless and in some ways even groundbreaking. Jared Leto, Jennifer Conneley and Dayman Wayans all give real solid performances. But Ellen Buryston's acting is just about as good as it gets. She was nominated for an Oscar for her role...how she didn't win it is a black mark on the Academy. In a nutshell the movie at it's most basic level is the story of four people whose lives are very much intertwined. Each of these characters has an addiction problem and in the beginning they anticipate something good to be the long term result of their drug involvement. But just as in real life the ugly head of addiction rears up and grabs each character eventually making their lives a living hell. There is so much more to the movie than that but I'm very hesitant to give anything away because this movie deserves to be seen with an open mind. To give away any more of the plot would be akin to retaining a great artist to paint you a painting and then giving him a canvas that all ready has a pencil sketch laying out the type of painting you are hoping for. <br/><br/>If you are interested in movie-making at it's very finest you'd be hard pressed to top REQUIM FOR A DREAM!

I loved his film The Wrestler, which was nearly my favorite film of 2008. and with his next movie, Balck swan, I also think it will be great. Second to Inception probably.

","This cult film got recognized and reached mainstream success thanks to great performances from Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly. It is a very controversial movie which deals with drug addiction in a very crude and realistic manner. The director was not afraid of tackling the issue of drug addiction and presenting it in a raw manner. The different kinds of addictions are addressed as you have a lot of sniffing, injecting, and coke dealing on the one hand, and medical prescript weight pills on the other hand so the different kind of addictions are addressed here and yes the medical drug pills are considered as equally addictive and harmful as the rest. At the end they both can have devastating results and the director tackles these issues. The film is very original and has several interesting filming sequences which just add to the overall mood of the movie giving it a more realistic and crude vision as do the dream sequences and hallucinations. At first it might seem as the movie is going nowhere if not paid attention too but at the end every sequence adds up to the mood of the film creating a crude and real film sending out a mirror message of the effects that drug addiction has. The movie succeeds in that the viewer experiences the hallucinations and the effects of the drugs and it pulls us in to a world many of us perhaps never have experienced."

Requiem for a Dream made me feel uncomfortable, depressed, and a little sick on the inside, and it's an amazing movie for achieving those things. <br/><br/>This is a movie about addictions, appropriately divided into sections entitled Summer, Fall, and Winter. An interconnected group of people take parallel journeys as a result of their habits, and the viewer comes along for the painful ride. Requiem isn't really a ""preachy"" movie, if that's what you're expecting. It's a little hard to describe it in a quick review, it's something that needs to be seen and experienced. And it is an experience, for lack of a better description. The same way that Mulholland Drive is an experience. It's something that goes beyond just sitting down for two hours to be entertained. <br/><br/>I have to make special mention of the way camera techniques are used to augment the story. The camera angles and various film styles employed here are just brilliant, and greatly helped draw me into the story. The score was great, as well.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is a masterpiece, but it would be inaccurate for me to say I enjoyed it.

Harry and Tyrone earn their living on the drug and theft and Harry is getting to become addicted to drugs with his girlfriend Marion. I like a scene that Harry and Marion are laying down talking their love, which is a very fantastic scene in this film. Although they are talking drugs, there exists something true and pure sense of love between them; he loves his girlfriend the best in the world and make the most of every minutes with their love. This scene would emphasize the last half that drugs break up their relationship.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Harry's mother Sara starts dieting since she got an odd call that she can appear on the TV. She tried to diet as much as possible she can. She starts relying on medicine for a diet before long and she often sundown that she appears on the TV or see the fridge shaking due to extreme diet or starving.<br/><br/>The ending is in the depth of without the beacon of the hope.

Selby & Aronofsky's screenplay pulls no punches as it chronicles the ever-worsening fates of the four main characters. However, if they wanted to engender some kind of pathos I don't think that they succeeded very well except in the case of the mother.<br/><br/>This may be partially due to Aronofsky's tirelessly stylized direction. The visual choices are varied, well-executed and usually fitting but I think that Aronofsky goes overboard. Overuse of the techniques that he employs calls attention to itself, thus shifting attention away from the story.<br/><br/>The score is also worthy of note, as it is clearly carefully crafted as well. It serves its purpose well and isn't as attention-grabbing as the visual style.<br/><br/>The cast sports some talented individuals, including Ellen Burstyn, who received Oscar & Golden Globe nominations for her performance. Jared Leto & Jennifer Connelly both deliver fine performances as well and Marlon Wayans gives what is easily the best performance of his career. Also notable is character actor Christopher McDonald as self-help guru Tappy Tibbons.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is a film that won't appeal to all tastes due to the subject matter.

This film focuses on the issue of Drug addiction, and how something that started out as a small addiction can lead to catastrophic events beyond belief. Throughout the movie I was thinking: ""by the end of this film I am going to be in shock"", but to be honest I was not as shocked or in disbelief as much as I thought I would be. But I think this is due to the fact that these days we have been subjected to so much knowledge about drug addiction and we see so much of it that I guess we have become desensitized to the issue since the movie was made (2000). Overall it was a very well made film with some really interesting camera and editing techniques that you do not see used that much anymore. The acting was amazing; Ellen Burstyn who played Sara Goldfarb was absolutely brilliant. Jennifer Connelly was astonishing as Marion Silver, My god that would have been a hard role to play but wow did she pull it off, and quite fantastically I might add. This film is definitely not for the weak at heart and it will leave you thinking and somewhat shocked long after you have turned it off. 7.5/10"
"Lucabrasisleeps","8","0","0","9 January 2009"," Over the top, sad drug movie
","This is one of the movies which are so depressing that it is not likely to be watched again by most people. The impact is in the over the top approach. I guess the over the top approach may be necessary in order to depict the life of drug addicts. The saddest story here is concerns an old woman. It was almost heartbreaking to watch the transformation from healthy woman to a drug addict.<br/><br/>The story is quite simple. The main characters are Harold Goldfarb, his girlfriend Marion, his friend Tyrone and his mother Sara Goldfarb. The movie spans the four seasons and show the transformation of the characters because of their drug addiction. The sad aspect is that they have dreams like regular people. Harold and Tyrone plan on selling drugs and earn enough to get the perfect drug. This plan ends in bigger problems. Sara goldfarb, on the other hand, takes to drugs for different reasons. She is plagued by loneliness and depression. Out of nowhere, she gets a call from a TV show and she gets excited. She starts eating diet pills in order to reduce her weight. This then causes more problems.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn's performance is one of the best I have ever seen. The portrayal of a lonely old woman who suddenly feels reenergised due to the drugs is absolutely amazing. I almost was in tears towards the end. It was great to watch the first few scenes where the boring routine of an old woman is portrayed perfectly. Jared Leto as Harold has also done well. He has expressive looks and his character seemed credible. The gorgeous Jennifer Connelly fit the role and her performance was great, yet I feel her character has not been explored much in this movie. Marlon Wayans as Tyrone is also top notch but I also feel his character has not been explored much. The most often mentioned praise about this movie is regarding the music. The background score by Clint Mansell is quite amazing, though I still prefer his score for the Fountain(That was beautiful!). Music is a big reason why this movie works as it is perfect for the tone and emotions in the movie. The last scene had some great music especially which effectively brings out the sadness and hopelessness of the characters. Darren Aronofsy deserves special praise for certain scenes which show the gradual degeneration of Sara Goldfarb. The orgy scene is also effectively done and the emptiness in Marion is shown effectively in these scenes.<br/><br/>I can't think of any negatives except for the over the top nature. I know the over the top necessary for drug movies. But I still don't have much of an affection for that style. It seems as if the director tried to force it into people's heads that drugs are harmful. Still it maybe necessary to highlight an evil which has been glorified by certain sections of pop culture.<br/><br/>8/10"

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","0","15 December 2008"," This is your brain on ""Requiem""
","There have been tons of films that depict addictive drug abuse, but no film does it quite like Darren Aronofsky does in ""Requiem for a Dream,"" using camera techniques to mess with your mind and visually drive you insane, much like the characters of the film spiral into drug-induced oblivion. The film is not particularly insightful--it is an independent film-- whose goal is clearly to make a film that shows drug abuse in a way never done before.<br/><br/>""Requiem"" follows essentially four characters whose lives go south because of drugs. There is Harry (Leto) and Tyrone (Wayans), two junkies who turn to selling dope to make a living, Marion (Connelly), Harry's girlfriend who will do anything for cocaine, and Sara, Harry's mother, an older, widowed woman who gets selected to be on TV and begins to take pills to suppress her appetite so that she can wear her favorite dress on air. Sara's story is the most jarring and unique to movie plots and therefore feels distanced from the others, but the technique is what matters in ""Requiem"" more so than the story itself.<br/><br/>This is Aronofsky's film from beginning to end. Numerous camera techniques are employed, particularly rapid sequences of close-ups when the characters are doing their drugs of choice. In addition, Aronofsky uses camera mounts on characters at times and even security cameras to capture some scenes in Sara's storyline. Aronofsky also does various slow downs and speed ups, white fades and more in the editing process that continue to inject director presence into the material. He really experiments with everything with varying degrees of success. <br/><br/>What makes Aronofsky's work so great, however, is not the techniques themselves, but how they are allegorical for drug addiction. He feeds them to us in steady and unobtrusive doses at first with the rapid close-ups for the first hour of the film, then as things start to go out of control in the plot, we get more and more abrupt changes in our viewing of the film from camera angles to the edits. It's brilliant because you can easily enjoy the beginning of the film, but by the end you feel really disturbed by everything and it all happens so quickly. Aronofsky actually psychologically messes with you, successfully.<br/><br/>Other praise for this film goes mostly to Ellen Burstyn as Sara. She's hauntingly brilliant in showing the gradual turn to insanity. A much deserved Oscar nomination. Leto and Connelly are also good, but this movie is more about how Aronofsky makes them appear rather than how they act.<br/><br/>""Requiem"" is really an art film, not a Hollywood-friendly drug movie about the dangers of drugs, but an experiment with the human mind and its ability to be altered by fine director craftsmanship. While there's no true catharsis in the film, it's a movie-watching experience in its own little category by itself and worthy of a try if you're in the mood for something radical. ~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"

","This is the highest rating I have ever given to a movie. The movie has got much to pounder on. Darren Aronofsky has been added to my all time favorite list. If his ""Pi"" was damn depressing and difficult to understand, Requiem for a Dream reaches a new level of depression that entertains.<br/><br/>The movie's genre has to be psychic Horror. Its about drug addict individual's pleasure and pain. The ever lasting peace of satisfaction is in truth turns out to be momentary misery. <br/><br/>An old lady, lonely for life has a reason to live after being invited to a TV show. The pain she undergoes to fit into an unfit red outfit becomes turmoil, after she decides to cut down the sugar. And so she decides to take the pill meant to reduce weight. <br/><br/>A couple's love seem eternal with their success in their new business venture (the business they consume whole heartedly). Life seems beautiful. The business fails, and their inability to fulfill their needs takes them to the extreme darkest corners of Hell. <br/><br/>A man's only solace is his mother's love from the past.<br/><br/>The camera work is a master piece. Its revolutionary and innovative. Proving Darren's mastery is the screenplay and Direction. If Pi has one protagonist, This movie has four, with shades of Grey. <br/><br/>The fast paced scenes with the slow motion scenes were eye struck. <br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn was too good to describe in mere words playing the role of the old lady. Jennifer Connelly seems to have given her best acting ever, with excellent roles cashing in following years. <br/><br/>Watch it to have a glimpse of what real stupendous Cinema is all about."

","I watched this film last night after seeing it on IMDb. It kinda sounded like the type of movie i would enjoy, however, it turned out to be one of those rare movie experiences that made me feel exhausted and speechless. the film was beautiful and traumatic all at the same time, the direction was fantastic and was cinema in the true sense of the word. If you have empathy and understanding of addiction you will really feel for the characters and if you don't, this movie will challenge your beliefs to their core. This is a non-safe movie which will guarantee that it acquires it's haters , but it's the safe, same old, same old movies that will not live long in the memory, where as Requiem for a dream will be here forever. If you are open minded and enjoy unique films, i highly recommend this film to you and you will love it. 10/10 along with pulp fiction and City of god"

","A haunting and stunning masterpiece-This film should be shown to teenagers in health ed class; I will certainly force my son to view it once he is 14 or 15. I will guarantee you anyone who does will NEVER experiment with dangerous, powerful drugs. This film delivers on every level until the gut-wrenching climax leaving you horrified; saddened and a bit sick. If you can stomach it; it is a masterpiece of abuse and the human condition. The individual performances are all amazing and Jennifer Connelly is at her most beautiful best. The visuals are equally impressive; whether you are sober or not. It is amazing although not unbelievable at all; the lengths humans will sink to realized here."

","So many drug-related films (Traffic, Blow) have come out in the past year that I've started to get them confused. But this one tops them all. Ellen Burstyn's performance is absolutely mind-boggling. The scene where she dances around in the clown makeup and the red dress is chilling. I can't imagine the depths of her soul that she had to reach to get this performance, and it is an absolute travesty that she didn't win the Best Actress for it. Jennifer Connolley does a great job as well- this woman is seriously underrated. The scene where she tears apart the apartment looking for a fix conveys desperation like you rarely see on screen. I love how Aronofsky makes you get close to the characters, but not *too* close...and how his directing and editing mimics the descent into hell. This is a depressing film- the characters are sad, desperate, and pathetic, yet we still have empathy for them, no matter how despicable or disgraceful their behavior becomes. A truly unique film experience."
"PaulyC","8","0","0","12 May 2008"," hypnotic tale of desperation
","Requiem for a dream is a hypnotic story about four people desperately pursuing their vision of happiness. It links the lives of a lonely widowed mother, her son Harry, his girlfriend Marion, and his best friend Tyrone. Each one of them begin to fall apart largely due to drug addiction. Each one of them is on a dangerous free-fall but none of the stubborn addicts can change their habits. Shot in Coney Island, Brooklyn with a unique style and flair, Darren Aronofsky directs a very effective film. Although lead actors Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are good in the movie, it is Ellen Burstyn as the widowed mother who steals the show with a powerful performance. Director of photography, Matthew Libatique is on top of his game with his imagery and the musical score works perfectly with the film. Good Stuff!"
"LagerLagerLagerShouting","6","0","0","30 April 2008"," Powerful And Thought-Provoking But Depressing.
","A gritty, powerful drama, Darren Aronofsky's second film is a visually stunning, character driven ride through drug addiction. Showing the protagonists on a gradual downward spiral offers depressing viewing and general monotony through the film's progression but the anti-drugs message sure packs a punch as does the terrific acting, great music, brilliant camera-work and dynamic editing. Aronofsky uses a vast array of technical delights and lurid compositions to depict a drug-induced world inhabited by the characters. These include hectic low-angle close- ups, dizzying POV's and wide angle shots heightening the surreal cinematography. But what really makes the film is the awesome editing by Jay Rabinowitz, who uses some amazing visuals to heighten the drug induced state. This not only makes the film more overpowering but keeps it moving (most films contain about 750 cuts, Requiem For A Dream contains about 2000!). A highly original, thought-provoking, depressingly dark film that delivers an emotional punch.<br/><br/>7/10"

","It's hard to say that one can enjoy such misery. I found this movie disturbing yet quite powerful. For one thing it does not glamorize or romanticize the horror and reality of its subject matter. The performances were brilliant on everyone's part. The cinematography really set the pace and it is so close to the real life desperation that comes with the territory that I was riveted to it. It just took me along with it to it's painful end. Burnstyn and Connelly were both brilliant in this. Definitely not a Hollywood feel good vacuous time waster but well worth the cringe factor. There's no room for ""what if."" The story is linear and tragically inevitable. Painfully memorable."

None of my friends have ever seen this film, but I hope that one day the do, as this shows the horrible consequences of drugs. At first, I could not cope with this film.

I had no expectations to the movie, but as the minutes progress in the move it surprised me more and more. The movie is different, and maybe original. It's one of the best movies i ever seen. The plot is used before, and everybody knows the story about drugs, and how bad it is. But this movie really show you the reality, it's shows you that there is no happy ending using drugs! The movie are powerful and emotional. The acting is great! Jennifer Connelly does a great acting performance, I know she was Nominated for some movie awards, but she did not win any. That I don't understand! She deserved to win something. Another actor who is also doing a good job is, Ellen Burstyn, acting as an addicted on pills and almost crazy woman. She is a great actor.

","I came to watch this movie after hearing about it from so many people. And reading about it everywhere on internet. After seeing it i had to sit back for a while to come back to the real world again. I am truly convinced that everyone should watch this movie. Not just because the performance of the actors and the brutality of the story, but the fact that you will think twice before making a run for drugs, or any other addiction for that matter. It really is a educational story on a hard and chilling way but nobody will deny that its the real truth, and thats what makes this movie so wonderful. The performance of Ellyn Burnstyn and the role which she plays really makes the movie complete. Also the choice of music in the most critical scenes will give you goosebumps everywhere. By my opinion this movie belongs to one of the best movies ever made and thats why i give this movie a 10+. I can not say enough that this movie must be seen by everyone (if your above 18 that is).

","Like all good trips, ""Requiem for a Dream"" takes us to another world. As Harry, Marion, and Sara are devoured by their addiction, they trade the bright Coney Island light for the gloom of their dusty apartments and the shady side streets of Mermaid Avenue. I rarely ache for a happy end, but in this case I did. ""Requiem"" is no less than a masterpiece, but it's painted in the darkest colors in the palette. Maverick director Darren Aronofsky finds new and compelling images for what drugs can do to you. He makes wide use of visual gimmicks including split screen, keyhole frames, cash-register style cross-fading, god's-eye crane shots, and image overlay. But while such gadgets often come across as strained and showy, he uses them to great advantage. Among his most haunting feats is having the actors run around with the camera strapped to their bodies, yielding a head shot that makes the characters appear strangely lifeless, like puppets on invisible strings. Shattering performances by Jared Leto and Jennifer Conelly. They make a ravishing, if ghostly couple indeed. Outstanding appearances by Ellen Burstyn and Christopher MacDonald in supporting roles. The Kronos Quartet provides a piercing score. Movies as profound and inventive as this one are hard to find."
"andizapatagj","10","0","0","4 February 2008"," dramatically amazing
","this is one of the best movies ever made with the best performances. Ellen Burstyn is just incredible in her role as sarah and jared leto and jennyfer conelly are also very good. I think the clear message of this movie is anti-drugs but also found many elements important of this movie as how dreams can fall to pieces, people can be naive and loneliness can make you desperate and even can drive you to destruction in the case of sara. I felt also so depressed for the characters of conelly and leto that were in love in such a pure way and then became depraved and destructed by their addictions. Addictions destroy everything but not only addiction for drugs but also for people, for feeling right and loved or even happy. The last scene had me crying till the credits ended and i just couldn't stop. Its so heartbreaking to watch how this characters that seemed full of dreams, happiness and hopes at the beginning could end up becoming so pathetic and dark. When letos character lost his arm i was impressed and also when conelly was selling her body for drugs and sara was in the siquiatric hospital, those were painful scenes to watch. But i think one scene that also got me crumble was the part when conelly and leto talk on the phone and by then you just know nothing will be the same again for them. The photography and effects were just excellent and managed to drive you crazy but also to know what characters were feeling when they were high. This movie must be watched because as hard as it is important for everyone to realize how dangerous drugs really are and how addictions and extremes can destroy your life no matter how old or smart you think you are."

","This is an extremely powerful tale of young couple and a mom. The perfect storyline, the visual effects and the tragic outcome is all together way too much for one to handle. But yet, along the movie- until the very last end an beyond, it gives a strange sense of fulfillment. It makes you wonder about what could have been, if you took a slightly different path in life. It makes you feel fortunate and melancholic. The movie really starts at the end. Because you are way to busy absorbing the all the input during the movie, you can't really reflect on it. But after, for a brief (or not so brief) period of time, you are barely a reflection of your formal self. This movie get to you, it creeps under your skin, through your arteries and into the most remote and hidden parts of your brain. And it makes you want to talk about it. A great movie!

","Let me be the first to mention exactly how powerful this film is. This film can very well change your life for the better. It is quite possibly the greatest gem in filming to be released since American Beauty. But even though this diamond is huge, it has a few faults. First it seems to lose its seriousness at points, and certain points seem random and err, well quite odd. That being said, this could be the greatest film ever. It has that eerieness that even when something seems so comical you cannot laugh. It is terrible to see what happens to these people, and I could hardly say that this movie will make you feel good once its over. At the end, more than likely you will sit in your seat for a minute just processing what you saw. This movie gives no hope, no beaken of light, and it shows the absolute worst case scenarios. If you think that our world is perfect, then Requiem will wake you up from that dream quickly, and once you wake up, you will only want to go right back to sleep. Definitely a powerful film. 9/10<br/><br/>Pros: Characters feel real, it remains dark and bleak, tremendous acting.<br/><br/>Cons: Repetition of one scene in particular where drug use is shown, however different the drugs or the process of using it, this scene stays the same. Honestly, thats all I can think of.<br/><br/>Go buy this film, or at the very least, rent it and never bring it back to the store."

The thing that makes Trainspotting stand out over this is that Trainspotting was, in some ways beautiful. It never glorified the drugs scene but it depicted it in a much better way with far more clarity , despite the fact that all Requiem for a Dream is , is clarity, this clarity shields the viewer from the film and discourages it. After this film , I felt sick, after trainspotting I felt shocked, amazed, in awe, and yes , sick...but at least there was more than just 6.<br/><br/>It's a good film, it just doesn't hit all the right places, I'd still give it a 6 or a 7.

","This is one of my favorite movies and I always suggest it.  The response I frequently get is how they didn't like it to which, after asking why they didn't, they respond, because it was horryfing or depressing, shocking, or something of the sort.  I think that is exactly what is so wonderful about it.  Aronofsky's Requiem shows to mercy to three kids who mind as well be faceless.  We live in a time of addiction and abuse to drugs and finally there is a film which sugar coats nothing.  What is most impressive about Selby's writing is how he's not just examined teenage drug use but adult drug use as well and in as much, knowing the problem is universal is all the more terrifying- no one is free from the clutches of addiction and uneccessary need and no one, at least should say, I can do it, I have a resistance, I can take just a little bit more.  Its about pushing lines and being stuck on the other side of them.  With special effects sequences which for once, don't take away from the movie but greatly add to its objective. Aronofsky throws life in our face, and we catch--in an almost welcomed discomfort--a problem, so real you feel your heart breaking for these characters everytime you watch. Leto, Wayans, the beautiful Connelly, and the wonderful Burstyn make the cast--cast rather well--and act circles around circles- wonderful performences, along with movie all unappreciated. Philip Glass provides the empowering tear-jerking requiem for a dream of a movie about a nightmare, for a world that needed such a wake up call. Definate A."

My house would have had to have been on fire for me to take my eyes off the screen and even then I would have had second thoughts.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn, who gave the performance of a lifetime, was haunting. I can still see her face.  She was absolutely cheated out of EVERY award in 2000! She should have WON THEM ALL!  Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans were also amazing!  Jennifer Connelly gave her best performance ever.  When watching this film I just kept wondering how these actors performed at that level. It's apparent that they were all pushed to their absolute limit both personally and professionally for this project and the way they all rose to the occasion was mind blowing!<br/><br/>The disturbing images and sound effects of this piece have been seared into my brain and will be for a long time.<br/><br/>I could go on but I won't.  Please just see this film.  After watching it I felt like an addict because I just wanted to see it again and again.

Wow, I have never seen a movie like this one before. I have never done drugs, and I will definitely never start after watching this movie.  After watching it I felt like I had been beat up and smeared through a sewernever felt that way before after watching a movie<br/><br/>                       ****May be Spoilers****<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is a very disturbing and dark movie.  The camera angles show some of the oddest and most unique point of views that I have ever seen.  It is nice though to watch a different kind of movie that does not have to tie up everything at the end and make you feel happy.  A movie does not always have to have a happy ending.  About half way through the movie you can tell that things are just not going right for them, so I at least expected to watch them go down their dark paths.  I felt sorry for the four characters as they were sucked into insanity/darkness/hell, and wished that things would turn out alright, but I knew better  <br/><br/>If you liked this movie, I suggest that you watch Ladri di biciclette - 1948 (The Bicycle Thief).  Don't ask me why, but they both have the same kind of feel of being a great movie but depressing at the same time.  They are different plots and different times, but both of them make me feel a little depressed/panicky/anxious/pity.  <br/><br/>I gave this movie 10 out of 10.  I just think it is has unique camera angles/point of view, great acting, good plot, and directed so well that it is worth watching at least once, if not twice.   The DVD has deleted scenes and a commentary on the making of the movie, as well as more.  The DVD menu for this movie is also very unique.  When I first put it in I was getting upset that I could not get my DVD player to work right, I thought maybe my TV was messed up also.  You have to watch the DVD to understand what I mean.<br/><br/>I suggest you go watch it, but it would not be a good movie for children. If some of the scenes were not so graphic (particularly the sex scenes), then it would be a good movie to show to children/adolescents as an anti-drug movie."

After reading lots of comments, I prepared my mind for something depressing, but this movie is just beyond that, its impact is, as one of the commenters here said, at the level of one of the powerful movie of all time.  Every actors did their job so great (For me, Ellen should get 2 Oscars for this role) and the directing is not just modern but very effective.  I love this movie and just hope everyone can see it."

","As soon as the syringe plunges into Harry's arm, we are mesmerized, hypnotized by Darren Aronofsky's directing. Not too long ago I read Requiem For A Dream by Hubert Selby Jr. and was amazed, after seeing the movie I felt the same way. A modern tale of broken dreams and the end of innocence.<br/><br/>This is a tale of a woman (played beautifully by Ellen Burstyn giving one of the best performances to ever be seen)  only wanting to be thin, only wanting to be loved in a superficial society. Harry, her son, dreams of becoming rich along with his girlfriend Marion, who would like to open a shop. Tyrone, Harry's friend, spends nights wishing for his mother and injects heroin into his body to help fuel these dreams. Using drugs and dreaming, they don't realize they've created a nightmare that swallows their dreams. They somehow see past this and no matter what, try and see the good side of something and drown out the oncoming nightmares.<br/><br/>We feel virtually helpless and miserable as we watch their lives dwindle down into a never ending spiral of drugs and lonlieness, yet we can sympathize with them on some level. Due to spectacular performances and even better directing. Each shot is done with such precision and beauty, its a shame it ends. The use of body cameras allows us to feel what each character does and the regret on their face. The use of split screens not only shows us the action, but the beauty within their lives, before drugs interfered, I.E. Marion and Harry lying down on the bed. Everytime I see this movie at the end I always cry. A 10 out of 10. Explicit sex scenes and disturbing images, a wonderful film."

","Darren Aronofsky is one of the, scratch that, THE preeminent voice in maintstream contemporary cinema.  No other filmmaker today, or ever (Yes, that's right, I just said 'ever' and FULLY understand what that means), has produced work with such a stunningly profound voice and level that he has. Ever. It simply just hasn't happened yet. By following such an engaging film as Pi with one as Requiem, it only proves beyond the shadow of a doubt, that, he is for real, for better or worse.  And even though his early attempts have had the subtle, unmistakable traces of immaturity thus far, if I could offer only one suggestion / word-of-advice for ANYONE who reads this message, it would be this: Take heed, he is just simply THAT good."
"kintopf432","9","0","0","7 April 2003"," Searingly intense (if propagandistic) film
","The performances here are great, sometimes shockingly so.  Ellen Burstyn disappears completely into her character--she's so authentic in this role that it chokes your heart.  Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly have never been this good (some would say they've never been good at all, before or since). Even Marlon Wayans, that goofiest of Wayanses, is unexpectedly touching in his key supporting role.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofksy's technique is quite astonishing.  It's interesting (and heartening) to see how popular the movie's become with young people, as its chilly formalism has more in common with art-house provocateurs like Peter Greenaway than with all those flashy new talents who used to make music videos.  At the same time, the technical virtuosity never overwhelms the narrative; in fact, it tricks you into thinking the simplistic message is more profound than it is.  The rolling, nightmarish sequence leading to the film's climax, made even more feverish by Clint Mansell's incessant score, is so searingly intense that you may feel physically sick afterwards.  (At least, in the unedited version it is.)  It may be the most powerful and disturbing fifteen minutes ever put on film, and to deny its effectiveness, even as a propaganda tool, would be wrong.<br/><br/>And a propaganda tool is exactly what it is.  As an anti-drug message film, it's nowhere near as sophisticated as `Trainspotting'; its message is writ far too large for that.  And as entertaining as the film's aesthetic elements are, the relentless moralizing can be wearying.  `Requiem for a Dream' puts its message into a box (in this case a refrigerator) and hits you over the head with it over and over again.<br/><br/>Then again, the aesthetic elements are so strong that talk of thematic subtleties seems like carping.  And really, I wasn't bothered by the movie's obviousness so much, even if I did notice it.  Highly recommended, with the tiniest grain of salt.  9 out of 10."

","Darren Aronofsky who is truly a terrific and very creative writer/director is at his best here with Requiem For A Dream. Everyone i know has said that RFAD is excellent but very weird and dodgy which really it isn't. The film is just showing us (the audience) what the characters of the movie see and feel over their addiction to drugs. The acting in the film is truly amazing especially from Ellen Burstyn who is just brilliant in this movie playing a mother trying to lose weight and then gets addicted to pills and well i won't spoil it for you with what happens to her. Jared Leto is also great in this movie playing the son who is addicted to Heroin, Jennifer Connelly is brilliant as Leto's sexy girlfriend and Marlon Wayans also turns out a good performance as Leto's best friend (also a heroin addict). I believe the film has some of the best editing i have ever seen in a movie and the way some of the quick and snappy shots are put together are fantastic. The music is also brilliant, an eerie instrumental tune which is also used in One Hour Photo. RFAD only recieved one oscar nomination and that was to Ellen Burstyn for Best Actress who maybe should of won it i don't know but i feel other nominations such as Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay & Best Editing should of atleast gone to the movie as well. If you haven't seen this movie forget renting it and buy it now it truly is an excellent very creative movie. 10/10"

Darren Aronofsky's modern day morality tale of the doomed life of four individuals from Brooklyn hits the viewer hard. Really hard. superb acting helps - Ellen Burstyn, Marlon Wyans, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are all great. The supporting cast does a wonderful job as well. If you connect with any of the characters, be prepared for a gut wrenching ride. A superb score and beautiful cinematography only strengthen the movie's grip. I literally could not take my eyes of the screen. That's not to say that I liked what I was seeing there - the spectacle of four people destroying themselves is unpleasant and deeply disturbing.

Since then i haven't gone a day without thinking about it. I would reccomend this to everyone not because it's a happy movie, but because you have to see it.  I don't know about showing it in school, it's a lot to handle especially unrated, but what a great message it has.  I don't know who wouldn't think twice before injecting heroin in there arm after watching this.  A great story with some of the best acting I've ever seen. Not only was the acting great, but the directing stood out especially when they take the drugs.  The music at the end also is very moving and powerful.

","This powerful film follows the intertwined lives of four people as they descend a downward spiral caused by drug addiction. We see the three young characters Harry, Tyrone, and Marion innocently begin to sell drugs to satiate their ever growing habits. We see the human sides of them, the potential they hold, and their love for others slowly get destroyed as the drugs take control of their lives. We also witness Harry's lonely mother, Sara, descend into a similar hopeless state, but in her case the drugs are legal, and prescribed to her by a doctor. When she is prescribed her weight loss pills, the doctor does not even look at her. A chilling parallel is drawn; her doctor and the street dealers are shown to have the same total disregard for the lives of their buyers. For a time everyone's life is good, everyone has money, and Harry's mother loses weight and feels accepted by her friends. But it doesn't last, and one by one they descend into a state of hopeless desperation. It is all very graphic, and it left me with a profound feeling towards the horrible effects of addictive drugs. All of the actors do a spectacular job portraying their characters, and I really felt for them. This film should be shown to anyone who is having thoughts about experimenting with drugs. It is shocking and brutal, but it has to be in order to truly reflect the world it portrays."

The movie stars Ellen Burstyn an old women with an obssesion with televison who believes that her big chance to make it on Tv has finally come so she goes on a diet of taking diet pills. Her son played by Jared Leto a junkie who is trying to break big with dealing with his buddy Tyrone played by Marlon Wayans. During the course of the movie we see the too make it big and hit rock bottom at almost the same time. Jenifer Conlley stars as Marion the girlfriend who is simply relying on Leto to make things happen. The movie takes you on a wild ride through each of these individuals lives, we see them fall then rise but then fall again until everything crashes down for them.

","I just saw RFAD the second time, first time on the big screen and I still think it's and very good movie. Knowing what was expecting me made the emotional impact gave way for a more calm and rational view. When people seriously criticise the movie, they often say, that the characters are flat and artificial. And they are somehow right, but I personally think that this is not a flaw of the movie or script, but just an different attempt of telling a story. There are a lot of very good movies building up characters from the inside, showing fragile emotional and intellectual structures rising and falling. RFAD chooses a more ""graphic"" way. The characters are abstract images, looked at with a cold distance. They are not actual human beings but an essence of  some of theirs ways, they are dreams of beings in a dreamlike graphic world. And as the title already tells they get shattered. People might be right in judging these attempt as inhuman and potentially superficial, but I feel otherwise. To me it is really beautiful and precious and the fact that such a highly abstract and stylised point of view can cause a real emotional effect shows the high quality of this picture."

","I am not writing this review to actually talk about the techniques used by Darren Aronofsky to make this amazing film but about the effectiveness of his film making. All of the techniques in the world are not going to make a good film to me unless it makes me feel something.<br/><br/>This was one of the first movies where I was left feeling utter despair. The type of despair that you feel after losing a loved one to cancer, or to another woman. The type of absolute despair that leaves you doubled over unable to make a sound. I saw it alone one night, from midnight to two in the morning,(being the brilliant genius that I am), and what I wanted to do afterwards was talk about it with ANYONE, and I ended up crying myself to sleep because of the void that it filled me with. It was disturbing to see the things that people are addicted to (heroin, hope, food, affection etc.). The horrifying part was the length to which all of the characters went in order to not give up. To not give up on dreaming of a better way of life; a sure fix that will solve all of their problems. The drugs were not what the characters were ultimately addicted to; they were an immediate problem that dulled a deeper sorrow.<br/><br/>When I woke up yesterday morning after watching it the night before, I looked outside and was wonderfully appreciative to see the sun, and to see that life went on around me. It was the ultimate ""f*&% you"" to this film. That is not to say that I did not appreciate it, but like a funeral, or an experience in which your life was at stake, you will want to express your thanks for being alive and healthy, if that is your current state.<br/><br/>All of what I planned to write seemed to be much more profound than what I am actually expressing, but what it comes down to is that I envy anyone who would be able to walk out of this film feeling unaffected. Either they are the most pretentious people to ever walk the face of the earth, or they have faced demons I hope to never see and have come out triumphant. If you do not fit into either of these categories, then see this film. However, make sure that you have the stomach to watch it, and a shoulder to possibly cry on when it's over."

I really cared for the characters, I didn't think they were just some junkies biting the dust. The director, screenwriter and actors make us symphasise with them. All four leads are amazing, and their slow journey into hell is so realistic.

All of them are addicted to drugs: cocaine ,heroin, pot, diet pills.... As their addiction gets stronger, they face all of the despair caused by the drugs: paranoia, abstinence and so on. Darren Aronofsky´s direction is perfect: he seems to know by heart what to do. The split-screen takes ,unusual camera effects and his other techniques are just great.

I literally could not find the words to sum up how I was feeling about what I'd just seen. It was everything I  hoped I'd never see all in one movie that seemed to last forever.<br/><br/>Things aren't quite the same when you see the slides in health class of people shooting up as when you see how it could play into someone's life. Now, the fact that I have a clear fear of needles, syringes, etc., didn't really help me enjoy this at all. I have to say that I feel very little sympathy for the characters in that they chose to do drugs and took the chance of forming an addiction. I just think it's interesting to see how drugs caused the downward spiral of everyone's lives.<br/><br/>The acting in this was outstanding. I'm not a huge Connelly fan, but here she was amazing. She played the part so well. The rest of the actors did a wonderful job as well. It was really interesting to see that these actors played the parts so well and really showed the way their lives were slipping away. Great job to all actors in this.<br/><br/>My impression after the movie was not like I'd had with any other movie. The last half hour of the movie was the worst. I couldn't sit through it. I really took advantage of the good old pause button for that part. I went and talked to my friends who recommended it. I told my friend that I just couldn't find the right words to describe what I thought. He replied by saying, ""That's exactly the point."" I would say that parts of the movie gave me the chills, but once I started getting them, they never really went away. I never wanted to do drugs to begin with, but this movie makes me want to avoid them even more. I'm really glad I saw this, and if I could, I'd show this to every single addict out there. It really makes you think ""What's it going to take to get these people to stop using?""<br/><br/>I could go on and on about this movie, but my comments would in no way to justice to the way this film made me feel.

I knew nothing of the film, only what I read on the back cover and that didn't help me very much, but I heard enough it's name plenty of times so I decided to give it a looksey.  When the credits started to roll I had a deep feeling of sorrow in the pit of my stomach. It left an incredible impact on me and I just had to see it again.  I was stunned at the complexity of the characters and the multiple themes one could find in here.  There are emotions in this film that everyone can relate to.  It is not just a film about junkies and how they mess up their lives with drugs.  It is about what drives the people into those drugs. It is about loneliness, and most importantly it is about how everything can become your drug of choice, from candy to television to daydreaming anything in your life that you cannot seem to live without is your drug of choice.<br/><br/>More than that it is the way one finds these characters to be at the end.  Many people will point out certain elements that are not true to real life.  They say that the doctor didn't play a doctor correctly, but do you know why? It is because he isn't a doctor.  I've never heard people complain that the gangsters in The Godfather or Goodfellas weren't realistic enough.

Never has a movie invoked a total feeling of despair in me. The last 20 minutes of this film was like a 20-minute free fall into hell with nothing but a burning parachute. I was totally surprised by the weight of this film.<br/><br/>However, what surprised me more was the depth of the film. Instead of focusing on the drug use and abuse itself, Darren Aronofsky focused on the characters' emotions, ambitions, flaws, and ultimate downfall. With Sara Goldfarb's bourgeois obsessions, Harry Goldfarb's struggle for a better and easier life, Marion Silver's crippling addiction to the thing that fills the hole in her life, and Tyrone Love's inherent Oedipus complex, Requiem for a Dream becomes much more than just a lateral ""drug movie.""<br/><br/>
To put the proverbial icing on the cake, powerful music coupled with the deft usage of color creates the moods that complement and contrast so amazingly well. The beginning of the film is saturated in color, as opposed to the end with it's subdued greens, grays, and blues. The camera work also adds to the intensity of the film. Holy extreme close-up Batman!<br/><br/>In the end, Requiem for a Dream ranks up there in my favorite movies of all time. However, I don't suggest this movie for a late night party.

","I have seen the movie and read the book (I own both by the way) and I would have to say that although this was a good movie, one should definitely read the book.<br/><br/>There were a lot of things in the book that Darren Aronofsky ignored while making the movie, which is a major reason why I think the book is better. For instance, the quick shots in the movie of the pupils dialating, etc. disappointed me the most with this movie.  One of the reasons the book was so great was because Selby, Jr. described the heroin parties in great detail, which was the meat of the entire Harry, Marion, and Tyrone story . For Aronofsky to condense the most entertaining part of the book into quick shots to give audiences the IDEA that the characters are getting high made me feel cheated out of the full experience.<br/><br/>Another part I was disappointed about was that Marion and Harry's love wasn't shown as well as it was shown in the book.  I have read many other reviews of this movie that agree with me on this one.  At times when the two are talking they seem rushed to me, like Aronofsky just wanted the audience to get the IDEA that they are in love.  If the Harry, Marion, and Tyrone section wasn't so rushed then I think that this movie would have been a lot better.  Even so, I still think this is the most entertaining section in the movie; too bad it was ignored.<br/><br/>However, the part that was not rushed and, to me, seemed drawn out was the Sarah Goldfarb section.  Her's seemed like Aronofsky's favorite story and he explains it well (often exactly like the book) although there are some parts that seem more long-winded than effective.  The part where the people come out of the T.V. could have been a lot better if the T.V. characters didn't break into a Conga-line (or however you spell it).  For me it made the scene seem more fun than scary and disturbing, and watching this part more than twice is liable to cause the fast-forward button to be pressed.<br/><br/>This totally sounds like a bad review, but this really is a good movie for someone who didn't read the book first.  If I subtract my biases for the book then I have a very good movie sitting in front of me.  I guess it just wasn't what I expected after reading the words first, which is probably a normal reaction to everyone who has read the book before seeing the movie. As a whole I recommend this movie to anyone who likes different movies and does not get offended easily, but the book is a must no matter what the circumstances."

","When I finished watching this movie last night, it was 2 AM and I was alone. I was practically shivering in horror at what I had just seen, and I felt like curling into a ball with my pillow in hand.  Watching this movie is like watching a close friend deteriorate before your very eyes.  I had to hit the mute button during the ending montage and peek through my fingers at the TV.  I normally don't watch films like this, but this one had been tempting me for months, so I finally gave in.  I'm really glad I did, but part of me wished I hadn't.<br/><br/>""Requiem"" is such a powerful film that deserves the acclaim it has  gotten. Drug addiction is the obvious element here, but there's much more underneath: love, betrayal, loneliness, and desperation.  Ellen Burnstyn does a superior job as Sara Goldfarb, an aging widow and mother who lives alone in her apartment.  Her son, Harry, makes his living dealing drugs with his friend, Tyrone.  Harry's girlfriend, Marion, who's also an addict, are living together and trying to establish a good living.  Ms. Goldfarb knows nothing of her son's real life, and fantasizes about his future, as well as her own when she receives an offer to appear as a contestant on a television show.  Her story alone makes this film - it's heart-wrenching and traumatizing to watch.  The three kids got what they deserved, in my opinion, but Sara was the innocent, loving mother who didn't deserve such a fate.<br/><br/>The incredible, albeit a bit cartoony, camera cuts work very well.  I loved the music in this film and how it was used.  It was unsettling to hear the music all discordant when the characters began their respective freefalls. The ending montage, if you have the guts to watch it, unlike myself, is a visual wonder, from the little bits that I saw.  <br/><br/>If the film could be stripped of its nudity, this would be an excellent film for at-risk teens and high school students.  This is where the three young adults' stories are powerful.  Drugs might be fun for a while, but soon you're hanging onto a train and you either keep riding it 'til your life gives out, or let go and face a long, hellish recovery.  But in this case, the train stopped, leaving the kids out in the cold.  Witnessing what they have to do to feed their addictions is truly sad and it's something every teen should see.<br/><br/>This is a harsh film, very horrifying and not good for sensitive viewers. Did I enjoy it?  Not really.  Is it a brilliant film?  Absolutely.  I knew this was an excellent film when it was over, but I didn't enjoy it much. Though, honestly, this isn't a film to be enjoyed, because what you see is isn't at all joyous.  It's a film to be experienced, and what an experience you'll get!  I won't give this film a grade, it's not a fair measure with a film like this, but I highly recommend it."

To me it is about loneliness, losing the ones you love, seeking refuge whereever you can(i.e. the drugs) and generally how easily life can turn out in ways you never wanted or imagined. The message of Requiem is about more than drug abuse, it is about losing sight of what's really important and about the coldness of society and the fellowman. The title really tells all.

And even though one could argue over the point of the movie and the plot details, I believe most all would have to say that it hides nothing from the audience in the way of all the good things humans have to offer, all that they want in their life and the lives of others, and how either gradually over time or in the blink of an eye, it can all be swept away...and the brutal honesty and reality that is their own lives surfaces and shines through.  Everyone thinks that if they just ARE good people and live life and BE good people that they SHOULD and WILL get what they and others feel they deserve.  But as anyone who has ran across their own failures and fallibilities in their own lives can tell you, that is not always the case, and the story doesn't always have a happy ending, even if there are not any bad guys to readily blame or condemn for the tragedies that befall even the most unassuming of people.

","SPOILERS WARNING<br/><br/>The film contained many fascinating sequences but ultimately left me none the wiser about the characters. The acting was great yet the story and the direction contained little emotional depth and almost no subtlety.<br/><br/>At the end of the film I didn't feel as if I knew, or could empathise, with any of the characters (with the exception of Sara). The anti-drugs message was very evident but reminiscent of a patronising school counsellor. For example, in Trainspotting Danny Boyle contrasted the thrill of taking drugs with the likely dire consequences, and therefore offered a non-masochistic insight into the sad popularity of illegal drugs.<br/><br/>The two scenes that stood out for me were Sara's quite brilliant speech about her loneliness in old age and the scene with her two friends hugging. They had an emotional depth that the rest of the film lacked. The gruelling scene involving the electic shock therapy, amputation, and the show-orgy was distressing to watch but no more so than if I had seen those terrible images out of context. The same message could have been delivered with more subtle means so I found myself questioning what the graphicness of the scenes added.<br/><br/>An interesting film, with some innovative directorial touches, that I'm unlikely to watch again."

","There's something about this movie that defies you to refrain from declaring whether you ""like"" it or not.  And I'm not sure if I can put my finger on why.  Is it that the effort to capture everything (and I do mean everything) on film is a kind of recipe for cinematic autodestruction?  Or is it that the film was successful in delivering its ""goods"", and that goal has nothing, but nothing, to do with ""liking"" or ""enjoying"" the product?  Or is it something else?<br/><br/>Anyway, I *will* say that the film delivers an interesting thesis, and it IMHO is this:  That when you take all the drugs away from life, what you have left is love.  Corollary:  Everything that masks love is, by definition, a drug.  I can't say whether this is a particularly groundbreaking thesis or not.  I figure there's a very good chance it's been dealt with--perhaps even more effectively--by any number of prior cinematic efforts to deal with the drug issue [write me and let me know! -ed].  But this film certainly throws its hat squarely into that ring.<br/><br/>I'm sort of reminded of the quintessential Vietnam movie as a kind of holy grail of filmmaking in the U.S.  That particular pursuit has come to strike me as a kind of obsession, with a feeling of each new entrant being yet-another headlong rush 180 degrees in the wrong direction (away from the probity necessary to healing).  The difference in this genre of movie (e.g., ""Requiem"", ""Jesus' Son"", et.al.) is that the pursuit seems more focused and honest, more like the pursuit of insight and true healing.  I wonder if ""Requiem"" might be a kind of belated ""Apocalypse Now"" of the drug wars.  To the extent that there's any basis for such an analogy, ""Requiem"" bears a look.<br/><br/>AFTERNOTE:  I was about to submit this review with no other comments.  Think about it:  Not a word about the acting, editing, script...nothing!  I would like you to take that as a positive comment; the acting, scripting, editing, etc. were fine, to the point of not needing or naturally eliciting comment. It's like Stravinsky said when someone asked if the attraction of Beethoven was in his voice-leading:  (paraphrase) ""Well, that's an ironic thing about voice-leading.  When it's absolutely perfect, it disappears as an attribute of the musical product.  The best voice leading defies being noticed.""  I feel that technically this film defies this kind of commentary.

I had seen a few movies by writer/directors, where the writing was substantially substandard on their follow-up effort (Magnolia by P.T. Anderson being the prime example for me). About the only writer/director I found I was a fan of was Chris Nolan (If you haven't seen any of his movies, by all means see them). I can now safely add Darren Aronofsky to that short list of writer/directors I admire.<br/><br/>I guess it was a good thing I was watching this movie on DVD - I was able to distract myself a little by looking at the notes inside, the better not to be completely sickened by what I was watching. Not that I was sick in a bad way - but rather, when you watch the three minutes or so that is the climax of this movie - when you see how the dreams of 4 people winds up plunging them into madness, into an abyss where they will never come back from - you too will be sick.

","It always begins with music.  This spirit emerged from the power of the dithyrambic chorus, because `language, as organ and symbol of phenomena, can never reveal the innermost depths of music, and as soon as it engages in the imitation of music, can only ever skim the surface, while even the most eloquent lyric poetry is powerless to bring the deepest meaning of music as much as one step closer to us.'   The opening notes from the Kronos Quartet are tidal waves coming out of the idyllic seas of common imagery.  Even the title, Requiem for a Dream , speaks towards the dithyramb which calls the death of the Traumbilder that were once held so dear.  The key scenes of this film do without the burden of words and allows the music and the images wash over the audience.  The ice cold current of the Kronos Quartet flows fast through the spinning images of Sara, Harry, Marion, and Tyrone's lives collapsing from stark reality exploding-through their pitiful constructs. This churning of images blends the characters into a solitary unit of grotesque failure in the face of their aspirations.  Once again, the flow of music leads and defines the path of the images."

","Ancient Greek culture pioneered the tragedy and mastered the art of touching the emotions of the audience. There is a term - ""catharsis"" - which means ""a purifying or figurative cleansing of the emotions, especially pity and fear, described by Aristotle as an effect of tragic drama on its audience."" Darren Aronofsky successfully incorporated this catharsis into his visually stunning emotional parachute-less sky-dive ""Requiem for a Dream"".<br/><br/>I watched the movie alone, immediately captivated by his directing style. By the time the movie had finished I was left feeling empty but cleansed. His frightening pinnacle and resolution sequence near the film's end brought me to my knees but also left with me sense of purity and hope. After seeing this movie I felt that everything around me was beautiful. This takes me back to a theory of Chuck Palahnuik the author of Fight Club. After threatening a shop clerk to death with a gun in the back of his head. Tyler Durden lets the poor man go only to say, ""Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K. Hessell's life. His breakfast will taste better than any meal he has ever eaten."" After hitting rock bottom and finding you have wasted every aspect of your life you can find peace and beauty everywhere.<br/><br/>When I re-watched the movie with my girlfriend she broke down sobbing at the film's ending sequence, but she wouldn't let me touch her to comfort her. It was an amazing little experience to see someone so abused by a film. I was still upset to see her this way - don't get me wrong.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is the only movie as of recent that has taken my emotions hostage and abused me however it pleased.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the directing in this film I recommend Amelie - this a much more light-hearted and funny movie, almost on the opposite end of the spectrum from Requiem. Both of these films have drastically altered my perception between good film and epic film."

","This thing that surprised me those most about this movie was Marlon Wayans' ability to step out of his usually comic role in order to play a convincing drug addict. It is his performance, as well as Ellen Burstyn's that stand out among the many great acting jobs in this movie, such as Jared Leto's and Jennifer Connelly's.<br/><br/>However, it is not just the acting that is great in this movie; the plot and direction are suburb. Instead of becoming corny and melodramatic, it conveys a feeling of helplessness and innocence about drug addiction which makes it that much more powerful. Although the film is very graphic, making it inappropriate for younger viewers, and harsh in its depiction of reality, I believe that this is a film that many age groups can enjoy. Also, what makes this movie great is it's ability to step out from the individual characters, and to tap into the underlying theme of addiction in all of its forms. Therefore I believe that many people will be able to identify different characters in this movie with different parts of their life.<br/><br/>Really, the only critique I have of this movie is the fact that the haunting music will get stuck in your head, and you will be constantly thinking about it. But, that is not a bad thing, in this case, because Hubert Selby, the writer, created this movie to be mulled over for many days.

I thought I would learn new things and see new things if I saw it again, but it just wasn't like that first time. Yes, as others have noted, the performances of Burstyn, Leto, Wayans and Connelly are good (Connelly is very good), but the story, taken in total, tells us nothing but a tale about the banality of media, particularly arty films. It is a beautiful film, with perhaps some of the greatest imagery shot in the last 20 years, that contains over-the-top stock characters.

","Putting aside the brilliant drug sequences, a surprisingly GREAT use of split screen shots, a perfectly honed musical score, and utterly superb acting, this film indulges those of us who enjoy wallowing in our own self-pity and hopelessness.  The emotions of each of the four major players was absolutely real and just too powerful at times, as never have I experienced a film that was able draw me in so drastically.  This film is not about sympathising for drug addicts (as many of you prematurely enjoy claiming), but about raising an awareness of things people desire and want, and ultimately how they may affect us if we allow them to control ourselves.<br/><br/>Other films claim they have pushed the envelope with their pretentious plot-lines and explicitly gratuitous visuals, but Requiem actually delivers in a very progressional and extremely natural flow.  This film isn't preoccupied with shock value, but instead keeping a certain level of integrity that other films miss when dealing with such subject matter as substance abuse and withdrawal.  You feel just as useless and pointless as the four players do, and at times...it hurts just to look at them.<br/><br/>Whatever, I'm assuming you know the plot-line and have read other reviews to get to this one, so I'll keep this wrap-up short:  This movie is beyond comparing to any other, and it would be wrong to catagorise it in any specific genre.  All of those cynical critics that claim that Requiem is the shell of it's predescesors are...well...wrong, but some people insist on living their lives in a constant state of an emotional flatline.  I have never seen a film quite like Requiem, but if any future films have the ability to hit me harder than this one, I will most likely die from sheer bliss."

If you ever wanted to do drugs or have done them, after you see this you will never look at a needle or a blunt or even a cigarette ever again!!! Every teenager should see this movie. After I left the movie I was shaking. The plot is simple. It takes place during a whole year, broke up season by season. It begins in the summer. There are 4 main characters- A mother (Ellen Burstyn) who loves her son and is still mourning her dead husband. She lives all alone in her apartment. Well, she gets a call to appear on tv and that's when it starts to go down hill for her. Wanting to lose 50 lbs and fit into an old red sexy dress, she goes to the doctor for diet pills.. aka- Speed. Then there is her son (Jared Leto) who is on his way to become a junkie with his friend (Marlon Wayans) who deals and also does drugs but not to the extent for his friend. Then there is Jared's girlfriend (Jennifer Connoly) who is the daughter of a rich fashion district mogel who is in love with jared and the same goes for him. She also does drugs for fun. They come up with the idea that if they start to sell drugs, they will be able to make money and become something. From here the story moves fast through each season to their final downfalls. NO matter what anyone says, this movie is incredibly real, almost like a documentary. The acting was incredible. They all did fantasic jobs but the most surprising of the bunch was Marlon Wayans. He really can act with being foolish or joking. Ellen Burstyn will be nominated for an oscar. All these 4 actors should. You must, MUST see this movie. It is very disturbing but so real and sad. You feel for the characters because they are all people you would like. They just want happiness in their lives and to live for something. Unfortunately they think drugs are the way. If I was a teacher in a health class I would show this uncensored depiction of how drugs can ruin people with such promise and hope. See it!"

","This is a dream piece, and while there is a linear exposition of a plot, the way to enjoy it is to take it for what it is, a dream, or a spook-house ride. Dreams have a staccato, flanging progression, with big, loud highs and ominous languid lows. The feel of a long unending nightmare is achieved superbly, with characters as caricatures, sensations as icons exploding, and time warped at roller coaster pace, with, not incidentally, the Coney Island Cyclone as constant backdrop. I'm not sure I approve of all those Wasp actors portraying Brighton Beach Jews, as it did draw attention to the fact that we were watching something put on and unreal, but even that is not inconsistent with the quality of nightmares. The point that we are all addicts, in one way or another, is well made, and the dream, despite its amusement park ridiculousness, is always a bit too real. Burstyn deserves a special Oscar for allowing herself to look like death in such horrific close-ups."

I thought that I would never be shocked after seeing Happiness but I was wrong. The commentary, or better yet, the comparisons between addictions was amazing. This is not a movie about the effects of heroine. It is about something more than that. It made me see things in myself and in my friends that I never would have seen. It felt like I ran right into a brick wall and before hitting my head on the concrete beneath me as I fell backwards I caught a glimpse of who I was. I was not very different from Harry, or his girlfriend, or his mother. Do I do heroine, or am I addicted to diet pills? No, but that does not mean that I too do not suffer from addiction or the ideal of the ""American dream.""<br/><br/>Images from this movie have stayed with me and I believe they will always be apart of me. I have never been so shocked and disturbed as I was during the scene with Harry's girlfriend at the end of this picture. The way that it was filmed was brilliant. It depicted the horror of what was going on without really showing what was going on. It was done tastefully, or as tastefully as a scene like that could be. Will I ever see this movie again?

The cast gets very high and I mean very high marks: Ellen Burstyn's name should `pop' up in the best actress oscar nominee list, Jared Leto's formerly mediocre `so-called' acting is now a thing of the past because of his extraordinary performance, Jennifer Connelly not only stimulates us with her beauty but also demonstrates that her acting skills are not of a hallucinogenic nature, and Marlon Wayans  shows us in living color that he could also be a pretty good dramatic actor.

","Hulbert Selby Jr.'s  underrated ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"" portrayed self-destructive characters with no escape from their eventual fate.    In Selby's ""Requiem for a Dream"",  director Darren Aronofsky revisits the same territory with an engrossing cast and an ingenious array of camera tricks that work up to a point before things clearly get out of hand.  Whereas ""Last Exit"" knew when to back off, in ""Requiem"", we are tortured with excesses that overstate the premise of the film.  The final nerve-racking denouement ruined this film just as a similar technique doomed the over-the-top ""Natural Born Killers"".  It didn't have to be this way. ""Requiem"" built up the four main characters (Sarah Goldfarb who imagines being on the same infomercial she is constantly watching, her son Harry, girlfriend Marion, and buddy Tyrone who imagine raking in riches from selling drugs if only they weren't hooked on it) as they each ride the wave of their addictions before crashing violently down.  It used split screen to show the devious son trying to steal his mother's TV while she is locked in her closet afraid to come out; or another time to show the sensual caressing touches of Marion and Harry.  It used the imagined world to show Harry and Ty toying around with a policeman that they could not do in real life or Marion putting a fork into the hand of lecherous Arnold when she really had to submit to his grasp.  And in the case of  Sarah, the imagined and the real became virtually the same when the commanding refrigerator dictated all her actions. We even see rapid sequencing used to show the mundane act of getting up in the morning or Sarah swallowing up her skimpy diet of eggs and grapefruit or the final, maddening act when all four go down the sewer in quick succession. Ellen Burstyn's Sarah comes across initially as interesting and appealing, then as sympathetic, and finally as repulsive. She deserved better.  She must have identified with Linda Blair from ""The Exorcist"" after the stunning makeover from a prim eccentric widower to a drug-crazed, fiendish looking psychotic.  Sadly, ""Requiem"" went beyond sensibilities to try to make a point.  After a while, you wanted to tell director Aronofsky that enough is enough."

His follow up to the psychological thriller, ""Pi,"" and though a difficult feat, he has made an even more superior film, brilliant in every aspect.  I'm sure you have read other reviews and heard people talking about the story of the film, I will not go into that.  The story has been done before, drug addicts spiraling out of control to their eventual demise.  The film's brilliance, however, does not lie within the story, but within the way it's told.  The cinematography helps the film, and though gruesome in points, you cannot take your eyes off of the screen.  The spiraling overhead shots, the dark lighting, the simple but intriguing sets.  The excellent, fast-paced editing makes you not even want to blink, knowing that you will miss something (If this film does not win Best Editing, it should be considered a crime).  From the beginning, watching the simple characters' lives slowly fall apart until the shocking and non-stop beautifully disturbing climax, you cannot take your eyes off of ""Requiem for a Dream.""  Whether that's a good thing, I'm still not sure. I regret seeing the film, but I'm so happy I did at the same time.  It's those mixed feelings that make this film such a masterpiece.  I've read so many reviews about this film, talking about how everybody is dead silent at the end, still too shocked to speak a word.

Much will be made of the editing style, but in the director's capable hands, the technique isn't pretentious or excessive-it is merely unforgettable.

","""Requiem for a Dream"" - what a beautiful title, I thought when I went to see this movie. I knew nothing about it in advance, but the title was enough in itself to make me want to see it. And what an experience it turned out to be... The three main characters all have dreams; but, as so often happens, these dreams are confronted with harsh reality. In this case, a reality so harsh that the movie could end up nowhere else than in a death mass for those dreams. To accompany these three persons from the bright days of summer, through autumn, to the icy cold of winter was dramatic indeed. At the end of the movie, the smile on my lips had been replaced by a grimace of pain, and the tears that ran down my cheeks had been drawn out by an almost physical pain in the heart.

","After reading a few positive reviews and noticing ""Requiem for a Dream"" on several Top Ten lists, I went into the film with high hopes.  Even after a good digestion of the film, I was generally disappointed with the screenplay and skin-deep messages from the film.  Sure, the directing and acting were top notch, but when it comes down to whether or not the whole movie was quality, one cannot avoid the plot.<br/><br/>How many times do we need to watch another supposed landmark film about drug addiction?  It's been done over and over again each time pushing the limit on grotesque scenes to make the audience cringe.  Rarely are horror films regarded as break-through for their blood and guts scare tactics, so why should a drama be?  Moreover, Requiem left nothing to the imagination during the film or after the closing credits.  Listen critics, there was nothing there, it's not deep, it's not satirical, it's just a good director, some quality actors, and an unoriginal wannabe screenplay writer adding some decent cinematography to cover-up the awful writing.<br/><br/>I can't attack this film too much though because the Aronofsky was able to use his creative genius to warp this film into something worth watching just for his directing.  Without Aronofsky, this film would have been another....oh wait, critics love all movie with mind-twisting drugs involved.  Sure, there is a time and place for tripped out scenes or even films revolved around the subject itself.  Apocalypse Now and Traffic are two of my favorite films.

","Requiem for a Dream is a visual and aural feast combined with an excruciating punch in the gut.

The performance by Ellen Burstyn as the mother was both convincing and agonizing.<br/><br/>Most of the films reviews miss the poetic nature of the film. To stand back and view the film without analyzing the minute details reveals a palette of visual and audio techniques never seen packaged in quit this way. The infatuating music by the Kronos string quartet in the background gave an exciting rhythm to the proceedings. The act of getting high depicted by a quick aural and visually magnified sequence lent just the right focus to the process of assimilating the drugs, i.e., a routine act of getting were you want to be. The scenes cutting from characters to character was typical in the beginning, but as the film neared its climax became a throbbing and sickening process that left you shaken and generally glad it was over.<br/><br/>I hate drug movies and would not have gone to this movie if I had not been unaware of its content.

Ellen Burstyn is superb and the next time my fridge starts making strange noises I'll call in an exorcist instead of the electrician. We always knew Jennifer Connelly was one of the most beautiful women around; we should all look this good when strung out, but the extension to her acting range with this role has been quite a surprise. The cinematography is excellent and the techniques for distorting reality and experiencing the rushes and the subsequent downs is exhilarating, if that's the right word.

","I'm not one who normally reads reviews for anything, let alone writing them, but after traveling 120 miles round trip to see this film because my small college town isn't showing it has driven me to comment.  No pun intended. I was thoroughly impressed with the camera work and stylization in Aronofsky's PI, and was so again with REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, but the tones of the two movies could not be farther from each other, which was to be honest a rude awakening as this film progressed.  In no way do I attempt to compare the two stories, as I would find difficult to do, however, I was shocked at the film I saw a few hours ago.  I can't remember the last time I was this disturbed by a film.  If you're looking for reasons not to let an addiction take hold of your life, then by all means, take a seat.  I of course have not met Darren Aronofsky, but I pray he has not personally experienced the tribulations of addiction that he superbly conveys in his film.  The fear of need, the anticipation of the next fix, the temporary comfort, the physical effects, the repetition, the mental fixations, the denial, the repetition, the disregard for one's self, the repetition, and the gradual breakdown that a person experiences hits you harder than the bad dream that is these character's lives.  The images in my head after seeing this film will stop me from practicing ANYTHING in excess for a long, long time, and hopefully forever.  As I mentioned earlier, the camera work grabbed me just as much as the performances of these actors, and the shots along side the editing and sequences of images brings the story so close to the thought patterns of the mind it's no wonder I was disturbed.  This film thinks with you."

","After reading various comments on the film, I read a comment stating that the films only apparent message is 'say no to drugs.' I have to ask this question: why on earth did these characters begin using in the first place? Look at Sara for instance: her life revolved around the TV. Upon hearing she is going to actually be on TV, she becomes obsessed with looking perfect, fitting into the ideal dress. She can't restrain herself, because us spoiled americans rarely have to live on limited means, and ends up on miracle pills to help her lose the weight, rather than use self control. This film is a commentary on material culture as a whole. Why does Harry sell drugs? To make money to buy ""stuff."" Well, yes, sometimes that stuff is more drugs, but he buys his mother a large screen TV, as if that would make her happy. These characters have no understanding of how to achieve happiness. And how can they in this world that tells us that purchased goods equal happiness? So to limit the film to anti-drug propaganda or what not is utterly ridiculous. This is a brilliant film criticizing not drugs, but culture. As Tyrone's mother tells him, I don't want you to make it rich (in so many words), I just want you to love your mother. I may be exaggerating my point, but please see this film for something more than surface value."

","**Warning: spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>At basis, this is a pretty simple sort of drug film. It depicts the lives of four people, and how drugs are instrumental in their downfall. One loses sanity; another loses innocence and self-respect; another loses freedom; another loses an arm. The message is hardly subtle: drugs can mess you up. Well, duh.<br/><br/>Three of these characters fall into destructive drug use in the ordinary, expected way: through escalating recreational use. More interesting is Ellen Burstyn's character, who instead naively allows herself to become dependent on amphetamines in order to lose weight for a television appearance -- an appearance we, as the audience, of course know will probably never happen, but which gives her otherwise meaningless life new hope.<br/><br/>
It's a shame, really, that her character wasn't given primary focus in this film. For her, drugs are simply the incidental means to fulfilling some deeper desire rather than an end in themselves. She doesn't self-destruct because she wants to get high, but simply because she wants some reason to feel alive again. Much more could have been done with this idea if the movie hadn't been too busy showing the other characters' more routine kinds of addiction.<br/><br/>This movie really doesn't stand out as a particularly poignant or interesting drug film, then -- certainly nothing to rival, say, Traffic. Where it does stand out is in technical excellence. The filmmaking is so perfect it is nearly sublime; if the movie fails in having a new or interesting message, it certainly succeeds in imparting its message with stylistic force.

Personally, I don't feel this was the directors intention, and I wouldn't consider this as much of a drugs movie, as it is more of a full-scale drama about the loss of hope.  The plot revolves around four people, Sarah, Harry, Marion, and Tyrone, who each have their own sense of innocence and each have personal dreams about their futures at the beginning of the movie.  The three youth have already experimented with drugs and their addictions only strengthen as the movie moves along, making the relationships more tense and the dreams further away.  The older Sarah is especially a touching character, as she doesn't learn she is taking speed until she is addicted, eventually becoming a slave to the pills and becoming what Harry had warned her about.  Aronofsky put together a perfect compilation of scenes for the climax at the end of the film and capped it all off with the final Tappy Tibbons scene that just left me feeling so empty I was ready to cry.

It's a powerful movie and a bit difficult to watch at times, but it's worth the ride to go down with these characters to depths from which they will never emerge.  All the performances are solid, but Ellen Burstyn gives the performance of her life as a woman who just wants to wear a red dress that reminds her of more hopeful days.  Jared Leto -- where did he come from? -- gives an equally impressive performance as her totally hapless drug addicted son. This movie is a great antidote to morally bankrupt films along the lines of ""Trainspotting"" that portray serious addiction as glamorous.

","Like the three young actors who star in it, this is a good looking film and the director has done a great job with what is, in my opinion,  an unremarkable storyline.  The music video style may seem at odds with the serious message of the film, but I think that  this is the only way the director could inject (pun probably intended) some interest into an uninspiring plot. We all know about the dangers of drugs and the comparison between  addiction to illegal and prescription drugs is one that has been made plenty of times before so I think that any film about drugs/addiction made these days needs to offer something more.<br/><br/>I don't think that you necessarily have to care about characters in a film, but you at least have to be interested in them.  Whilst the mother is a fairly sympathetic character (and fantastically acted), her fate is pretty obvious from the start, so seeing her pop pills soon becomes boring and the other three characters are weak, in particular the girlfriend Marion who is nothing more than a series of cliches.   I lost interest in all of them for the middle section of the  film and although the sheer brutality of the climax drew me back in, it didn't compensate for the boredom that had gone before - perhaps this is a comment on the boring repetitive nature of addiction, but it doesn't make good cinema, no matter how fancy the editing techniques are.<br/><br/> Comparisons have been made with Trainspotting, which to me is a far better film, not only because the characters are more realistic and interesting, but because its portrayal of drugs is more honest, showing that people take drugs for pleasure and not always end in tragedy.

","In the most violent, destructive, and emotionally gripping manner, Darren Aronofsky (and Hubert Selby Jr.) has managed to make sure, that I, Garry Tsaconas, will never even go near drugs in my entire life.<br/><br/>The whole objective of this film was to give the viewer a direct observation as to how drugs (in this case, heroin and cocaine) can basically lead you from a high Utopia, into the final steps before death. (***Spoiler Alert Starts***) What was interesting about the movie was that none of the main characters die. They all end up at the lowest points in their one-decent lives, and can barely hang on to life anymore . When Harry (Leto) has lost his arm at the end of the movie, how many people walked out of the theatre and said, ""B.S.!!!! That's not possible?"" Think again.

Period (***Spoiler Alert Ends***).<br/><br/>The acting, I must say, was excellent on behalf of all four main characters. I was very impressed at what I saw, especially since they worked with such a deep script. Marlon Wayans, for a typical comedian, managed to pull off an above-average performance. Jared Leto pulled a sweet job in this flick, nailing down an accurate Coney Island accent (although I'm not from Coney Island nor have I ever been there, the topic is up for discussion). Jennifer Connely did an alright job, but she wasn't up for any type of praise, I'd say. Ellen Burstyn carried about 50% of this movie. She does have talent, and she sure knows how to give you an impression or two. I can understand the whoop-lah of Julia Roberts getting the Best Actress nod at the 2001 Academy Awards, but she hadn't of been involved, I swear, Ellen Burstyn would've taken out the competition. <br/><br/>As for the directing and the cinematogrophy, it sure captured the detail that was needed to show the effects of this film. Dual-screen shots, quick-action sequences to show what the viewer already knows (i.e. someone either shooting up, sniffing coke, popping pills, or simply eating food), and certian angles and shots that controlled the entire room, all for the viewer.<br/><br/>'Requiem For A Dream' was not easy to watch.

","The off-puttingly titled Requiem For a Dream is the second feature from Darren Aronofsky who made his debut with 1998's Pi, a dark tale of mathematics, madness and mysticism. The enduring image from Pi was that of spirals. Requiem examines another spiral - the inexorable descent of addiction.<br/><br/>The film, set in present day New York, tells the story of Sara Goldfarb (Oscar-nominated Ellen Burstyn), a plump middle-aged widow who spends most of her time watching television and, after receiving a promotional phone call, becomes convinced that she is to appear on it. Meanwhile, her wayward junkie son Harry (Jared Leto) and his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) attempt to set themselves up as drug dealers with partner-in-crime Tyrone (Marlon Wayans).<br/><br/>Whilst remaining generally faithful to Hubert Selby Jr's 1978 novel, Aronofsky litters the film with a dazzling array of visual flourishes. The split-screen effect which he uses to introduce us to Sara and Harry Goldfarb suggests a little heavy-handedly the divide which has grown between mother and son. For the most part, however, he employs audacious technique to uncommonly good effect. The repetitive cycle of addiction is echoed in brisk montages of pill-popping, TV-tuning, joint-rolling and shooting up. Requiem's increasingly frenetic camerawork and editing mirror the skewed vision of its ever more drug-crazed protagonists, whilst its evocative string score brings out the tragedy of their lives.<br/><br/>Requiem has been accused of perpetuating heroin chic, but the beauty of the young addicts and Sara's pathetic attempt to slim down for her imagined TV appearance merely emphasise the hollowness of the beautiful shell. What shines through is the humanity of the characters, thanks to touching performances, in particular from Burstyn who gives the most haunting and unforgettable performance of the year.<br/><br/>What sets Requiem apart most from other junkie movies such as Trainspotting and Drugstore Cowboy is that it is utterly unrelenting. This is no road to Damascus - the only light at the end of the tunnel is the shaky fluorescent bulb at the end of the hospital corridor. Happy endings only happen in the facile daytime TV trash that Sara consumes as compulsively as the diet pills to which she becomes addicted. Rather than offering redemption or hope, the dénouement strips the characters entirely of what little dignity they may have retained as the world around them looks on with cold indifference.<br/><br/>As the film reaches its conclusion, the quick-cut montages gain in speed and the sounds are intensified. The result is a full scale assault on the senses that builds up into a crescendo of pure cinematic horror. Requiem has left audiences trembling. This is not an entertaining film - it is an ordeal. But it will remind blasé and complacent audiences that although now habitual parts of everyday life, drugs have not lost their power to destroy lives and cinema, when it doesn't compromise itself, has not lost its ability to shock."

","This movie's story isn't particularly fabulous (in fact, it's pretty one-dimensional) but I still found myself enthralled with the film.  The main draw for me was the frenetic, machine-like editing and clever foley sounds used during the ""unhealthy habit"" sequences.  Few films have impressed me as greatly in terms of final effect; the nightmarish spiral engaged by the characters will stay with you, almost hauntingly, long after you watch Requiem For a Dream."

","There's a lot to like in this movie.  Afonwhatever's style keeps things moving and peppy but sometimes you have to ask ""why?""  Why do MTV style fast-forward shots of turning off the television and popping pills OVER and OVER?  There's apparently little meaning behind it - it's just a piece of visual flash.<br/><br/>Second the shock value is effective but tired.  The good girl gone bad and then having sex with black men thing is cliche at this point.  We saw it in Traffic.  Of course, they're always gross, nasty black men, right?  Gimme a break.<br/><br/>Much rawer than trainspotting, this film leaves out most of the style elements.  The choice of location - Coney Island - is perfect to this end.<br/><br/>That said, the real genius of this flick is how despite the main characters' additions things seem more or less under control for 2/3 of the film, in some ways even prosperous.  The drugs are shown as recreational and stress relieving.  But without any warning to them, or the viewer, we quickly realize that things are definately not in control.  And if you watch the film again you would be hard pressed to point to a particular scene where things pass the point of no return.<br/><br/>Hopefully this film will make a few conservative ""it's your own fault/why don't you just quit?"" types think twice before they condemn a social outcast or someone addicted to drugs."

","I rented this video, not knowing too much about it, except that it stars one of my favorite actresses: Ellen Burstyn.  Ellen was her usual extraordinary self.  But what I experiencee was one among the most engrossing movies of the year!  The acting is phenomenal, especially Ellen and Jennifer Connelly. The guys, Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans, were none too shabby too.  But the ""star"" of the movie has to be the director, Darren Aronofsky, whose creative and original visuals (camera angles, split screen, closeups, assorted characters, surprises, etc.) made this movie absolutely unique and compelling. Not a squeamish person, I nearly lost it during Sarah's(Ellyn Burstyn) shock therapy scenes and Harry's (Jared Leto, playing her son) final ""shooting up"" scene. Both were not only emotionally drenching but also extraordinarly painful scenes to watch.<br/><br/>This movie is the perfect antidote to the ""just say no"" crowd. Just watching the movie would probably discourage 99 percent of the kids from taking drugs. The movie also warns adults that they shouldn't be so smug about ""illegal"" drug taking when so many of them are hooked on perfectly ""legal"" drugs.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this super charged, emotionally draining movie.

It draws you in with stunning visual aspects seldom seen in the played out mainstream movies and holds you with the simplistic yet haunting soundtrack.  The story itself is mesmerizing, showing how addiction (and addiction is the true theme of the movie, rather than drugs) destroys the lives of its victims. As it states on the back, the characters quest for and refusal to let go of their respective versions of happiness results in ""a nightmarish, gut-wrenching freefall."" To be able to say that this movie literally leaves you emotionally shaken is a testimony to its power, even in today's society, where there is little that were aren't desensitized to.

","Well, what can I say other than this was one of the best films I have seen this year (along with; 15 Minutes, Final Fantasy, Hannibal, Pearl Harbor and Planet of the Apes).<br/><br/>The story concentrates on the lives of four people who are effectively drug addicts, following them through the highs and lows of their lives.  It demonstrates that no matter who you are, what age, whatever lifestyle you're from, drugs will change your life forever.  The film is very graphic at times and may not be everyone's cup of tea - you couldn't sit down and watch it with your parents, but maybe I'm wrong?<br/><br/>Sometimes you can't help but feel sorry for the characters, their desperate need and moral descent.  Unlike most American films, this doesn't have a happy ending, there are no heroes, no real villains, just everyday next door type people living their lives the only way they know.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film for it's straight down the line rawness, it was a bit slow to begin with, but before you know it you are really feeling for the characters, and intrigued as to what will happen next.  It appears to be quite a low budget movie, but the camera work intensifies each situation so realistically you won't be disappointed - you don't need expensive special effects.<br/><br/>In short, the message the story is trying to get across is don't do drugs, if you are going to, face the consequence.  I will definitely be keeping an eye out for future releases by Darren Aronofsky."

I was stunned by the film makers' abilities to convey the feeling of gradual distortion and loss of control, caused by chemical addiction. It was a very harrowing ride. This film (probably more than any other I have seen recently) blurs the boundary between representation of experience and experience itself. Very powerful.

","This movie suffers from overwhelming obviousness. ""Drugs are bad"" seems to be the great enticing message of Requiem for a Dream. I walked out of the theater feeling greatly disappointed and almost chanting its Nancy Regan mantra. Anybody that has even once ridden a bus in a city bigger than Topeka knows how drugs can ruin a person's life, but Aronofsky insists on directing a film that is little more than ""reefer madness"" with better cinematography.<br/><br/>Granted this film is visually stunning, even groundbreaking at points. And the cast does a stupendous job of giving the script's transparent and two dimensional characters a chunk of humanity, but in the end this movie is nothing more that thinly veiled propaganda picture. If Aronofsky wanted to make a film that spoke honestly about drug culture he should have looked at some of Gus Van Sant's or Harmony Korine's work. A film with a message has a lot more power if it does not try to be a cold halibut smacking you across the face. Pi made me weep, Requiem for a dream just made me cry.<br/><br/>

For those of you out there who have seen Aronofsky's first film Pi, you will notice a lot of cameos and small roles for actors from it, Sean Gullette as Harold sticks out in my mind. I liked his character in Pi, but here he was just repulsive and the scenes with him showed what lengths Jennifer Connelly's character (Marion) would go to for cash/drugs. The fact that Darren Aronofsky's superb directing wasn't nominated for an Oscar really surprises me. His directing and film were even grittier than Traffic (while Traffic is also an amazing movie, Requiem got deeper into the downfall of addiction) and he deserved at least a nomination (if not a win). The Hip-Hop Montages, Snorricam and the drug use scenes were amazing. This film shows the horror of addiction to anything. After I watched this movie, it stuck with me.

The film itself, I must urge do not watch this movie alone! It is a film so brutally honest and so dangerous to simply watch without anyone being there for comfort. I watched it alone and when the film was over, I was in complete shock. There is only one other film that you might remotely relate this one to and that is Trainspotting, and that film doesn't even come close to the impact that Requiem For A Dream has. This film affects you in every way possible. It's visions haunt you while it's subject matter urges users to NEVER indulge again, and scares people who have yet to try drugs into never trying them. The actors all did a wonderful job. After seeing this I definitely think Ellen Burstyn deserved the best oscar over Julia Roberts, but I digress. Her and Jared Leto, I'm not too familiar with except for this film in which they both do a marvelous job. What happens to this mother and son is heart-wrenching.(I couldn't believe that Burstyn's character went that far into her addiction). Connelly and Wayans were the two actors that I had been familiar with going in, and I was amazed at their performances as well. It's a shame that this film was not nominated for best picture.

","REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is such an important film that no award or accolade can justly honor the people who have put so much into its making. I was so profoundly affected by this movie that I doubt I will see a more important film to come out this year. I will not say much on the plot only because I think many of the user comments have already referred to it. Nevertheless, I think certain aspects of the plot in REQUIEM should be commented on. Primarily, I like how the movie speaks of a greater tragedy. Rather than limiting the movie's theme to an anti-drug message REQUIEM FOR A DREAM shows how addictions (be it drugs, television, etc...) shatter dreams and goals. The ability to create something good, anything good, is one of the greatest gifts a person can possess. When we reduce our lives to the rituals of addiction, and its destructive results, we destroy our capacity to create better lives for ourselves. In this film we see so much potential for these people to have something better. Their quick decline results in some of the best acting ever committed to celluloid. Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly all give career-best performances. I have seen very few movies that have actually made me think seriously about my own life. I can honestly say that I think this film has made me a better person and I would like others to benefit from this movie as well. One of the best statements on the quick decline."

","There are two establishments that have me thoroughly confused.  They are the MPAA ratings board and The Academy Awards.  First, a gruesome, disgusting gore-fest titled ""Hannibal"" gets an R-rating, which, in essence, allows children of any age to see it (with a parent, granted). Yet ""Requiem for a Dream"", which shows very graphically the potential horrors of drug use, and which should be seen by teenagers, was threatened with an NC-17 rating, barring anyone under 17 from seeing it at all.  The film was eventually released as unrated.  Secondly, I cannot begin to understand how ""Requiem for a Dream"" wasn't even nominated for a Best Picture Oscar in a year when that award was actually won by a such a mundane piece of rubbish as ""Gladiator"".  And probably an even bigger travesty is that Ellen Burstyn's performance in this film, a performance of a lifetime, lost out to the ho-hum, no-effort work of Julia Roberts in ""Erin Brockovich"".

His earlier work, Pi, was completely his baby and totally under his control. With Requiem, he had to adapt someone elses work yet still maintain his artistic integrity. If there are any doubts whether or not indie filmmakers are truly talented, please lay it to rest. The content of the film (incl. EXCSESSIVE DRUG USE, betrayal, deceit, lust, family, hope, failure, and utter physical and mental anguish) were juxtaposed insanely with fast editing, sweet camera work, and a visual style that no mere human being could ever dream for in a film. But the performances in this film were truly, truly magnificent all across the board. Jared Leto - crazy! Jennifer Connoley - reached Julianne Moores exceptional talent, and may very well have exceeded it under the circumstances! Marlon Wayans - utterly stunning in his portrayal as the straight-man role, no jokes, no silly sight gags, just very awesome dramatic power! Ellen Burstyn - whatever pre-conceptions i had towards her performance (i think the academy awards are more corrupt than american politics) were washed away when i experienced first hand the true genius of a disciplined actress who was so utterly committed to her role that i had to constantly remind myself that this was Reagan's mother in excorcist so many years ago.

"giancarlorocks","Null","0","0","19 August 2001"," A relentless and raw film that must be seen
","It would be a grave error to call Darren Aranofsky's Requiem for a Dream' a mere drug film. This thought-provoking and visually stylistic film represents much more than simple addiction. The addiction in question can be anything from hope, television, money and drugs. Aranofsky accomplishes this transfer of knowledge from the screen to the viewer through an incredibly groundbreaking method of visual techniques and trickery, which result in a guilty and confusing mind-trip that will stay with the viewer long after the film is over. Requiem' traces the complex characterizations of four richly developed characters in their quest for possible redemption and salvation. Ellen Burstyn plays Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widowed elderly woman fixated on losing weight. While Jared Leto plays her estranged junkie son; Harry, while Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans play Harry's girlfriend and best friend in crime respectively.      The interesting thing about this film is that for the first twenty minutes the viewer is entranced in a myriad of character development that ultimately leaves the viewer breathless and confused. Yet, we still watch because we want to find out what happens to these poor souls on their ill-fated journeys. Each character has a specific journey that all come together in the end resulting in this film being a total trance for the viewer.      The drug sequences are exquisitely implemented and leave the viewer with a sense of disillusionment as if they had just injected themselves with the drug. Yet, the visuals do not stop there. Aranofsky uses plenty of split-screen action to convey the point; in my opinion that although these characters are all connected in a sense they still are all lonely, personable souls seeking something that lacks in their empty lives. Furthermore, this film is not only visuals - In looking at the film from a symbolic perspective, there are many subtle messages that can be discovered in the film, yet the ultimate message is hope and acceptance. These characters come to the gruesome realization that they all have none. Hope is something one creates, and without it, their lives are meaningless, therefore they are not accepted. This film will not please everyone; it is edgy, graphic, and coarse in content. This film does not hide the fact that it deals with some harsh subject matter that is touchy to some people. This film clearly states that for some people  life sucks, and there is no hope.  For example, Burstyn gives an incredible performance as a lonely widow who is addicted to television. One day she receives a call from her motivational TV guru to appear on his show. Seeing as she is overweight, her friend refers her to diet pills. Therein lies the journey into the descent of her misery. Slowly the viewer is pitted inside her mind as muffins appear in her dreams, her refrigerator sneaks up on her and well-cooked, tasty dishes mysteriously appear out of nowhere due to her fearsome appetite.  This is just one example of how well this film is made.      This is revolutionary filmmaking at its' best. Aranofsky has brought to life a great story bu Hubert Selby, Jr. and transformed into an intricate, complex and entertaining cinematic experience that captures the viewer from the first frame and does not let go until that final devastating frame.<br/><br/>Giancarlo's Rating: *** (out of four)"

","I saw an amazing film on DVD over the weekend.  I am still a bit shell shocked because it had such a profound effect on me.  I haven't seen a film like it for many years.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream has to be one of the finest films I have seen for a long time.  Basically a story about drugs, it follows to storylines; one a lonely widowed mother gets invited to appear on a game show and tries to lose weight so she can fit in her 20 year old red dress; the other, her drug addled son and his friends try to crawl their way up the drug food chain to become small time dealers to make their fortune.<br/><br/>To be sure, this film is not a pleasant experience.  Humour is hard to come by in this gritty, visceral, trippy 100 minutes.<br/><br/>The mother resorts to diet pills to get thin, and in the process becomes addicted and starts to go slowly mad; in her fevered mind the fridge won't stop attacking her, and she is addicted to a daytime television speaker/game show host who she slowly allows into her subconsious where reality and fantasy begin to blur.<br/><br/>Our little drug cartel starts off promisingly but after one failed deal the spiral of tragedy begins; they need to feed their own habit as well as sell the product and they are a group of 20 somethings with no self control.<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky uses every trick in the book to pull the visual feel of each scene - split screen is used to dazzlingly good effect and the sets and locations used exude a warmth that hide any possible budgetary shortcomings that I thought would be evident with this film.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn plays the mother with harrowing subtly and finesse; it is easy to see why she was nominated for an Oscar for this standout performance. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are both very good as the drug addled couple trying to make it big - they are very convincing.  The supporting role by Marlon Wayans is also very good but not given the full opportunity to shine like the other three.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is a movie that will leave a lasting effect on you.  10 out of 10."

","Cinema in general is rapidly becoming cheaper and more money driven.  The average film goers always head towards the movies that seem to have high budgets, big stars, and lots of advertising.  I don't remember ever hearing of Requiem for a Dream until the Oscar nominations came out.  It garnered an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, which led Arinovsky to make an edited R rated version and an unrated Directors Cut, which is what I saw.<br/><br/>This may be the most powerful film I've ever seen.  It kept me glued to the screen, despite the graphic and heart stopping visuals on screen.  There was actually one scene where I had to close my eyes, in a sickening moment when a junkie pushes a needle into his infected arm.  I was pretty shaken by the time the credits began to roll.  Every little tidbit that makes films great was done with perfection here.  <br/><br/>Darrin Arinovsky has proven to be a fully formed master at direction. Everything he does here increases the film's power immensely, such as split screens, different color hues, and surrealistic hallucinatory sequences. His way of showing a person using drugs with the extreme closeups is particularly effective.<br/><br/>The sound in this film is incredible.  Something that rarely gets mentioned about this film is the score, which is dark, tragic, and haunting, creating a perfect atmosphere for the events that take place.<br/><br/>The acting is truly amazing.  Jennifer Connelly and Jared Leto aren't the type you'd expect in their roles, but they perform very well.  Its easy to forget that you're watching Marlin Wayons in a serious role, he is surprisingly good.  Ellen Burstyn is simply phenominal in her role, giving the year's best performance.  Watching these four people rapidly deteriorate into miserable, pathetic junkies is depressing, but heartfelt.<br/><br/>I'd personally recommend that anyone 11 or over should watch this film.  Its the type of movie that should be shown in middle schools and high schools as an anti-drug video.  It shows how far into the gutter you might go if you try drugs.

","I rented the this film on videocassette last night, and the box prominently mentioned that this is the ""Edited Version"".  My first thought was that I was being cheated out of seeing the director's original ""unedited"" version by overzealous film censors.  After surviving one viewing of the film, I can only thank God for having mercy on my senses by not exposing me to the ""unedited"" version, as the ""Edited Version"" contained about as much as a person of ordinary sensibilities can probably stomach.<br/><br/>Having said that, ""Requiem"" is an amazing film on many levels, much better than Aronofsky's ""Pi"".  He creates in the audience a strong empathy for his characters, something that ""Pi"", despite its artistic innovations, was unable to do (at least to me).  Whereas Aronofsky's distinctive style in ""Pi"" often seemed to me to be little more than being different for the sake of being different, in ""Requiem"" he has refined his directorial techniques and used them in the service of telling a compelling and moving--though admittedly bleak--story.  He has also managed to coax amazing performances from all four of his lead actors.<br/><br/>Aronofsky manages to capture the repetitive aspects of addictive behavior in a way that I have not quite seen on film before.  Every time one of the characters gets his or her ""fix"", we are treated to a quick-moving series of images of the method of delivery, the internal effect, and the external effect of the person's drug of choice, which repeats each time that character takes their drug (a technique that reminded me of the ""bullet scene"" in ""Three Kings"", and of certain sequences in ""Fight Club"").  The musical score reinforces this feeling of mindless repetition, with sequences of a few notes--or at times, even one note--being repeated, conveying a sense of the automaton-like repetition that occurs with addictive behavior.<br/><br/>In a way, some of the themes in this film were similar to those explored in the more accessible ""Traffic"", though without even a hint of hope for resolution (e.g. (Possible Spoiler) Jennifer Connelly's character's addiction leads her to a situation very similar to one of the characters in ""Traffic"", but without anyone to rescue her).<br/><br/>Though the movie is only rated ""R"" and not ""NC-17"", it is a very strong ""R"" in terms of its cumulative psychological impact on the viewer. Nevertheless, no serious movie lover should miss this one - just be prepared to see something that will stick around in your brain and challenge your sensibilities."

","*MAJOR SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is not just another movie. Requiem for a Dream is right at or near the top of several lists: most intense, most disturbing, most depressing, most powerful... and, oh yeah, best of all time.<br/><br/>
I'm not saying that this movie is the number one, best movie ever made. It has some flaws, mostly minor stuff, but they exist. Maybe I'll bring them up later, if I'm not too tired after praising the unequivocal genius of Darren Aronofsky and, equally, Herbert Selby, Jr., who co-wrote the screenplay and authored the novel that begged the movie.<br/><br/>First of all, I have to comment on the split-screen technique. It is genius. I didn't think too much of it in the first scene, thought it was a little gimmicky but cool; but when Aronofsky split screened Marion and Harry on the bed, with one side on one of the characters' faces and the other on the small of the other's back, or the other's Adam's Apple, it made me shiver. The intensity of that scene, the power, the love I felt, I have never experienced in watching another movie. I have never felt the warmth of that scene outside of real life.<br/><br/>Must comment on the actors' performances as well - Ellen Burstyn, while somewhat annoying at times, turned in the performance of the year precisely because she was so annoying. I just started to crawl down in her hole with her when she started popping more than one pill at once - and it shocked me. Jared Leto, who I've never thought much of before, was also mesmerizing. The scene in the kitchen with he and Burstyn (when he wants to tell her about the TV and finds out she is doped up)is, IMO, the finest scene of the movie. The tension, the feeling that these characters - with help from Aronofsky - create is absolutely gutwrenching. I love it. Jennifer Connelly is superb as Marion, so believable even as she descends into the arms and den of Little John. And Marlon Wayans as Tyrone also does an excellent job, especially once he and Leto decide to take off to Miami - the scene in the car, ""600 miles from home"" is also one of the movie's best.<br/><br/>The attitude of this movie, the pacing, everything directorial, is perfect (thanks, Darren)... the script is mature and leaves just enough to the imagination. I love the way Aronofsky films the drug/coffee sequences... it got me thinking, hey, this isn't going to be that graphic. But all it does is hit you ten times harder when Leto shoots up in the car on the way down and you see his arm... and then you don't...<br/><br/>The only negatives... I thought Ellen Burstyn's story was far inferior to the story of Leto, Connelly and Wayans. If Burstyn did not turn in such an amazing performance I would have hit the fast forward button about ten times. And without her performance, there really was no ""other"" story besides the kids'. Here I think the script fails, spends too much time watching Burstyn descend, showing the same scenes over and over, when we just need PROGRESSION from her story. You'll notice Aronofsky only pulls out the ""gimmicks"" - flying food, a walking refrig, and the TV show in her living room - for her story. No such fluff for the other story. In fact, I hated the living room TV hallucination in the same way I hated the hallucinations in THE BIG LEBOWSKI... it detracts from an otherwise mesmerizing script.<br/><br/>Also at the end, the kids both end up in jail... i didn't get that... and Burstyn gets the shock treatment, which is graphic for the sake of being graphic. It doesn't add to the story. All the other graphic parts of the movie are totally necessary, totally realistic, except for that.<br/><br/>Loved it overall, can't recommend it enough if you can stomach it...<br/><br/>9.4/10"

This is not, however, a review forum for Pi.<br/><br/>
'Requiem' had been recommended to me by a few of my friends.  I rented it, and expected a similarly-directed movie to 'Pi'.  I was right, but I didn't know how right I was.  The scenes where there a quick cuts of the blood, the paper, the eyes, and other things were perfect.  The sound effects were amazing.  I was also very impressed with the use of the violin players.  The music added a lot.  Good performances all around by the cast, especially Ellen Burstyn.<br/><br/>I agree with others, this was a good movie, but not one of the best ever, or even for the year.  The directing was impressive, but DO NOT MISTAKE GOOD DIRECTING FOR A GOOD STORY.  I know that I have seen weaker stories, but I have definitely seen better stories about drugs.

Not so here, you are forced to sit through four gritty, ugly and depressing stories. You paid $8 for light-hearted escapism? Sucker! You get the reality you hate hearing about in the news thrown right in your face. This movie was never intended for the mainstream audience.

If all five of these hit the mark for me then I'm happy.  Here, not only do all five of these elements hit the mark, they blow the mark away.<br/><br/>Hubert Selby's story is simple, but all the more powerful for it. Aronofsky's visuals are as imaginitive and even more stunning than those seen is his debut, Pi.<br/><br/>Bjork said after acting in Dancer in the Dark that she never wanted to act again as the experience was too distressing; bear this in mind when you watch Ellen Burstyn's utterly convincing performance and you could easily forgive her for wanting to retire!  I have to wonder how Julia Roberts won the Oscar over Ellen Burstyn, Julia was good in Erin Brockovich, but Ellen's performance is in a different league.  Leto, Connelly and Wayans also give outstanding performances.<br/><br/>As well as fitting the movie perfectly, Clint Mansell's haunting soundtrack could well be the best techno-classical crossover album in the world. And finally, the ending... it's an ending so powerful it makes Taxi Driver look like a walk in the park.<br/><br/>All in all I'd recommend this film to anyone, especially those who fancy a good (metaphorical) kick in the head."

Darren Aronofsky's direction is nothing short of brilliant and it is a shame that a film as good as this doesn't receive more recognition from the acadamy when you have the likes of Gladiator scooping awards (which is undeniably a great film), this for me was a better picture.

Stunning performances from all (most notably Ellen Burstyn - words fail me) and Aronofsky's superb camera work (never intrusive, never lethargic, and not-quite-so-slick as to allow you to remember that this isn't real, it's a film) contribute to a sense of a complete loss of faith in the world in which we live. I sat down to watch it on a warm summers evening, fresh from a day of relaxing in the sunshine. I emerged at the end a twisted wreck of my former self, battered down, sleepless and horrified by the grotesque capabilities of mankind.<br/><br/>
This film raises arguments about censorship - although we have a longsuffering counsel authorised to qualify the amount of physical violence, sex, or swearing we can see on the screen, there is as yet no authority to protect us from the amount of emotional trauma a director can impose on his viewers. How far is it possible to go without (not to put to fine a point on it) actively scarring your audience? I resent being forced to see the world like this - surely things can't be all that bad?<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream, in my book, is blessed with the kind of crushing brilliance that consign it to the ""mustseeonce"" pile, along with Full Metal Jacket, The Deerhunter etc. I don't think I could stand another viewing. 9/10 - recommended with a HUGE health warning attached.

I don't think the intent of this film is to induce feelings of sympathy for these characters, we as adults suffer the consequences of our actions, but I personally felt a sense of despair after seeing this, and for that I give it a 9/10, few movies can do that these days.

After seeing what a great movie it really is, I'm disappointed that not as many people have experienced it. And for me, it was an experience. Not in a very long time have I been so engrossed in every scene that took place in a movie. It deals so closely with the pain and sickness of the characters that every thing that happens to them seems to in some way effect the viewer.<br/><br/>By no means is this a light film. Aronofsky's direction is masterful. There is a mixture of disturbing imagery, and the scenes themselves, filmed in a fast, jumpy manner give the illusion of raciness that those characters must be partaking in. It's a movie about addiction in its rawest form, and this movie does not pull any punches with the imagery and story.<br/><br/>It's not the most original concept. Movies about drugs and drug addiction have been around for ages, but never before has a movie been so well done and honest on the subject. The acting is incredible. Ellen Burstyn as the mother gives a frightful performance. It is an incredible thing when an actor gets so involved within his or her role that while watching it, you feel for that character and no longer believe it's just an actor doing their part. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connely deliver fine performances. Surprisingly enough, Marlon Wayans shows he can act (I admit I was worried when I was told that he was in this film, I was sure he would undermine the movie.) Everything about this movie is good.

","One of my favorite moments in cinema occurred when Cocteau's hero in Blood of the Poet desperately tries to rub off a pair of lips from the palm of one of his hands. Having rubbed the lips from the a portrait he has painted, the artist is told by the living statue in his studio that a scar like that is not that easy to remove. From there, the hero is thrust into a Kafkaesque dreamscape where he realizes that `sleeping or dreaming, the dreamer must accept his dreams.' There is such a sensibility in the new Aronofsky film, as characters seem to float between a harsh realities and dreamscapes.<br/><br/>If Darren Aronofsky is remembered for anything in the annals of filmmaking it will be for staging the definitive `drug movie.' It is a masterwork of cinema that manages to stage the act of drug use as a cacophonous act of self-destruction where the individual will scale the ends of a their seemingly shallow existence in order to further dissociate themselves from their self-imposed, pathetic lives.<br/><br/>Aronofsky goes for the jugular as he bombards the viewer with a dirty, lyrical pathos that is instantly reminiscent of the seemingly masochistic fashion that Paul Thomas Anderson greets his characters in the climax of both Magnolia and Boogie Nights. Take the final image of Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark and stretch that for nearly two hours and you have the gut-wrenching and harrowing effect of this film.<br/><br/>Manipulation is a word that is too easily thrown around when talking about films like this. Those who have suffered or have seen others suffer from the effects of addiction will no doubt find a very confrontational truth to this film. Aronofsky, whether personally familiar with the chaos of drug use, knows the desperation of the addict who seeks out the next fix like a vulture scavenging on a rotting corpse.<br/><br/>Eugene O'Neill's maternal figure in `Long Days Journey Into Night' was a sad, pill-popping woman who was hopelessly stuck in the past. Her only link to her drug-free past was a wedding dress lying quietly in her closet. Ellen Burstyn is that woman. Slowly wilting away in her Brooklyn apartment, her husband in his grave and her son catering to his growing heroine addiction, Sara Goldfarb finds herself compelled by the simple pleasures provided by a TV game show that promises self-actualization to its viewers in the form of fortune-cookie wisdom. One phone call later and the promise of being on the TV show has Sara shockingly falling into a vortex of self-imposed hatred as she desperately tries to fit into the red dress she wore to her son's high school graduation.<br/><br/>This is no dream that is being lived, but a self-imposed reality, and Aronofsky stages the descent into hell as an act of mourning. Clint Mansell, who orchestrated a phenomenal music for Aronofsky's Pi, creates some of the more dramatically effective crescendos imaginable; beautifully complimenting the journey these characters take into nothingness.<br/><br/>The final images of the film, focusing on the winter of the characters' lives, is admittedly extreme, but only in the sense that it spares the viewer nothing in showing them the degrading lengths people will go to, and the degrading end results that welcome them, at the hands of addiction. And when teachers instruct their students as to how to master the fine art of drama, let it be known that Ellen Burstyn will be remembered for having given one of the finest and most revelatory performances to have ever graced an image of celluloid."

The cinema finally takes their crack at it, and really there is no one better than Aronofsky to handle the task.  He seems to have less sympathy for the characters towards the end.

","I don't know where to begin on this one, folks. A truly remarkable film that explores the depths of addiction from the innocent beginnings to the tragic ends. I truly defy anyone to watch this film and not be affected in some way. The film, based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., revolves around Harry Goldfarb (brilliantly portrayed by Jared Leto), his mother Sara (an academy award nominated performance by talented Ellen Burstyn) his girlfriend Marion (the lovely and always wonderful Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend Tyrone (a serious role for Marlon Wayans). Each of them has their own addiction - Harry and Tyrone prefer heroin and speed; Marion loves the taste of cocaine; and Harry's mother suffers from addictions that many people ignore - sweets, television and eventually diet pills. Harry and his friends decide that the best way to get the drugs and all the money they need to sell it. Everything is going fine as can be for a group of drug dealers until their personal addictions and circumstances beyond their control take their toll, spiraling the young adults into a hell specially tailored to the choices they each have made. And it is a descent that turns the stomach and makes one glad that they have never hit rock bottom this hard. Meanwhile, Harry's mother learns she has been selected to appear on television and after unsuccessfully trying to lose weight to fit into her favorite red dress, a quack of a doctor subscribes diet pills to her - potent and highly addictive uppers. As she learns how wonderful they make her feel, she slowly begins to delve into a realm schizophrenia and hallucinations that grow increasingly more disturbing and tragic at each pill she takes. The film is a wonderful follow-up to Darren Aronofsky's debut ""Pi."" The film moves quickly, is beautifully photographed and directed. The climax of the film is a montage of some of the most disturbing and haunting visuals ever committed to film - a powerful visual assault than drives the viewer to the edge of their own sanity. You will not forget them. The soundtrack, most of which was performed by the Kronos Quartet, is perfect from the beginning sequence (where the quartet is tuning their instruments as if to begin an actual requiem) to the end of the credits. There is not one part of this film, before and behind the camera, that doesn't seem to have a proper place. ""Requiem"" is as real as it gets. This is a film you experience and as some critics have said, it is a film that forces you to want to look away but you find that you can't - and don't.<br/><br/>The DVD contains a remarkable Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound presentation, is in widescreen formats and contains deleted scenes, an in depth audio commentary by director-co screen writer Aronofsky, the director of photography, a behind-the-scenes documentary/making of, an interview with Selby conducted by Ellen Burstyn and many more extras that make it worthy of being added to any collection."

","I will point out that this review does contain what might be considered spoilers, although this raises the obvious question of whether there is even anything in A Requiem For a Dream which could be further spoiled. Not unlike Tarsem's ""The Cell,"" this over-baked melodrama's barrage of fancy visuals do nothing to hide the fact that it offers absolutely nothing new in the way of story-telling or characterization, and is at its core morally bankrupt. In terms of acting and character development, despite any hype you may have heard, the fact is that Requiem's characters are familiar movie cliches, and not very well-acted cliches at that (unless overly thick accents and histrionics are what pass for acting these days). As a realistic portrait of drug use, Requiem fails miserably. Arnofsky should have taken a cue from Alex Cox's ""Sid and Nancy"": only one hyper-stylized scene per drug drama, thank you. Anything more and the movie's sense of realism suffers, and what you have left is no longer a believable world populated with sympathetic characters, but merely elaborate set pieces to satisfy the director's ego. Not only does Requiem not work in any way as a gritty urban document, but its plot elements are so weak that as an anti-drug parable it is useless as well. Ellen Burstyn descends into an amphetamine-induced hysteria that is too maudlin for anything other than a parody. Can we at least hope that Requiem is the last movie to use the ""smeared lipstick as sign of psychosis"" convention? Jared Leto's losing an arm is not so much a consequence of his drug use but of stupidity; people can get infections from many things besides drugs after all. Most humans with an IQ of educable or above would have seen a doctor a bit sooner. Oh well, it's his arm. Jennifer Connelly's circumstances are even more absurd. Desperate for drugs, she is ""forced"" to sleep with ""Big Tim""(John Carpenter veteran Keith David). And of course as everyone knows, after making it with a black man it is just one small step before you're having greased-up-on-all-fours-lesbian-sex for the amusement of rich white guys in suits. The idea that a woman like Connelly had no alternative other than performing the most humiliating, debasing public sex acts in order to make money is so laughable that no one can possibly sympathize with her situation. Since Requiem founders as both slice-of-life genre movie and cautionary tale, the only reason it has left for its disturbing visuals is to be an exercise in excess. This film's transparent purpose, in the end, is merely to wallow in its own prurience. I give Requiem For a Dream one star out of... oh I don't know... it doesn't really matter does it?

","I'm not going to write a spoiler review for this,(although I usually do) simply because I want you to see this film!!!(by the way, avoid Hollywood Video and Blockbuster-they're carrying edited versions because apparently the film as Aronofsky intended it is 'too disturbing').<br/><br/>All I can say in an effort to keep this brief is that once again Mr. Aronofsky has produced a movie that is TRULY mesmerizing-as with Pi, I was unable to turn away for a second(even on some of the more graphic scenes - once you see it you will know what i'm referring to). Regardless of your stance on the drug issue, this is the true picture of heroin addiction-there is no room here for debate on whether it 'glorifies heroin' like some people tried to with Trainspotting(which i didn't understand-how could Trainspotting possibly depict a glamorous life as a junkie??? come on!!! oh yeah that really looks like fun when Renton attempts to retrieve his pills!)<br/><br/>ANYHOW I am without a doubt going to purchase this on DVD-it amazes me how much Aronofsky manages to completely immerse you in the story line, and rip your heart out without resorting to contrived Hollywood standbys of cute kids and the like. Some may complain this movie is graphic - yeah well that's REAL. The sheltered, ignorant masses of suburbia need to get a good idea of what absolute hell some people experience in their lives-and that it's not just the 'messed up youth of today' that have problems. You especially have to appreciate the depth of characters that is developed in order to give the viewer a feel of WHY people end up doing things like this to themselves."

Wouldn't it be great if Darren Aronofsky could take that hip, edgy, New York style of his and apply it to a good descent-into-hell story like, say, Trainspotting?  And while he's at it, maybe throw out all the playfulness that Danny Boyle brought to the subject matter?<br/><br/>Well, you're in luck.  Requiem for a Dream is all that and more.  Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and the luscious Jennifer Connelly put in marvelous performances as four New Yorkers each piloting their own plane crashes.

The over-the-top scenarios depicted in this film will be unlikely to deter people from experimenting with drugs: in 50 years it will take its place alongside the 1920s-era, unintentionally funny film ""Reefer Madness"" for its absurdity and poor research.  For example, the pupils of an individual mainlining heroin *constrict*, although the movie shows them *dilating* time and time again -- even though these scenes contain mesmerizing effects and quick cuts, they are factually wrong.

","I saw Requiem for the first time back in November, and I've seen it numerous times since that unforgetable initial viewing.  This masterpiece has left an indelible impression on me, and for this, I am truly thankful to Darren Aronofsky. For me, this film evokes passions and emotions that I've truly never felt before, and that's quite an accomplishment for a film. Throughout each viewing, I remain truly captivated and saddened by the downward spiral that the characters experience, courtesy of Aronofsky and author Hubert Selby, Jr..  Since many of the reviewers on this site have already included a synopsis of some sort, I will exclude any sort of summary, and will attempt to expand on the general mood of the movie, and how it is achieved.<br/><br/>
In an effort to convey the abject pain and despair his characters experience, Aronofsky tactfully and deftly employs just about every trick in the book. Each scene utilizes some sort of clever camera angle, and the colors he uses always seem to be congruous with the mood of the film: dark and dreary.  Actually, the aesthetics in general only serve to bolster the lightless depravity of Requiem.  Also, Aronofsky does a masterful job at squeezing out the absolute most out of every actor/actress in this production.  Contrary to what many people have posted, he does delve a little into each character (this is done in varying degrees), and while I couldn't empathize with any of the characters, I definitely did sympathize with their plight.  Finally,  Clint Mansel and the Kronos Quartet have added the most indefectible original score ever, in my opinion.  As great as the film is, it just would not be the same without the haunting, chilling music.<br/><br/>
So much more could be said, but as you can see, so many have already skillfully expounded their feelings in this forum.  I can only say that for me, no movie will ever elicit such powerful emotion from me again.  Even after numerous viewings, I am still completely spellbound by this well-crafted magnum opus.  I am not a fan of the Batman franchise, but it will certainly be interesting to see what Aronofsky can do with this sinking ship."

By far, this is probably the most disturbing drug film ever made, because director Darren Aronofsky pulls out all the stops, to make you feel as if you are participating in this drug induced nightmare. He intensifies it minute by minute of screen time, having you experience what these people are going through. A film like this, will not end on a happy note because it will scare you in the sense that you'll never want to see a needle. The performances are top notch. Jared Leto, trying to eschew his pretty boy image, is well cast as a loser with a dream to make money, along with Marlon Wayans (distancing himself from any kind of comedy) as his best friend. The most startling performance by far is Ellen Burstyn, in a role that should've won her the oscar, because it's unflinchingly sad. She plays a woman coming apart at the seams from the beginning, only to have drugs set them off. Jennifer Connelly is a strong actress who ends up whoring herself to make money for her boyfriend's business.

Using a number of techniques such as split screens,distorting lenses, slow motion, fast forward etc.he manages to literally transport us into the minds  of his characters and make us see everything through their distorted vision. This is coupled with one of the most powerful and black stories told on the big screen for a long time;Requiem is a study in the various forms addiction can take, from heroin to coffee to sugar to TV.Moreover it is a painfully accurate depiction of shattered dreams and dashed hopes, of the self delusion that spurs all of us to build our dreams and hopes around non existing chimeras and a powerful critique of the american dream of fame success and easy money. Those who dismissed the film as moralistic and didactic missed the point entirely, just like those who had dismissed Trainspotting(another excellent film)as being pro-drugs. The drugs in Requiem for a dream are the pretext Arronofski uses to talk about wider issues such as the nature of all addictions and the ravages that illusions and self delusions perpetrate on the human psyche.

","Imagine seeing the life of an addict through the addicts mind many have done it but not to this downfall depth. I was more then amused with this film in fact one might say i was intreguid that the film had nothing to hide. yet if it did it would make a great sequel. I am a very pickie movie watcher and to actually have nothing bad to say about the movie is a rarity. Stand out performances by the talented cast of actors yet one seemed to shine himself above the rest. Maybe its due to his comic relief in most movies but Marlon Wayans played a part that would have given me second thoughts on the direction of his acting career. The depth of his character seemed to keep everything glued on each scene he was in, a miraculously played part that deserved recognition. Jared Leto gave a astonishing portrayal of a Love so in depth that drugs couldent stop it, yet near the end it somewhat does. The dedication of the faces the actors kept during the movie is what captured me. The editor of this film gets my highest rating in interest i was in love with the way he used the scenes with drugs and made them so mystical i would need to try them to understand the feeling. Ellen Burstyn gave her best performance ive ever scene so good that me and associates of mine felt so sorry for her within the room you could hear ""aww poor thing"" she captured a part of my interest never caught before and for that main reason this film was more then good. It was societies life in its realest form believe or dont believe but its out there manifesting into our minds like a sweet song entitled""requeim for a dream."""

","There is not one bright spot in this movie, it is extremely depressing.  It shows the spiralling downward of different addictions told through the stories of a mother and son. the director really knows his job here, this must have been a very difficult movie to film, at times you feel the ""jonesing"" of the addicts looking for their next fix, hit, pill, this is how well it is done. The effects of speed, the infamous diet pill, is captured in a short spellbinding scene that must have taken forever to film. Ellen Burstyn had her Oscar stolen from her by the drones who voted for Julia.  In her performance here she is amazing, down to her walking, talking and electric shock therapy reactions through her slide to insanity. The other leads excel as well, particularly Jennifer Connolly, looking at the end like a ghost of her former self. It clearly depicts the hell of addiction - the love affair with the drug of choice takes over one's life so that all else is forgotten and the true degradation of the spirit begins.  Not since ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""The Lost weekend"" and ""Days of Wine & Roses"" has this been so well done. This director is going places. I have it a 7 out of 10 as the beginning is slow and took a while to engage me and also for the absolutely no hope of redemption depicted, even by a minor character."

","I do not want to write a proper review- pnly to say a few words on Arronofsky's picture REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.<br/><br/>Whe I rented this film- I expected a good film- not groundbreaking or Oscar best picture stuff. But when I watched it- I was so shocked by it's power and terror created something in me I had not felt ever before. The final minutes of the film are so shockingly powerful and horrific that I- who am desensitized to everything I've seen for the past long time- was disturbed. I don't get disturbed at films. When films want to disturb and they are good at just that- I am not disturbed- but I get the overall effect- so films don't lose their power. But REQUIEM FOR A DREAM not only disturbed me- it truly shocked and chilled me- I couldn't sleep. I was so disturbed- I hadn't felt that way EVER!!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Not ever have I been so moved and emotionally affected by a film or anything before. This film is best picture stuff- it should've tied with BEFORE NIGHT FALLS last year. Normally- it would've won- but Before Night falls was amazing too- though not in the same way.<br/><br/>For once in my life- I do not want to see a film just one more time (or a hundred, depending on how much I like it). REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is an amazing film, one of the best ever made. However, it's power and brilliance cannot stand up to it's terror. Absolutely groundbraking- but I advise you if you have not seen it never to see it. It may be one of the best films ever- but it just isn;t worth it- do not see this film.,"

","'Requiem for a Dream' is perhaps one of the most difficult films i have ever attempted to judge. Director Aronofsky is obviously a genius, and he has a way with actors that few can reproduce, especially when its complimented by such a perfect cinematic eye. But after viewing the film for the first time, it left me empty inside, no matter how much i wanted to empathise with the characters. Its almost as if the downward spiral became so much, part of my emotive brain switched off, and i stopped caring. This could be due to the climactic jarring music, which i felt brought me entirely out of the film, even though perhaps it was entirely necessary.<br/><br/>What can one say about 'Requiem?' Its powerful, dark, moving in places; but ultimately if it doesn't grip you, cold and perhaps even unnecessary."
"Boatmeme","10","0","0","4 November 2000"," The best movie that I only need experience once...
","...but will study many times on DVD.<br/><br/>Incredible. Not ignoring the first 30 minutes - when I was overly conscious of Aronofsky's technique and wondering why I care about any of these characters - this movie was my reality for its running time and a short period afterwards. Its effect on me was akin to the drugs its characters relentlessly sought, shot, and swallowed throughout. It was a rough drive home.<br/><br/>I can see how this could be the type of film to fly right over people's heads, or at least make them want to go home and scrub down real good. There's not much to say for a cohesive narrative here. So it would seem after one viewing. Really, a viewer must sink into the seat and under the skin of this film, though two things do make themselves apparent on the surface: Ellen Burstyn's praiseworthy - if there are words - portrayal of a lonely mother/widow and the tight coupling of sound and editing. But, you've probably already read about both of those.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of PI, you'll see a few familiar faces here in Sean Gullette, Mark Margolis, Samia Shoaib. Some of Aronofsky's stylistic continuity from PI to Requiem includes: the way the characters are shown to take drugs...flash-cut and up-front sound -=BOOM=- new reality, shots with that custom-made camera attached to the actors (I forget what its called), the blood splatter towards the end, and again, as evidenced by the drug scenes and the intense final act, a profound integration of sound and visual editing.<br/><br/>There's plenty of new stuff here, too. Honestly, I DO have to see it again in order to take myself out of the movie and analyse a bit. Its that immersive. I recall the gradual changes in lighting and color and of course the split screen technique toward the beginning.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has proven himself again to be extremely proficient not only technically, but as an artist who's technique serves his craft and pushes the boundaries of the art of film.<br/><br/>Hyperbole? Well, I am excited."

"monoqlith","10","0","0","11 June 2001"," Darren Aronofsky's Brilliance - A Review
","Darren Aronofsky's latest effort, Requiem for a Dream, portrays a descent into the depths of chemical dependency.  The film begins its crescendo of tension with the heisting of Sarah Goldfarb's(Ellen Burstyn) television set by her son Harry(Jared Leto) and his comrade Tyrone(Marlon Wayans) to fund their experimentation with drugs. This experimentation soon escalates to drug-pushing, an enterprise innately prone to failure, and then culminates with the ensemble's full-blown terminal addiction. All the while, parallels are drawn between the story of Harry, Marrian(his girlfriend, played by beautiful Jenniffer Connoly), Tyrone, and Harry's mother as they all waste away in their various terminal addictions. Jennifer resorts to de-facto prostitution to finance Harry's and Tyrone's drug entrepeneurship, while Harry's arm succumbs to the defilement of heroin addiction, as he and Tyrone desperately try to chase down more `pieces' upon which to fix themselves and grow their business. Perhaps the most intense and depressing story of them all is that of Harry's mother, Sarah, who finds herself in the midst of a loneliest inferno exaggerated by her physical addiction to weight-diet pills. In all its astounding surrealism, never once does Aronofsky surrender Â‘Requiem' to mindless shock-ridden chaos, the excesses of bad horror movies. Everything in the movie serves to further the film's overall coherence and intensity: the quick edits, the use of psychadelic color and twitching lights, the careful, meticulous, deliberate construction of shots. Aronofsky smoothly, but deliberately, switches between each person's perspective as the story rolls onward; and while the story is told in the third-person, its tone is wholly first-person. We are outside the mind of each victim, but the experience conveys the same percieved intensity of drug-addiction to someone who has never been addicted to drugs; in this, we are brought into the mind of the addict. Aronofsky's masterful direction and the film's editing give it a sense of being one inch away from reality: and in this, the film truly portrays the actuality of drug addiction. The actors themselves masterfully helped to heighten the experience: Burstyn's performance is extremely poignant at many points throughout, and as usual is worthy of a Best Actress award. Jared Leto and, unexpectedly, Marlon Wayans, shine in their roles along with beautiful Jennifer Connoly, who never once, even with the severely detrimental effects of heroin and cocaine, seems to lose her beautiful visage(perhaps a more frightening prospect than visible deterioration). If you've ever thought about trying cocaine or heroin, watch this movie. If you are already addicted to cocaine or heroin, watch this movie. I assure you, if it does not scare you out of drug abuse, if it does not rescue you from that cliff of devastation, then you are owed your money back. Overall, the movie accomplishes everything it aspires to accomplish, with flying colors. Darren Aronofsky is brilliant. See it. Overall Rating: 10/10"

Why did Darren Aronofsky feel it vital to his plot to play on the fears of white America by having the virtues of the addicted ""girl next door"" defiled by the big bad black man?  It seems to be a common theme in these ""drug movies"" that black men are cast as sexual predators, ready to pounce on the weakness of a daughter near you!! If you don't believe me, rent the movie Traffic, which incidentally netted Steven Soderbergh the nod for best director.

"Polter-Cow","10","0","0","6 June 2001"," The reason we invented celluloid
","*Requiem* is an experience. It is a ride. It is a descent into hell itself. Your eyes do not want to leave the screen, yet they want to look away from the horror of it all. I'm still shaking, and not just because it's cold outside. If there is a theater anywhere near you showing this movie, see it at a theater. I don't think it can have quite the same impact on a small screen.<br/><br/>The movie follows four characters. Sara, mother of Harold, is an obsessive TV-watcher who becomes addicted to diet pills when she is told she has won a chance to be on TV. Harry, his friend Tyrone, and his girlfriend Marion all shoot heroin and snort cocaine. The simple blurb is that the movie shows how each character's addiction to drugs destroys him.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's touch is evident. Remember those oh-so-cool quick cuts of Max popping pills that emphasized how routine the action was? Well, that technique is back, and with a vengeance. In a few seconds you get cut - drop - roll - snort - dilate, complete with sound effects. It's a wonder this didn't get nominated for sound editing; the effect is amazing. Aronofsky also has another trick up his sleeve in that in several scenes, he uses a split screen to his advantage. Even the opening credits should be noted, the way the white names appear on the black for a few seconds, and then the black eats away at them until they are devoured.<br/><br/>Speaking of devoured, don't be surprised if after seeing this movie, you're a tad afraid of your refrigerator.<br/><br/>For the first third or so, the movie is very beautiful. The relationship between Harry and Marion is portrayed effectively, lovingly, by both the actors and the director. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is the scene in which Harry and Marion lie head to head with feet pointed in opposite directions, and the camera circles slowly above them, and in their calm, drug-induced bliss, they express their love. ""You make me feel human,"" she says.<br/><br/>The actors themselves, too, are beautiful. Jennifer Connelly, Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, and Marlon Wayans. You see them, how happy they are...and you watch them destroy themselves. The acting, as it must be, is excellent. Marlon Wayans actually *can* act, my friends. And Ellen Burstyn, nominated (and rightly so) for an Academy Award, has a lot to handle for her role, and she executes it with unflinching grace. Watching her onscreen, seeing her face and what it does, you wonder how she's doing it, how horrible it must be inside her head to make it so convincing.<br/><br/>As he did in *Pi*, Aronofsky uses music to its full potential, with a haunting score, the strings performed by the Kronos Quartet. I just saw *Yi Yi*, which uses almost no music but for the beginning and end, and I greatly appreciated that. Life has no soundtrack; it was effective. But I am once again reminded how much music can do for a film.<br/><br/>Words really can't describe how this movie feels.<br/><br/>During the horrific climactic sequence (you'll know it when it happens), my whole body had chills running through it. I felt the beginnings of tears in my eyes. I knew that if it pulled the right strings, it might get tears from me. It was just absolutely horrible to watch what these people had become. They weren't *bad* people. They all had their dreams...and all they received was a requiem. After the heartbreaking denouement ended to begin the credits, I couldn't move. I couldn't speak.<br/><br/>There is *no* redemption in this film. The title tells it all. This is a requiem. This is not a happy movie. At all. It won't restore your faith in humanity. It will restore your faith in film, however, and what it can do. (Why this movie wasn't nominated for more Oscars is beyond me. Technically, this movie is masterful. Editing, Directing, Sound, Score...all should have been nominated. As long as Darren Aronofsky stays true to himself and doesn't succumb to the Hollywood machine, the next *Batman* is going to kick serious butt.)<br/><br/>I am glad that this movie was simply about the horrors of drug addiction. If someone could make a movie this effective, this powerful, about the horrors of humanity in general, I just might have to go kill myself."

I thought that Aronofsky's ""Pi"" was one of the strangest and yet brilliant movies ever. I thought to myself how could he possibly follow that up? Then I saw Requiem... Requiem for a Dream goes places that other anti-drug films would dare go.

Jared Leto fresh out of Fight Club gives a incredible performance as Harry Goldfarm, a herion shooting, coccaine snorting addict. His best friend is played by Malon Waynes, who despite his previous films shines. Harry's girlfried is played by Jennifer Conneley who has come quite a long way since her days of Labryinth. Then we come to Ellen Burstyn who is simpley stunning as Harry's mother Sara, who is addicted to diet pills and television. Let me say right now that this film is not for everyone, there are some moments in this film that are tough to swallow, and rightly so! But to anyone who is up to it I challenge you to watch Requiem for a Dream. And parents, if your kids are mature enough to handle a film like this (and beleive me they have to be mature)let them watch it with you."

","Darren first caught my attention  with his debut ""Pi"". And now, ""Requiem for a dream"" confirms that  Mr. Aronofsky is growing to be one of the best directors around.<br/><br/>Everyone has a dream. But for some the dream becomes an obsession that simply takes a life away from the person. That's what Darren shows us in this masterpiece of sarcasm and bitterness. The movie is not an average ""I am a good person so shed a tear for me for I've run into problems lately"" Hollywood style production. The main characters, (An excellent play  by all actors) don't deserve pity, they were asking for trouble from that start, miserable youth and TV-addicted lonely former housewife. They can't fight for their life so  they all got what they deserved, for their life was worthless. And Darren, using an excellent FX and camera work puts the viewers literally beside the characters as they descend to their ultimate doom. So just embrace yourself for a very dark journey, and think, if your life is any better ? 10/10"

"Q. Bob","10","0","0","1 November 2000"," More effective than any anti-drug campaign
","After seeing this film at the Denver International Film Festival, I began counting the hours until it opened at the local Landmark theater so I could see it again. Darren Aronofsky's masterful adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr's novel is by far the best movie I have seen this year.<br/><br/>Perhaps most impressive is the fact that I normally can't stand excessive use of rapid editing or being hit over the head with act structure, but, as with Pi, the editing actually added to the story, using repetitive imagery to show the patterns the characters fall into.<br/><br/>Also impressive was the way the entire feel of the movie changed with the seasons. When it begins in summer the film has a bright, optimistic feeling to it; by the time it gets to winter the movie feels cold and pessimistic. In addition to getting unprecedented dramatic acting from Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans, Aronofsky subtly changes the color scheme of the movie to reflect the situation of the characters.<br/><br/>Above all, this is a powerful film. There has been no shortage of movies about drug users hitting rock-bottom, but Aronofsky makes us care about these people; he makes us hope that they will actually achieve their dreams, so that, like the characters, we want to see the signs of their slow decent into addiction as only a minor setback.<br/><br/>I actually found this film to be more effective than Selby's novel, simply because Aronofsky's visuals and Clint Mansell's music increased the emotion behind the text tenfold. This film should be shown in high schools; it would be a far more effective deterrent to drug use than anything I've seen, in or out of the educational system."

I've never seen ""Pi,"" so I'm not familiar with his work, but I was amazed at how many different ways he presented us with the information!  I can't even pick out a favorite scene, there were so many interesting cuts and techniques used.  And even in the one major scene where no unique editing was done (where Harry and Sarah are talking in her apartment after he bought her the television) the scene was perfect and gripping.<br/><br/>Anyway, all four major perfomances were outstanding.

I was also very impressed with Jared Leto--he's come a long way from ""My So-Called Life""!  <br/><br/>It was the most amazing ride I've ever been on while watching a movie.  The ending sequence was so harrowing that it literally had me in tears.  I was completely floored.

Start a word-of-mouth campaign to all your friends to see this movie.  Challenge them.  Ask them which was the better movie; `Forrest Gump', `Shawshank Redemption' or `Dead Man Walking'. Ask your friends to compare `Requiem' with `Gladiator' and `Traffic'.  No competition.<br/><br/>I won't divulge the plot of the movie because I want people to experience it like I did.

Would I let my 15-year old daughter see it? Not yet.  But did I let my 17-year old son watch it? Easily, a must see.  He said that after watching the movie he felt sick.  What better rationale or justification is there when asking if it should be shown to children.  The question parents must ask themselves is, Are your children mature enough to handle it? and, When can I show it to them? because they need to see it.<br/><br/>I read that `Requiem' only grossed about four million dollars.  It's a shame.  The original NC-17 rating meant that Ellen Burstyn's performance and Darren Aronofsky's direction won't be seen by people.  People whom it could help the most.

He was the most genuine person I ever met in Hollywood. We just chatted about this and that.

","Darren Aronofsky's frantic, music-video style of directing isn't particularly original - Danny Boyle, David Fincher, and Tom Tykwer all have made names for themselves with it within the last few years - but Aronofsky is really the first to use it to make a truly emotionally wrenching film. His stamp is on nearly every scene (incidentally, the little criticism this film has received is because of this), but rarely feels out of context.  It all adds to the power of the story, it all compliments the emotions and feelings the characters are going through.  This is why this is a great film.  The camera tricks and weird angles aren't 'cool' in 'Requiem for a Dream' like they are in 'Trainspotting' or 'Run Lola Run' - they're just disturbing.  Which is exactly what they're supposed to be.<br/><br/>If 'Requiem' falls short anywhere, its thematically.  This is a film about addiction, desperation, loneliness, and the loss of hope, with drug abuse as the vehicle.  So on the surface, you have this immensely bleak picture of 4 people abusing drugs with very little if any insight into why these people ever started in the first place, any insight into the pleasure of it. Consequently, the film almost comes off as unintentionally preachy.  I have no doubts that this was intended as a film about giving up hope and the drug abuse was merely incidental, but I can't help but wonder if the theme would've come across a little better if a different vehicle for the characters' demise had been chosen."

Well, where can I begin! Most of what I want to say- has already been said already..but I must reaffirm many of those points. I am tempted to call any of those self-assured 'critics' who had the unmitigated audacity to pan this movie idiots, morons, dopes, smug, self-conceited fools who feel themselves superior to the vast masses...but I won't (call the 'critics' who had the AUDACITY to pan this movie the dopes that I feel we all know they are)..I don't want the IMDB review board to remove my Post.

","Movies are an art form as well as entertainment, and few movies demonstrate this fact as well as Requiem For A Dream.  I read these comments from people complaining there's 'no storyline', 'it's too flashy', 'nothing but a 2 hour anti-drug music video', etc.  These people don't have a clue.  A requiem is a musical composition to honor the dead.  Every person in this movie had a dream, and each dream died as a result of drugs.  This movie is a musical composition to honor those dreams.  'Requiem' is a work of art.  It does more than tell a story, it draws us in and shows us what's inside the minds of the characters.  We do more than watch the events unfold, we experience them.  Nowadays, with the blockbusters and special effects, people demand explosions and CGI to be satisfied.  Have we forgotten the use of camera angles and framing to establish mood and thought?  Apparently Darren Aronofsky hasn't.<br/><br/>I don't think there's a thing that could be changed to make this movie better.  The acting was superb.  I had no clue at the Academy Awards, but after seeing Ellen Burstyn's performance, how could anyone have given the Oscar to that hack, Julia Roberts?  It shows how false and stupid the Academy has become.  The editing was top of the line, and the musical score has stuck in my head ever since.  Very reminiscent of 'The Sweet Hereafter', the Kronos Quartet brought the characters' emotions to our ears as well as our eyes.<br/><br/>If you didn't walk away from this movie touched, you had no feeling left to begin with."

","Most of the reviews here have been, in my opinion, excessive with the praise. This is a good movie, but not a great one. Does this movie really get inside the mind of what it feels like to be a drug addict? Yes. Does this movie have some inventive, perhaps even pioneering, camera work? Yes. But does this movie really tell a story? Uh...no, can't give you that one.<br/><br/>I won't rehash the plot, but of the four characters, Ellen Burtsyn's was the only one with something resembling a story, and even hers is more of a stream-of-consciousness meditation on addiction. A very stylish and pounding stream-of-consciousness, but a stream-of-consciousness nonetheless. She wants to be on a game show, which never pans out, and in preparation for her TV appearance, she gets hooked on diet pills and goes nuts. The other three characters--well, they just wallow in their addiction until they are either in jail, turning tricks, or having limbs amputated.<br/><br/>Jared Leto's performance is passable, but he's really a bland actor out of his league with this material. Connelly and Wayans come off better, if only because their characters (at least in the movie version) are two-dimentional at best; the quality of the supporting performances mostly lie in their ability to convey the hunger of addiction in closeups and extreme closeups. Burstyn is certainly impressive, but after seeing this, I'm glad Julia Roberts won the Oscar instead (I can just hear the hardcore film buffs hissing at that).<br/><br/>As for the direction...well, yeah, it definitely makes you feel something, and it's not pleasant (but, of course, that's precisely the point). For conveying the feeling of addiction, I give this film lots of credit. Yet, the eye candy camera work only covers up the lack of depth in the story.<br/><br/>That being said, I'm reviewing this movie in comparison to conventional narrative films. I would be inclined to classify Requiem for a Dream in a slightly different category--rather than a narrative film, this is more of an experiment in visualizing the subjective experience of drug addiction. On that level, it's a perfect success. But the movie's more like one of those simulation amusement park rides--the theme being drug addiction, and it's a REALLY scary ride--and a satisfying STORY it is not."

The movie shares four different fates with its audience, dealing out the details bluntly, directly and vividly.

","Allot can be said for writer/director Darren Aronofsky who's debut sci-fi Pi shook the independent film scene forever.  Though Aronofsky has little experience in cinema, his unique flavor plays out like a pro.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream, which carries the very rare NC-17 rating, is a compelling drama about four people, closely related, all dealing with drug addiction.<br/><br/>There is the story of Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) an elderly women addicted to diet pills who dreams of being on TV, dressed in her fabulous red dress, with fabulous red hair.  The tale of her son (Jared Leto) Harry's heroin addiction, who hopes to save enough through dealing dope to one day open up a fashion designing business for his talented girlfriend Marianne (Jennifer Connelly).  And the story of Harry's best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) who's dream is similar to Harry's, and addictions as well.<br/><br/>Of all four outstanding performances, Ellen Burstyn's acting stands strongest.  Nominated for an Academy Award, Burstyn's lovable character compels the viewer into a state of worry.  One must tip their hat to Burstyn who plays most of leading performance by herself in her apartment; hyperactive, but then gloomy and depressed frightened from a living refrigerator.<br/><br/>Another surprise was Marlon Wayans as Tyrone C. Love.  Wayans, who has never given a believable or even respectable performance, takes drama to new heights.  His supporting role plays well with Leto at hand, as an anxious and worried friend.<br/><br/>If you've seen Aronofsky's Pi, you're going to remember the mind blowing pill scenes.  The psychedelic frame shots played frequently through the film are used in Requiem as well.  The characters hallucinations are genuinely portrayed as either beautifully felt or horrid and terrifying.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's well performed and very well edited movie is only the beginning for this young director.  He has signed on to direct the next Batman epic due in 2002. But for now Requiem for a Dream serves as a reminder of the desperation drug users are thrown into.  Requiem is the best cinematic experience of the year.<br/><br/>* * * * * out of 5"

","I have finally had the chance to watch this movie and although its flaws, mostly due to its unnecessary ""modern"" style, it is a movie based on its actors' performances. Ellen Burstyn is nothing short of magnificent - this must be one of the best performances by an American actress in movie history. The last part of the movie, when Ellen almost dominates the screen, is unforgettable. I wonder how an actress can accomplish what Ms. Burstyn did in this movie. I have paid a lot of attention to Ellen Burstyn over these years and I am glad she is still around offering us her brilliance. Bravo Ms. Burstyn!"
"Rich-19","7","0","0","23 May 2001"," REALISTIC, BLEAK ART FILM 7/10
","This film is an uncompromising look at addiction and the price one eventually pays down the road. Director Darren Aronofsky is masterful in the way he uses editing and sound to emphasize his camera images. He has a fresh, unique style that is completely his own. Ellen Burstyn is a wonderful actress and disappears into her character. It's a remarkable performance. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly also excel as two addicted users drawn to each other for their own selfish reasons. Connelly is a risk taking actress and allows herself to be shown in 2 or 3 degrading scenes. But they are essential to her character and the film. ""Requiem For a Dream"" is not a fun, entertaining picture. That's not the intent or the point. It takes you to a place and shows you the way these people live. It's real, bleak and does not pull punches. Aronofsky's got one overwhelming message. DON'T DO DRUGS!!!<br/><br/>Overall Rating  7/10"

I thought a lot of the movie was cliche covered up by a lot of loud music and flashy camera work.<br/><br/>Best film of the year....I think not...Traffic delivered a similar story of drug addicition but let the actors tell the story and not the man behind the camera.  Everytime the girl in Traffic did a hit the same four frames weren't played, backed by the same loud music and some choppy and distorted camera angles.<br/><br/>In my opinion...sometimes less is more.<br/><br/>(Don't get me wrong..I enjoyed the film but it was a bit overdone)"

","Putting my opinion into words is a challenge, because I just shut the DVD player off about an hour ago yet my mind hasn't wandered away from the images on the screen -- I haven't come back, as corny or pretentious as that sounds. The bottom line is this: This film tells a story with such poignancy and graphic detail that you wonder how anyone could craft such a work. I was amazed.<br/><br/>The four main players (Burstyn, Leto, M. Wayans and Connelly) were all outstanding. Burstyn has been lauded for her efforts, and yes, she probably deserved the statue more so than Julia, and Marlon Wayans surprised me with his performance. Their portrayal of addiction, in one form or another, carried incredible impact without being over the top.<br/><br/>The editing was another outstanding aspect. It was concise, not flashy, adding intensity to subject matter that was intense in its own right.<br/><br/>I made sure I saw ""Pi"" before I watched this, to see the chronological progression of a promising filmmaker. ""Pi"" is interesting, quite good; this was amazing. A realistic, if not depressing, look at the downward spiral the less fortunate in the world call life. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky, I tip my hat."

","Harrowing, uncompromising look at the world of drug addiction, Darren Aronofsky's sophomoric effort is a masterpiece of visual elegance and hard-edged style that surpasses his witty but self-conscious debut, Pi: here the fast-paced cutting and frenetic energy do get wearing at times, but on the whole the psychotic carnival ride of images is so suited to the subject matter that it makes it all feel appropriate. Ellen Burstyn stars in a career-topping performance as an aging, lonely woman who gets addicted to diet pills when she becomes convinced that she's eligible to be a television game show contestant. Jared Leto is her son, a junkie trying to make it on the streets as a big-time dealer with his best friend (Marlon Wayans), but neither of them can shake their habits long enough to accomplish it. Jennifer Connolly is excellent as Leto's girlfriend, at first a promising young woman from a well-to-do family, but eventually a dope fiend who will really do anything for a hit. Brilliant as it may be, the film pulls no punches and is in no way easy, therefore a warning to sensitive viewers that they might consider thinking about this one before committing to it."

","Erin Brokovich?  Traffic?  Cast Away?  Please.  The problem with movies like Gladiator, Cast Away and the like with getting recognized at awards shows isn't in the fact that they are the ""best"" movies but that they are the ones most have seen.  If the same could be said of ""Requiem for a Dream"", audiences would say that this was the most deserved film for at least direction and actress if not best picture as well.<br/><br/>I love Julia Roberts and am happy she finally won an Oscar but she pales in comparison to Ellen Burstyn's performance here.  Furthermore, let me say that while Ellen not only deserved to win but that her three co-stars deserved nominations.  First, Jared Leto was amazing and has never shown such range in acting (but to his credit he has never had the script to work with either); Wayans is someone that I could do without normally but here he takes a despicable character and actually makes him very human and sympathetic (that is great acting); and finally Connolly is amazing and definitely deserving of a best supporting actress nod for her wicked turn as the good girlfriend gone bad.<br/><br/>The only downside to this movie is that it revels in the despair and never shows any signs of coming out of the depths of hell, but that is the wonderment of the movie.  The fact that we are submersed in doom and gloom and still find these characters intriguing and sympathetic tells me that this is a powerful story.  Furthermore, it is amazing to me that Aronofsky was able to do the direction he did and go totally unnoticed by everyone! Shame!<br/><br/>Best movie of 2000 without a doubt.  Sorry Billy Elliot.  You have my number two vote though."

","Requiem For A Dream is the scariest movie of all time.  At least it's the most disturbing.  It's very scary to see what happens to the characters. Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely, and even Marlon Wayans give chilling performances.  Once you see the movie, you are chilled about the three different stories that you have nightmares for two weeks.  Three stories in a drug movie seems to be a trend now, seeming as Traffic does the same thing.  While Traffic weaves their stories a bit more well, Requiem's is by far alot more harrowing.  This is far more scary then Ellen Burstyn's big hit The Excorcist, which in my opinion, I thought was a hilarious movie. Ellen Burstyn deserves her nomination here, she was better than Roberts, who won.  In fact, this movie deserved nominations for sound, score, editing, cinematography, adapted screenplay, supporting actress(Connely), director(for Aronofsky's brilliant direction) and best picture.  I thought this was by far the second best film of the year, just losing to Traffic. Even though I am child, I wouldn't recommend showing this one to your fifteen year old.  I'm sorry if that's hypocritical."

This woman is incapable of looking anything but incredibly beautiful, no matter how depreaved her character is supposed to be.

","Some people don't like films like this.  They call them depressing.  I have to say that I find a lot of happy, jolly, false stuff unbelievable and depressing a lot more than stuff like this.  Admittedly, Requiem is frighteningly intense in places; but this is a quality which is rarely found nowadays; only Magnolia in parts and oddments of Fight Club compare to this in terms of nerve-shattering emotional intensity.  Or perhaps Monkey Trouble.  Only joking :).  <br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn plays a lonely widow & mother named Sara Goldfarb who becomes addicted to diet pills in an attempt to make herself presentable for a TV appearance she applies for.  This becomes the focus for her lonely existence.  Aronofsky skilfully compares this with the lives of Sara's son, Harry (Jared Leto) and his girlfriend and friend who are all regular Heroin users.  Marlon Wayans in particular is fantastic as Harry's friend Tyrone, but the star is undoubtedly Burstyn who, especially in the second and third parts of the story, had me in almost constant tears.<br/><br/>I really can't recommend this enough.

","This movie is about self-delusion, as seen in the context of drug abuse.<br/><br/>
We track the experiences of four people who all have problems at the start of the film. Sara Goldfarb, portrayed in a startling performance by Ellen Burstyn, is still getting over her husband's death and longs for some meaning in her life - ""something that's worth waking up in the morning for"" and finds it in the news that she is to appear on television, something she is almost as addicted to as sugar.<br/><br/>Her son Harry, played convincingly by Jared Leto, longs constantly for a new, better fix and not surprisingly, finds it in drugs. His girlfriend Marianne (Jennifer Connelly), tries to escape from the control of her parents, who give her enough money, which for her, is not enough and so she also gets involved with the drug scene, descending to lower levels each time.<br/><br/>Marlon Wayans plays the role of their friend, Tyrone, for whom all that seems to matter is doing something with his life that will please his mother. The fickle world of drugpushers promises wealth and status and soon starts involving him and his two friends.<br/><br/>The film moves through three seasons. Summer sees everyone living the good life, but in the Fall section, things get out of control. In Winter, everything collapses and each character has to accept the consequences of their earlier actions.<br/><br/>The direction of Darren Aronofsky and cinematography of Matthew Libatique brings Hubert Selby Jr's bleak world to life. Close-up shots of the drugtaking experience add to the extreme graphic nature of the film and the Fall section includes some of the most amazing direction, editing and cinematograpy you will ever see.<br/><br/>It is impossible to watch this movie and not be affected by it.

Ellen Burstyn was robbed of an Oscar for her portrayal of Sara Goldfarb, a lonely Coney Island widow who embarks on a dark journey of madness when she is perscribed diet pills by a quack doctor.  The film centers on her strife, and it is harrowing and unforgettable to watch a human being disinegrate in front of your eyes.

","The poster of the film resumes what the film is in a metaphorical way. Wee see a beautiful eye, but even though of its beauty, is filled with sorrow, and that's because its dreams just went away and with them, its freedom and happiness. We see the ocean at the back reminding us how dreams come and go like waves, and how they shatter when they hit the shore just like dreams do when they hit reality.<br/><br/>This film is like a bucket full of ice and acid thrown at your face while you were sleeping and having the most beautiful dream you've ever had. It's like waking up to the real world after being distracted from it all your life by a silk curtain that suddenly falls and the truth is discovered in the most brutal manner.<br/><br/>What are dreams? Can you live your whole life based on dreams and never realize the truth even if it is just in front of you? How hard is to lose those dreams and begin to live life, as it is, brutal, rude and fast? All this questions are answered in this film. A film that stands up from all the films of its kind I've ever seen in my whole life.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding of its crudeness, is filled with beauty, color and hope. Hope is the last you lose at times of adversity, and this is proven by the characters of the film, who are incredibly well portrayed by Ellen Byrstein, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and one of the Wayans Bros.<br/><br/>
This film is a complete new experience, but not a very pleasant one, is one of those films that you love or hate, but nothing in between. A film that I don't think I would ever see again for what it made me feel, but that I would certainly recommend to anyone. After all it is a film that will remain in my mind for the rest of my life, and I will never be able to take it our no matter how hard I'd try."

","Sensationalist direction, MTV-editing, suffocating room for character development, unrelentless juxtaposition, over-produced. Darren Aronofsky is that new breed of director who patronises his audience, feeling the need to underline scenes with a pounding soundtrack and extreme shoots. Which is a shame considering when the camera decides to stay on the actors for long enough, they really do shine. A letterbox-view of the drug culture, shown up against the spectrum of 'Traffic', this film is dated.

There are no mellow-dramatic withdraw scenes or extravagant scenes of the characters shooting up. Its in your face but collectively. Some of the other themes that transpire are deeply touching. Such as a lonely Ellen Burstyn sitting in front of her television wishing for a call from her son, and so perfectly phrased in one scene she tells him ""I no longer live my life but endure it."" (Something along those lines) The direction I venture to say is groundbreaking and gives the film flair. Jennifer Connelly was amazing. Ellen Burstyn deserved that Oscar! The final 15 minutes of this film shook me up and are some of the most disturbing sequences in cinema history.

","Darren Aronofsky's first film, ""Pi"" (1998), was brilliant. His second film is no exception.

The movie focuses on a small group of people who watch their dreams die when they enter a downward drug spiral.<br/><br/>It is very visually intense, especially when seen up close on the big screen. The rise and fall of emotions and eventual crush of hope and desperation leave you feeling like a fragile shell of a human being. There are a few very emotinally shocking scenes that may not be for the faint hearted. The soundtrack is a mix of Clint Mansell's experimental electronic and is filled with very haunting cello and string accompaniment in the form of the Kronos Quartet, which only enhances the feel of the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Any film which can draw you in like this one did, allowing you to experience almost every emotion the characters do,  to rise and fall with them, is worth seeing.

For me, the end of the movie is a masterpiece of editing (more for its efficiency than for its artistic quality). I really have been glued to the spot.

","Darren Aronofsky has created a masterpiece in Requiem for a Dream.  It's combination of artful cinematography and powerful imagery, as well as plot, combine to make this the singularly most affective and moving film of the drug genre.  Following such predecessors as Drugstore Cowboy and Trainspotting, Requiem surpasses them all in its grim portrayal of the downward spiral of the drug culture, and wrenches the audience through an emotional roller-coaster that will keep them talking for days.  Never has any movie had such a lasting affect as that of Requiem.  Warning - This is not a movie for the light-at-heart.  This movie portrays every grim aspect of a reality we are all to easy to forget exists.  It is a movie everyone should see, but not many can handle.  Ellen Burstyn leaves a performance for the ages.  I highly recommend this title to anyone that has ever considered the use of drugs.  You will never be the same again."

"radicimo","9","0","0","20 March 2001"," The brutal depiction of a modern dance of escapism, tempoed like a 'thriller', heavy on the experimental filmmaking.
","Easy interpretations of this film will grasp for an anti-drug message, or the exploration of a cycle of addiction.  However, a more fundamental theme is conveyed concerning the behavior of bodies from whom the soul escapes, or had escaped.  Drug abuse does permeate the film, but to my sensibility it somehow feels tangental to the themes of age and death.<br/><br/>The work is peopled with characters who behave not unlike a living dead. None of the characters in the entire movie elicits much sympathy, including the secondary and even peripheral roles.  The primary characters (4) all live in different forms of dreamworlds, which prove much more rewarding and secure than their messed up realities.  Escapism in all of its varied forms and mental suggestions is the dream to which the title refers.  This escapism takes shape in the form of reflections upon youth, hope for the future, a hallucinatory present, psychological malady, drug abuse, and last but not least -- television.<br/><br/>Tempo and style are essential to the filmic experience presented by this work.  The suspense quickly delivers you to the edge of your seat and from there continues to build to an almost deafening creshendo.  The tempo seems very much styled upon that of a thriller or suspense film.  The refrigerator, and a few other 'gruesome' scenes exemplify the filmmakers' ability to even incorporate elements of the horror genre.<br/><br/>This film is also a platform for experimental cinematography and editing, which at points are overdone.  A testament to the filmmaker is that much of the experimentation does work so well.  There is some wonderful stedicam work at the beginning, and the repeated sensoral metaphors for the various forms of drug intake convey extremely well.  The music is rather subtly delivered, but serves to moderate the tempo quite well.  However, the requiem of the title seems to be as much visual as aural."

","""Requium for a Dream"" cements Darren Aronofsky's place as one the truly great new directors of the new century, along with David Fincher and P.T. Anderson. This is a film that will shake and move you very, very deeply. In only his second film, Aranofsky illustrates his truly incredible command of the medium; this is the first film that, for me, managed to honestly and perfectly capture the psychology of a drug user via its images and sounds. The four main leads - Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Waynes and especially Ellen Burstyn- act with a sense of honesty and conviction that you very rarely see in cinema. Thier collective belief in the film and what it has to say is up there on the screen. Visually, this film is truly astonishing and proves that ""Pi"" was no fluke. Case in point: the split screen sequence with Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly ,post-sex, talking and saying how much they love each other. The way that the screen is split is a truly compelling and powerful foreshadow of the way that their relationship disintergrates once addiction takes hold. This is shown later in the film the way that Marion,hungry for a fix, flips the photo of her and Harry in happier times, to see the number of the dealer that will give her drugs in exchange for sex. It's a very quiet, but completely devastating moment in the film.Some of the film's most gut wrenching moments are its quietest, such as where the two old ladies are crying and hugging outside the hospital while the smow falls after they see Sara. Although he just about sets the screen on fire with the way that he visually depicts his story, Aranofsky's trump card in ""Requium"" is his use of music. Clint Mansell and The Kronos Quartet have perfectly married their vision musically to what Aransofsky depicts on screen. Best example: the very final sequence in which we see where the four main characters have ended up both physically and emotionally from where we first met them. The combination of aural and visual is one of the most perfect and completely heart breaking moments ever committed to film, particularly the very final shot with Sara and Harry telling each other that they love each other, imposed over Sara sleeping in her bed in the hospital. I left the theatre physically shaking both times I saw ""Requium"" It is a pity that no one under eighteen in Australia can see this film. It is one of the most important film about drugs and drug abuse ever committed to film. ""Requium For A Dream"" is the rarest of bests; a film about drugs that neither glamourises nor preaches. It is the first truly great film of the 21st century. If this film manages to make even one person change their mind about using hard drugs, than that is the greatest recommendation that ""Requium For A Dream' could possibly receive."
"stp_44720","10","0","0","2 March 2001"," utterly devastating
","The multi-talented Darren Aronofsky follows up 1998's Pi with perhaps, the greatest film this year. The story of how searching for dreams in<br/><br/>the wrong places and utter horror of the drug world is nothing short of brilliant. The elder woman of the story (Ellen Burstyn) is ageing and alone. Her wish of being loved and important in someone's life is almost granted in an invitation to appear on t.v. Her attempts to crash diet for her alleged fifteen minutes go from hilarious to downright painful.<br/><br/>
 Jared Leto appears as Burstyn's drug addicted son. His dream of starting his own business and marrying his lover (Jennifer connely) go equally awry. His ""partner"" (Damon Wayans) is a small time hustler that attempts to move up in the drug world, all the time a junkie himself.Leaving the theater, I felt truly jarred. The final scenes of the film stayed with me for days. If there was any justice this film would have come away with more than just one nomination, while Gladiator basks in 10! A Requiem indeed."
"tezzzaaa","Null","0","0","25 February 2001"," mind blowing film, speeding towards a powerfully horrible climax
","When the film started I was quite easily overtaken by it,  the melodic music by the Kronos Quartet backed up by a trip hop kinda beat effectively adding to this.  I loved the way the camera and lightning backed up the mood of the moment, or rather the season, as the film is divided in the four seasons. These set the mood and atmospheres accordingly. This is especially clear (would be the right word to use here!) in the Spring and Summer.  The lights outside are blinding, so blinding this should either be considered as surreal or as being an omen, if you will, of the things to come.  Don't be tempted by the brightness! The film deals with four personalities and the ways they get dragged in a world of addiction.  In case of the three young people it's dope, in case of the mother, beautifully and hauntingly acted, by drugs as well, but prescribed drugs, for her to loose weight, not less dangerous.  The fact that both these narcotics have been set as equally seductive and damaging was to me a great element of the film.  Films where drugs kill kids have been made plenty, we have been warned sufficiently I would say.  But placing kids and dope on the same line as people being on medication or, as in this film, diet pills(aka speed) adds a new and powerful dimension. At the same time this was the best part in the film for me.  The way this woman who so desperately wants to be young and beautiful again is pain steaking.  It also reminds a girl nowadays to try to not be dependent too much, either on beauty or on a husband that will provide for you, till he's dead (and you're not!).  The camera work here is excellent, as she becomes more and more paranoid, the camera moves with this, and makes things equally paranoid and shaky for the viewer. The path the kids go in the film starts off as being almost too perfect, to me anyway.  The film appeared as an Mtv video almost and seems to bring a message of ""dope is cool"", with these hip kids shooting up while mixing records on their deks.  At first this kind of annoyed me, not cuz I believe drugs are all that bad and shouldn't be portrayed as giving satisfaction, but just cuz it seemed too easy to watch these perfectly sedated creatures. Then, when the mood of the film became more desperate and grim it seemed like the supposedly ideal state of the beginning was contrasting the rest perfectly.  Maybe this great beginning was only illustrating the dream and illusion the kids were living in, not only fooling the viewer, but also themselves.  On the other hand, things could have been close to perfect all the time, had they been more responsible. Exactly how the kids get drawn in a downward spiral so fast was not as convincing to me as the way the woman gets in deeper and deeper.  She is haunted by her memories of the past and idealizes her forgone beauty and the way she used to look in her red dress, how she could charm all those around her, the only way she thinks to achieve this again is to fit into that dress and appear on television.  She wants her moment of fame, tragically portraying the average American and the dominating role TV has taken in their lives. TV here seems almost like a metaphor for the misleading lures modern capitalist life has brought us, and that are slowly consuming us instead of us consuming them and growing. The film moves to a terrible climax, which was done very well and extremely effective.  Even those not easily shocked will not find it easy to stay unaffected, getting drawn in the misery and cruelty of the world to those who have lost control.  The scenes follow each other up in rapid speed, everything mixed in a whirlwind of  deceit, frustration, despair and inevitability."

","In fairness to the filmmaker and anyone who may be reading this, I viewed `Requiem for a Dream' in the same week I saw `Hannibal' and `Pollock.' Afterwards, I hurried over to a local cinema to see the sing-a-long version of `The Sound of Music' in an effort to balance things out, but the box office had posted a sign `SOLD OUT UNTIL END OF RUN. DON'T EVEN ASK!' I guess a lot of other people need a sugar `fix' as well.<br/><br/>
When we meet the four central characters in `Requiem for a Dream,' they're already fatally damaged. Their `goals' aren't anything we're rooting for, and as they spiral predictably downward, we encounter very familiar material that's been covered in literature and moviemaking for years: drugs aren't safe (prescription and non), materialism corrupts, spiritual emptiness leads nowhere, diet fads are bad, it's pathetic to watch game shows, capitalism is inherently selfish, aging will leave you lonely, the mental health system is inadequate, always ask who's going to be at the orgy you've agreed to show up for, and rotate veins when you shoot upÂ…. You get the picture. It's not a pretty world out there. <br/><br/>All of that is well and good if you have something new and bold to say. But I didn't come away with any new insights. [Well, that's not true. I learned never to let Louise Lasser color my hair or encourage an actor to vomit directly into the lens.]<br/><br/>There is something striking about Aronofsky's command of the medium. Using visual and editing styles from music videos with some spectacular performances (Jennifer Connelly in particular) he's created an intense and powerful experience. But so is buying a ticket to have someone hammer a nail into your skull."

It is definitely one of the most harrowing movies through which I have ever sat.  And I say that as a former reviewer who sat through many movies.  The camera work, yes, is a bit arty at times.  But it serves to induce the skewered vision of the addicted. I especially related to, and appreciated, the physician-encouraged addiction of Sarah Goldfarb (Burstyn).  Poor Sarah is an innocent, naively trusting in what her doctor tells her - after all, he knows what he is doing!  She winds up as a total psychotic - but at least, a THIN psycho, which is what is important for women!  There are undertones of sexism in America, along with many others, in this film. Marlon Wayans is a delight and so is the rest of the cast.  If this is a low budget movie, it surely doesn't look like it.  Writing, acting, directing, editing, scoring - all well above average.  For women, the end scene of Harry's girlfriend's descent into the hades particular to females is so terrifying, mortifying and hellacious that it will be a long time before we get it out of our minds - if ever. The comparisons to Trainspotting are inevitable.  Trainspotting was excellent in its own right.  But Requiem is the one I think I'll never forget.

That it would rock me and that it'd stay with me, that I'd feel sick and re-invigorated at the same time after viewing.  I was more than willing to believe them going into the theatre, but for the first half-hour, a little voice in the back of my head whispered,<br/><br/>
""Where is it?""<br/><br/>The first act consists of nothing remarkably vicious.  We are introduced to the four principles, we get to know their drugs, their inter-relationships, etc.  We see blink-and-you'll-miss-it cuts one on top of the other, which do, to some degree, warp your mind a little, but nothing on the level of a ""Midnight Express"" moment. <br/><br/>Aronofsky is obviously a fan and a student of good movies.  He knows the rules, and is smart to not indulge himself by breaking them when he makes his own movies.  It would be easy to attack an audience with ideas, but in this, only his second feature, he really only lets the characters' actions be the attack *until* the last fifteen minutes, when he puts down his restraint and declares absolute war.<br/><br/>At times, the last act of ""Requiem for a Dream"" feels like the cinematic equivalent of a tommy gun, blasting you down before you have a chance to get up.  Seeing it, it often resembles the film montage showed during Alex's rehabilitation in ""A Clockwork Orange"".  Colorful, compelling, and original, the entire film as a whole will stay with you for a very, very long time, even if you don't think so for the first half-hour.  The director unleashes an assault on your opinions about addiction and may very well make you question the very fabric of your own sanity the next time you pick up a cigarette or cup of coffee.  <br/><br/>A"

The repetition of sounds and images allow the audience to connect with the characters on the levels that Aronofsky sets out. Also, the fact that the movie is separated into sections, each becoming more graphic, forces the audience to ride the roller-coaster of emotion that the characters experience. Kudos to Jared Leto for shedding any kind of 'pretty boy' image of himself, and to Marlon Wayans for limiting the comedy in his acting. Jennifer Connelly's and Ellen Burstyn's acting was also superb. Burstyn shocks you with the combination of her descent into this drug-filled world, and her decay as a character. I thought that Trainspotting had done it for disturbing drug movies, but REQUIEM makes Trainspotting look like a Disney movie in comparison. I doubt I can ever watch this movie again for the graphic images stay with you long after the movie is over, but I recommend it to anyone who has thought about doing drugs. This movie will definitely dissuade that idea."

You see how inhumanely people can treat one another and it is so tragic.<br/><br/>You see how drugs can affect people and the toll substance abuse takes.<br/><br/>The end of the film stays in your mind for some time.

Stunning visuals, beautiful score and good acting. Great editing and camera work. Very innovative to those who don't know innovation. There are a lot of people in this world who have ideas like this, but somehow, either by chance or fate, all of them do not have the opportunity to prove themselves. Everyone in this film worked hard under Aronofsky's guidance as director, and it definitely pays off. It's a wholly immersive experience, and it's nice to see risks taken.<br/><br/>Bad<br/><br/>Others have had the idea of constant music dubbed throughout and the whole artsy euro-blue and green tinting is definitely overdone. I know greens and blue are hip and artsy and fun to look at, but for God's sake, it's old. Steadicam frontal shots have been done. One of the weaknesses of losing focus on the story and angling in on the sensory aspect is that it becomes just something beautiful to watch. I feel the loss of a fun story and miss more of a character driven dialogue aspect. We do see the visual throughline in this movie, so that keeps it together. The effects of drugs, especially on Mrs. Goldfarb, are exaggerated. Diet pills do not equal LSD. Maybe she took too much?<br/><br/>Maybe it's wrong to say we shouldn't do something that's already been done. We should applaud a good use of something that already exists, and just because a certain person thinks this is a masterpiece doesn't have any more weight than someone who thinks it sucks.<br/><br/>I think it's a great film.

","I saw ""Requiem for a Dream"" yesterday and it has barely left my mind for five minutes since. First of all may I say it's very positive to see the standard of reaction to this movie in the other user comments, I expected a fair amount of backlash.<br/><br/>This movie is a piece of living, breathing cinema. It is new, fresh, daring and okay I'm being hyperbolic - but what I'm saying is that this movie whether you liked it or not, will produce a reaction from you. The audience I watched it with were drawn in by the characters and the flashes of humour and then ultimately disturbed and left shaken. I have never heard so many genuinely shocked audible reactions from an audience.<br/><br/>So how does director and co-writer Aronofsky achieve this? He achieve it by using every tool available to a film. Writing: a heartbreakingly juxtaposed story of a mother and a son and their dreams which are ultimately shattered. A very original take on drugs, which ultimately places it within a wider social context than many other films that rarely take on the greater implications.<br/><br/>Acting: Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly all deliver top rate performances. Burstyn in particular is amazing, it is one the most heartbreaking performances you will ever see. It is wonderful to see a role written for a middle age person with depth and edge, and performed so electrically. How Burstyn lost and will lose to Julia Roberts (for Erin Brokovich) is beyond me. Roberts delivers a fine performance and probably the ultimate of her career, but I think you have to award someone for the actual quality of the performance not in terms of some career achievement. I think it is up to us lovers of this film and Burstyn's performance to keep campaigning, keep writing on the message boards so that hopefully some of the voters might see what the public want for a change. The distributors of ""Requiem"" cannot compete in terms of campaigning, but we can. Sorry I've gone of track again. In terms of the other performances they are all very good, it is particularly pleasing to see actors like Wayans break away from his usual screen persona and deliver a fine performance, it is a big risk for him and it paid off. Leto and Connelly also invest huge amounts, but if there is one criticism it is that the ""you are the most beautiful girl in the world"" scenes come off a little awkward.<br/><br/>Music: This has to be some of the best use of music in film. Clint Mansell again produces another fine off-centre score, beautifully offset by the work from the Kronos Quartet. Music and sound almost penetrates the whole film never letting you settle, so that when there is little sound it is very noticeable. It is also crucial to the end sequence. Mention also should be made about the TV show. The repetitive chants and exclamations, brought home for me the notion of television as the new religion, the TV show is made to seem like a religious fervor, and Christopher McDonald plays a very effective ""Evangilist"".<br/><br/>Cinematography: Washed out colours, Steadicam, warped angles, sped up, slowed down. Everything is put to use. Some of the most interesting camera work that has been seen for a long time. And who will ever forget the first shot of ""winter"", it is forever planted in my mind.<br/><br/>Editing: Well if the editing on this movie doesn't receive an Academy nomination they may as well stop the whole event. This has to be one of the best editing jobs EVER. Hollywood seems to give awards for seamless editing, well whoop-de-doo, how about using editing to enhance the movie, how about giving an award for daring, revolutionary editing. They won't and it's sad. P.S. They should congratulate the editor for having such a strong stomach to be able to edit this movie.<br/><br/>Direction: What can I say? Think about how one man can bring all these ingredients I've mentioned and more, together to give what is one the most narratively and visually fulfilling movies you will ever see. The most effective thing that Aronofsky uses to keep the audience with the movie is pace and the withholding of shock. The movie gradually and gradually builds pace until the climax, this allows us to go into the minds of the characters as they gradually spiral out of control. The withholding of shock is also well used, because the audience is not distanced from the movie to early and when the director has them, then he shocks them. It is a great piece of film making.<br/><br/>""Requiem"" does have its faults. However, they are more than compensated by the standard of film making, the risks taken. I was left emotionally drained at the end of this movie, but also invigorated to see a new, exciting and original film."
"maty-1","10","0","0","3 February 2001"," An existentialist requiem for a dream
","This is certainly the best film that I have seen in a cinema. The performances from Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly as the two lovers Harry Goldfarb and Marion Silver is spellbinding. The dividing of the movie into Summer, Autumn and Fall (each with their own distinct musical themes) is a device that works well and helps to build up to the climax in the third act which is raw, kaleido copic and emotional. The first ten minutes of the movie are certainly very good and the constant depictions of a deserted fairground and rusting rollercoaster remind one of lost childhood and the inevitability of dissolution. The most disturbing addict of the film is Ellen Burstyn playing Sara Goldfarb, a widow with a delinquent son who is always stealing the TV (her only real solace). The soundtrack to this movie is one of the most original you will find, which is why I have just gone and ordered it. Its a great pity that this movie was only released in arthouse cinemas, it is a movie that everyone needs to see, a savage attack on the dystopia produced by the quest for the American Dream. This film will never lose relevance."

","I left the theater two hours ago and I still feel stunned.  When the film started I was struck by the unique and instantly coherent visual vocabulary. The split screens...the frenetic images.  Fueled by a quirky, driving Kronos Quartet score.  There was a sense of humor about the bleak relationship between Sara Goldfarb and her son.  The running gag about him selling her TV for drug money.  From the opening sequences and what I'd read in reviews, I felt that I was on recognizable ground.  That I could watch from a safe vantage point as the story unfolded and enjoy the edginess of the plot and break away clean.<br/><br/>But somewhere in the midst of it, I felt myself drawn closer to the action. Sensing more and more that I somehow physically understood what was happening to Sara even though I'd never been there.  And by the end, I felt sick.  I felt my boundaries had dissolved.  I felt a physical connection with what was happening on the screen.  The sound and the image invaded me and I felt physically sick, assaulted, wasted.<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever felt that way in a movie.  The ugliness and the horror completely engulfed my personal space.  I was not safe.<br/><br/>I can't really recommend this movie because it was so graphically disturbing...I would not want the responsibility of sharing the experience. But if someone has the courage or strength to face it, they will be confronted by a seamless experience that wastes no time setting a stage for the viewer, but plugs directly, like electrodes, into their mind."

","whether u end up eventually liking this movie or not, it will leave a lasting impression on your mind.  that impression will probably be a sickening, horrifying and dark one.  the originality of the script is not the only quality that makes this film stand out from others.  the fabulous cinematography and exquisite editing make this movie first and foremost, a striking visual experience.  there are some critics that claim this film stands only as a ground for experimental camera effects and snappy editing. they also claim that requiem lacks the quality of being a strong narrative. however, they fail to realize that they went to see a film.  if they were looking for reading material to form their own images, they should have probably stuck with the book and not bothered with the movie.  the visual environments that are created through the camera-work are part of the narration.<br/><br/>for approximately two hours, this film lets the viewers fall through the hopeless whirlpool of an existence that is addiction.  most people who have seen this movie will probably tell u that this movie is about junkies. indirectly, it is.  but in reality, it is a story about lost souls who are trying to hang on to the little flame of hope they have remaining in their lives.  even when that flicker seems to be fading away, they cultivate and create through their drug-enthused minds a ""happily ever after"" picture. a picture that everything will somehow be taken care of and will be okay. they are lost in their dreams.  their dreams are the only places where they are truly happy.  for them, reality cannot compare with the worlds they experience while being high.  and after those feelings disappear, they will go to great extents to recreate the dreams in which they acquire happiness--through drugs.  and in that, lies their weakness.  they are too weak to face the real world.  in that also lies their surrender to conscious life.  they are held captive by their drugs--their weakness.<br/><br/>if the latter hasn't formed a depressing environment in your mind, go see this movie.  this is not a movie after which u will say ""gee, that was a cool movie"" or ""that was a GOOD movie"".  u will first think about the effect this film has just brought about in u.  even though it might seem otherwise, u will walk out of this movie somehow forming a connection with one of its characters or their thoughts.  u will be disturbed and moved by this film. although not a horror movie, it is not for the faint of heart.  it is probably more lurid than the latter genre because its terror lies not in its personification of supernatural entities, but in its gruesome depiction of real personalities.<br/><br/>some people claim that this movie, if shown to high-schoolers would provide them with a good reason to not do drugs.  but then again there are many violent movies depicting the murderer or rapist reaching his eventual death or jail sentence; the crime rate in america doesn't seem to be getting any lower.  this movie is not meant and will not stand as a public service announcement.  neither will it break any box-office records (unless it starts to have a blair-witch type following).  it gives us a realistic peek into the minds of lost people.  however, if there is such a movie that can persuade a ninth-grader to not start experimenting with drugs, it is definitely requiem for a dream.  such is its effect."

As an original and hard-hitting film, it makes its mark. It very accurately and quickly portrayed taking a hit with a few quick shots. There's a stronger emphasis on visuals than coherent story, however--I found myself concentrating on the camerawork at the expense of other aspects of the movie. Also, I could not finish watching it--during a scene where (SPOILER) Ellen Burstyn is being fed, Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are attending to his disgustingly infected arm and Jennifer Connelly is in some sort of group sex scenario, I had to get up and leave because I thought I was going to throw up in the theater. My nausea went away as soon as I was out. I've always had problems hearing people relate medical problems and been hyper-sensitive to portrayals of pain, so that might be why (or maybe the quick cutting did it). The last time I walked out of a movie was probably in the late 80s, however, so this was very unusual. It's especially unusual because I thought it was an interesting and original film.

Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly will probably never do better work in their lives.  And Ellen Burstyn...wow.  Watching this in a theater the same weekend her wonderful EXORCIST performance was re-released just reminds us all she is a national treasure.  In the end, many disturbing things happen to many people but nothing tears at your heart more than the simpleness and reality of her character's descent.  She is absolutely perfect."

","One complaint that I have with contemporary cinema is the dearth of empathetic characters onscreen.  Far too frequently do characters of depth and humanity appear.  When a film has both empathetic and non-empathetic characters it creates an interesting effect when trying to evaluate the total work.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream involves both kinds of characters.  I found myself totally involved with Ellen Burstyn's character -- it had substance, meaning and was performed with a skill that far exceeded her co-stars.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I could have cared less for the characters portrayed by Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly.  I found the juxtaposition of the Burstyn/Leto & Connelly stories fascinating, but I left the theater wondering what the director was trying to say.<br/><br/>Granted, I assumed that we were to feel sorry for all these tragic people as we watched them going into their downward spiral.  Were each of these stories overlapped simply for comparison's sake?  Or, were we supposed to feel equally disturbed by the events in Burstyn's and Leto's?  It seemed to me that Leto chose his path deliberately while Burstyn tragically lost her way.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is very striking, even if somewhat self-indulgent. (There came a point about midway through the film when I thought if I saw one more dilating pupil, I would lose my mind.)  And, although effective, the visual devices are not necessarily original, either.  Those who were impressed with the rapid cutting of the final portion of the film should take a look at D. W. Griffith's Intolerance -- a film made in 1916!  So much for ""cutting edge"" (pun intended).<br/><br/>All in all, an effective film, with Burstyn's performance a standout."

","I think everything has been said about this film so I won't repeat how powerful, orginal and audacious this film is.<br/><br/>What I found striking though, reading many of the comments, is that almost every review focused on the drug use and some even thought the film is anti drug propeganda that should be seen by schools. I think that is slightly naive and shows, with respect to the commenters, an ignorance and detachment from the issue. <br/><br/>Furthermore, and this is really the main point I am trying to make, I disagree that this film is about drugs. This film, in my humble opinion, is about addiction. As such, it is not real or hyper real. It is, following my thesis, a surreal analysis of human obssession, addiction, and the effects thereof. To support this view, merely look at the way Aronofsky juxtaposes the story of Ellen Burstyn's obssession with appearing on TV and the means taken with that of the kids' obssession with 'finding a way out' and the consequential drug addiction."

","So many others have contributed their comments on the stars and general style and arc of this film, so I will be more focused in this analysis on placing this film within a wider context.<br/><br/>After a number of films appeared in the 70s, 80s, and early 90s that stripped away at least some of the romanticism of drug use, Requiem For A Dream sets a new standard through which to see the new crop of upcoming drug films, including Traffic and Blow. Among the earlier efforts, I felt both Rush (a rather underrated film) and Drugstore Cowboy came closest to an accurate portrayal of the life cycle of using/abusing. Others have cited Christiane F also in this regard, though I have yet to see it. Other films, especially Bad Lieutenant, Liquid Sky and Trainspotting, were narratively driven more by their flashy stylistics than the story told through the characters, though the former has very subtle plot threads that appear above Abel Ferrara's stylistic excesses. Trainspotting tended to be romantic about drug use despite it's ""choose life"" metaphor. Films such as New Jack City cloaked any anti-drug messages amid the flashy excitement of the drug mafia. Perhaps King Of New York is a more balanced view in that regard, being actually a rather restrained Ferrara film, a kind of warmup to Bad Lieutenant. True Romance quickly abandoned any relation to accuracy in turning to a cartoon-like portrayal of the good guys versus the bad guys with the doomed couple in-between.<br/><br/>Though there have been any number of films in the later 90s that had drug use as a subtext (High Art, for example), the cycle of drug-themed movies has ebbed until the advent of Requiem For A Dream in late 2000. It surely takes off at a level beyond anything we've seen before. It is realistic: real and hyper-real at the same time, it shows us people like some we may know who want more out of life, and feel they deserve it now, so they take the short cut that drugs offer in many ways, shapes and forms. The incredible stylistic effort of Aronofsky's production puts the film form in place to drive the content - again, the story portrayed is quite simple, the message not quite so. It shows us escapism in any form can be a recipe for tragedy, with the outcome quite different from the desired result.<br/><br/>As I left the film, quite stunned in a way I have not felt since Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer, a woman asked me how I felt about the picture. I told her unless she had been around the block a couple of times, she may find the film hard to relate to (this despite Ellen Burstyn's part). I think anyone who has been in situations where drugs are seen as the goal to the promised land, with people around who literally proselytize drug culture as a model to be aspired to, can clearly see what's going on here. The forceful nature of this film may obscure some of its message, but upon careful examination the thematics of the film can be teased out."

","So I saw Requiem a while ago, and I feel it has been long enough ago that I can fairly evaluate it.  This is 8/9 of a great movie. Let me explain. I judge movie by three catagories: Direction, acting, and overall story.<br/><br/>In Direction, Aronofsky has employed some of the most visually stunning and novel camera tricks I have ever seen. His rapid fire cuts to his neurotic screen hallucinations are better than anything that has come before.<br/><br/>In Acting, Leto was wonderful. I felt for him at every turn. Even Marlon Wayans, who I generally dispise, was more than adequate. Jennifer Connely was also quite endearing. But I like many others was most drawn in by Ellen Burstyn. Here dessent into madness was nothing less than tragic.<br/><br/>And Finally in Direction.Now here is where I was less than satified. I broke this down into three subcatagories. Beginning, Middle, and End. the Beginning, we were introduced to the characters and shown there flaws and strengths magnificently. The middle played up there weaknesses which should have set up the ending where we show how there strengths would overcome their weaknesses. The end, um there was no end. I mean the movie is over, but as far as I could tell there was no adequate end to this movie. Yes, I know its an art house film and it doesn't have a happy Hollywood ending,but it was needlessly abrupt and depressing. Just thinking about Connelly, Burstyn or even Wayans end still depresses me.<br/><br/>

","Though I am pleased to see that most people have given this film very positive reviews, I had to laugh at some of the negative ones questioning the validity of Aronofsky's presentation of drug addiction, including those alluding to the film being anti-drug 'propaganda'.<br/><br/>Hello, all you deep thinkers.  This former IV narcotics addict can verify that ""Requiem for a Dream"" comes closer than any film I've ever seen (that's a whole lot of celluloid, folks) in portraying what addiction -- no matter what the chemical -- is really like.  With all due respect to good efforts such as ""Clean and Sober"" and ""Trainspotting"", none of those films takes us into the inner desperation, insanity (literally), anger, isolation, shame and hopelessness that addiction ultimately becomes, nearly as well as ""Requiem"" does.  If you haven't stolen or otherwise degraded yourself repeatedly to get a drug ""one last time"", used to overdose levels knowingly without wanting to, used drugs you hate just because they're there and something awful is better than nothing at all, become capable of hurting others you love intentionally when having to choose between them and the drug, lost the ability to function as a friend, worker, family member or citizen, and kept coming back for more because the compulsion and obsession overwhelmed everything you knew or wanted to do, then please do not pretend to be able to say whether this film is an accurate representation of drug addiction.  Thank you.<br/><br/>As for technical merit, the acting performances especially by Burstyn and Leto were absolutely brilliant.  I knew Burstyn was that talented, by Leto totally surprised me and gave one of the very best male lead performances of Y2K.  The script was flawless, the camera work inspired, the frequent flash sequences representing the process of getting loaded were cut to the bone. This is an exceedingly important film.  It's been over eleven years since I touched any mood-altering chemical, nor do I crave to use, but this film brought all that pathetic, degrading, relentless, bleak hopelessness right back.

Most interesting is the story about Sara Goldfarb, the mother of a junky who unknowingly gets addicted, herself.

","""Requiem for a Dream"" is easily one of the best films of 2000, one that deserves to be remembered for many years to come.  As I was watching this film for the first time, I was overwhelmed by Darren Aronofsky's bold film-making techniques.  By the end, however, I appreciated the immediacy and unabashed truthfulness they gave each scene.  Despite its often discordant style, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a moving film that flows seamlessly.  It contains many disturbing images, but never does anything seem thrown in just for the sake of shocking the audience.  What we get instead is a deeply felt story about four people whose lives are crippled by their addictions.<br/><br/>Many people have referred to ""Requiem for a Dream"" as an anti-drug movie, which it certainly is! It definitely provides a vivid account of how drugs complicate the lives of the four principal characters, as each slowly descend into his/her own personal hell during the film's wrenching climax. However, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is as much a film about human frailty and longing as it is an anti-drug movie.  It wasn't until the second time I saw this film that I recognized Sara Goldfarb's red dress as a symbol for the unattainable dreams that each character desires to fulfill.  The scene where Sara is visited by her son Harry and she tells him that the red dress ""is a reason to wake up in the morning"" really drives this point home.  She yearns for the time in her life when her husband was still alive and Harry was still close to her, much the same way that Tyrone yearns for the comfort and love he once felt in his mother's arms.  Also, in two dream sequences, Harry is seen approaching Marion, who is at the end of a pier wearing a red dress (an image that is used for the poster art for this film).  Such an idyllic scene as this is offset by other scenes depicting each character in the throes of their respective addictions.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn's fearless portrayal of Sara Goldfarb, the lonely and helpless widow beset by her addiction to diet pills, gives ""Requiem for a Dream"" its emotional center.  She deserves all the accolades she has received for this performance.  Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans also deserve recognition for their committed performances.  Matthew Libatique's photography and Clint Mansell's hauntingly dark score add immensely to this film.  And I really look forward to Darren Aronofsky's future films.  With ""Pi"", Aronofsky made a very promising start, and with ""Requiem for a Dream"" he lives up to that promise."

","Director Darren Aronofsky's previous film effort, known simply as Pi, didn't really impress me that much. It was an overly cryptic, gritty tale that seemed more tedious and frustrating than it was worth.  Requiem for a Dream is his newest outing. It's definitely not a pretty picture either, but it's certainly better and more effective. During the course of its running time, it's guaranteed to produce a cringe or a wince in almost any viewer. It's the kind of film with the capacity to disturb and produce a sense of relief when it ends, even though one is glad to have seen it. Ellen Burstyn is at her frumpy and neurotic best as a television-enslaved, middle-aged woman who gets caught in a drug-addicted frenzy of compulsive behavior. Greatly adding to the intensity and momentum of the story is a similar downfall her son (played by Jared Leto) also experiences.<br/><br/>A lot of what makes Requiem work lies in the film's breakneck pacing, structure and cinematography as the two lead characters race toward simultaneous self destruction in different, but equally frightening ways. Depictions of old apartments, bad areas of the city and wasted lives from the ravages of abuse have rarely been more harrowing. In fact, as the film's climax of final scenes unraveled, I was really beginning to squirm; I even toyed with the idea of leaving the theater. Yet like the characters, I was compelled to go all the way. Requiem for a Dream may be many things, and you may not want to see it again very soon. But it is undoubtedly original, unforgettable and a noteworthy contribution to the annals of cutting-edge filmmaking."

","Its easy to understand why some people were left feeling cold by Darren Aronofsky's second feature. It is very bleak. In a loose sense Aronofsky's first two films are outright horror films, each one a throwback to an older horror genre- Pi is the classic paranoid, mad doctor syndrome, and Requiem is reminiscent of the doom and gloom, anti-drug propaganda films made in the 50's and 60's. It is Requiems decidedly downbeat, hopelessness that first turns off many viewers, but the second complaint I heard was for lack of character development. Well, the characters aren't really the issue. Its not a film about whom these addicts are, it's about what happens to them. Like a boxing movie that's not about the fighters, but about the combat itself. If one wants to damn Aronaofsky for that, fine; it is a legitimate gripe since he could have easily fit a few more scenes of development into it, but I don't really think that was his concern. The downward spiral they all share is the focus, and Aronofsky does a good job of hitting the viewer with it like a brick."

","Not since viewing the the entire canon of Wilder's work way back in film school have I felt awe, gratitude and devotion for a director.  Mr. Aronofsky is the first cinematic master of the new millennium and I don't care how passionate or hot-headed that sounds, or how young he is. A director who can tread in such violence, darkness, and base human behavior and yield the enormous amount of compassion this film illicits on an emotional level is indeed a master.  Thanks to the brazen and courageous literary mind of Hubert Selby Jr., the material here was ripe for filmic interpretation - which Aronofsky has accomplished with jagged perfection - something the makers of ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"" missed entirely several years ago. The unflinching examination of human beings lost to their hunger for connection in a barren world yielded a level of soul identification in this viewer, also a director, previously unknown in my personal experience. The photography and sound design, HANDS DOWN, far supercede anything put out in Hollywood over the past five years, at least.  Finally, special effects used as an emotional construct rather than a tool of sensationalism - AND THEY MOVE US.  The score pushed the cinematic brilliance of the piece into the stratosphere with its subtlety, responsiveness, and power.  Last but first, there is no contest, in this year or any other of the past decade, for the best actress in any award pageant.  Ellen Burstyn has gifted us with a character whose devastation and helplessness is depicted with more raw, immediate, and fearless heart than any I can remember.  I was aghast at her nakedness in chanelling an utterly lost, heartbroken soul. Bresson said that great acting is not acting at all, and to that effect:  Burstyn IS.

","I have been telling my friends, those who go to see ""Batman Returns"" and ""Charlie's Angels,"" that the reason I do not go see those movies is because they are not reality, i.e. the good guy always wins, or the ending is shiny and happy.  I told them that if I was ever to make a movie, it would be based upon reality:  life is difficult, and we have to live with the choices that we make, and most of the time those consequences are not what we had hoped for.  Aronofsky drives this point home, excuse me, bulldozes, this point into oblivion.  Where ""Pi"" left the viewer undecided, and, in the case of this reviewer, a second screening of that movie confused me more, ""Requiem"" left little to the imagination, but much to the conscious mind. I left the theater wondering if I could sit through another movie such as this. The camera work and effects were some of the best in moviemaking to date; maybe not groundbreaking or earth-shattering, but in the context of this movie, so appropriate and disheartening.  The players played to an unbelievable level, especially Burston, who topped her ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" performance.  She was so stunning as an everyday addicted-to-life woman and (at one time) mother that I still am having trouble thinking of my own mother for fear that she may succumb to this way of living.  Leto was amazing enough to follow to any G-rated movie that he may do in the near future, which is hopefully never.  And Connelly was so convincing, so hurtful, that one cannot fathom all the pain much she causes amongst herself and Leto's character. It was reviewed that the viewer falls in love with the characters, but I take the contrary position.  These characters know that their choices are spiraling them down, yet do little to stop themselves due to their addiction and lack of love for anyone but themselves, except when withdrawal kicks in. No, I never found myself yearning for a happy ending, only for one that would spare ME the heartbreak and misery that they were subjecting themselves to. Now that I got to see the movie that I always wanted to make, I don't know that I ever want to see one again.  Maybe the everyday Peoria-living movie audience is right, Hollywood should be an escape.

It does take a poor director, though, to elicit wildly over-the-top performances, present scenes that drag and bludgeon his film to death with editorialising violin music. In addition, said director should not win any points for originality by filling his anti-drug manifesto with trippy hallucination sequences that seem designed for midnight viewings at art-house cinemas, leaning back in the front row with a joint in hand. ( And no, that's NOT how I watched the movie.) For all of the sturm and drang and distgusting little details -- ""EEWW! Look at his arm!"" the camera screams -- this is just another aestheticisation of the junkie lifestyle, and it's shameless how willing Aronofsky is to pull out a horror movie trick or two just to keep us from getting bored. He seems to be daring us to walk out, but the sad fact is that the horrors have no connection to the material: like Dancer in the Dark, this is just an exercise in sadism where the nasty bits serve no purpose in furthering the story. You might as well show someone kicking a puppy for two hours: I bet you could fool people into thinking that's ""visionary"" also. What I saw in this movie was a facile anti-drug message lost beneath a bunch of ""ain't it cool"" camera tricks and subverted by a screenplay that suggests the characters might have been happy as junkies if not for a few chance mishaps. ""Requiem for a Dream"" is bad, but it's also very ordinary. It doesn't leave a lasting enough impression to be considered a spectacular failure.

This film uses every method the medium affords to show how the characters feel and mixes that with the basic Aristotelean precept of completely fleshed out and well portrayed characters.  The acting is wonderful.  Try your hardest not to miss this film!"

It left me with stronger, bleaker emotions than any other movie. On the ride home I was lost in my own mind, unable to escape from the unspeakable horrors that I had seen.

","This film's effect is blinding....you don't realize the impact of all you've seen until after the viewing experience.  Though the content seems initially depressing, this film's draw is in the realistic portrayal of drug addiction's trance.  Every character is caught in the trace, so much so that their inevitable downward spiral still catches us offguard.  We are hopeful that some redemption takes place, but the director is brave enough to give us realistic resolutions that are, oddly enough, satisfying in their honesty.  Every performance hits notes that are honest, subtle, overt....true life.  Marlon Wayans' performance is so refreshing....there IS someone home....and he was finally given an opportunity to show a range of colors and emotions here...he deserves much praise for a great performance. Jared Leto, and, especially, Jennifer Connoly's performance, is heartbreaking.  See this film, as hard as it may be to watch, it is an unforgettable experience.

"apoclypze0","Null","0","0","15 December 2000"," excellent, if exaggerated, look at addiction
","""Requiem for a Dream"" is quite a powerful message film.  It tells the story of four major characters all with some form of an addiction; whether it be to heroin, cocaine or diet pills.  It builds up and glamorizes the stories of the characters, making you care for them, and then proceeds to flush their lives down the toilet.  Arnofsky's sophomore effort is overstylized and snazzy, but it's good to see that he has talent in his style.  The faults?  The script is rather unsensational, the acting is good enough but never as good as it could have been.  And the stories sometimes seem too exaggerated (Mrs. Goldfarb comes to mind) in order to make a point.  Often attempts at subjectivity seem overblown.  But other than that, the film is excellent and sometimes exceptional.  I don't think that I've ever seen such a harrowing, disturbing film.  Even when you think you can't stand to watch, you are always compelled to.  Arnofsky's style is awesome: original and effective in creating the tone for the film.  Another big plus--the score is fabulous and evocative, especially in the final montage of the characters' fates.  I don't think that the film is deserving of the NC-17 rating (or the adults only policy being enforced) like some other films which deserve it, since a powerful lesson is to be learned from ""Requiem"".  I don't see how anyone could want to use cocaine or heroin or anything like that after viewing this film. By the way, as powerful and excellent as ""Requiem for a Dream"" is, I have no plans to see it again; that would be somewhat masochistic.  It's so depressing and disturbing, I could never subject myself to it again.  Very very powerful, and incredibly worth seeing...once.<br/><br/>9/10"

","This is one of the best movies I've seen this year so far. Never had I been so impressed by the brilliant technical filmmaking on the harrowing and brutal subject of drug addiction. I hated Fight Club for reasons (self-conscious apathy and the ludicrous twist near the end single-handedly destroyed the whole film) but I absolutely loved Requiem for a Dream for good reasons. <br/><br/>I was hoping to see the film based on word of mouth but was initially disappointed in the first half hour. Then it became better and more enthralling as the film progressed and it becomes morbidly fascinating as the characters Harry, Marion, Tyrone and Harry's mother Sara - played by Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn - dwindles into the black hole of addiction that was haunting and frightening. I'll be able to shake off the nightmarish images of the demonic refrigerator and personal demise and depravity even for three hours after I saw the film as I write this.<br/><br/>Darron Aronofsky has made the landmark film (after his impressive debut Pi, for which he won Best Director at the Sundance Film Festival in 1998) that does not condemn nor glorify drug abuse and addiction. Instead, he shows us the cautionary tale of happiness and deep depression caused by abusing hard drugs and over-the-counter pills to the extent that it becomes mind-numbing and scary.<br/><br/>This is an important film that should become the required viewing for under-17 teenagers who have experienced substance abuse and liquor or are considering using drugs (with the exception of marijuana, which isn't a ""bad"" drug in my opinion). It is utterly hypocritical the underage moviegoers aren't allowed to see this film while they can get in to see R-rated movies like Fight Club and Scary Movie (the latter of which parents took the children to see in droves).<br/><br/>Screw the hypocrisy of MPAA and the theater managers.

Never has a decent into the deepest layers of hell been so strikingly filmed.  My only complaint is that the script itself is lacking in areas. The characters are given just enough to do before the slide begins (don't worry, that's no spoiler ... just look at the title of the movie), but while I appreciate when a director doesn't waste time, more time spent with these particular characters would have been appreciated even more.  However, that's my only complaint.  Visually, this is one of the most exciting films I've seen in years.  The performances are sound, with Ellen Burstyn giving us an Oscar-worthy turn.  The editing is especially incredible and should also be nominated (if the Academy has 1/4 of a brain between them all).

"Saber","10","0","0","9 December 2000"," Wow - some SPOILERS
","SOME SPOILERS<br/><br/>Before you categorize me in some sort of group of viewers, let me say that I am trying to stay as objective as I can.  I am a very critical person, and I analyze everything I see in a film.  It being filmed mainly around the neighborhood I grew up in, and having visited Sara's apartment complex numerous times as a child (coincidentally -to visit my own grandmother), I had a good time seeing ""home"" again.  Possibly that's why it hit me so hard, because it literally was ""so close to home.""<br/><br/>The fates of the individual characters are inevitable, the title is clearly a spoiler.  You know what will happen, and can deduce the general plot. Given that, it's difficult to point to something specific that makes this movie great, and allows the viewer to experience such shock.  We all know that Heroin is bad, but this movie takes addiction to another level.  I don't mean to spew cliches, but I sat in my seat shivering as the movie progressed.  I am not a film student, nor am I film critic, but I would say that any movie that brings out such emotion is doing something right.  I am sure it is difficult to portray such ugliness so beautifully, and so effectively.<br/><br/>It is 3:00 am, and I am still up having seen this movie just 4 hours before. I can't seem to find an adequate flow for my user comment, so I will jump in on another tangent.  Each of the characters paths taken individually do not work.  We simply wouldn't believe the path Sara takes.  In and of itself, it's probably too improbable.  Hope seems to be portrayed as a drug, and that aspect of her story I buy.  However, her drug addiction came out of no where, and it didn't really seem to flow well with the story.  I never did understand the motives behind the diet doctors, though Sara's motives were clear.  Frankly, I wouldn't care about Harry's faith.  It seems that justice is served (in a rather macabre way).  But I think that's precisely where this movie shines.  We aren't asked to justify or forgive anything any of the characters do.  We simply take a ride with them, and see the results. To that extent, this isn't a movie with entertainment value per se, but rather it is more like a roller coaster ride -an experience.  I felt like I was following each character into their own personal abyss, taking each step with them, and so, feeling each pitfall along the way.  Their pain became my pain, and I truly established a point of connection with at least some aspect of each character.  We wouldn't have nearly as much sympathy for Marion if we saw just her story.  She really is just a brat, with a rich daddy.  Obviously she makes a few mistakes (an understatement perhaps?), but there seems to be some sort of missing link.  What are her motives?  It seems that she is on easy street, why would she follow Harry so blindly? Why IS she so drawn to Harry?  Tyrone's character was probably the most shallow of all.  I never understood any of his motives, and didn't really see why he was so distraught.  There seemed to be some attempt to include his mother into the plot, but I didn't think it was too effective. Nonetheless, he keeps the story flowing well, providing us possibly with a more objective perspective of the other 3 characters.  Mesh the 4 together,<br/><br/>and you get a masterpiece of emotion.<br/><br/>I felt Sara's path was the most excruciating.  She was just an innocent and sweet old lady, who was driven to drugs by a false sense of hope.  Tyrone's faith is fairly straight forward.  Yet another dream destroyed.  Harry and Marion had the most obviously painful faiths.  Ultimately, their separation is what strikes a chord.  Marion had everything when she had love, and now all hope is lost, not even her love for Harry remains.<br/><br/>
Fitting, how there is no spring."

I wonder if in its time people saw ""reefer madness"" a film where a gifted young man with a dream ends up in jail, and his girlfriend in a mental ward, all because they smoked a joint, and reacted just like people did to this film. Lets look at this thing objectively; Point 1)This movie seems to miss is the purpose of bail. You do not actually need to post the entire amount. Also, you get all of that money BACK as soon as the person in question appears at the trial date. The state doesn't KEEP bail money. Its not a fine. Its collateral. Point 2) And possibly the DUMBEST thing in the film is how Harry and Tyrone are arrested because a doctor saw the signs of drug use. What exactly are they arrested for? It is NOT illegal to be a drug user. Its only illegal to possess drugs. It doesn't matter if you use them or not. What are they charged with? Track marks? Possessing money? Driving? I mean honestly.

For all the bleakness, for all the evocative hopelessness, the man still fails to grasp the most important thing a filmmaker needs to pull off: well-drawn, deeply felt characters. As game as the efforts of his actors are - and obviously Jennifer Connelly deserves a ton of credit for the chances she took - only Ellen Burstyn's performance suggests anything remotely like a real person, and Jared Leto's Harry is a cipher (in a synthetic, ineffective way).

It wasn't any of it.<br/><br/>There are several problems I had with this movie. The first and biggest was the style. Now, I love Tim Burton movies and I'm a Brian De Palma fan, so normally I like unusual and unique styles, however the visual style of ""Requiem for a Dream"" just didn't do it for me. In my opinion it also didn't do any good to the movie and the story. It made some of the emotional scene's even almost look comical like. I know the style was meant to give the movie a 'trippy' kind of feeling but if you truly want to have a 'trippy' movie experience watch ""Natural Born Killers"" instead.<br/><br/>I don't know but the movie also gave me the feeling that the cast and crew didn't really did much if any research on drugs and the effects. They could have had at least spoke to some (ex)-junkies or spend 10 minutes in a room with Courtney Love or sit down all together in an Amsterdam coffeeshop for a day. I don't really know why but the movie didn't gave me the feeling at all that they did any of this. Maybe if they had done this they also wouldn't have had miss cast Jennifer Connelly. I like her as an actress but she is far to pretty and 'normal' like to play a convincing drugs addict.<br/><br/>The story was also quite standard and pretty far fetched. I mean, if you're a drugs user this is about the extreme that could happen (but not the worst). I Only really liked the Ellen Burstyn story line. Mainly because Ellen Burstyn self acts wonderful and her character is the only one that doesn't start as an addict and is the most believable and emotionally involving one. <br/><br/>That brings me to another I had with the movie. I couldn't feel for the characters.<br/><br/>I make it sound like this is an horrible movie which I totally hate. But however this is not the case. There are enough positive things to say about this movie. Such as the hectic ending, that really made up a lot for me and nice little musical score by Clint Mansell was also good.

Amphetamines blow out pupils, heroin and opiates cause them to become near pin-points. Nitpicking? On something so basic, maybe not so much. Since they thought it was such a cool feature that they decided to show it EVERY time he got high, then perhaps they should have done the first iota of research and represented the drug properly.<br/><br/>It's like they took some of the DEA's most promising writers and shoved them in a room and said ""Go in and write a movie that will scare the kids sh*t-less against 'drugs' in general, don't worry about the facts.""<br/><br/>A couple of things:<br/><br/>Permanent amphetamine psychosis? Doesn't really happen...it almost *always* clears up after cessation of use. So the lady going in for electroshock? Pure BS.<br/><br/>Being arrested for seeking help at a hospital? Completely ridiculous, and it even sends a DANGEROUS message to kids who may be in trouble.<br/><br/>Uneducated kids have DIED because they were afraid they would be arrested at the ER. It's called patient/doctor confidentiality! Misinformation from ridiculous D.A.R.E. FEAR FILMS like this one are the reason some are reluctant to seek treatment. What about the problems caused by the LAW ENFORCEMENT end of the drug problem?<br/><br/>The final scene with it's absolutely annoying camera angles and near-snuff-level scenes of people being electrocuted and DYING in jail was enough to make me leave the room. Enough is enough. This movie is awful<br/><br/>This is nowhere NEAR a good representation of the lifestyle of a junkie. The movie is stuck so far up its own rear when it comes to its message that it loses any potency. <br/><br/>The characters are not believable addicts they all bumble around completely depressed all the time and when they are high it is depicted as some manic, terrifying madness.<br/><br/>It's as if the person who wrote it had absolutely no clue what the substances actually did to people, so he decided to act as though they were injecting gasoline instead...<br/><br/>It makes some valid points, but overall it comes across as a scare-flick made by an anti-drug advocate with an agenda. Sorry if you're one of the many fans of this movie. I saw it once when I was in high school, and now I've seen it again, 7 years later. Two thumbs down, what a piece of trash."

","I, like many other people on this website, watch movies with higher ratings because they seem like must see movies. The truth is this movie is different. I could see how someone would like it because it is a film that is different than anything I've ever seen. That aside, this movie was absolutely terrible. I've seen many drug type movies, mostly trafficking and distribution of drugs, and this is a very different viewpoint. I'm not going to ramble about how unique the film is, its unique and there's a reason there aren't many movies like this. The acting was terrible, there really was no plot, it was a journey through a worthless group of peoples lives. Confusing, plot less, and random. 2/10.

"MOscarbradley","3","2","5","7 July 2007"," Will make your head swim and for all the wrong reasons
","The worst kind of American art-house movie; it takes itself seriously and is so full of 'smart' cutting and transcendent photography it will make your head swim. It's about drug addicts and all the attendant horrors of addiction and Aronofsky films it like a very bad trip. Half way through the movie you feel like beating yourself over the head with a hammer, or better yet, beating Aronofsky over the head and from here it's all downhill.<br/><br/>The central characters are a boy and his mother. He's your typical screen addict, a young crack-head on a downward spiral. He's played by the handsome but inadequate and monosyllabic Jared Leto. Ellen Burstyn is his mother, lonely and with dreams of appearing as a contestant in a television show who becomes addicted to diet pills and prescription drugs and it's a monstrously over-indulgent piece of acting. The character never strikes you as being real, (very little in the movie does), so to show just how far gone her character is Burstyn keeps giving us The Mad Scene over and over again.<br/><br/>There are two other addicts in the film, the boy's girlfriend and his associate, and in these parts Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans are really very good. Their parts aren't particularly well-written but these two talented performers find a truth in their roles that rises above the formulaic junk. Indeed, this is probably the best acting that Connelly has yet done. But the movie's a downer and not for the reasons Aronofsky would have us believe."
"Percivalx","4","2","5","27 May 2007"," Dream Turns To Nightmare!
","Requiem for a Dream marks my first Darren Aronofsky film to date. In short, I am disappointed and has given me a bad first impression of the director. This overwrought public service announcement follows the lives of four people suffering the consequences of drug addiction. An interesting subject treated with the utmost superficiality. My major issue is with the script. It doesn't seem to be doing much except saying ""look how bad drugs are"". There's no deep or profound meaning on the subject matter and doesn't leave much for interpretation. Furthermore, I could not manage to muster an ounce of sympathy for any of the characters. The script simply lacked any real depth to make them remotely interesting or relatable. We basically just watch all of them crash and burn. It might be visually interesting but we never get to emotionally connect with any character. There's also Aronofsky's visual techniques which are quite striking at first, but after a while they get tiresome. The four principal actors do well enough given what they have to work with. Ellen Burstyn is most notable for her Oscar-nominated performance. But not even a good performance can redeem this relentlessly pretentious film. A Let Down!"

","DRUGS. SEX. VIOLENCE. DECAPITATED ARM. Requiem For A Dream is one of my newest favorite movies. Whoa this film was kick ass. It starred Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, and Jared Leto, yes that's Jared Leto from 30 Seconds To Mars, he was an actor before he became a musician, usually that means that he would be bad at one or the other but I like 30STM and Jared is a superb actor especially in this movie. Harry and his partner/friend, Tyrone have a plan to make it big in the heroin business. Unfortunately, their recreational drug use turns into day-to-day addiction, and things start to get ugly. REALLY ugly. Ellen Burstyn plays Harry's Ma Sarah, a lonely widow who wants to lose weight to fit into a red dress so she can appear on her favorite television show. She starts out by being addicted to TV and candy, but goes to a ""doctor"" who gives her RX for diet pills but they actually turn out to be speed. The four pills a day eventually don't become enough for her and she starts going crazy, I mean CRAZY. She thinks her refrigerator is trying to get her she sees people coming out of the television. Because the paper telling her when she's going to be on television never comes in the mail she goes out searching for the TV station, at this point in the movie she is tore up, big time. Someone calls the cops to come and get her and she is put into a mental hospital where they perform crazy experimental therapy on her. So basically her life is ruined. While all of that is happening Harry, Tyrone, and Harry's girlfriend Marion are trying to make it ""big."" They don't. They get doped up all the time and can't make rational decisions so all the money the have been saving up has been spent. They can't make it ""big."" Marion starts to become a little bitch and starts yelling at Harry because they're out of money and can't get high anymore so she decided since Harry can't provide for her anymore she'll just go suck this guy's cock for some moolah. Her life is ruined. At this time Harry and Tyrone are on their way to Miami because Tyrone thinks they'll make it ""big"" there. On their way down to Miami Harry's arm becomes more and more infected from improperly injecting heroin and he continues to inject heroin in to the pus filled arm. Finally Tyrone decides to take Harry to the doctor; well they do this in some redneck town where the doctor calls the cops rather than helping Harry. So Tyrone and Harry are now in jail with no one to help them. You think it can't get worse but, bam! Harry collapses and the officers are forced to take him to the hospital. His whole arm is black and purple and the injection site is bubbled up and orange, it was sick but cool. Then they show an over view of everyone else's lives and how they're ruined and when they come back to Harry he wakes up in a hospital and doesn't have a left arm. DRUGS RUIN YOUR LIFE BIG TIME. Funny and Sad Movie."
"track8-1","10","2","5","15 April 2006"," Should have won an Oscar...
","""Requiem for a Dream"" is the follow up to Darren Aronofsky's highly acclaimed movie ""Pi"". Requiem was debuted in 2000 along with blockbuster hit ""Gladiator"", a Ridley Scott film that ,to me, falls short on the way of telling a ""Best Picture of the Year"" story. ""Requiem for a Dream"", sadly, didn't even get a nomination for best picture but the 2000 ballot was crowded by dreadful snoozers such as ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". ""Requiem"", on the other hand, is shocking, eye-opening, and demands to be seen. ""Requiem"" is the story of four individuals in Coney Island that are trying to make their dreams come true but are constantly consumed by their addiction to drugs. This movie hits hard with mind blowing visuals, some of the best acting I have ever seen in a movie, and a soundtrack by the Kronos Quartet that would impress even the most finicky music critic.<br/><br/>The movie sets up with Sara Goldfarb, a lonely, TV obsessed widow, and her son Harry, his girlfriend Marion, and his drug dealer friend Tyrone. The three teenage friends all have mild addictions to heroin and in the opening sequence are seen stealing Sara's, the main characters grandmother, television in order to pay for their next fix. At the same time Sara receives a phone call requesting her appearance on her favorite TV show. Harry and Tyrone have dreams of starting a big drug business and Marion has her own dreams of opening a fashion store and selling her designs. As the film progresses their addictions become severe and they keep slipping away from what they initially sought out to do.<br/><br/>The biggest mistake, I believe, that the academy made in the 2000 Oscars was not giving Ellen Burstyn the award for best actress. Instead Julia Roberts won for Erin Brockovich. Although I do believe that Erin Brockovich was Julia Roberts best performance it does not even compare to the breathtaking performance of Ellen. Ellen had to put up with putting on 4 hours worth of makeup every morning, wearing four different necks, two different fat suits, and nine different wigs throughout the movie and she was still able to give a performance that made me believe that I was going through what she was going through; that I was there with her.<br/><br/>The style of the movie is very quick and demanding. Most movies have between 600 and 700 cuts. Requiem for a Dream has over 2,000. Also, Aronofsky uses many trick shots such as mounting cameras on actors or even dropping cameras off building hooked up to bungee cords. This makes for an amazing visual film but, if you can't even watch an MTV music video without feeling sick this movie might not be for you. It has many graphic scenes including those that contain the using of drugs, strong sexual acts, language. This film originally got a NC-17 rating but lowered that down by deleting a few sexual scenes. The film is now available in both formats: the original, director's cut, and the edited version. Either way this movie is a great milestone in film production and story telling. I definitely suggest picking this movie up next time your at a the videostore."
"Gubby-Allen","3","2","5","21 February 2002"," Not for me
","Normally when I dislike films, I launch a tirade of abuse about them, but that would be harsh on this, even though I couldn't stand it.The core of the actual story was good. It was everything else about it that was a problem, and everything in the film seemed too over emphasised.<br/><br/>I've never taken any drug so I'll sit on the fence as to whether it was an accurate portrayal. It was however an irritating portrayal, by the end.<br/><br/>
I'm in a minority with the Snatch & Fight Club style editing and cinematography in these films but I can't stand it. The split screens, slow motion, fast forwarding and even the music, although not complicating the film, just seem to serve to lessen the continuity and eventually irritate.<br/><br/>Reqiuem for a Dream wasn't a long film, so couldn't really have been shortened. That created a problem in that any of: the Fridge moving, the cocaine being snorted, the mum on the TV show and lots more had all been flogged to death by the end. Each time I saw the face of, I think Washington? on the money I knew I could have a drink and look out the window for the next 30 seconds as nothing different would happen to the previous 10 times it was done.<br/><br/>Again, I'm in a minority but I would have liked this film a little more if it was tackled in a more conventional manner ie without the fancy editing and graphic detail, as there was much promise with the story. On the plus side though, the acting was almost faultless.<br/><br/>Rightly or wrongly, I Interpreted this as Anti-drug, even though the film never dictated that to the viewer. I don't shock easily, and found the drug snorting in Boogie Nights, far more graphic & off putting than here. But if this film prevents a few extra people from becoming an addict, I suppose it's served a purpose.<br/><br/>I just don't get enthralled when drugs is the central point of a film. Not that that means I don't think they have a place or purpose in cinema. They do. You can't brush  it under the carpet. But people who've no time for football or golf, wouldn't get over pleasured from films on those themes, in the same way I don't on drug addiction.<br/><br/>Finally, the last 10 minutes went a little over my head and any ideas what the name was of Tyrones girlfriend?<br/><br/>3/10"
"mattymatt4ever","5","2","5","24 May 2001"," Style outweighs substance
","""Requiem"" suffers from what I call the ""Thomas Crown Affair Syndrome."" Darren Aronofsky tries hard to dazzle us with visuals so much that it gets exhausting and repetitive after a while, just like the overuse of split-screen technology in ""Thomas Crown.""  There are some haunting montages, like the one at the end, which I thought was edited very well and done very well, but most of the time they just look either foolish or unnecessary.  <br/><br/>The characters are underdeveloped, and the whole film seems to function on a superficial level.  There's a fine line between substance and pretention. This movie uses more of the latter.  It does have redeeming qualities like a career-making performance for Jared Leto, who was terrific and feigned a very convincing Brooklyn accent, and a great original score.  Ellen Burstyn's performance was good, though I didn't think it was worthy of an Oscar nomination.  I have to admit that making herself look more unattractive by the minute was a huge risk, though, and I have to commend her for that.  <br/><br/>""Requiem for a Dream"" would've been more effective if it didn't depend almost solely on flashy direction.  The style outweighs substance, and after watching this film I was more exhausted than stunned.<br/><br/>My score:  5 (out of 10)"
"=G=","6","7","31","23 May 2001"," A very over-rated disappointment.
","""Requiem..."" tells of the downward spiral of several lives into a drug induced oblivion. A much over-rated non-story which won no major awards, this extrapolation of the ""Pi"" mentality treads more in the the artsy-fartsy fringe than the mainstream offering an excellent performance by Burstyn, over done artistic effects, and little else. There are many better ""druggie"" flicks with real stories to tell which don't make the viewer feel like a lookie-loo at a traffic accident.<br/><br/>Because of it's overwrought creativity, which is more of a liability than an asset, ""Requiem..."" is the critic's darling. However, it is too far from the mainstream to be a popular which probably accounts for the small space occupied on Blockbuster's shelves by the new release. Blockbuster -does- know their market. As for the high marks given by IMDB.com users, one can only speculate. However, there's no way this flick could possibly score an 8.7 of 10 (at this writing) given voting by a demographically typical cross-section of the population. Over half the votes a max score of 10....I don't think so.<br/><br/>Recommended for those into art for art's sake films and younger adults who haven't seen this kind of kaleidoscopic visual creativity before."

","I like Darren Aronofsky, and Requiem for a Dream is one of his better and I think his most powerful film. I love the style in which it is filmed, there are lots of split-screen technique, exaggerated sound effects and huge close ups, and all these manage to be stylishly used. The music is stunning too, Aronofsky directs superbly and the script is brutal and very honest. Requiem for a Dream has one underlying theme, the creeping menace of addiction, this theme is explored in a lot of forms and with chilling and compelling effect. Not only that, the highs and lows of drug-taking are conveyed. The story is hard-hitting, moving and draws you in and the characters feel real. The acting helps with this, Ellen Burstyn is amazing and gives one of the best performances of the decade. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are also excellent, and Marlon Wayans I think hasn't been better. In conclusion, a powerful film, while not all people may like it it is for me one of the most important films on this subject. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

If you want to see a movie about druggies, see Trainspotting."
"TheMarwood","1","2","6","23 September 2014"," Drama reaches hysterical heights
","Before Darren Arnofsky found his footing as a strong director, namely Pi, but especially Requiem for a Dream felt like film school exercises. Whatever little substance there might be is crushed under the weight of a director who throws split screens, frame rate effects, cameras mounted to the actors, fisheye lenses inches away from faces and an endless grab bag of visual gimmicks that sits uncomfortably between amateurish and pretentious. The director is the star here and the film suffers from it. The characters are about as fleshed out as your standard uninteresting junkie usually is and while Ellen Burstyn gives a decent performance with this material, her downward trajectory as a diet pill popping old lady who wants to be on television - is so over the top that it becomes almost comedic. The characters are never engaging and watching these cardboard cutouts on a hardcore afterschool special path of self destruction, is no more substantive than watching a young director play in a new sandbox with all the split screens and gimmicks at his disposal."

","Requiem for a dream is by far the most overrated and hyped film i've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>I admit the film is well made, the acting is OK for most of the time and Jennifer Conelly is hot.<br/><br/>Still, that does not, in any way cover up the lack in story, message or interesting characters. Basically it's about three heroine addicts, Harry, Marion and Tyrone. It works pretty good for a short time for them, but sometime they run out of drugs and Harry and Tyrone drive down to Florida. Harry loses his left arm and Tyrone ends up in prison. Meanwhile Marion has to prostitute herself for drugs. End of the main story. You don't think thats a good story? Well it isn't! <br/><br/>The message clearly is: STAY AWAY FROM DRUGS! Guess what? Everybody knows that already, whats the big deal? Do people really feel sorry for Junkie and Dealer to end up in prison or lose his arm because he can not find another spot to inject his drugs (big logical hole!) <br/><br/>Only the side story about the mother taking medication and going crazy because of it, is almost interesting, but then again not too interesting."

Also, having just read the wide variance in reviews, there's not much in my reaction to what I'm seeing that varies from a lot of others who didn't care for this.<br/><br/>Except I'm not seeing this as an anti-drug movie in any way. I did have those original reactions, like this was just a more styleized version of anti-school specials, but that's not accurate here, because the director doesn't seem to be making any real anti-drug statement. All we're doing here is watching people we never really started to care about descend into a state where the only entertainment factor becomes lurid, prurient, and sadistic.<br/><br/>So, unless I'm easily manipulated into caring about characters that don't seem real to me, or even if they did, I wouldn't care about, all that's left is going to the freakshow. And I guess I've never found that entertaining.<br/><br/>What I do find lacking from this movie, to its credit, is the mean-spirited, taking of pleasure in the misfortune and suffering of others I've found in the works of other directors like Todd Solendz, Larry Clark, or Harmony Korine. But I'm not convinced showing putrid aspects of human nature equates with honesty in any real way.<br/><br/>These just aren't characters I care about. I like some of the style going on here. I enjoy the baseline of the women in chairs in front of the building providing a hum drum contrast to what happens to the main characters.

Many filmmakers pay little to no attention to that aspect, but it seems to be the majority of time was spent on composing and collecting the music for the film.<br/><br/>The film's imagery is immaculate. Many will say the film was made to show imagery, but on the contrary, it is nearly impossible to truthfully say so, as the imagery, however grotesque and bitter, is still woven strictly into the storyline as just an aesthetic add-on.<br/><br/>For the fourth section, the film isn't only very well made, but most of the facts you see are true. The story shows the extents people will go to get that next high. The ways shown in the film are just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. There are so many more things to go along with sex trafficking and amputated limbs.<br/><br/>Many low-rate reviews are focusing on a few points of the movie that the writers felt were ""bad parts.""<br/><br/>1. I've read many reviews pointing out that the doctor toward the end wouldn't treat Harry, and that could result in his receiving a lawsuit and that it is unreasonable to think a doctor wouldn't treat a patient, especially in the condition he was in. In actuality, that sort of thing happens all the time. When an obvious drug-abuser is sitting in your hospital, you have a choice: run the risk of killing the patient; not knowing what drugs they were using and giving them a specific medicine may turn fatal. As a doctor, being the catalyst of someone's death is not on your top 10 list. So it makes sense not to treat Harry at that time, because it was obvious that there was no over-dosage, so leaving him be wouldn't kill him.<br/><br/>2. Many also said that the pimp for Marian was an idiot to pay for hookers with drugs. Again, that's incorrect. This happens more often than not. He doesn't pay for reputable hookers. He pays for girls who have a lack of a better idea. Marian is given his phone number as a ""shove it"" move from Harry, but she later acts upon being given that number. As she is in desperate ""need"" of drugs, she is willing to do anything for them. Hence, her lesbian sex scene.<br/><br/>3. Sara Goldfarb and Harry Goldfarb's relationship is forced. Reading this idea, I was, at first, confused. The relationship is contrary to what the popular belief on the subject is. Sara is aware of Harry's problem in the opening of the film. She knows he's a drug-addict, but doesn't quite understand how she's fueling his ability to be one. When she ends up becoming one herself (when Harry visits her), she doesn't notice her behavior because she hasn't been around her son's drug-abusive behavior, so it slips from her mind. She finally realizes her problem at the very end of the film when she walks out and sees her friends sitting at the table. This, again, slips her mind when she is watching her show in the asylum.<br/><br/>4. Finally, the ""I want to be on TV piece is poorly motivated."" I've read countless times that being on a TV show wouldn't do anything for her. This was the hardest one to swallow, because that means the central idea of Sara has been lost for so many people who viewed the film, which is by far the reason the film was so well done. Sara Goldfarb has lost her husband, and her son. When Harry visits her and she says ""I lost you,"" she is not referring to him being away. She is giving her confession that she knows what he would do with the TV and that she knows what he would do with the money he got from the TV. The whole time, she had hidden from him the fact that she knew. This is why she wants to be on television, because she knows that when she tells Harry, it'll be all over. We see how this affects him, due to his physical appearance, and his mental instability from that point on to either end of the film. She wants to be ""on her show"" because that's the last thing she can look forward to, as well as her last chance to help Harry get away from his addiction, however it backfires on her, and she ends up getting an addiction herself.<br/><br/>With a film so well thought out, and perfectly finished; polished with the shiniest substances, you may wonder why so many low ratings are given, but it is simply due to peoples' lack of observation in the film."
"Prismark10","6","1","2","6 November 2016"," The Hit
","Requiem for a Dream is a grim, intense, choppy, trippy film about drug abuse. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a frumpy retiree who watches television all day, she wants to fit into her red dress as she believes she will appear in her favourite show and is on diet pills to lose weight. The pills are actually amphetamines and they make her hallucinate.<br/><br/>Her son Harry (Jared Leto) is a drug addict, he steals from her, he is gaunt from the drugs, his arm ruined by the injections. His girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) is on a downward spiral, to score, to survive she will have to take part in sex parties, humiliating herself. Their best pal Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) realise that the their drug addiction has overtaken their lives and they are heading for the bottom of the barrel.<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky is fascinated by the use of the camera and sound. He uses split screens, fast cuts, speeded up editing, flashbacks to show the characters wanting their drugs, then the effect of the hit and later the withdrawal.<br/><br/>It is an assault on the senses, it is also a provocative film but I felt that the visual tricks were disguising a thin story."
"DVR_Brale","9","1","2","8 September 2016"," Dreadful, disturbing, grievous and most serious movie with superb acting
","I've been thinking lately why is this movie named Requiem for a Dream. Now I realize: drugs end even the most beautiful dreams.<br/><br/>All characters in this movie have something in common, apart from being addicts. That is, all of them have a dream for a better future. All of them suffer from some emotional wounds and give in only to relieve themselves, at least for a few moments. Sadly, pursuing temporary relief distracts us from dealing with real problems. Those problems continue to grow and eventually come upon us thus ending our dreams for better times. That's why Requiem for a Dream. Title suggests that we are not going to see a happy ending but a sad one put in contrast with life protagonists deep inside want to live. I still remember crying together with Sarah Goldfarb when she hugs her successful son in her beautiful red dress she wanted to fit so much into.<br/><br/>Let me now comment on Ellen Burstyn performance. I've never seen better female performance as a leading actor. It's very unfortunate she didn't win an Oscar for this role she was nominated for. Scene where she's talking with her son about how lonely she feels is the most convincing play ever. Her face is exposed full screen for two long straight minutes. There's an interesting story accompanied with this scene. If you look it carefully, you're going to see that there is something wrong with the camera. That's because one of the camera men began to cry while filming the scene. I challenge anyone to name more convincing performance than this monologue. Really, her performance is breath taking...<br/><br/>If Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans didn't perform excellently as well, Burstyn would have overshadowed them. Harry (Leto) and Marion (Connelly) together form a couple worth watching. Both of them had tough roles to play but succeeded in doing well. Both of them were young at the time when this movie was shot and both grew up to become great actors and were awarded with Oscar. Ellen is over eighty now and still plays regularly... Wayans was extra cool as Tyrone but nowadays takes much lesser roles. This movie wouldn't be as near as good as it is if acting wasn't superb.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream was edited in a hip-hop style which may confuse some viewers. I liked it! It somehow immersed me in the world where Harry, Marion and Tyrone live. This world is extremely disturbing. That's why RfaD is not a movie I could recommend watching. For some viewers seeing it might be a terrifying and dreadful experience, especially last few scenes. I really don't recommend seeing this movie if you're under eighteen even though some recommend seeing it as an anti-drug prescription. This might be true but it's certainly true that RfaD causes anxiety.<br/><br/>Let me conclude: RfaD is very disturbing and scary indeed. However it has a strong anti-drug message. If you're easily disturbed, seeing this one might be a bad decision. If not, Marion, Sarah, Harry and Tyrone are going to stick with you for a very long time."

"sandnair87","9","1","2","17 December 2015"," More A Nightmare than A Dream, 'Requiem for a Dream' is An Addiction In Itself!
","'Requiem for a Dream' - What an inappropriately dozy title for such an explosive film! Darren Aronofsky's nerve-corroding adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel depicts drug abuse's annihilative properties using a sobering sensory blitzkrieg. It takes four relatively happy and balanced individuals and it watches almost clinically as each one messes up his existence through addiction.<br/><br/>Set in Brooklyn, we first meet the characters when Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) comes round to his mother Sara's (Ellen Burstyn) for his regular habit of pawning her belongings in order to buy drugs. Swiftly afterwards, we meet the other two main characters: Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend Tyrone (a barely recognizable Marlon Wayans). The movie then follows its inspired three-act structure of 'Summer', 'Fall' and 'Winter', as the characters chase their various dreams and obsessions. Harry, Marion and Tyrone are all hooked on drugs and they dream of being 'on Easy Street' – to that end, they conceive a plan to buy, cut and sell heroin, but they soon get a little too fond of their own product. Sara, meanwhile, is also addicted, to her daily routine of coffee and television, specifically a show that is part infomercial, part game-show. So when she gets a routine junk-mail call that appears to promise her a place as a contestant, she starts to obsess about fitting into an old red dress, and becomes hooked on amphetamines as a result. Visions of luxury become inescapable nightmares of insatiable itches — to be thin, rich, applauded, feared. Requiem for a Dream glamorizes nothing en route to a near-nauseating finale. As the absence of 'Spring' in the chapter titles hints, it's a near-operatic descent into hell for all concerned! Darren Aronofsky is a visceral film-maker, and here he pulls out all the stops to create a truly hypnotic experience. He repeatedly shows us the various junkie 'routines' of cooking, shooting up, or of making coffee and popping pills, shot in close-up and edited together rapidly. When added to Clint Mansell's aching, agonizing score that crescendos to audible reckoning, this has the intended effect of conveying the sudden rush the characters are experiencing, as indicated by the repeated shots of dilating eyeballs that end each montage.<br/><br/>As his four ill-fated characters, Mr. Aronofsky assembles an unexpectedly strong cast. Both Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans give commendable performances. Jennifer Connelly imbues her character with vulnerability and sexuality even as she stares pale-faced into the bathroom mirror desperate for a fix. As for Ellen Burstyn, she's brutal to watch. You really see her deteriorate before your eyes, going from Mommy dearest to that whacked out old hag raving in the subway. Burstyn gets thin, then thinner, her hair dye gets uglier and uglier, her make-up messier, always more obsessed with her game show and her stupid red dress. The actress manages to trace a frighteningly real portrait of emergent obsession fueled by loneliness, sadness and vanity.<br/><br/>Yes, visually this is an exhilarating, unique film. But it is also a singularly difficult and challenging film to watch. More a nightmare than a dream, Requiem for a Dream becomes an addiction in itself."
"datorsiers2","9","1","2","23 July 2015"," Makes you feel
","The movie isn't really showcasing exceptional plot or film making, here it is all about the emotions and sending a message. Requiem for a dream does a great job with really getting you sucked into the movie and it kind of makes you feel remorse for the characters, despite all of them being stupid drug addicts.<br/><br/>The main point was to show how horrible and disgusting is the life of a drug addict, it showed their ''highs'' and their ''lows'', ''highs'' being when they were using the drugs and making some money, or in Harry's moms case just getting slimmer. All the characters ended up having to be alone and miserable, nobody was happy. I liked that the movie showed Harry's mom going insane just because she wanted to be thin, shows that people's lives can go downhill just because of a silly reason like that and without even knowing that they get hooked on dangerous drugs. A good point was the way the guys lost all their money just as fast as they had earned it, that is just how it can be when you get involved in drug dealing, i found that to be the greatest aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>Definitely a must watch, don't look for plot in this movie, it is basically non existent, enjoy the emotions and feel for the characters!"
"vishaal811","10","1","2","22 June 2015"," A Unique Cinematic Experience
","Well, this movie has style, whether it is the fast cuts, split screens or the fantasy sequences, the director manages to weave it all in despite being a low budget movie. I watched Requiem For a Dream after watching Black Swan, also directed by Darren Aronofsky. I must say that this is one of the best psychological movies you will ever see. An elderly woman receives an opportunity to appear on television due to which she decides to lose some weight in order to appear beautiful on air. As dieting fails to deliver results, she decides to go to a ""doctor"" who gives her pills that will magically reduce her weight. What she doesn't realize is that the pills are probably drugs that will not benefit her in the long run. Although the movie is filmed on a meagre budget, it has a brilliant cast consisting of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly. Ellen Burstyn gives a truly mesmerizing performance which probably deserved an Oscar. The soundtrack is spectacular and the main theme is one of the most widely used tunes in sports videos. This is the kind of movie that will make you believe in the power of good filmmaking."
"brianberta","8","1","2","13 June 2015"," A horrifying but honest look at drug use
","I found Requiem For a Dream to be much more scarier than most modern horror movies nowadays. It is probably one of the most horrifying horror movies created. This movie details how 4 people have their lives ruined as a result of repeated drug use. The film shows how their actions affect their lives. This is a movie where you can't watch it a second time. It has nothing to do with its quality but the reason is because you don't know if you can put yourself through another viewing of it. What makes this film so horrifying is that the events that are detailed can actually happen and they have happened before. The first 2/3 of this are bearable but near the end, it gets highly frightening as it shows how their actions effected them. The acting is magnificent. All main characters give strong performances which allow us to get more immersed in certain parts of it. Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely did amazing performances and Marlon Waynes was a shocker in such a serious role. Sara (played by Ellyn Burnstyn) is the saddest character who we feel sorry for the most. She plays someone who gets addicted to diet pills her doctor prescribes. I felt sorry for the rest of the characters but I felt sorry for Sara much more. This film must be watched by everyone. Not just for its frightening imagery but for its educational value. In school, we've been told ""don't do drugs"" several times in but in order to know how truly frightening the consequences of drug use can be, you need to watch this film. It's hard to watch but it will stick with you long after viewing it. This is by far the most powerful anti-drug film ever made."

"Tolvarion","8","1","2","16 May 2015"," A glimpse of the dark side
","In a time with media depictions of lives and lifestyles with relatively unproblematic views of drugs and their effects on individuals and society, Requiem for a Dream captures the other side and its imprisoning darkness. With increasing force, this movie beats at you with such intensity and emotion that you want to curl up and avert your gaze, and at some points I almost did. At the same time, it had me hooked, especially through the use of extraordinary cinematography and accompanying score. If you are prone to empathising with your characters, it is not going to brighten your day, but it will surely make you feel, think and wish to intervene, while repeatedly denying you just that. In a way, the movie is like the world it portrays - an emotional, unrelenting and unforgiving experience."

","""Requiem for a Dream"" tells the story of 4 people, connected either through blood or some kind of personal relationship, whether it be family, girlfriend, or business partner. Although the characters lived far from what you and I would consider to be normal lifestyles, they shared something in common with each and every member of the audience; hopes, aspirations, dreams. Sara Goldfarb (played so wonderfully by Ellen Burstyn) dreams of one day being on a TV show, and one day, gets her chance. She fantasizes about how she could wear her favourite red dress, that she wore to her sun's graduation, on television. However, upon trying to wear the red dress, Sara discovers that she has gained some weight over the years and tries desperately to lose her weight, eventually resorting to medication. All of the characters have drugs (the bad kind) affect their lives, which eventually take over their lives. The movie documents how for each of the 4 people are effected and eroded by drugs.<br/><br/>The look of the film is extremely stylized, but justifiably so. Aronofsky uses surreal imagery as a vehicle for realism, something that really works when done well, and done well it was. By using a combination of slow and fast motion shots, extreme close-ups and more edits than you can shake a stick at, Aronofsky successfully brings the audience into the world and mind of someone with a drug problem. The audience visually experiences first-hand what it is like to be 'scared' or 'high' - all this in 3rd person; all this in the comfort of the theatre chair.<br/><br/>Of course, all of this effort would be in vain if it didn't mean anything at the end. The film leads the audience down a spiral of addiction until the grand finale, which features a montage of graphically intense scenes and images with more edits per second than any film. The pacing at the end, when compared to earlier parts of the movie, was so fast I started to find it hard to keep up, and literally took my breath away as the credits came up. All in all, the effect was amazing, and something that I have not personally experienced when watching any film before."
"emikegriff","9","1","2","26 April 2015"," A Powerful Experience
","To start this off, I have two things to say about Requiem for a Dream. Firstly, this is the most disturbing film I have ever seen. Secondly, it is one of the best ever made. The film is shot beautifully utilizing very unique shots including the split screen shot which allows you to see multiple perspectives of what is happening at the same time whether in the same room or across the country. Another technique is the usage of drug use montages such as the very famous montage of preparing and taking heroin. Never before has a film's style and angle made you think so hard about what is trying to be portrayed. <br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is extremely intense and very hard to watch. It is horribly depressing and really takes the energy out in a very powerful way. It makes you rethink your ideas about drug use and the struggles of many people that use them. The film seems very realistic and the characters are acted to perfection. How these actors haven't gone on to do more contemporary movies is beyond me. <br/><br/>For those that find grotesque movies such as this hard to stomach, I think that the movie is similar to A Clockwork Orange. It is very disturbing and upsetting to watch, but it is something so powerful that everyone should experience it. I am generally hesitant to call any piece of art ""life-changing"", but Requiem for a Dream could easily change the way one views the society around them. This is a masterpiece of film and should be experienced by all."
"joemike1999","10","1","2","27 November 2014"," Amazing
","This is my favorite movie of all time and can watch it multiple times without getting bored. I think that all the actors in this movie are fantastic in their roles and that if you are to watch, if you haven't already, then especially listen to the music. The music is what won me over most of all in this movie and really fits the scenes through out the movie. This movie takes you through the drug addictions of 4 characters and how it would affect their lives, and how as soon as you get to the addiction stage of these drugs then you will do whatever you can to keep them up. This is a fantastic movie in my opinion and would recommend it to any and everyone."
"shubhojoy","10","1","2","18 November 2014"," A film noir that leaves you shaken to the core
","The film starts innocently enough to put the viewers at ease until things start to take a turn towards progressively horrific. It's as if the four main characters are caught up in personal nightmares of their own with intersecting scenes. And its at those intersections that drug usage manifests itself in its true disturbing real life aspect.<br/><br/>The treatment of the film is novel and just appropriate. There's a touch of humour, in retrospect a black humour in the devices that are used, especially the camera movements and staccato frames of presentation when the young people are chasing the white powder.<br/><br/>While the protagonist's mother becomes addicted to ""weight losing"" pills, the protagonist and his girlfriend become progressively desperate to score more drugs for which they need money. It's as if they have been drawn into an endless nightmare from which there is no escape without losing all sense of dignity and the ownership of one's own body. Every character experiences this in their own way.And perhaps here is where the film delivers a message unambiguously to everyone out there: drug addicted people are either scorned by the general public or in worst cases used in a manner that is inhuman as it is criminal. It exposes the society's unforgiving ways and the hypocrisy of the affluent.<br/><br/>Of course the film was never made in order to convey a message but to honestly recreate the lives of addicted people and the tragedy they will inevitably have to go through. In a short period of time they will see their most cherished dreams, dreams that were pretty much within reach or do it seemed become unlikely fantasies or even caricatures of those dreams.<br/><br/>From a beautiful blooming romance, their drug usage leads them to the sleazy and dangerous paths where the young girl is taken advantage of in a more and more demeaning manner bu individuals who are experts at using women who need money. Meanwhile the protagonist and his friend moves from trouble to trouble from street violence to finally incarceration for drug usage.<br/><br/>The protagonist's mother had become a victim of an unscrupulous who prescribes psychotic drugs so that their patients who want to lose weight are easily able to diet. But as her condition progresses from bad to worse, her drug intake increases without any limits while she begins to hallucinate. Much later when she fails to respond to standard medications for her addiction, she is talked into a radically new approach which consists of passing electric shocks directly to the brain.i The end of the movie does nothing to resolve and reassure the audience but hints at more misery to come because there is no hint of even a speck of light at the end of a dark an deep tunnel. Overall, it's once of those movies which are very gripping yet you wish you did not want to see, especially because of the ending. In it's depiction of addicted people, the movie's stylisation does not make it yet another docudrama with emphasis of the gory dtails of drug intake and following euphoria and a steady progression to illness associated with heavy use. For sure all those things are there but the director treats them as repetitive motif from scene to scene while a very tragic drama plays itself out. one of the most accurate scenes in the movie is the protagonist's mother's hallucination or hallucinatory dreams."
"jonruff108","9","1","2","8 August 2014"," The most disturbing and depressing movie I've ever seen.
","FYI: I watched the original, NC-17 version.<br/><br/>There's no doubt this movie has been reviewed by thousands of other people here on IMDb so it seems rather pointless to add another but I still feel inclined to share my thoughts and feelings of this fantastic movie.<br/><br/>I didn't know what to expect going in. I hardly had a clue what it really was about other than that it involved drugs and, one of my favorite actors, Jared Leto. While it is quite possibly the hardest movie I've watched, it is also one of the best directed, acted, and edited.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is more interesting than anything else. The characters and their motivations are unfolded slowly and the quick and clean editing and cinematography keeps the audience completely engaged. There are some really neat camera tricks that are actually quite creative and bring the character's perspectives closer to you.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie is where things start to unravel more quickly and violently. Characters become more desperate and are willing to go to any lengths to get what they want, and, in effect, the on screen images slowly become more disturbing and gut-wrenching to watch. There were multiple times when I was unknowingly squirming in my chair in disgust at the horrors on screen.<br/><br/>The real reasons these images are so intensely horrifying are because of the motivations the characters have. It all comes down to the basic idea of what is happening. The thematic elements are just as frightening as the visual elements. Maybe not everyone will be affected in such an intense way; it depends on how much you can stomach.<br/><br/>But maybe perhaps the reason both the thematic and the visual elements worked so blissfully together was because of the incredible acting from the entire cast. Ellen Burstyn delivers a phenomenal performance as the challenged mother of Harry (Leto) and depicts insanity that is so believable you forget she's acting. She totally deserved her Oscar nomination. Jared Leto was his usual self, putting everything he had into the performance and pouring emotion onto the screen everywhere. Jennifer Connelly also gives an excellent performance as Harry's psychologically tortured love interest. Again, it was very easy to forget that you were watching actors and actresses act and think you're actually seeing these deeply troubled people through the eyes of a camera.<br/><br/>Then, of course, there's the soundtrack. Oh, boy...has it become popular fourteen years later. It's an odd soundtrack for this type of movie. It's more ""epic"" sounding and inspiring if heard by itself but when it's put into the movie it becomes something else entirely. it's eerie, it's scary, and most of all, it adds to the intensity of what's happening on screen in a strange but subtle way. Clint Mansell did an excellent job making this possible.<br/><br/>I really never thought a movie about drugs could possibly be so fascinating and interesting. Darren Aronofsky directs in such a way that everything is personal between the characters and the audience. You care for these people; you feel like you know them. You want them to overcome their troubles. The camera merely serves as a window into their world. You feel a part of it all.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this movie? Well, it would depend on the person. There haven't been many movies that have moved me in a way this one did. It wasn't the typical emotional experience but rather a truly gut-wrenching one. There is no hope, no savior, no happiness. By the time the credits roll you should feel dead inside. This is one of those movies that everyone should watch at some point during their lives, preferably when they're younger. But for that very reason, it doesn't make it a film for everyone."

","Alcoholics or drug addicts feel wrong when they don't feel right. Eventually they feel very wrong, and must feel right, and at that point their lives spiral down into some sort of final chapter--recovery if they're lucky, hopelessness and death if they're not.<br/><br/>What is fascinating about ""Requiem for a Dream,"" the new film by Darren Aronofsky, is how well he portrays the mental states of his addicts. When they use, a window opens briefly into a world where everything is right. Then it slides shut, and life reduces itself to a search for the money and drugs to open it again. Nothing else is remotely as interesting.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is the director who made the hallucinatory ""Pi"" (1998), about a paranoid genius who seems on the brink of discovering the key to--well, God, or the stock market, or whatever else his tormentors imagine. That movie, made on a tiny budget, was astonishing in the way it suggested its hero's shifting prism of reality. Now, with greater resources, Aronofsky brings a new urgency to the drug movie by trying to reproduce, through his subjective camera, how his characters feel, or want to feel, or fear to feel.<br/><br/>As the movie opens, a housewife is chaining her television to the radiator. It's no use. Her son frees it, and wheels it down the street to a pawn shop. This is a regular routine, we gather; anything in his mother's house is a potential source of funds for drug money. The son's girlfriend and best friend are both addicted, too. So is the mother: to television and sugar. We recognize the actors, but barely. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is fat and blowzy in her sloppy house dresses; if you've just seen her in the revived ""Exorcist,"" her appearance will come as a shock. Her son Harry (Jared Leto) is gaunt and haunted; so is his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). His pal Tyrone is played by Marlon Wayans, who has lost all the energy and cockiness of his comic persona and is simply trying to survive in a reasonable manner. Tyrone suspects, correctly, that he's in trouble but Harry is in more.<br/><br/>Sara's life passes in modest retirement. She joins the other old ladies out front of their building, where they line up their lawn chairs in the sun. She's addicted to a game show whose host (Christopher McDonald) leads the audience in chanting ""We got a winner!"" She's a sweet, naive women who gets a junk phone call that misleads her into thinking she may be a potential guest on the show. She obsesses about wearing her favourite red dress, and gets diet pills from the doctor to help her lose weight.<br/><br/>She does lose weight, and also her mind. ""The pills don't work so good anymore,"" she complains to the druggist, and then starts doubling up her usage. Her doctor isn't even paying attention when she complains dubiously about hallucinations (the refrigerator has started to threaten her). Meanwhile, Harry talks to Marion about the one big score that would ""get us back on track."" Tyrone can see that Harry is losing it, but Marion, under Harry's spell, has sex with a shrink (Sean Gullette, star of ""Pi"") and is eventually selling herself for stag party gang-gropes.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is fascinated by the way in which the camera can be used to suggest how his characters see things. I've just finished a shot-by-shot analysis of Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" at the Virginia Film Festival; he does the same thing, showing us some things and denying us others so that we are first plunged into a subjective state and then yanked back to objectivity with a splash of cold reality.<br/><br/>Here Aronofsky uses extreme close-ups to show drugs acting on his characters. First we see the pills, or the fix, filling the screen, because that's all the characters can think about. Then the injection, swallowing or sniffing--because that blots out the world. Then the pupils of their eyes dilate. All done with acute exaggeration of sounds.<br/><br/>These sequences are done in fast-motion, to show how quickly the drugs take effect--and how disappointingly soon they fade. The in-between times edge toward desperation. Aronofsky cuts between the mother, a prisoner of her apartment and diet pills, and the other three. Early in the film, in a technique I haven't seen before, he uses a split screen in which the space on both sides is available to the other (Sara and Harry each have half the screen, but their movements enter into each other's halves). This is an effective way of showing them alone together. Later, in a virtuoso closing sequence, he cuts between all four major characters as they careen toward their final destinations.<br/><br/>Burstyn isn't afraid to play Sara Goldfarb flat-out as a collapsing ruin (Aronofsky has mercy on her by giving her some fantasy scenes where she appears on TV and we see that she is actually still a great-looking woman). Connolly, who is so much a sex symbol that she, too, could have disgraced herself in ""Charlie's Angels,"" has consistently gone for risky projects and this may be her riskiest; the movie is inspired by Hubert Selby, Jr.'s lacerating novel of the same name, and in her own way Connolly goes as far as Jennifer Jason Leigh did in ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"" (1989), an equally courageous, quite different, film based on another Selby novel. Leto and Wayans have a road trip together, heading for Florida, that is like a bleaker echo of Joe Buck and Ratso Rizzo's Florida odyssey in ""Midnight Cowboy."" Leto's suppurating arm, punished by too many needles, is like a motif for his life."
"nikkhah98","10","1","2","6 December 2013"," This movie is not all about the addiction.
","If you see this movie as you see other typical movies, you will be amazed by its acting performances, its directing, editing, dialog and the meaning of it. But the meaning of the movie for many people is just that addiction is not a good way to reach the end in life, Of course it is not. But the way that the writer of the book and the director(which is the screenwriter himself) see the meaning is not just that. That is a word that every healthy person know, and that's why many people don't get it and they don't like it because of that. The true meaning in my opinion is the wrong targets of people lives. Addiction is one of them yes, but the whole meaning is much more than that. When you really need 'something' you'll try to reach it an it will become a life goal for you. Characters in the movie wanted and needed different things, but they all had something in common and it was to be satisfied of the way they life goes. But non of them was. Each of them tried to reach it in a wrong way and for all of them it caused addiction. As it wasn't the right way they all lost life at the end.The right way was much more easier as they talk about it and be it in some moments but still they want to do the wrong way. And the dream of all of them never came true. Helpful points we can get from this movie is not only to not getting into addiction but in bigger way, it's about to chose the way to reach what we want correctly and do not go the way that we just 'think' is correct if we want to reach the target of our lives."
"jimbo-53-186511","10","1","2","29 November 2013"," Quite simply a masterpiece and one of the best films I've ever seen
","**************WARNING SPOILERS THROUGHOUT**************************<br/><br/>This film is so good that I hardly know where to begin. I'll be honest and say that I am usually quite picky when it comes to giving a film 10/10, but for me it was a 'no brainer' with Requiem for a Dream for so many reasons;<br/><br/>Basic plot/summary; Four Coney island individuals lives become badly affected when their addictions to drugs grow stronger.<br/><br/>Firstly for me one of the major pluses with this film is the direction; Oh My God! What a feast for the eyes. I have never seen such brilliant direction in any film that I've ever seen. There are shots where the camera is spinning and where the camera speeds up (this wasn't poor directing or poor camera technique, but was clearly used to show the drug induced minds of the four individuals).<br/><br/>Next we come to the acting/characters; Sara Goldfrab (Ellen Burstyn) - what can I say? Not only was her acting 'phenomenal' but I found her character the most interesting out of all the characters. Sara is basically a telly addict who fantasises about being on TV. She also uses diet pills to lose weight (or so we initially think). However, it is heavily suggested due to Sara's mannerisms and the speeding up of the camera that she is in fact taking 'amphetamines'. I felt that Burstyn gave the best performance and I also felt most sympathy for her character.<br/><br/>Harry Goldfrab/Tyrone C Love (Leto and Wayans respectively). I decided to discuss their characters together as for the most part they worked as a double act. Their story arc shows them initially selling drugs and making lots of money (until a deal goes sour with Love and some other guys which to be honest wasn't explained very well). Due to this major hitch, the 2 men find themselves with no money and desperate for their next fix. This leads perfectly to the next act; <br/><br/>Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) - wow wasn't she gorgeous here? Not only was she absolutely stunning, but she also gave an absolutely brilliant performance. There are a couple of scenes where Harry pimps her out in order for her, Harry & Tyrone to finance their next fix. Yes pimping her out might seem 'degrading', but I felt that this was warranted given the context of the film. They were desperate, they needed their fix. What made it more plausible is that Marion was just as hooked as Tyrone and Harry so she was prepared to go along with it.<br/><br/>There are a couple of poignant moments in the film that for me were just perfect; we see in the middle of the film that Harry is running towards Marion, not much is made of this initially but towards the end of the film Harry runs towards Marion again and she disappears when he gets to her. My personal feeling on this is that of 'Love and Loss' - he had her love in the first instance and lost her love in the second instance (kind of reminded me of Bon Jovi's music video 'Always' but I'm being mushy now).<br/><br/>To be honest though, the most poignant scene for me was the end of the film; on the Game show it shows Sara and Harry at the end on the same feature. He is depicted as a successful importer (as he stated he was at the start of the film) and Sara was this perfect TV persona. For me, that embodies what Sara always wanted; her son to be successful and for her to be this big TV personality and for me it was the perfect ending to the perfect film. Of course, it was all fantasy but it was at least slightly uplifting.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is simply superb; Aronfosky has excelled himself. This film has everything; exceptional directing, amazing acting, brilliant story and many heart breaking and harrowing scenes. This is definitely a film that is not to be missed!"
"pgFiSheYe","10","1","2","27 October 2013"," A supreme directional achievement. A sublime outstanding breathtaking film. It breaks you into pieces with no mercy.
","Requiem for a Dream constitutes the most amazing 100 minutes you will ever spend in your life watching a film. When someone asks me in what place does Requiem belong, I answer ""right there next to the Modern Marvels of the World"".<br/><br/>Imagine if you will a mental beating the kind of ancient Roman's did on their slaves, relentlessly and endlessly until forcing their submission. That is exactly what this movie does to you. I have yet to meet someone who has been able to stand RFAD without giving a minimal sign of grief. Requiem is the epitome of independent filmmaking: daring, crude, merciless, realistic and just when you think it will cut you a break, it keeps on pounding your mind non-stop. If you expect this film to take a pause and go easy on you for a minute or two, then you guessed wrong because it simply won't. It will go hard and harder and harder and just when you thought it cannot go any further, it will... until it breaks you down.<br/><br/>Much has been said about the subject, the performances and the soundtrack which by all means are sublime. However I believe Requiem greatest achievement made by Aronofsky. There isn't a single wasted scene in this film. Simply put, there isn't a single meaningless scene all-though the 6000 seconds, which is the reason why at the end of the movie one ends up so mentally exhausted. Yes the camera angles are different and quirky, but it is undeniable that they match the pace of each character in such a perfect way, that even the viewer asks for it as every minute goes by. <br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly is at her very best here. Forget ABM or any other movie in her resume. This is Connelly on top of her game, which by all means is equal on any other laureate actress such as Isabelle Adjani or Meryl Streep. Her character is perhaps the most human and victimized, so it is easy to feel sorry for her during the scene in which she talks to Harry over the phone, will getting herself ready for Big Tim's party. However it is the bathtub scene the one that resumes in about 10 seconds the fate of her character and the intensity of Connelly's portrayal.<br/><br/>However make no mistake: in term of performances, the film belongs to Ellen Burstyn. I won't lie, she begins a little slow (as a matter of fact all pieces of the film start a bit slow), but quickly gains strength and becomes the most powerful performance I have ever seen, period. Burstyn must have received every single award known for her portrayal of Sara Goldfarb, even the Nobel Prize. The monologue scene breaks even the strongest cold-hearted people you can imagine. Impossible to shed a tear during of after it.<br/><br/>Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are equally superb, although one level underneath Connelly and thousands below Burstyn. Fortunately, they get great aid from Aronfsky's direction and of course the chilling script, both of them empower and upgrading the value of their performances. <br/><br/>Then you have the soundtrack: as simple and plain as you can imagine, yet as powerful and haunting as any major soundtrack you can remember. If I was to rate the importance of every element of the film, it would be #1 The Direction, #2 Ellen Burstyn and #3 The Soundtrack, with like I said Connelly coming real close at a #4. <br/><br/>This film is so powerful, even some of the minor characters are memorable and have unforgettable moments. Keith David's Big Tim's subtle laugh when he answers the phone has stayed in my mind for years, just like Dylan Baker's brief appearance as a southern Doctor.<br/><br/>I have yet to figure how this film has not received the accolades it deserves as of 2013, and it has been continuously overlooked in every single Top 10 greatest films of all time list. Aronofsky may have got lots of glory thanks to The Wrestler and Black Swan, but believe me it is Requiem for a Dream the film that should and will cement his name in history not only as a filmmaker but as an artist.<br/><br/>Oh and by the way, there should be way to rate this film 20 out of 10.<br/><br/>Finally, if you still want to do drugs after watching this film, you are simply no good to this world and understand nothing about life.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"kskirthana","9","1","2","21 October 2013"," Requiem for a dream outlines the life of four Coney Island residents and their addiction to drugs.
","Requiem for a dream- ""A tragically beautiful piece of music mourning the loss of an unrealized dream."" Of course its all conjecture, but if I were to guess this would be my interpretation of the title.<br/><br/>The movie opens with an introduction to Harry and Sara Goldfarb, an overindulged young man whose only concern is his next fix and a doting single mother who yearns for her son's well-being. Sara's only escape from the drudgery of her routine suburban life is her daily escape through television, in particular a weight loss show called 'Juice by Tappy'. <br/><br/>The carefree, drug fueled existence of Harry, his gorgeous girlfriend Marion and friend Tyrone sets up a sharp contrast to the lonely, ordinariness of Sara's life, her obsession with television, and her diet fads. We are seduced by a life of excitement, danger, rule breaking, youthful dreams with endless possibilities, drugs and sex. The glamour of these drug- induced utopias make Harry and Tyrone's schemes seem like a means to beautiful possibilities. This constantly switches between the manic lifestyle that Sara's desperation to lose weight has led her to. Her depression and loneliness is alleviated by an unexpected invitation into a world of glamour, however this soon gives way to an anxiety that she no longer fits in. In her desperation we see her becoming completely reliant on 'diet pills'. Morning, noon, evening, night, morning, noon, evening, night, morning, noon, evening, night. She spirals further and further down the rabbit hole of addiction, tragically unaware, she seems to think its a harmless quick fix. As her body wastes away she is plagued by paranoid delusions. Even through this, she remains oblivious. A true success story in her mind. Alternately, the youngsters are constantly on the prowl for their next fix. The failure of their schemes, leaves them desperate. <br/><br/>The movie is a work of art. Each scene is carefully choreographed visually and the soundtrack and sound effects and meticulously planned. The intensity of the mood created because of these visual and musical elements is quite magical. Reminiscent of the drama of a Scorcece film and the lurid quality of a Fincher film, it comes together in a remarkably artful way. <br/><br/>The characters are rich and complex and each of the performances are arresting. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are believable, genuine and surprisingly endearing. Jennifer Connely is BEAUTIFUL, fragile and feminine. But Ellen Burstyn steals the show! Her performance is lurid, and gut wrenching. A startling and touching portrayal of a woman without love or companionship, a life of longing and complete neglect."
"Jean-Antoine","10","1","2","23 September 2013"," Masterpiece
","What a masterpiece! The acting was so amazing as it was from Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and especially Ellen Burstyn. I just loved it! The emotions were so strong and it was so realistic!
The music suited perfectly to the movie.
I think this movie would be a great prevention against drugs, as we see how a couple get destroyed; how a mother keeps living in her dark crazy world, obsessed by the idea of being a TV star, but finally ends in a mental hospital; and how a lonely guy who is fighting for his life finds himself devastated by drugs all around him.
In the end it was a great work by Darren Aronofsky. I really enjoy his movies by the way he insists on the psychological aspects of the protagonists."
"cybero96","9","1","2","15 September 2013"," Unsettelingly brilliant
","Requiem for a Dream sticks. After watching the whole thing all the way through there wasn't a single scene that I couldn't look back on and think how utterly brilliant it was.<br/><br/>While the start sets the scene in an almost cliché drug dealing VS proper morale mood, that all changes when the plot of the movie is observed. Each of the four main characters faces their own trials and tribulations, and each of them their pride before their fall.<br/><br/>What strikes me most about Requiem is that although society tells us that we shouldn't be aligning ourselves with any of the characters because of their disgusting addictions I couldn't help feeling more emotionally attached to the cast than any movie I've ever seen. Each character fell prey to similar addictions but entirely different one's all the same. Each character was warped by their method to succeed, and that's what made it so brutishly heart wrenching.<br/><br/>The ending was so beautifully crafted I ended up praying it would could keep going - the additions of wonderfully simplistic editing and soundtrack really encapsulated me.<br/><br/>If you are looking for permanent emotional damage, and a fantastic narrative that explores the unsettling nature of addiction abuse - watch this film."
"campb234","9","1","2","15 September 2013"," I'm not going to tell you what you already know...If you haven't watched this you need to.
","So, I finally watched this movie yesterday, 13 years after it's release. I remember hearing about this movie over the years and I had wanted to see it, but I never got around to it for various reasons. I am glad and disappointed that I waited this long. I have seen most of the directors other films (I always forget how to spell his name so I just won't) and I guess I wasn't surprised at how intense this one was. It was very interesting to think of how the movie opened and closed. It was the same mood, tone, etc, but that's all I will say. There are already over a thousand reviews for this, and I doubt anyone will see this, but if they do thank you for reading. This is one of the most horrifying non horror movies ever. Now I know why everyone always references it."
"Caaarrl94","10","1","2","9 September 2013"," Everybody should see this movie.
","This is a near masterpiece. I have just watched this movie and I can tell you this is the first time i've cried over a movie in a very long time. I have a feeling this one will resonate inside me for ever.<br/><br/>I don't have many words to say about this movie apart from you must watch it. It's one of the finest movies i've ever seen with glimmers of absolute cinematic perfection.<br/><br/>The acting, cinematography, excellent sound track, editing. Everything about this movie is near perfect. Jared Leto gives the performance of his career in my opinion. <br/><br/>Don't expect a Martin Scorcese story with a crazy twisting plot with complex back story and side plots because you get none of that. It's quite evident what the movie is about from the get go. It's about the decay of peoples lives because of their drug use. The story simply follows several people on their journey from discovery to addiction to destruction. And it does it wonderfully and terrifyingly.<br/><br/>10/10 I recommend this masterpiece to everyone"
"RolltheClip","9","1","2","9 September 2013"," Emotionally Draining Eye Opener
","The movie industry has always had an obscure relationship with drugs. Originally being completely taboo, they are now a staple in many modern horrors and comedies. Where some films glamourise them such as the 'Stoner-Comedy' sub-genre, there are other films that really show the grittier, downward spiral that narcotics can easily take people down such as 'Less Than Zero' or 'Spun'.<br/><br/>Having seen Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem for a Dream' before, I knew what film I was going to be sitting through. There would be no settling down, and no entertainment. This isn't to say that it is not a great film but you really do feel emotionally drained after the viewing. It isn't a movie you watch prior to settling down to sleep but one that will haunt you for a time after the credits have rolled. The surreal parts emphasise occurrences superbly, going from a very limited dark colour palette in reality to vibrant, energetic colours in their hallucinogenic, vegetated state that enables you to see things from their perspective without making drugs seem alluring. Far from it. This is potentially one of the greats of anti-drug cinema.<br/><br/>There is no way to really prepare yourself for such an experience. It is bleak straight from the opening scenes where Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is introduced. Entering his own mother, Sara's (Ellen Burstyn) home, he takes her television to acquire money for a fix. All the while the cinematography really gives you a deeper insight into their tarnished relationship as there is a literal line drawn between the two characters, showing their actions and reactions.<br/><br/>Harry plans on becoming a dealer of high quality drugs with Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) whilst Goldfarb slowly drags his girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connely) into the fire with him, promising her their dirty money would go towards her own store where she can sell her fashion designs but, with her history of drug-usage. She soon finds herself back in a predicament.<br/><br/>The film takes place over three seasons; Summer, Autumn and Winter and each play out as an act, showing the escalating desperation as the four main individuals sink deeper into their troubles. Throughout Harry's ordeal with the heroin his mother is dealing with another form of addiction. After the loss of her husband she has become lonely and food and television have become her substitute for love. After a phone-call from a television station she is filled with false hope, entertaining the idea of her 15 minutes of fame. Determined to wear her once beloved red dress for her small-screen appearance, unknowingly, she turns to amphetamine and becomes increasingly reliant on it's effects.<br/><br/>Much like seasons in reality, each act becomes darker earlier, cold in it's outlook. Frosty in it's reception. Each of the characters push past the point of no return, sacrificing love, health and happiness in their own selfish or vulnerable haze.<br/><br/>It isn't just the acting or the content of the movie that pushes it above and beyond, it's the orchestral pieces by Clint Mansell that really capture the despair. I am unable to listen to his pieces, full of sorrow and foreboding. It has a confounding effect on the soul emphasising all that is occurring on screen. Without a doubt it is one of the most effective and provocative soundtracks I have experienced on film. As much as it is an essential watch. It's too taxing to watch regularly. However, it deserves pride of place in any DVD collection and I would implore everyone to give it at least one viewing in their life-time. A powerful and eye-opening view into an underworld that most people avoid in their life-times. It really is a challenging view."
"City_Wolf","10","1","2","7 September 2013"," best movie of Darren Aronofsky
","What makes Requiem for a dream so great is the realistic perspective on different drug addictions and drug addicts. Aronofsky was the only director who could make this movie so dark and depressive. Throughout the story movie makes us connect with the characters so we feel exactly what they feel, which can be very traumatizing especially towards the end. The cast of this movie is great, not just because of their acting but they are easy to connect with. The writer of the story Hubert Selby Jr. struggled with depression his whole life so with the help of Aronofsky they wrote the screenplay the best way possible. One of the other great things that cannot go unnoticed is the composer Clint Mansell, whose soundtrack fits perfectly in every scene and makes the ending of this movie absolutely perfect."
"danieljosephvan","10","1","2","7 September 2013"," A review about the beauty of the movie and its emotional qualities.
","This movie was probably one of the most emotionally moving movies I have ever seen. It is one of a number of movies that I can count on one hand that has made me cry.<br/><br/>This movie was an original. I have never seen anything similar to this masterpiece. I would recommend this work of art to anyone I know. However, with the recommendation comes a warning. This movie is very dark, possibly the darkest movie I've ever watched, and yet, through the darkness shines a light. This light is a ray of hope. It is the hope that we can learn from this masterpiece and better our lives. From these characters, we can choose to aspire to be the best we can be. These characters had those aspirations, but they were lost in the world of drugs that surrounds them.<br/><br/>The ending scene is probably the most intense, beautiful scene in a movie that I have ever viewed. Tears began to flow down my cheeks as the music picks up in the last few minutes and these tears are of more than just sadness. These are tears of joy and thankfulness and hope. This movie left me a bit depressed, but at the same time, enlightened, and I began to feel happy that I do not have to deal with such situations as these characters, but the sorrow I feel for these characters and any humans like them is a sorrow that will never leave me."

","Before I saw this movie I had teared up in 3 movies. Forrest Gump, Garden State, and The Perks of Being a Wallflower. In this movie I cried for about 10 minutes. I have never seen a movie that changed my life so much as this. I rented this movie with moderate interest in it and began to watch it while cleaning my room. Before long I had stopped cleaning and was completely transfixed on the TV. All I can say is this: You will hear from people that the film is terribly shot. The camera is shaky and the lighting isn't perfect. The story has its plot holes and the music has its moments where it simply doesn't fit. But this is my favorite movie. There is so much truth in it and the acting (especially Ellen Byrstyn) made it impossible to doubt. And with an amazing ending to finish it off I cannot say this movie was flawed. Its imperfections led to its perfection. If you want a movie that changed your view of things watch this. If you want to watch Saw 38 or Rambo 18 be my guest but unlike those, this one is memorable and could very possibly change the way you think about things (not just drugs)."

","When I first began watching this I thought it was really strange and hard to follow. To be honest, it's like that for the entire movie. The filming was artistic and new, yet disturbing and unsettling. Overall, this movie is extremely dark. It's definitely not for an immature audience, nor is it for those who dislike sad stories. Oddly, I was painfully satisfied with the end--though I will not share the conclusion. The content is very explicit throughout, from sex scenes to brutality, but I didn't find any of it to be excessively unnecessary. Jared Leto does a fantastic job, along with Jennifer Connelly, Ellen Burstyn, and Marlon Wayans. (It was really weird to see a Wayans brother in such a dramatic film! Nonetheless, he did very well.) I still feel numb from the music that was constantly played, and I will never forget it."
"jeremiah-johnson6","10","1","2","16 August 2013"," An absolute roller coaster ride of depravity and despair....AWESOME!!
","If anyone has dealt with drug addiction,personally or thru a friend or family member,this movie will strike a very real and uncomfortable nerve. It is uncompromising in its telling of how drug addiction can creep into the lives of both the seemingly responsible and the irresponsible alike. Do not take the ""Bob Dole approach"" to this movie and dismiss it as a glorification of drug use,at face value. This movie is a warning! It says ""Yeah,drugs can be fun,or in Elen Burynst case,helpful...but before you realize what's happened,your lost down the rabbit hole!"" also the musical score that plays thru the movie is simplistic yet brilliant! Just like the movie,it starts out slow and meticulous,gradually becoming more and more louder and complicated leading into a symphonic cacophony.

","The plot for this film ""Requiem for a Dream"", is about four people Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) Harry's friend Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) and Harry's girlfriend Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly). Sara, Harry, Tyrone and Marion are all dealing with personal issues, and battling addiction with drugs, and being accepted by others and finding their place life.<br/><br/>Sara is a widow who is trying to get back to her past self when she was thinner, happy and when people needed her. Sara becomes fixated on getting back into this red dress, with the gold heels, and her red hair. Sara thinks by taking diet pills, and watching infomercials that she will become a contestant on a show and everyone will accept her and she will be needed. Harry is a dope fiend who is trying to find his place in the world but falls short due to his drug habits. Tyrone is also fighting a battle that has to do with his childhood and being accepted by his mother, he wants to be accepted and loved and turns to drugs also, which in the end leaves him alone. Marion is a drug addict as well and has plans of opening a store and becoming a designer but due to lack of money she has to have sex with people to get money to feed her drug habit. The theme for, Requiem for a Dream, in my opinion is a movie dealing with drug addiction, loneliness, depression, finding acceptance, and dealing with personal life issues. Sara, Harry, Marion, and Tyrone are all chasing a dream, to be wealthy, happy, loved and accepted by others. Sara's addiction is diet pills. Harry, Tyrone, and Marion's drugs are heroine, and cocaine. These drugs are the reason that Sara, Harry, Tyrone, and Marion suffer, become an addict, and the reason their lives spiral out of control. For some people being accepted by their peers is everything in life. That's why some people like to have money, and be flashy when it comes to their clothes, and hanging out with their peers. For example, when Sara was in her kitchen talking to Harry he who is an addict himself was trying to persuade his mother to stop taking those diet pills. However, she wasn't hearing anything he was saying to her. All Sara kept talking about was that red dress, and how when she was sitting outside she was the center of attention, how she had the best seat and how everyone cared and listened to her and was interested in her life. That was the satisfaction she was looking for and wanted and getting on that show is what mattered and she was willing to do whatever it took to get that fix she was chasing, even if that meant becoming addicted to diet pills. In my opinion I think that Basketball Diaries has the same theme as Requiem for a Dream, drugs addiction, prostitution, and robbing people to get his drugs. This movie is about a basketball player who had everything going for him was on a good basketball team, went to a good school, but then a change in his life came and it turned him to a life of crime because he got hooked on drugs and he was chasing and trying to feed his addiction. I think that the reoccurring motif in this film is addiction, and satisfaction from other people. All four characters had an addiction that needed to be feed and wanted satisfaction from their peers. That's why they all did the things they did, from Sara getting on the diet pills, dying her hair red, watching the infomercials and stalking the mailman every day. To Harry wanting to sell drugs so he can make a better life, have money, and not have to steal from his mother anymore. Lighting and angles of the movie Requiem for a Dream in my opinion fit the movie. The angles that were shot in different scenes showed what everyone individually was doing or going through. The lighting was natural in some scenes but was dark in others for example in the beginning of the movie when the screen was split and Sara was on one side locked in the room and Harry was on the other side arguing with her about her television. The audience could tell that there was something going on and it was wrong. I knew within the first few seconds of the film that Harry was on drugs when I heard them arguing over her television set. In my opinion Requiem for a Dream was a very good movie it showed how being overly obsessed with what people think about you can ruin your life. These four individuals Sara, Harry, Tyrone, and Marion let drugs and their unhappiness for the way their lives where going consume them. This movie just showed how chasing the ""American Dream"" can kill you."
"GTeixeira","3","1","2","27 July 2013"," Technically good but... is it really needed?
","Drugs are terrible, that much is common sense. The terrible reality of drug use is something that is commonly shown and talked about everywhere nowadays, being necessary in order to stop the newer generations from giving in to them like the idiots from the past decades.<br/><br/>Among the many documentaries, special programs and propaganda (not in a bad use of the word) done to spread the knowledge of this drug disease, Darren Aronofsky came out with 'Requiem for a Dream'. A powerful film that showcases the suffering of drug addicts, not leaving out how dirty and almost inhuman such a reality is. Maybe the saddest is that shown by an old woman, who abuses diet pills (abuse of legal drugs are often forgotten or not mentioned, sadly).<br/><br/>There is quite good to say of the film in a technical aspect. The interesting visuals add to the gloomy atmosphere, and one can see Aronofsky was not afraid to experiment with his camera work. At times he makes us see things in a blurry way, almost as if hallucinating like his characters. The soundtrack is also excellent.<br/><br/>But, WAS ALL OF THIS NEEDED?<br/><br/>While Aronofsky DID a powerful film, I have to question why was this needed; or even if it succeeds. There is nothing here that hasn't been covered and shown thousands of times in documentaries or advertising, both before and after this film was released. <br/><br/>I can understand the argument that 'many people don't see documentaries, so showing this on a film will reach many more!', but even then this film fails. A person who is not interested in documentaries or more artistically focused films, will it have the patience or taste for a film like this? <br/><br/>Most people see films for entertainment, no matter what 'artists' think. The people who look for art in films are the same who would enjoy a documentary on the subject matter; someone who only wants entertainment will promptly dismiss something as this, especially since it looks to repulse rather than attract. I had a lot of friends actually say they didn't watch 'Requiem for a Dream', or say it was rubbish, exactly because of that.<br/><br/>'Requiem for a Dream' isn't even a groundbreaking in-depth analysis of the drug subject, making it inferior in that aspect to most of the abundant anti-drug propaganda; at the same time, it holds no entertainment value in order to reach the 'common' people. To actually reach a bigger audience with such a repulsively strong subject, a better approach would be to include something to attract. Something to balance things. Like Danny Boyle did in his not-as-serious drug film, 'Trainspotting'. But Aronofsky does nothing of that.<br/><br/>I must say I wasn't very thrilled with the acting. They did their part visually, looking ghastly as the addiction grew; however, they indulged themselves too much on the usual junkie clichés. There are more reactions and expressions junkies can do besides those usually attributed to them and shown in here. Still, both Ellen Burstyn and Jennifer Connelly were great. Jared Leto didn't peak my interest, maybe because he played the kind of junkie that not only I can't bring myself to sympathize with, but that makes me feel he deserves what is happening to them. Marlon Wayans is out-of-place in such a serious movie.<br/><br/>Despite being a visually powerful and well-made film on a strong subject, I must say 'Requiem for a Dream' ultimately fails for lacking any entertainment value. It seeks to repulse far too much, and for the audience it might appeal to it will inevitably be less worthwhile than one of the hundreds of documentaries out there."
"johnshanemusic","3","1","2","24 July 2013"," I am blown away that people revere this movie!
","How this movie ended up with such a high rating is beyond me. I watched this movie with high hopes of being entertained (because of it's high rating). Instead, I found the entire movie to be garbage. It's a recycled story line - and it features highly obnoxious, contrived, ""I'm trying too hard to be artsy"" cinematography.<br/><br/>So the story line,.......people try to ""make it"" by pulling off some drug deals, only to end up addicted and ruined by the product they were pushing. Gee, that story has only been told in about 5 dozen movies PRIOR to this one! Girl ends up selling her body for drugs, one guy ends up in jail, and one guy ends up close to death. Gee, that story has only been told on film a hundred times! Way to come up with an original concept!<br/><br/>The only other story in the movie is of the mother. For the first hour of the movie, we focus on her struggle not to eat. Really? An old woman struggling to diet is supposed to entertain me? Then comes the cliché, predictable irony,.....the old lady gets hooked on prescription diet drugs. The mother's story line takes a long winded, boring walk to a point that has been realized for so long that the irony is long gone. Yes, law abiding people get hooked on prescription drugs - we are all well aware of that. A breathing, growling refrigerator doesn't make that well established point any more interesting. For me, the scenes with the mother were embarrassingly cheesy. <br/><br/>Most people that love this movie revere the art student cinematography. I found it to be completely obnoxious. A good portion of the mother's scenes have an almost strobe like effect that literally strained my eyes. The rapid flash clips reminded me of a film student editor that was trying too hard to make a recycled story line into an art film.<br/><br/>Finally, I just didn't buy the acting. The old ladies were all like caricatures of old women. The two male leads were never able to make me forget that I was watching a performance. About the only two actors in the movie to put on a believable performance were the girl that turns to prostitution, and the host in the weird ""juice"" TV show.<br/><br/>In summary - the story was recycled, the acting was average at best, and the cinematography was trying way to hard to make this movie a piece of ""art"". I can see why young film students might like this movie. They look past the lame story line, and the unspectacular acting - and instead focus on the cinematographic technicalities. To me, appreciating this film only for it's technical merits would be like appreciating a boring song, performed by average musicians, that was recorded in a unique way. Beyond those subjective cinematographic technicalities, I saw nothing redeeming about this movie. <br/><br/>I enjoyed ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" and ""Sharknado"" more than this piece of art garbage. And if you've seen ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" or ""Sharknado"" - I am sure that you thought it couldn't get much worse than that."

","After I'd finished watching this movie I had to get some air as I felt truly drained. I had seen a few reviews of this movie beforehand and so was eager to see if this movie could possibly live up to those reviews. I'm not so pleased to say that it did. I say not pleased because this movie hit me hard. I was watching a film about addiction, both physical and emotional with characters I really should not care about, with maybe the exception of Sarah (Ellen Burnstein in excellent form). But we are slowly introduced into their seedy and needy lives but once we are pulled in we are not let go as slowly all the main characters' lives start to unravel before us and we feel everything. It's ugly, dirty, nasty and seedy and that's just how I felt as the credits rolled and it was all done without the need (in general anyway) for gratuitous scenes of drug taking, sex or violence (Okay there is a particularly graphic scene towards the end involving Jennifer Connelly but it is spliced between scenes of all the other there characters and so lessens the explicitness of it). This works more on an emotional level and it plays with your emotions so much you cannot help but be affected after. This is not a movie to sit with friends over a tub of popcorn. I would even go as far to say it is a movie better watched alone to feel it's full impact. Just don't expect not to be affected afterwards. Don't think my score of 8 out of 10 is not high. It is. 8 represents a great movie for me. A movie would have to be something extra special to get a 9 and total perfection to get a 10 and as far as I'm concerned that doesn't exist yet. This isn't a movie for everyone but if you want to feel moved in some way then this is a movie for you"

Jennifer Connelly & Ellen Burstyn are brilliant.<br/><br/>Now, with the cinematography & editing, it is totally different from most of the movie made. The fast cutting editing totally mesmerized me.

I wonder someone makes a film on the latest addictions.<br/><br/>Although, telling a grim story, the second half is duller than first and as it approaches the end, becomes a tad boring.

A close friend of mine recommended it to me and I am very glad that he did so.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the few that I believe to be a ""must watch"". Throughout my watch, I experienced a myriad of emotions (shock, sadness, sympathy, disgust...). I believe I have even found myself tearing up at times (I'm not usually one to cry during a movie...except for the occasional few). Honestly, If I were to have to remake this movie there wouldn't be a thing I would change about it... the actors were all very believable, the pacing seemed just right, the cinematography (If that's the right word for it) was fresh, the ending was unlike most movies, and even the scenery (/feeling) seemed to fit the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>However, I must warn you... if you are completely against very upsetting/nerve-wracking movies you should probably avoid Requiem.

","Now this is a difficult one and I think my rating may seem pretty harsh to some, considering how high it rates in the members poll. However, personally I just didn't enjoy it. The concept is great but I think it was taken a bit too far. I like controversy but I think the combination of how the film was shot, the themes and the score took it over the edge of what is enjoyable cinema and a piece that is intended to shock and leave the audience feeling stunned.<br/><br/>For me Jennifer Connolly stole the show. Her role entails playing a confused but fundamentally good hearted girl that ends upon a situation that you wouldn't wish on anyone. I think the pain and emotion which is shown is nothing short of a masterpiece. If this was the only story in the film perhaps my opinion would be higher.<br/><br/>However on the opposite scale Ellen Burstyns performance of a house wife who eventually goes mad due to an addiction of slimming pills is boarder line ridiculous. Apart from Gary oldman in Leon, probably one of the most overacted things I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I could talk about the plot holes in this film all day long but ultimately those could be looked over if I was entertained and I'm not sure if I was.<br/><br/>Give this a watch and make your own decision but definitely don't invite a date."

As well as the usual young persons drug abuse it also features an elderly woman who is addicted to weight loss pills. The film portrays all the drug users sympathetically and treats them as decent people who just happen to have a terrible addiction which makes the results even more sad. <br/><br/>The spiral into darkness starts slowly as you get to know the characters but once it starts it really does spiral fast leading to an unforgettably bleak final reel. This film thankfully in no way glamourizes drugs but shows graphically how they can take an iron grip on anyone. <br/><br/>The acting is of the highest order from all involved but especially from Ellen Burstyn and Jennifer Connolly who are tremendous. <br/><br/>This is an excellent and must see film with a brilliant script, great acting and an ending that will live with you."

","Requiem for a Dream Aronofsky's best in my opinion!! 4/4 stars <br/><br/>Was time once again to watch this awesome film that was directed by Darren Aronofsky. I must say this is one of those movies that i can watch 100 times over and never get sick of it. Tne story of 4 people who are co dependants of different forms...drugs and eating disorders who all find out that after achieving the great highs their is always the crashing lows. Great cast includes the always great Ellen Burstyn (who if you asked me got totally robbed by Julia Roberts in Erin Brokovich that year in the Oscars) Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans. Aronofsky never even received a nod for best direction (Which in my opinion is a crime) And this all is backed by an amazing soundtrack by the Kronos Quartet (Another miss at the 73rd Academy Awards).<br/><br/>All these things i have mentioned make this film epic and is yet another reason why Darren Aronofsky remains in my top 10 directors of all time list!"

On top of that, it was incredibly unpleasant to watch. Even if I happen to agree with many of the gripes aired here--doctors are often pill pushers who don't give a damn about their patients, people in the South (especially those employed by the state) are still racists, drugs are not a viable route to a meaningful life--the presentation was so heavy- handed that I felt like a junior high school student watching a didactic video intended to dissuade me from even thinking about taking drugs. <br/><br/>Actually, it reminded me a lot of a production of similar quality (shown in I believe third grade?) in which we were instructed not to talk to or go anywhere with strange men whom we meet in the park or the school parking lot. I recall that even the ice cream man ended up being some sort of pederast.<br/><br/>People--even critics--found this to be a masterpiece? I am frankly surprised."

Aronofsky is one of the must interesting directors in the world today.

","I knew of this movie's existence when it was released in 2000, but I was only 13 then, and, since no one under 17 could see it, it took me a while to discover it. At the time of its release, I was fascinated by the fact that a movie could be unrated and released. Well, I'm 25 now, and I finally got it on Blu-Ray. To me, it was worth the 12 year wait. After seeing it, I saw a form of idiosyncrasy between that movie and my own life. The movie deals with four people spiraling in their own worlds of addiction. At the time of the film's release, I was witnessing my own mother's spiral across many addictions. So, maybe it was for the best that I wasn't able to see it in 2000. It likely would have been too much to bear. I digress, but for good reason. Anyway, I think that the passage of time lent to my appreciation of the movie. I knew I heard that soundtrack somewhere before I saw this movie, and it's always nice to know the source. The story is absolutely unrelenting, and I can say the same about Darren Aronofsky's directing. And there are the performances. Before this, I have never seen anything that contained either Jennifer Connolly (""A Beautiful Mind"" is not exactly one I'm hurrying to see) or Jared Leto (though I do listen to his music with 30 Seconds To Mars). I only knew of Marlon Wayans from ""The Wayans Bros."" and ""Scary Movie"" (I'm sorry to say), and was surprised with his performance here. Obviously, Ellen Burstyn gives the prime performance here, and it's easy to see why she was an Oscar nominee for this. This story did hit very close to the bone to me. My mother's fate was similar to that of the character of Marion, which is why she is is a non-factor to me except as a warning. However, I'm still glad I saw it.

Love (Marlon Wayans); and how drugs affect them,<br/><br/>Okay I'll start with this – this film is incredible, and should be considered a modern masterpiece. The direction by Darren Aronofsky is perfect, claustrophobic, emotional and original. Quote from Wikipedia: ""Aronofsky uses montages of extremely short shots throughout the film (sometimes termed a hip hop montage) While an average 100-minute film has 600 to 700 cuts, RFAD features more than 2,000. Split-screen is used extensively, along with extremely tight closeups. Long tracking shots (including those shot with an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, called the Snorricam) and time-lapse photography are also prominent stylistic devices."" The use of these stylistic features produces an enthralling perspective of drug use, and really gets you into the mind of the characters.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. Ellen Burstyn shows a frail old woman to a drug-crazed maniac, which sounds ridiculous but it's true. She is electrifying. Her most famous line 'I'm gonna be on television' is heartbreaking. The supporting cast are equally award-worthy, yet received none as of the type of film it is.<br/><br/>I was deeply moved by this, I have never been so emotionally affected by a film.

We get off the road, jump from the tracks, derail and we lose our souls.<br/><br/>Every single type of addiction is studied or depicted here in their most stringent consequences.<br/><br/>First television. You can dream of being on television. This will never happen, and you know it, but you go on dreaming and you become addicted to that dream just as much as you are to the television itself. And then you start behaving as if you were a star gone berserk.<br/><br/>Second you can get addicted to slimming pills and in six months you become a zombie, the shadow of yourself, a non-entity, a guinea pig or guinea fowl if you prefer for doctors who are going to try all kinds of treatments not to cure you but to know what the effects of these treatments may be. You are an inmate in a hospital just like so many hundreds of thousands were inmates in Auschwitz.<br/><br/>Third you can get addicted to drugs and then you will end either with one arm off and crippled for life, if they let you go out of the prison that will stand behind, or directly in the prison dreaming this time of freedom, though you were dreaming of paradise when you were free and you were shooting yourself with all kinds of heart accelerants, shooting yourself in both feet.<br/><br/>Fourth you can get addicted to love in a way and a man in particular but, if you are, when that man will turn absent and non-existent any more you will be in a fix and you will have to replace him without being able to replace him. He will be your mental pimp and you will be his mental, but real indeed, shady lady or shady gentleman as for that, ready to do anything to get your fix, get some dough, maybe some baked dough, generally known as bread.<br/><br/>Fifth there is another addiction that is dreadful. The addiction to old age that makes you believe you are not old and makes you behave as if you were not, but you can't not be, so you start cheating with life, taking pills, sitting in the sunshine, visiting other isolated old people, chanting and dancing when your son comes visit you, even if it is to steal your TV to bring it to a pawnshop of your friends.<br/><br/>But the sixth and worst addiction of all is the addiction to solitude. That addiction can happen at any age, for any sex and in any circumstances. And don't believe it is because you live with someone, you share your daily life and chores with someone that you are not alone on this earth. Solitude is our daily lot and there is no fate in that. It is just a fact and you have to accept it. If by any chance you get addicted to that solitude, then your life is going to be hell on earth because everything, everyone is going to be a disruption, a disturbance, a dysfunctional item or individual or bore.<br/><br/>When you meet people who are living an addiction to anything, you sure are going to come across a very disagreeable and very unpleasant experience. Addiction is the other side of the moon, the moon of life, the other side of it you can never see really because you are dead to the world, reason, logic, simple sanity and insane people don't see anymore: they fantasize.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","To view a film like Requiem you must approach it with a different set of goals than you would with most other films. The film takes you through the lives of four addicts who's addictions eradicate exactly that, their lives. An audience must brace themselves when approaching Requiem as the emotions felt at the end of the film are merely sad, distraught and cold, however, the film itself is one that should be viewed by all, for this heartbreaking roller-coaster ride presents unbelievable craftsmanship and acting which is Oscar-worthy from not only Ellen Burstyn, who was in fact nominated, but the other three stars also ; Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans who's abilities as a serious actor were astounding, ( yes, he was Shorty in Scary Movie).<br/><br/>Requiem is one of a few stand alone films of the previous decade, who's motive is not to entertain as such, but to demonstrate a universal message that addiction, no matter what it may be, can take control of an individuals life and ultimately destroy it and those around it. To start it provides hope that things can turn out beautiful, but the further in you get, the more you realise that they are inevitably doomed, this film brings you down with the four protagonists to the bottom, a pit of desperation and despair. As the credits rolled it felt like my breath had been held throughout the final climactic twenty minutes. Requiem is different from other horrifying movies due to its' realism, it makes you feel what they feel, it creates a bond between you and the protagonists as they are in fact likable characters who are however immoral, tainted by their addictions.<br/><br/>It is a brutal, honest and harrowing masterpiece, delivered through a medium of beautiful cinematography and fine craftsmanship, backed up with some of the most heartfelt and poignant acting I have seen in cinema. Watch Requiem, you won't regret it.... well, you might, but in a good way."

","IMDb Top 250: 62<br/><br/>Have you ever been scared by the aura of a movie? Requiem for a Dream was my first. Right from the start, I knew this was going to be a VERY memorable experience. And I knew it wouldn't end nicely.<br/><br/>Obviously, Requiem is about drugs and their effects on people. But this is different, all the good has been cut away, leaving the gritty, terrifying core, addiction. Requiem is one of the bleakest films I've ever seen. <br/><br/>This is a four-actor movie, and everyone pulls their weight. Most viewers will relate most to Harry, Jared Leto's character. He has the friend, the girl, family- just wants to make things work out. He also has his habit... The other three actors ( Burstyn, Connelly, Wayans) all step up to show three other sides of the addiction game.<br/><br/>Mrs. Goldfarb's story is the saddest, as she isn't even knowingly ruining herself. Ironically, she is the loneliest, despite seeing the most people during the film's events.<br/><br/>Two other things complete this essential viewing: the music and the camera-work. You've probably heard Lux Aeterna somewhere else, but the rest of the soundtrack is one of the best ever. Seriously, go listen to it right now. It will haunt you. Forever. Progressively it gets louder and more intense, as the character's scenarios change in the same direction. The camera-work works similarly, with shorter and shorter scenes until the climax. Also, very good use of split screen.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream's plot is such a downer, you have to see it for yourself. And since there's not really anything like it, you won't be able to prepare yourself.<br/><br/>*Edit* Just saw it for the third time, still a masterpiece. Another thing jumped out at me this time: the makeup. The characters look like HELL, and it looks so real. Harry's gangrenous wound... Also the ending is just as shaking and unnerving as ever. You cannot get desensitized.<br/><br/>Very few films are as powerful as this one. 9.7/10"

","When I watched this movie for the first time, I was with a friend and we put it in with an open mind. We knew coming into this movie knowing that it was weird and unusual. By the time the credits rolled onto the screen my friend and I sat there with no expressions on our faces looking at the TV screen. <br/><br/>It is hard to put into words what this movie does on any level of film. The film is, simply put, one of the greatest movie produced. It was well directed, well acted, and film exceptionally well. The way the movie warps the camera in some cases show what a high could\would feel and seem like in a moment of uncertainty and worry was astonishing. It was a beautiful movie from start to finish. I fell in love with Aronofsky's work the moment I saw Black Swan, but this film is far more then just a movie that can entertain you with physiological thrills( but do not get me wrong I loved Black Swan). It is one of the few films that hit me on an emotional level so hard that it leaves me in absolute silence with disturbed amazement. That cannot be said often about a film. This movie will not entertain most, but it is not to entertain when a movie like this is made. My belief on why a film like this is made will be different than your interpretation of why this film was made, and a Film that can do that is not just a film, but it is art."

","Amazing on a purely cinematic level – assaultive, hyper-kinetic, full of breathtaking images and cuts, The performances too range from good (Jared Leto) to extraordinary (Ellen Burstyn). <br/><br/>But for me, after a while, the style becomes the substance, and I'm ever more aware of the filmmaking rather than the story and characters,<br/><br/>Also, other than 'drugs are bad', I'm not sure what Aronofsky is really getting at. There are interesting implications that our real addiction is to our dreams, and escaping whatever our reality is, but those themes are never fully played out. So we end up with a film made with the technical skill of a Scorsese or Kubrick, but missing a layer of depth in favor of (admittedly amazing) pyrotechnics. <br/><br/>Last, it feels like the film 'cheats' more on reality as it goes along. By the end the story twists start to join the style in being over the top, and a bit illogical. <br/><br/>Now, all that carping aside, I still recommend this film for it's bravery, performances, and technical virtuosity. And it grew on me on a 2nd viewing. And I'm a fan of Aronofsky's. But I'm in the minority in admiring this film, but not being able to completely embrace it."

"suicidalicecreamtruckdriver","10","1","2","14 April 2011"," The Downward Spiral of movies
","REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is a rarity of a film. It's far too dark for mainstream cinema, hence the high ratings, it's inaccessibility will make it ignored by critics (although this is proved to be untrue) There is no romance, no laughter in this film- something that could be seen as a flaw. Although only 100 minutes in length, it feels longer, but not that it is triggered by boredom, but its triggered by the want to not see the grotesque imagery. The film finds its own happiness in the start by the character's ambitions, only to see them crumble as the film progresses. It's a film that will both depress and make you feel sick, due to the explicit depiction of drug addiction. It's greatness is gained by seeing the sickening truth of drug addiction, where such films have hindered away from. With a soundtrack of noisy violins that combine the harshness of noise music with the grand soundscapes of classical music, the film is going to depress, and make the characters (all actors, partically Jared Leto are to be commended) go through a downward spiral, where the light at the end of the tunnels can only be conjured by their imagination through the highs that are achieved through the drugs, but the truth in which the film gains most of its devastation from; the harshness of reality, something that is hard to escape. Thought provoking and a must see, but a warning must be made that this film isn't for those with weak stomachs. Although many people may view this as a bleak film, it could be said that it empowers the viewer to change their lives for the better. It's depressing, but the only visible light at the end of the tunnel will only be seen by the viewer. It's a see once movie, but it will not leave your mind for a very long time."

I remained stunned. I stayed awake all night, I could not sleep. Because of the shock I guess. But already the next morning I was glad I watched it. There is no chance that I will ever use drugs after these scenes. After i saw Harry's infected arm. And doctors treating his mother with electroconvulsives. And loneliness of the characters.

","I have been sitting here at my computer for nearly fifteen minutes, staring at a screen, wondering how to even begin to describe the effect this film had on me.<br/><br/>This is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. No, that is a lie - it IS the most powerful film I have ever seen! Of course, films are subjective, and not everyone can be pleased by the same film. But make no mistake, this film will ""please"" no-one. Having seen it, I feel it has affected me almost like the drugs that it displays. I am shocked, spaced out, paranoid and I feel the need to share it with everyone.<br/><br/>In a modern day society where singers trill joyfully about drugs and children deal them out in school like sweets, I feel like I need to show this film to everyone who has even listened to such a song, never mind tried such a drug.<br/><br/>The film shows the rapid decline over one year of four linked individuals, each driven to differing styles, but equal depths of despair and pity by their chosen drugs. While the story is strong and the acting stronger (especially Ellen Burstyn), the directing is what turns it into such a tour de force. The film begins with simple shots of drug taking, in throwaway style as if the characters were simply doing something as matter of fact as eating a biscuit, but as the effects begin to take their toll, both physically and psychologically, the camera becomes your enemy and the soundtrack feels like a torture as you begin to feel as if you are personally enduring every torture yourself. And the soundtrack is incredible - with the string ensemble summing up the movie perfectly - powerful, unforgettable, driving, intense and a thing of haunting beauty."

","I really was excited to watch this movie because the reviews were positive. Many people said it was hard to watch but I didn't think it was that hard to watch. I did not cry nor got really emotional at the end which surprised me. Maybe because I had to take bathroom brakes and had to stop the movie once in a while. Maybe I was expecting it to be a super great movie but I guess there is no perfect movie in the world. Well anyways I'm going to list the pros and cons.<br/><br/>Pros -Creative jump cuts/videography -Great acting -Interesting plot line that somehow gets you hooked even though sometimes you don't want to watch it at the same time. -Has a moral message unlike other modern movies<br/><br/>Cons -Sometimes the jump cuts were annoying and I just wanted to see more continuous dialog. -Obviously not great for families -The reason why I didn't cry is because I don't think there was a great consequence to these people. The person who I felt most bad for is the grandma because she becomes paranoid and it's just hard to watch. However the other characters just go to jail, gets arm amputated, and the girl just becomes promiscuous. Other than the fact that the love relationship between the guy and the girl just becomes ruined, I do not feel emotional about the three people.<br/><br/>Overall it's a great movie to watch by yourself. turn the lights off, go to the bathroom before the movie because that would make it more emotional."

","This is one of the rare movies that deeply impact you after viewing it. The last 20 minutes of the film are incredibly intense and disturbing, and unites the entire film in a beautiful-yet-horrific sort of way. What's more impressive is that this is achieved without mere gratuitous violence or shock-and-awe footage. This is Aronofky's greatest ability - to extract such strong emotion from the viewer, and what ultimately separates 'Requiem' from other movies with similarly strong subject matter; the simple use of strong images isn't sufficient to move the viewer, but needs to be part of a greater vision, something that this film recognizes and delivers in an unforgettable fashion. A decade later, this film still manages to profoundly affect me. 9/10."
"cxerophim","9","1","2","14 February 2011"," Mesmerizing...like a Catastrophe
","Requiem is not a movie for the faint of heart or easily offended, this coming from a discriminating viewer who adores movies that showcase society's gritty and grimy underbelly; and while it really has no other movie to compare itself against, I'd say the shock value and wow factor are on par with that of City of God. In a move of inspired cinematic form, we are led into the story slowly, providing four unique perspectives of life in a quasi-forgotten landscape near Coney Island. Through a deliberately slow buildup we are made to see these peoples' dreams of grandeur blossom for the briefest of instants and just as swiftly, wither and die. Each person has their own utopia in mind, but all are afflicted with a debilitating condition, addiction. And as each spirals deeper into the depths of their cravings they are forced to take drastic measures to get their fix. The endings, in my mind, are quite appropriate as they all find themselves in their own private hell. As I said at the beginning, there is no glamor, no glitz to be found here, just cold reality and it truly is striking, not a movie that most will watch casually, but one that I'd highly recommend to anyone looking for a well-produced, chilling reminder of the harsh realities of the real world."

The four interlinked stories are strong, told well with immense verve and imagination, and delivered with powerful performances by all the principals. The two women have, perhaps, the stronger roles and therefore make the greater impact, but everyone here delivers, and then some.<br/><br/>This movie, too, is dispiriting, but the characters are sufficiently sympathetic that you hope that their inevitable descent into tragedy will not happen.

","I see a lot of films these days. I am a big fan of films so I feel an obligation to see what films have made an impact out there. Most of the films I see I end up liking simply because I knew there was something to like. But only maybe a few times throughout a year do I see a film that I stop and say WOW to. Requiem for a Dream is another one of these rare great achievements that makes me savor and appreciate this art form and how powerful it can be.<br/><br/>A film does not have to have themes or messages that it tries to convince the viewers of. Sometimes a lot of great films do, and in their own ways it works, but even when seeing a film like this it is not hard for it to truly sink into your conscious. I have seen many films where they have a certain visual power that really hits deep, most notably films like 2001 A Space Odyssey or Mulholland Dr., or even Aronofsky's own recent Black Swan, yet when looking at all of these films by their own each one stands out. I love films like this, and I know it is not everyone's type of aspect that they like, but I do, so it is to be expected that I was mesmerized by this film. <br/><br/>The storyline itself is not important, it is the experience as I have always said. Seeing as it has been 10 years since this film came out, i can only imagine what type of reaction it took. Whatever opinion someone has of it, it is unforgettable. Someone might read that statement and say how self-indulgent it sounds, but ambition is certainly not missing here. Aronofsky is a true artist and now has two ground-breaking films under his belt- Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan (I am cautious not to let out the little word called 'masterpiece' on just one viewing). For a visionary films like this it is important for the director to make it worthwhile, but Aronofsky is also able to pull off great performances from his actors (Rourke in The Wrestler, Portman in Black Swan, and Burstyn here). Burstyn is not just great, she achieves everything needed and more. <br/><br/>The ending in itself is brilliant, and when the film ends one should not speak anything because it is so hard to. The film is in it's own way disturbing, mesmerizing, captivating, and extremely powerful, and should be seen by anybody who loves movies in general."

","Director Darren Aronofsky is really one of a kind. His films are the ones people are looking forward to see since Requiem For a Dream. And there's a reason for that. Requiem For a Dream is a brutal film. It's brutal because of the subject it handles which is drugs and addiction. It's also brutal how seriously and honestly it has shown to the viewers. It may shock more vulnerable people. It's a good drama still. It's a pressure-cooker so you may need extra focus to see that movie and get the point.<br/><br/>Well, what about cast? Ellen Burstyn is Oscar-nom, Jennifer Connelly is cute. Obviously the only serious role played in Marlon Wayans acting career, but he's OK.

","Requiem for a Dream...The psychologically disturbing path of self destruction.<br/><br/>Defining a cinematic genre of its own kind, Requiem for a Dream enriches you with an experience, though severely troubling, yet morally fulfilling. It tells the story of Harry (Jared Leto), his mother Sara (Ellen Burslyn), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans); four dreamers whom drug addiction, coming in different forms, is their ultimate downward spiral. <br/><br/>As if actors have been casted before the story has been written, every character falls into place with its portrayer making the film as real in the viewer's eyes as it could ever be. The human desperation to become wanted and desired is vividly presented by Ellen Burslyn who performs an Oscar nominated role of a life time with a character that walks pitifully through the pathway of sanity to insanity undergoing the painful transformation from human to clown in search for a wild dream. On the other hand, Leto, Wayans and Connelly, each in his own frame succeed in playing their very intense roles compellingly.<br/><br/>Director and mastermind Darren Aronofsky accomplishes a tough yet a necessary mission of putting the audience in a state of acquaintanceship with the complicated characters of the movie. As the story goes on, you feel attached to them, like you're a part of the group, as if you're another junkie on quest for a sniff or a desperate old timer hallucinating from diet pills. And then, with the speedy snapshot-like frames, the split screen scenes and the shots from the characters' view angles, we see cinematography and editing giving the director a well deserved helping hand that contributes to the making of a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Generally in the world of film making, music has always played a huge role in creating a film's identity. However, in ""Requiem for a dream"" music has played the center role, the lead which everything follows. The remarkable original theme coming from composer Clint Mansell stands out as the one thing that will always remind you of this film. Throughout the movie it makes you feel that all events revolve around it. It provides quite the goose bump effect required to let the audience appreciate the dramatic depth of what they're watching. And even in scenes where the main theme is not used, deep psychedelic music plays on pushing the audience forward to a unique state of euphoria that makes them feel exactly the same way the characters do.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, ""Requiem for a dream"" is a tale of sex, drugs and shattered dreams. It is so well-woven it takes control of the viewers' mood. As dark and grim as it is, it is also inspiring in its own way. Appreciate the acting, understand the lesson and fix yourself with a stand up comedy a while after to alter back your mood."

Sure, Jenny is a sexy girlfriend but she doesn't deliver the same intense play as her boyfriend or the mother.<br/><br/>For me, this character is the heart of the movie and her actress would have been worthy of an Oscar! It's unusual to have a movie about elderly people and their loneliness. As being alone is a fundamental pain, it's easy at this age to take the path to craziness. Here, the movie doesn't spare details. It's truth that TV is often the only social experience for loners but it can be very harmful. This threat and her madness is so brilliantly told that the last half-hour of the movie is nearly unbearable to watch. It's really like a bad trip, reminiscent of a Lynch movie, all the more than the mother looks like Grace Zabrisky (Laura Palmer's mother).<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie ranks second, behind ""Cruising"" as the most provoking and stunning movies I have seen."

There are problems galore to find with the film if you go digging, but it deeply disturbed and affected me nonetheless.<br/><br/>The film introduces us to a handful of characters all deeply dependent on drugs of one kind or another, and then follows them all down a demented rabbit hole as their stories spiral out of control. The final 20 minutes or so are a harrowing montage of terrible things happening to all of them -- infected arms being amputated, girls performing sex shows for drug money, middle aged women ending up in psych wards receiving shock therapy -- and threaten to take the film too far into camp territory to recover. But the saving grace of the film is that it's meant as more of an impressionistic soliloquy on desperation and hopelessness rather than a realistic representation of drug abuse.<br/><br/>Whatever else it is, it's a film that's virtually impossible to get out of your head.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

"gabem-1","9","1","2","23 March 2010"," a review
","REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is a movie that disturbs the viewer one way or another; according to many reviews and comments in the movie web sites, some in the audience have walked out in the middle; some have sat through till the end and have broken down crying, because they could not stop the four characters in this tragic fable going down. And some have criticized the effort of Darren Aronofsky as nothing but a stylistic shocker making up, with shrewd manipulation of montage images, sound effects, split screens and fast forward frames etc. for the lack of substance and story. I disagree to this last criticism.<br/><br/>This is a story that traces the downfall of four protagonists, who succumb to one antagonist who has no physical form. I was disturbed by this story,not because of the style, but because this villain, called addiction,which resides in many of us and can attack us as well; it can consume and destroy us before we realize, particularly in this age of speed,of wanting things quick and soon; where the peer pressures, the information overload from the hidden persuaders of media overwhelm us with promises of better look before dawn, bigger busts by miracle treatments and millionaire by tomorrow schemes. If there is a message from this movie maker, I would say that it comes out as we sit back and painfully reflect on why these characters destroyed themselves. Then we realize that we must be at peace with what we are and what we have,cherish our achievements and esteem.<br/><br/>All good stories have the important theme. The theme here is about the destructive nature of addiction. By the end of the movie, we are convinced that addiction can destroy anyone; common simple folks who can be of any age; who come from diverse backgrounds such as the four characters in this movie. The stories of four people in this film are the results of a chain of events that start off with ""normal, everyday folks"" and end in the worst kind of way, and in a way, aren't accidental, which maybe the saddest thing of all. These stories are parables to us of the roads best not taken.<br/><br/>Now, how do you present a theme where we need to show the movement of four protagonists and an invisible satanic antagonist which resides in each of them? There are four parallel plots running at the same time and they are intertwined at the appropriate moments to nail the audience to the mood of despair and helplessness that the four characters feel. The dialogs are very minimal and the shots are detailed into effective montages to bring forth the losing fights. After seeing the movie and reading the script one can see, how well the story is enhanced by the careful style chosen by the story teller.<br/><br/>In simple words, these are people who have their dreams like anyone of us. They are not unusual or weird people. Their objectives are not that of Einstein's or that of Hitler's! I believe this is what makes the movie a compelling piece of story. It hurts to watch this film, and is mentally painful to see the downfall these people, because the presentation is such that you start to care so much about these people. The director has made you to fall in love with these characters.<br/><br/>There are two scenes which can break the heart of any woman audience in this movie. It shows to what extent a person can stoop to because of the addiction and later feel disgusted. First is the one where Marian walks out and vomits after her sex with Arnold. The complete scene is shot hand-held with a strange hazy lens focus which deliberately distorts and barrels the image. Marian is disgusted, dazed and controls her nausea as she leaves the room of Arnold. The other scene is where we see Marian in the bath tub from above when she seems to clear her inside with a scream and throwing out the ""dirt and disgust"" she has gone through in having sex with Big Tim. There is strong characterization to show how the drug addiction can make normal people to do most disgusting things. One may not like these shots, but they make you feel sad for the characters and feel disgusted about the ill effects of addiction. <br/><br/>Is Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a dream a collection of montages to shock the audience while trying to cover a weak story? I do not think so. I believe that we have a strong story here which traces the journey of four individuals and this completes their portrayal in terms of bringing the full arc of transformation."

The addiction wins and the dream dies.<br/><br/>Graphic, heady and not a film for everyone. My rating 10. I can't fault it anywhere. It accomplished its ends."

","It's a one feverish 100-minutes-long video clip. I wanted to say effective too, and it is in a way, but I won't. And that's why I'm writing about it now. Yes, the artistic points worked, Clint Mansell's music was fabulous, and the acting - especially from (Ellen Burstyn)'s side - was truthful to creepy extent, but all of that was in a bad hype.<br/><br/>The problem is that it deals with the addiction's lust - whether of drugs or TV - with lust as well. The pace of the movie, 2000 shots, the horizontal extension of the event, the complete collapse of all the characters' fates, and the absence of any positive type as well-made the whole thing as a catastrophic tragedy maybe as painful as the addiction itself!<br/><br/>I don't promote for a happy ending, or making a dream out of it. In fact, I find that the movie's own end is a real happy one compared to it. It just needed deep analysis for the reasons, not a volcano of results as we saw. Otherwise, it's only a study for the hell of images and sounds that an addict lives. Or, at worst, it's the longest, most exhausting, public service announcement against addiction. Both ways, the very substance became so strained and worn out.<br/><br/>In (Requiem for a Dream), dealing with important matter, and a social issue, as a horror movie was the real horrific thing. Hence, does it effect? Yes, but as one feverish 100-minutes-long video clip, not a movie. Simply with the hype, anything meaningful runs weak. So how about being with weak drama too?! In short, it hates drugs while looking like being on one!"
"daryl42-1","10","1","2","22 January 2010"," Perfect embodiment of drug use in the format of film.
","9.3<br/><br/>Requiem For A Dream is a very powerful movie. It is powerful in more than one way. Both thematically, and artistically, the movie captures the correct atmosphere and mood of the subject matter. The pacing and editing also fit the theme well. Everything is seamed together in this movie, and nothing falls out of place.<br/><br/>If you've ever taken drugs, especially heroine, but not limited to, you will immediately connect with Requiem For A Dream and its characters. It seems like Aronofsky and his crew tried to capture the essence of drug use into film format, while telling a story about the pitfalls and traps of drug use, whether it be for medical reasons, or for pleasure. They succeeded. What we have here is a movie that embodies the drug its tale is based upon. Like heroine, the user immediately feels pleasure once the substance is introduced to the bloodstream, the user is raised high into a state of euphoria. In the first half hour, the movie is mellow and pleasurable to watch, but not without its cringes. After a while, the effects start to dwindle. The drug drops you from your hedonistic height, and eventually the user is left feeling lower than sobriety. The climax of the movie leaves you feeling disturbed, if not disgusted, at the physical, psychological and even spiritual effects of drug use.<br/><br/>Aronofsky and crew utilize quick cuts, multiple frames at once, and even odd camera positioning techniques to put you into the shoes of the characters, to help you feel their despair, and their euphoria as well. The pacing and the atmosphere in this film are some of the best that I've seen in film-making. I wouldn't say that the film is one of the greatest of all time, but it's definitely an achievement that solidified Aronofsky and Mansell as filmmakers in my eyes."
"ferbs54","7","1","2","30 September 2009"," The Dark Ladder
","Delineating a quadruple downhill spiral of escalating drug addiction and hallucinatory madness, Darren Aronofsky's 2000 offering, ""Requiem for a Dream,"" is some pretty intense stuff indeed. In it, Oscar-nominated Ellen Burstyn plays Sara Goldfarb, a sweet Jewish senior living in Brighton Beach who becomes devastatingly hooked on purple, blue, orange and green diet pills, while her son (Jared Leto), his pal (Marlon Wayans) and his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) go down what Joni Mitchell has referred to as ""the dark ladder"" of heroin addiction. This interesting dual story line is made even more effective by the great acting jobs turned in by the film's four principals, and the very flashy, stylized direction that Aronofsky employs, utilizing split screens, slo- and fast-motion photography, rotating camera work, fish-eye lenses, strobe lights, etc. Burstyn surely did deserve her Oscar nomination in this role, and the film, I feel, should have been singled out for its direction, photography and editing, as well...not to mention the incredible makeup job that Judy Chin & Co. accomplished, turning the still-glamorous Burstyn of 2000 into an overweight senior, and then a gaunt and grizzled hag. So yes, the film IS intense, but ""not for the squeamish,"" as has been reported? With the exception of one fork shoved through a hand, and the quite unpleasant sight of Jared shooting up into a very messed-up (gangrenous?) arm, the picture is not at all quease inducing. By the film's end, the dreams of all four characters (the perfect dope score, a dress shop, to be on TV) lie crushed beneath a cold and miserable reality. This is a picture that transpires over the course of a summer, fall and winter; for its four main, pitiful characters, there is no spring...."
"thesar-2","6","1","2","12 September 2009"," Requiem for a Nightmare
","I was in the mood for a real, honest ""feel-good"" movie and was not disappointed in 'Requiem for a Dream.' There's heartwarming drama, true family ties, love, comedy and all around wholesome to be found in this uplifting tale.<br/><br/>Of course, I'm just kidding. Despite one character taking uppers, this serves up the downers, in truckloads.<br/><br/>Four characters in various degrees of drug usage and stages of narcotics spiral out of control, and yet, I felt the movie serves up the extreme consequences only a few go through. Granted, I am not a drug user, nor do I associate people that live this kind of existence, so what do I know? It just seemed to me, in a very short time, less than a year, these people went from (sort-of) real world to near death or worse.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a son scaring his mother by removing her TV. My first reaction was he was trying to help her from her television addiction. On the contrary, it was to sell it for the x amount of times in order to score drugs with his friend. They, with the addition of the son's girlfriend come up with a ""surefire"" way to make it big and out of the life-path they've set themselves on. Hmmm, without giving anything away, I wonder if their slam-dunk plan will work. Meanwhile, Mom gets her dream come true: guest starring on the one and only show on TV (really? There was never anything else on?) To prepare, she inadvertently gets hooked on uppers her careless doctor prescribes. Even her son tells her ""Say no to drugs.""<br/><br/>Overall, I liked the movie that doesn't just also tell the audience to avoid drugs, but shows why in very original and unique ways. Great performances, especially Burstyn (Mom.)<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the reason I didn't give it a higher rating was though the story was predictable, the results seemed somehow sped up. Also, the music, which was sometimes good, most times was so overbearing/such a distraction to what was going on or the dialogue spoken. And finally, as unrealistic (again, I'm not a druggie, so I'm mostly assuming) as their lives seemed to turn out, they made the rest of the world crazy, too. Blind doctors, electric shock treatments to cure prescription woos and a station that runs a ""game show/self-help"" program 24 hours a day, 7 days a week marathon on 3 simple principles of ""being a winner."" I know those exist, but mercifully, they're only usually in 30 minute 3AM time slots."
"hrstar24","8","1","2","5 September 2009"," Very intense
","After seeing and loving The Wrestler, which is also directed by Darren Aronofsky, and hearing all the hype around this movie, I finally decided to watch it. I can say that after seeing the film, all the stories floating around it are true. It is one of the most intense movie experiences I have ever had in my life.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream, based on the novel by Hubert Shelby Jr., follows Harry (Jared Leto), his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and his lonely mother (Ellen Burstyn) as they each realize there dreams of money and happiness, only to have them transformed into horrific nightmares by drugs and narcotics.<br/><br/>Darron Aronofsky definitely shows his directing skills in Requiem. Every scene is torn down frame by frame, and then cut back together to give a strange psychedelic feel to the movie. It's a little like Pink Floyds The Wall, except there are actually characters and a plot that we can follow. The editing and directing is definitely the best aspect of Requiem, because it is so imaginative. The music is another brilliant piece that adds to the suspenseful and disturbing vibe.<br/><br/>The overall plot of the movie is isn't very deep, and leaves a slight feeling of being let down, like there was more potential there. Also, there could have been a little more character development because even the main characters seemed a little flat. But other than that, everything else was brilliant. All the actors are in top form, especially Ellen Burstyn who gives a truly amazing performance as a drug addicted old lady. Even Marlon Wayans shows his unique range in the film.<br/><br/>The most famous part of Requiem by far is its reputation for being intense. And the film definitely lives up to its name. This was the first time I have ever felt like walking out of the movie before it was over not because it was bad, but because it is almost too much to take in at once. It accomplishes what horror movies try so hard to do, by creating a truly chilling atmosphere as the characters fall into a living hell. It is this intensity, however, that makes watching the movie so unique that everyone should experience at least once. Requiem grabs your heart as the characters find happiness but doesn't let go as it drags you and its characters into the disturbing and sinister reality of addiction.<br/><br/>Overall, Darren Aronofsky is once again able to create a very unique movie experience with Requiem through great visuals, music, and acting. I recommend that everyone see this movie at least once, because it leaves such a lasting impression on anyone who sees it."
"Copaface","9","1","2","5 August 2009"," Shocking, terrifying and brutally honest.
","I had first heard about Requiem For A Dream on one of those top ten lists sites. It was ranked at number 7 in a list of disturbing films which instantly drew me in to a desire to watch it. The first thing that must be said about this film is that the acting is top notch. Now I am no fan of Jared Leto's. I abhor his band and I only watched American Psycho because I heard that he died in it. And after watching Scary Movie, I could never imagine Marlon Wayans succeeding in a serious movie role. But both of them proved me 100% wrong. After watching Requiem... I barely even want to touch a glass of alcohol again let alone any type of drugs. This film is incredibly, brutally honest in its portrayal of not only the drugs lifestyle but the fear of growing old alone. In steps the fantastic yet tragic performance of Ellen Burstyn as the lonely, elderly mother obsessed with a spam call telling her she will be on television. The last ten minutes of the film is the culmination of how devastating the effect of drugs can be as each of the characters suffer their own tragic fate.<br/><br/>Definitely give this film a watch. It may just be life-changing."
"Mr_Censored","10","1","2","15 July 2009"," Beautifully Ugly.
","Spending 100 minutes with ""Requiem for a Dream"" is like falling down a slippery slope that never lets up. You'll partake in the addictions with the characters on-screen and follow the downward spiral that ensues. In just his second directorial effort, Darren Aronofsky has crafted a film that is both beautiful and tragic, as well as emotionally gripping. You'll get to know and love, as well as sympathize with the characters, in spite of their sometimes selfish and ignorant decisions, all in the pursuit of improving their own lives. A widowed TV-junkie, a sheltered young woman with over-bearing parents, the boyfriend who just wants to make his girlfriend happy and a man who dreams of making his mother proud -- these aren't junkies, but rather, victims of their addictions who, as much as they try to overcome it and make things better, only end up worsening their troubles, brilliantly illustrating the devastating effects of any addiction, be it narcotics or otherwise.<br/><br/>To say ""Requiem for a Dream"" is the most effective P.S.A. to date would be an understatement. Show this to any teenager who is even thinking about trying hard drugs and you'll likely turn them around. There are many who have said it before me, but this should be a mandatory screening for high school health classes. It's both stunning and true to life how quickly the lives of the characters get swallowed up in their addiction, and no matter what walk of life you come from, and even if you've never tried a mind-altering substance in your life, you'll relate to it in some form or another. Give this film to anyone lacking life experiences, and it will be guaranteed to have a positive impact on their future choices.<br/><br/>While the film is highly stylized and as drugged-out visually as its characters are, it never loses ground or strays from its humanity. The characters are brought to life by a brilliant ensemble cast. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly as young lovers trying to make it on their own are convincing and likable, but it is Marlon Wayans, known for his comedic roles, who really shines among the young actors. You may know him from ""Scary Movie"" or ""Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood,"" but his role in this film shows he has the acting chops and the charisma to break out into more serious film roles. It's a shame, then, that he has yet to do so. Then there's Ellen Burstyn, who plays the TV and food junkie beautifully. Burstyn disappears into her role completely, and delivers a performance that can only be described as heart-breaking. Behind all the style, Aronofsky handles his characters with maturity, giving them enough time to build while keeping up a brisk pace. You may only spend 100 minutes with ""Requiem for a Dream,"" but its effects will last a lifetime."
"shredalo03","10","1","2","28 February 2009"," Four intertwined lives spiral downward as they surrender to their addiction..
","Tired of happy endings?.. This is that masterpiece of a film!.. It will torment you, distress you, make you vomit if you will, it'll drain you emotionally and psychologically.. It will haunt you long after the end credits roll.. Let me just say that I'm putting this up on my 'MOVIES to WATCH BEFORE YOU DIE' list.. Everyone has to at least watch one such bleak and harrowing film in his/her lifetime.. If you really are tired of happy Hollywood endings, then go look for this movie and just have a great depressing time!..<br/><br/>We meet Harry and Marion who are a couple in Brooklyn with dreams of building a small business for themselves. Both are compulsive heroin addicts. Tyrone, Harry's best friend, a heroin addict himself is a street-smart hustler who with Harry, decide on risking their chances in the realm of the drug business. Sarah Goldfarb is Harry's mom. She lives all alone in her apartment and couches the whole day in front of the TV set. It is too boring and lonely. One day she receives a call from her most loved show and gets a chance of a lifetime to appear on television. When her beloved red dress can't seem to fit her, she goes through the usual slimming methods until she winds up using diet pills (uppers).<br/><br/>Four intertwined lives. Four desperate dreams. Each with a down-spiraling path laid in front of them. All we can do is witness and experience the horror.<br/><br/>This film is SUBSTANCE and STYLE. Substance, well.. first of all, it's about substance abuse but moreover, one measure I use to assess whether a film is good or not is if I actually care about its characters. All throughout, I felt their desperation and wished that things have gone differently for them. And talk about performances! Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are electric. Marlon Wayans who's known for his comic persona in the Scary Movie films and White Chicks shows us that he can put his A-game on the table. But you won't soon forget the courageous Ellen Burstyn. Daring and bold, she pulled off one of the best screen acting I have ever seen. Charlize Theron in Monster was something but Burstyn's was on par and very powerful. Heartbreaking is the best word to describe her scenes.<br/><br/>Style?.. you couldn't ask for more. I gotta give Darren Aronofsky props for using a variety of camera and editing techniques to subjectify the characters' emotions and mental states. He makes us see what they see, hear what they hear, feel what they feel, and then slams us back into harsh reality! And with such a haunting score to accompany these moments, this film is entirely unforgettable. I can honestly say that this is one of the best films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>This is a different kind of horror movie. You gotta have the stomach to take it. This is really heavy and intense stuff. Like I said at the beginning, if you're tired of happy endings, this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>I'm just glad I watched this on a Sunday morning. If it was around the 5PM-7PM mark, I would've thrown up from just feeling so bad."

","I just watched REQUIEM FOR A DREAM for the third time and I still was absolutely blown away. Never before has a film so accurately captured the nightmare of addiction.<br/><br/>First off, I want to say that the song that is performed by the Cronos Quartet is one of the most haunting yet beautiful songs ever, period.<br/><br/>Jared Leto gives a solid performance as Henry Goldfarb,a heroin addict that's always in search for a fix. He shows that he can play a major role, instead of just supporting ones like in Fight Club and American Psyco.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly plays Marion Silver, Henry's girlfriend and fellow heroin addict. Here, she shows (just like Leto) that she can take on a major role and not fail to give a winning performance. Marlon Wayans plays Tyrone C. Love, Henry's best friend and (you guessed it!) fellow pusher.<br/><br/>But the real gem of the film is Ellen Burnstyn's performance as Sara Goldfrab, Henry's mother. She gives the performance of a lifetime here, as a diet pill addicted widow. She most definitely deserved the Oscar nom and the Oscar itself. (She lost to Julia Roberts in ERIN BROCKOVICH.) The last half hour or so are quite possibly the most heart wrenching scenes in a movie ever. Henry Goldfarb needs to get his arm amputated because of an infection from one of the needles he used. Marion Silver is prostituting herself so she can get a fix. Tyrone is arrested and in prison he must face hostile prison guards, hard labor, and drug withdrawal all alone. Sara completely breaks down and becomes hospitalized where she undergoes electric shock therapy, eventually becoming emaciated and catatonic in a mental asylum.<br/><br/>For some reason, people sometimes say that this glorifies drug use. THIS IS THE BIGGEST ANTI-DRUG MOVIE EVER! just from the last couple scenes(look at the above paragraph) you know that Darren Aranofsky is showing you how ruined someone's life can get from using drugs! The film leaves a deep, deep impression in your mind that will last forever."

","I watched this movie after 9 years and it has in deed been overdue. I've heard many amazing things about it and perhaps this is partly why I enjoyed it that much; or maybe it's because it's really, really good. The plot is based on 4 lives of 4 people, lives that amalgamate with each other and complete each other. Harry and his friend Tyrone are drug addicts and basically best friends: Marion is Harry's girlfriend. Her family is wealthy, but her ambitions are much bigger: she doesn't want to lead the life she is supposed to lead. Sara is Harry's single mother, and her story is exactly the same, it ends the same, and the reasons behind her addiction are exactly the same as in her son's case. Sara is addicted to the past: when she is given a chance to be in a TV show, which has been her dream, she puts herself through hell and ultimately looses her own identity along with her mind. Even though she always has a smile on her face, she is alone and unhappy; and she sees a chance to change her life, and tell millions of viewers how proud she is of her own son - which seems to be the only thing she wants in life. And that longing is her true addiction: pills she begins taking are nothing but one step closer to achieving relief. Harry, on the other hand, carries a lot of guilt from the past he is unable to cope with: and even though he finds true love, he turns his back on it as soon as the option of his girlfriend sleeping with another man for money emerges. Ty is also addicted to the past: he cannot shake off the memories of his long-gone mother and the promises he had made still haunt him. Marion is addicted to her own independence, but when Harry disappears, the physical side of heroin addiction finds her and she is forced to do things she wouldn't think of doing 3 seasons before. The movie begins in summer, goes through fall and finally winter; spring never comes. There is no happy end of any kind: Sara seems to lost her mind and the only thing she remembers are the happy visions of her on stage with her beloved son, basking in the fake lights of reflectors. Ty gets into jail. Harry looses his hand and, even worse, Marion. She is shown literally clinging to the pack of drugs, falling asleep with a smile on her face. Disturbing images, shocking plot and depressing twists contrast with amazingly shot scenery: it is one of those movies you can freeze at any given time, print the scene and hang it on the wall. I believe this movie is an absolute must for anybody: especially for the young ones. Don't make no mistake. This movie WILL shock you. It will make you cry. It will make you discover feelings you never thought you had. It will make you feel alive."

","Requiem for a dream is hands down one of my favorite movies. All of my friends who have seen the clip seem to think otherwise, perhaps because they look at the movie as one that is trying to convey the dangers of drugs, which yes it is but the movie has such a deeper underlying meaning that so many seem not understand.<br/><br/>America is the land of oppourtunity, the place where dreams are made and happiness if fulfilled. Aronofsky uses his masterpiece film to show that the ADDICTION TO HOPE CAN BE JUST AS DANGEROUS AS THE ADDICTION TO DRUGS. the meaning of requiem is a a song or hymn of mourning composed or performed as a memorial to a dead person or in this case it is the death of their dreams. They all have hopes of dreams that become evident in the beginning of the movie, Sara wants to fit into the red dress, harry and tyrone want to get a pound of pure heroin and Marian and harry want to get enough money to open up a shop and be able to focus on their future with each other. As their drug habits spiral out of control so do their dreams, everything that starts outs so promising soon comes to an end.<br/><br/>One thing that he uses to foreshadow their dreams is the use of the seasons. Summer is a time of happiness, relaxation and promise. The movie starts out in the summer and that is when everything seems so promising and their drug habits seem to be some what under control. Just as everything is at full bloom in the summer so are their dreams of greatness. At first everything seems to be going great, Sara is feeling the best she has in a while and losing the weight, harry is making a fortune by selling the heroin, it seems as though harry and Marian are going to be able to open their shop and their relationship for the future is promising. the scenes before the fall shows the beginning of their demise. In the cab it shows Harry's greater reliance of heroin, Sara's spped pills are turning on her, aren't affecting her as much and she starts hallucaiating, tyrone gets arrested and they have to spend half their money on his bail and worst yet all their connections for heroin are being killed. they fall to desperate measures to keep hope for their once so promising dreams. Marian and Harry's relationship begins to dwindle has money and their dreams begins to crinkle and they start fighting and they all start becoming more depended on the drugs just as does their hope for their dream. By winter time it is evident that they are all doomed and that they are all so wrapped up in their addiction for both hope and drugs that there is no escape. Sara becomes so delirious that she has to be sent into the hospital, Marian realizes the only way to keep up with her addiction is to become a prostitute and in a final desperate act of hope harry and tyrone take a trip to Florida to get a heroin. In the final scenes it shows they have no chance of scoring heroin when things spiral out of control in the grocery store shutting off all hope of their dream. their hope and dreams take over their life so much that they are willing to travel all the way to Florida to get the heroin just as their drug addiction does. Harrys drug addiction becomes so bad that he has to get his arm amputated, tyrone ends up back in jail and in the final scene of dialouge it shows how harry and marians relationship is done because their addictions have altered their lives so much that there is no chance of change."

","When my friend told me to watch Requiem for a Dream, I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be another 'Don't do drugs kids!' movie, with bland characters and a lackluster plot line. I couldn't have been more wrong. <br/><br/>Requiem for a dream offers believable characters that you grow to love. Each actor does a spectacular job at facing the REAL side of addiction, not the glamorized version shown in most movies. With no weak-link in the cast, each character shows their personal struggle, whether it be with addiction, or loneliness in a honest way. <br/><br/>One of my favorite aspects of this film is the music. I've never felt so emotionally engaged in a movie, and Clint Mansell had a lot to do with that. The sounds don't compete with the images on the screen, but enhance it and make it real. Lux Aeterna being the theme song of the movie is perhaps one of the best songs I've ever heard. It brings you through every emotion with not a single word. <br/><br/>Another aspect of the film I adore is the incredible cinematography. The fact that you never once see a character actually doing drugs in this movie, yet you know exactly what is going on, is absolutely mind-boggling. The beautiful, yet frightening images on the screen make you feel what the characters are feeling, down to each character's individual pain and agony. At the end of the film, when Harry is lying on the hospital bed, it's hard not to feel every level of his pain, whether it be physical, or emotional.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream truly is one of the best films of our day, and offers a true glimpse into the world of addiction. I would recommend this film to anyone."

","This is one of the most shocking dark & tragic film I have seen in a long back. The movie which made me shock & awe before this is 'American Beauty' which is one of my all time favorite one. It's not great acting, classic cinematography or touch wood direction but shattering & shocking portrayal of chasing American Dream & its tragic reality which still lingers in memory when I first watched that Oscar winning gem of Sam Mendes. Now here Darren Aronofsky has done something which has done same impact on your mind. In a very poignant way he jumbled up sharp cutting images of various dreams about love, fame, money, beauty, and hope into the lives of four central characters of the film. How Drugs entered into each character's life & fulfill their escape route to their dream till they all reached doom is also something very original in theme as well as projection. Every actor has done nice justice to their complex roles but it's Ellen Burstyn as a lonely old age mother who breathes in the character of Mrs. Sara Goldfarb 7 it's really an Oscar worthy act. Film is technically appealing with cool visuals & sound adding substance to the film. Infect it is the execution of that visual style which has captured the essence of this brilliant script by Hubert Selby Jr. This is dark modern classic which may become another dark drug film if the viewer is not involved in itIts emotional & subjective involvement into this tragedy which makes it altogether different experience.<br/><br/>Brilliant work of Art.

","It's a great drama about dreams, hopes, disillusions, loss of control, and self destruction. When you become a slave of your own dreams and are disposable to do everything to achieve them you will for sure do things you weren't expecting and you might lose control. If this single loss turns into a permanent loss of control you will not control your life anymore because those ""little things"" which were ""nothing special"" become into an addiction. Once addicted you will have this feeling always asking you to feed it... Like that scene where the TV show's host and the ""contestant SARA"" ask to the ""addicted SARA"": ""Feed me Sara, Feed me...""! I enjoyed that scene because I think it was great portraying her state of addiction. In the particular case of this character what turned her into this state was her obsession with the TV show and her loneliness. The other characters were drugs and their ambition to make money. Nevertheless in both cases there's a dream that becomes a nightmare because of their loss of control. <br/><br/>This film is hard because it's about a very delicate matter, but it's also excellent because it confronts us to our most deep fears in a very crude, and sometimes even cruel, way. <br/><br/>The acting job is great from all actors and the cinematography is just excellent! From the great camera shots, to the ""accelerated scenes"" or to the ""cool combination"" between images and sounds, it's really great! I think it's not completely original but I don't remember to watch many films with this kind of cinematography.

","""It's such a fine line between clever and stupid"" goes the immortal line from Spinal Tap, and this film reinforces that message. The direction and cinematography and editing are as look-at-me slick, stylish and gimmicky as the most 80's of music videos. But oh my goodness the plot. I came to this comments board after seeing the film hoping, once my laughter had subsided, to make the obvious ""drugs are bad m'kay"" jokes, mock the ludicrous plot, and point out that this film outdoes Reefer Madness for camp, self-parodying counterproductive hyperbole. But I see plenty of others have beaten me to the punch in stating the obvious. This film is the Monty Python ""Salad Days"" skit writ large. Try drugs, and you will end up getting your infected arm amputated, your game-show-addicted mother will get shock treatment in a loony bin after trying to slim down to fit into her red dress, and funniest of all, your white girlfriend will be forced to fellate over-endowed black men and have foreign objects inserted into her anus at orgies in exchange for drugs. I could almost visualise John Waters and Ed Wood and William S. Burroughs making up this plot over a few cones of wacky tabbacky as they laughed and masturbated themselves silly. Except that they would have cast Divine as both the mother and girlfriend if they had been directing, and they would have called it something like ""Naked Flamingoes from Outer Space"" rather than given it the pretentious title that it actually had. And they wouldn't have taken it all quite so seriously. Watching this film, I honestly expected a Ron Jeremy cameo at any minute. The whole plot sounds like one of his Catskills routines, complete with long-suffering Jewish mothers doting on their disappointing sons. How they managed to avoid having Ellen Burstyn say ""You coulda been a doctor like that nice Dr Spencer"" I'll never know.<br/><br/>All that said, despite the clichés and the pretentiousness and the ludicrous, heavy-handed, moralising, didactic plot, the film has its merits. I wasn't overly bored, the direction was OK, if a little hammy, and the acting was adequate, if a little hammy. Still, I don't understand the rating of 8.5/10 and the rave reviews. That puts it higher than ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", which is even more ludicrous than the plot."

","It's a hard and well expressed movie.No need message,the messages can be a lot.The characters makes mistakes driving their lives to the pain but it's very disturbing to realize(and this is one of the values of the film)that people surrounding them ""helps"" very much to reach that pain.There are a lot of movies that treat the theme of the drug-addiction in many ways but this is one of the bests because it doesn't stop in describing the additions of typical drugs and it describes another type of no-return sort of additions and degradations giving us a quite complete vision of several different forms of falling down into dis-control in the lives of those unfortunate persons and takes the right elements that surround them in the story.May be nothing new is said but the way it is said is really convincing.THe personal at the hospital seem to be not treating with a human being,but with a thing. And this is unfortunately true in our world today.The style of description in the last minutes,when the final degeneration process is going on,the intercalation of suffering moments is brutal.The scenes does appear showing us the faces nearly,the elements like hand knocking a door nearly,the etc.and with the vibration some scenes have when we see the faces of the characters is a well done way to show the real pain;in fact,this is one of the most effective films ever in putting pain on the screen,in this final sequences."

","Requiem for a Dream is, undoubtedly, an example of exquisite craftsmanship and visionary film-making. It reinforces the anti-drug theme- but this time round, Aronofsky decides to go for a frontal assault and leaves you with harrowing images. Briefly, the story charts the course of 4 lives, imperfect and ordinary to begin with, through three seasons. The Summer is the high of addiction, where things seem a little bit more colorful and hopeful than usual; the Autumn is when it all starts to crumble while the Winter marks the absolute destitution, even the death of hope.<br/><br/>The visual techniques are what set this apart and the intriguing camera placements, split-screen scenes, the montages add to the experience. Coupled with the truly outstanding music, it is an attempt to get the audience invested in the proceedings.<br/><br/>The performances are inch perfect, led by a brilliant Ellen Burstyn.<br/><br/>My disquietude with the movie arises from the overt usage of striking visuals, a distinct attempt to gross the audience out. Aronofsky unravels the characters and their vulnerabilities- and just when you though that it was enough, he kicks you in the guts again. There is nothing redemptive in this movie at all, which I found disturbing."

"piksplanet","10","1","2","5 July 2008"," Absolutely heart-stopping!!
","Requiem for a Dream is a an Academy Award nominated film directed by Darren Aronofsky and based on Hubert Selby Jr's 1978 novel of the same name. The film revolves around four characters - Sara Goldfarb, her son Harry, and his best friend and girlfriend, Tyron and Marion. It's primary theme revolves around their individual dreams, and how their addiction to drugs imprison them in a dream world of illusion which, later on, mixes with reality, leading to their ruin.<br/><br/>Point one to be noted is that Requiem for a Dream is not a film for the faint hearted. It got a NC-17 rating on its initial limited release in the US. Everything in the movie is made in such a way that it leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. Whether it is the opera-style background score which is more effective than any I've heard in recent times; the camera-work, often hooked up to the characters neck in order to give the viewers a dizzy feeling which is exactly what the leads are feeling in the particular sequence; or the absolutely heart-stopping performance from Ellen Burstyn; Requiem for a Dream is one of the most well made movies of all time. I still find it hard to believe that Ellen Burstyn did not win an Oscar for her role as Sara Goldfarb. You'll have to see it to believe how amazing her portrayal of a woman gone deranged is! Everyone else in this movie give the performance of their lifetime.<br/><br/>You will squirm in your seat when you see what could happen to a human being's arm because of taking drug shots. It will scare you more than you've ever been scared. For any of you who are curious about the effects of drug use, this film is a must see. Like Danny Boyle's Trainspotting, it gives you harsh reality. Be afraid, be very afraid..<br/><br/>10/10. Freaked me out like anything!"

","This film is great in it's artistry, cinematography...but WAY overrated. Very cliché plot. The acting is good though, the best I've personally seen from Wayans. But aside from simply being very disturbing, which was an obvious desire of the director, it's just kinda boring. Lots of drug usage scenes. Get's pretty old. Im sure that was a desired effect so they could show how deeply they were getting into their usage, but after awhile its just like ""ok...here we go again. Borrrring."" Feels stale after like...the 3rd, 4th, 5th time. And it occurs a LOT more than that. A fairly typical ending. May be very disorienting to watch for some. Good film but definitely overrated."

Ellen Burstyn is absolutely brilliant. But the films excellence lies within it's mesmerizing power.<br/><br/>Some people have said that this film should be shown in High School health classes.

I don't know any drug addicts but, hell, that portrayal was more than great, congrats to all of them. Even the story shocks. Where there is no happy ending, there is something that will surely keep your thought fixed to the whole ""drug"" thing. This is a great movie perfected by all the freaky and new way of directing.

","I give this film high marks for its editing and ability to hold true to its gut-wrenching focus from beginning to end. It's hard film to watch...but it also lacks much of a reason to.<br/><br/>The story, if you want to call it that, starts and finishes at the same point. There is no beginning, middle or end...it's just a sequence (though a terrifying one at that).<br/><br/>For a film to take itself as seriously as this one does, a viewer should...no wait, NEEDS to care about the characters. For me, at no point did I feel much sympathy or care about any of them, with the exception of maybe the mother.<br/><br/>Despite my frustrations with the script, it is well acted. It's gritty and certainly conveys the despair and dark underworld of addiction. But again, without any sort of arc, I never felt sucked into it and was really expecting some sort of payoff, which never occurred.<br/><br/>The editing is certainly unique and worth showing to film students. I've never seen a film like it from that standpoint.<br/><br/>If you can ignore the writing and just ""go along for the ride"", then its worth a watch. Personally, I was hoping for more."

"vitriolicme","10","1","2","21 January 2008"," My favorite film!
","This film has been my favorite film since I first viewed it, what seems like many years ago now. It's one I have sat my friends through and made them watch and it's one that doesn't fail to impress them. Requiem For A Dream is hard to dissect because it's the whole work that is faultless for me. I couldn't imagine it without the music it has, or without the cast it has, as all of these elements make it the stand up film it is. It's a real, gritty, moving, haunting film. And if purchased I would fully recommend watching the extras the DVD contains as it will make you notice the subtle details more and appreciate it even more, knowing the thought that went into how it looked. The lighting changes with the seasons to mirror the characters live's. I since tried to view Pi many a time but unfortunately never enjoyed it and struggled to watch it. Requiem is a piece of art and though perhaps I shouldn't feel this way, I feel having read the book, that the book has no impact compared to Darren's portrayal. It's a hard watch because it can be incredibly depressing at times, but I think that it almost makes it more worth watching as it is a movie that will make you think. After I watched it the first thing I did was choose to write an essay about it. It makes you want to get people to watch it and gauge their reactions."
"lagriff05","Null","1","2","10 January 2008"," I'm speechless.
","This is a bleak, remorseless movie. It is so bleak, remorseless and depressing that I can't even really find words to say about it in a review. If director Darren Aronofsky's 2006 masterpiece The Fountain was the essence of love, eternal life and vigorous spirit, this movie is every bit the antithesis of those more positive themes.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's directing is every bit as compelling as on his later work, starting off dreary, hazy and even comical in a twisted sort of fashion, but before you even realize it's happening, the storytelling is quickly contorted into a demented mad carnival-esquire thrill ride, finally fading out into a sorrowful, monotone-gray ending that will leave you thinking, depressed, and most of all, changed.<br/><br/>The four main characters in the film are not deeply shaded with character development and intricate backgrounds. In contrast, the characters here are not really given colorful and detailed backgrounds, and we are provided with just sprinkles and minor tidbits of their pasts, making it very hard to know the meaning behind their motives and actions, and also making it so that we aren't going to start pitying these characters - we can fully see the consequences of their actions, not blinded by any misgivings we might have about what ""good people they all are underneath."" It creates a very shady atmosphere, Aronofsky has a talent for creating beautiful films on such scanty character development and plot background, and it's another part of what makes this good.<br/><br/>This is a masterful film, and I can't really assign a rating to it...it's beyond all that. Not essential, but if you want a compelling, emotional, and endearing film that will tug at your heartstrings while making you reel back in revolted disgust, and also provide something thought provoking and dense, get this. It might not be something you'll be in the mood for all the time, but when you do go back to it, it will remain as powerful as before."
"josefflorian","9","1","2","8 January 2008"," One must be as OBJECTIVE as possible
","I've read a lot of reviews on this movie, most of which highly praise it with a few others highly criticizing it, albeit with valid points. In this review I will try to be as objective as possible.<br/><br/>The general feedback by the non-praisers was that the film is 'over the top'. Come to think of it....yes the movie is over the top in some of its parts. There are various actions done by characters in the movie which are clearly unrealistic or exaggerated, especially throughout the last 30 minutes. Also, by characters i do not simply refer to the 4 main ones.<br/><br/>On the other hand I have to be true to myself and realize that I (like many others apparently) didn't notice these flaws on the first viewing. And why is it that these highly apparent flaws have gone unnoticed? My explanation is that this movie is not primarily focused on reality and facts, but rather on drug sensations. As a person who never took drugs, I still felt nauseated, confused, psychologically afraid, and with no sense of time throughout the whole movie. Everything from the music, editing, lighting, camera angles, acting and continuity, made this movie a drug in itself. Its a movie which should not be compared to Trainspotting or Blow which emphasize completely different points. Being so 'high' with just watching the movie, it was very difficult for me to notice such clear flaws.<br/><br/>Is this necessarily a bad thing? Well it depends on how the director wanted us to feel, and also on the viewer. If Arnofsky wanted this movie to be like a drug experience felt in his viewers, then I have to give this movie an 11/10, with 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' a close second. If on the other hand, his aim was to be realistic, depict drug usage circumstances and facts about drug culture, then this movie delves very little in these areas and might not appeal to you.<br/><br/>Others criticized the movie for having too much of a simplistic message (Don't do drugs cos they're bad for you. Look, this is what'll happen to you if you become a dealer/junky). But then again, when is it that film making has become primarily storytelling as opposed to creating a mood? It may be true however that this movie might be offensive to drug users or others who know about or are involved in the business, possibly due to some images shown and the circumstances of the characters, possibly being stereotypical and somewhat cliché. It may be the case that Arnofsky used over dramatization/unrealistic circumstances to enhance the mood, (some may argue that this dramatization was not needed) and if so, he has managed well. (Remember Kill Bill Vol 1? Exaggerated graphic violence to create the anime mood?) Finally on a personal, subjective note: I loved the movie because of the way it is packaged. I especially loved the acting, the way the director used the shots, the fast editing and sound effects, lighting, and the music! I think this was a package to create and compliment the mood and feeling the movie is trying to create...and hey...it worked for me at least!"

","Requiem For A Dream is an overall intense portrayal of the life of several winning characters who despite their ambitions for something greater are quickly overwhelmed by their unfortunate drug addictions. The scene is New York City, New York around the late 1990's. Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) and his best friend Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) are heroin addicts. Over dinner at a hot dog stand one night they decide that it is time to get their lives on track and make a little money. Their proposal: to score a pound of pure uncut heroin and then proceed to sell it to people for profit. Things are going great for Harry and Tyrone as well as Harry's girlfriend Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly). They are seemingly overcoming their daily troubles. Generously Harry proposes to Marion the idea of opening up their own shop where Marion can design, make, and sell her clothing ideas. Everything seems to be on track at this point, so Harry goes to visit his mother Sarah Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn). He apologizes to his mother for past shortcomings and tries to explain to his mother how he is going to make it up to her when he realizes that she is on diet pills (Amphetamines). His mother then explains the need for these diet pills (She had received a random phone call one day telling her that she was to appear on television, and she was determined to fit into the red dress that she had worn to Harry's high school graduation). Harry, in love for his mother, strongly discourages her continued use of these pills and finally tells her that he has purchased her a new television. Everything is going well for Harry until Tyrone witnesses a brutal murder involving the selling of heroin. Their Cash supply gradually becomes smaller until essentially there is nothing left. Blinded by their addictions they continue telling themselves that things will get better. Unfortunately things only get worse for all of them. As their addictions spiral out of control, Tyrone is put in jail suffering the withdrawals from his normal usage. Harry's arm becomes thoroughly affected with gangrene ultimately resulting in removal. Marion is in a position to where she can choose the love of her life or she can choose heroin (she sells herself off for the latter of the two). All the while, Sarah, driven by the hope of becoming more than a lonely housewife, gradually loses her mind to the amphetamines that she is on. The Overall delivery of this film was quite amazing. With a winning soundtrack provided by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet and the miraculous cinematography that Darren Aronofsky uses this film easily rates a 9.5/10."

From the very start, Aronofsky forces you to question reality, and only deepens it from there. The characters, seemingly neurotic by not insane, follow paths that could easily take them straight into Hell but you give them the faith  for awhile  that they're not that stupid and they'll find their way through, especially with one another's awkward but well-intentioned help. The camera, sound design, and scoring (Kronos Quartet  excellent) are complex and shattering, eerie, violent, distorted, and completely supportive of the increasing problems. Acting, especially by Burstyn, is fantastic. She has the toughest role, but as the story goes along, you see that more and more is asked of each actor. Connelly, Leto, Wayans... they all begin to fill their destinies, and they bring a lot to the roles.

It takes you so far into the emotions and stressful lives of addicts that by the end of the movie, and even the next day or the next week for some, you are so thankful you are not in their position. Also the contrast between the addictions of someone who's chosen the path(Jared Leto and friends) and someone who was led blindly into the trap is what, for me, makes it so amazing. I've seen other movies based on addictions, and I'm sure you have too, but none that show the helpless side of someone being blindly led down that path. Ellen Burstyn's character is so deep and crafted so well by the writers and the actress herself that you really feel for her. I'm not one to say drugs are bad and what not, but its true, some of our society paints them to be something there not. But this movie shows what can happen to anybody.

","Some movies are made to make money, some are made to entertain and some are made in art form with messages .Requiem For a Dream is a well made art form movie directed by Darren Aronofsky .Although it is a very powerful film with the depressive story line and great finale.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is about the four people who lose control of their lives in a short time period, divided by summer, fall and winter. This is a movie about addictions and dreams .Whether addiction to drugs, to television, to sex or chocolate all represent the same weakness of the human being .And their dreams which are destroyed by addiction.<br/><br/>First we are introduced by summer. Summer is peaceful and joyful than the other two sections. Everything seems good for the characters .Three friends who addicted to heroin, hope that one day they can live the American dream. Harry and Tyrone in to the drug dealing to make it big and Marion, Harry's girl friend, wants to open her store. Sara Goldfarb, Harry's, mother is a television junkie and her obsession is fitting the red dress for television show, she starts a diet program and hopes lose some weights.<br/><br/>We can not see the warm ambiance of the summer in the fall section. In fall, ambiance is getting colder and disturbing scenes create very discomfort feelings before the winter. Because of their individual addictions, everything gets worse and worse in the winter. In last part, effective and aggressive scenes are not easy to watch. <br/><br/>Sound effect and score of the movie is primary key for the story line. Film opens with the scene of commercial television show and we hear the sound of the audience, but in same time we also hear the dark and disturbing music from the background which gives a depression of the movie in the beginning. This and the other depressive sounds, in a pessimistic way, keep the audience's attention until the closing credits. Score of the Requiem for a Dream is also getting darker in every season.<br/><br/>Darren Aronfsky uses so many effects to make the movie more emotional. Drug using and sex scenes are very intense. Cash registers tallying in drug dealing scenes show director's great vision.<br/><br/>Acting is almost great in the movie. Ellen Burstyn is magnificent as a Sara Goldfarb, Jennifer Connolly and Jared Leto are great and Marlon Wayens is also totally different than his other roles and he completely fits his character.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is obviously dark and very depressive movie in a lot of way. In many level, it is very discomfort film to watch. However, Darren Aronfsky manages to give us sad and confuse feeling every scene of the movie. I believe that, story, effects, acting, score and director's vision make the Requiem for a Dream one of the most impressive and effective movie ever made"

It is incredibly good, a stunning achievement, and only a slight feeling of over-the-top-ness stops me from giving it a 10/10. However, it is incredibly sad. I feel shocked, and my stomach is churning. I didn't really want to know all this. I think I may never watch it again.<br/><br/>However, I would recommend to everyone to watch it at least once. It really deserves it."

","Requiem for a Dream covers the subject of addiction as poetry. It will spark so many conversations and forces the viewer to conceptualize this life. The scenes are not necessarily stuffed with words and conversation. There is very little conversation in the movie. Instead, the watcher is struck with the sounds of the movie. The quiet of the music burst through with a TV infomercial. Being completely harangued by voices and sounds and bells and cheering, suddenly stopped. The filmography is also to be admired. In montage productions, and side by side screen shots, the views and angles are handled with so much art it takes my breath away. Most importantly for me, is the accurate portrayal of addiction, the lack of choice, the slow and innocent plunge. The disease is represented well and without fluff. It is hard, it is true. The actors in this movie play roles I believe many wouldn't and they make you understand the hows and whys, they also let you keep a little distant. Requiem for a Dream is a must see, for all age groups, especially teens and people over 50, we just need to know."

","Talk about one of the most relentless films I have ever seen. There are few films I will almost turn off because they are brutally relentless, but not in anyway form or shape a terrible film. This takes the cake.<br/><br/>The film focuses on a family of two. A mother living with seeming no purpose at home, and a drug addicted son. Ellen Burstyn plays the mother, Sara Goldfarb, who is addicted to a TV Show which seems to be about losing weight. Her dream is to be a contestant on the show and when she receives a call that she is to appear on the show she becomes obsessed with being able to lose enough weight in order to fit into a red dress which she envisions wearing on the show. At first she tries a diet which becomes too painful. Then she here's about an easy way, pills. She goes to the doctor, who is tell-tale disinterested, and begins to lose weight as well as her mind.<br/><br/>Meanwhile her son, played by Jared Leto, Harry Goldfarb, is becoming more and more sucked into an impossible to break addiction to drugs. Along with him in his addiction is his friend Tyrone C. Love, played by Marlon Wayans, and his girlfriend, the ever beautiful Jennifer Connelly. Their story parallels everyone else's as they are headed in one direction with no hope of breaking their path or even slowing.<br/><br/>The film is painful, expertly told and no holds bar. Darren Aronofsky, the director, tells this powerful and depressing story with an intimacy that is disturbing. Did I enjoy this film? Not at all, but that doesn't diminish the power of this film. I am completely torn. I can't find flaws in the film itself other than my reaction viewing it. A part of me wants to mark this film as terrible and another part a masterpiece. My grade reflects this."
"alexapowell","10","1","2","22 January 2007"," A lesson...
","I first saw the other comments on this movie, and wanted to see it. I can't explain why. I'm the kind of person that doesn't just watch movies for entertainment, I enjoy a lot of movies that make you really think. The storyline isn't difficult to understand... Harry, his mother Sara, his best friend, Tyrone, and his girlfriend Marion, are the main characters, and during each scene we observe how the effects of drug use (both ""prescribed medical"" and illegal) cause their lives to change in ways they would never have foreseen.<br/><br/>Harry is a regular drug user, along with Marion and Tyrone. While the boys crave a life without struggling to find money for their next fix, Marion (while also being of the same frame of mind) is also a designer and wants to open a fashion store, if only she had the money. In contrast Harry's mother, Sara, lives alone, where the television is her best friend. After a phone call inviting her on her favourite show, she is obsessed with fitting into her ""red dress"" that she wore to Harry's graduation so that she can wear it when she's called to be a contestant on the show. You can sense her despair when she takes it out of her closet after years without use and trying to put it on, when she finds that she just can't zip it up. After trying a very boring diet that her friend suggests, she goes to a doctor about diet pills, which, after several months, she becomes addicted to, with effects that I can only describe as being... intense.<br/><br/>When I first sat down to watch this movie, I somehow assumed that all the characters would be young, naive, carefree.... No doubt, the things that Marion did in attempts to get cash to feed her addiction are horrific... but to see the effect that it had on Sara really makes you think about how dramatic people's actions can be when they crave something enough, despite their age group.<br/><br/>I was in tears at some of the things I saw. While some might sit there and think ""ugh, this is degrading and far-fetched"", I feel the need to say they're wrong, and that it happens more than you would care to imagine. The end titles took me slightly by surprise, and then silence. I can't explain to you how I was feeling, no words can describe it. I see now that anyone who sees this as ""entertainment"" are cold-hearted. All I can say, is that it's a lesson, and it'll probably mean something different to everyone that is taught by it.<br/><br/>It's worth it to watch it once, definitely, maybe even twice. But I couldn't watch it again."
"shattenjager777","5","1","2","13 January 2007"," Not as bad or as good as most seem to think
","I feel I must begin with a bit of a disclaimer about the supposed ""graphic"" nature of the film--it isn't bad at all. There are two sex scenes that are perhaps a bit more graphic than usual and (probably the reason for the NC-17 rating) there is one scene in which pubic hair is visible, but there is little else, so don't let that NC-17 rating scare you. Also, the sex scenes add nothing to the film's thematic or narrative content, so skipping them wouldn't actually hurt anything. Incidentally, that's one way in which the film is not as ""bad"" as most seem to think.<br/><br/>Certainly the stars of this film are really Darren Aronofsky (director/co-screewnriter) and Jay Rabinowitz (editor). The film is meant to be somehow ""deep"" through its ""unusual"" editing and directorial touches; however, it is essentially a recycling of many ideas from others (most notably Stanley Kubrick, Adrian Lyne, and Satoshi Kon) and even its choices that are--and this is the best word I can come up with for them--cutesy and fun become boring by the end of the film. For example, the repetition of the series of quick jump cuts to symbolize a few particular acts becomes bordering on annoying by the time the viewer sees it for about the 20th time during the film and the variation of the speed of the surroundings around a drug-addled individual, a technique already used to its best results in Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange,"" becomes repeatedly less interesting with each of the 700 or so uses of it here. Most of these techniques suit the film's subject, but some have seemingly no function and many of them have long since outstayed their welcomes by the time the film ends.<br/><br/>However, the real problem with the film is its subject. It is, as anyone planning to see it knows, a film ostensibly about drugs and their pervasive nature in our society. However, the film ends up coming off more as one about proving Jennifer Connelly's abilities as an actor and wrapping some goofy cinematography around what could be a truly heart-wrenching story starring Ellen Burstyn. Besides the lack of any interesting thematic content, the film obviously attempts to make each character's ""fall from grace"" heartbreaking, but does so horribly, the only exception being Burstyn, who forces it to work with a true powerhouse performance. The real injustice is Connelly's character arc (or lack thereof). It's obvious that the film is supposed to be introducing us to the newly ""grown up"" Connelly as a talented actress instead of just a pretty teenager, and yet she is given no material through which to show any ability and instead comes across as just the only person in the film who really gets what she wants in the end.<br/><br/>Still, the film is not a complete failure because of two things: Ellen Burstyn and Clint Mansell. Burstyn's performance is truly a sight to behold, as she manages to put the heart into her character that Aronofsky's direction tries so hard to remove, making me wonder how good a film it could have been with a decent director and ONLY her storyline. Meanwhile, Clint Mansell's score is absolutely wonderful--in fact it tells the story of the film much better than the film does. It mixes more traditional film music with more romantic composition styles (such as in the opening scene when the opening of Beethoven's 9th Symphony should easily jump to mind) and even rock influences into a cohesive whole that sounds like a particularly strong James Newton Howard work.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Requiem for a Dream"" isn't anywhere near as interesting, innovative, or thoughtful as its fans would have us think, but it's still not a bad film. Ellen Burstyn's performance and Clint Mansell's score are wonderful and make up for a lot of the problems with Darren Aronofsky's direction, making it at least worth a watch. But don't expect it to blow you away."

","I watched this heart-breaking movie twice in a space of few years. Its reality is so present and so powerful that squashes my heart so tight. In a world that claims to be so advanced and civilised, in the era of space stations and quantum mechanics, human being is still so desperate to find happiness and so unaware of how to get it.<br/><br/>All that Sara, Harry, Marion and others in this movie wanted was love and happiness. They all wanted to be loved, and they all cared for each other, but unfortunately they chose the wrong way to get to what they desired.<br/><br/>I was emotionally down for hours after watching this movie. It really shook my heart.<br/><br/>I specially appreciated the camera angles and concave lenses that created meaning to explain the status of the mind. For example when Sara saw the doctors surgery with a fish eye view or when Marion had such a big head that seemed very heavy with guilt after selling her body for drug money.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I have seen this scenario happening in real life to someone I dearly loved. That's why I have to claim that ""Requim for a Dream"" is real. It is no Hollywood glamour and shine. Watch it if you have the heart."
"John_Q_Citizen","Null","1","2","11 January 2007"," A Hard-Hitting Subjective Film that Shows Us the Horrors of Drug Abuse
","Darren Aronofsky's second and most powerful film, 'Requiem For a Dream', deals with a group of three friends and a sweet old lady who get hooked onto drugs and begin to abuse them, leading to horrendous consequences.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn plays Sara Goldfarb, a plump and friendly gal showing her old age and overweight-ness. She is a television-and-choco-holic, who takes to watching a continuous infomercial about improving your life. Her son, Harry--played by Jared Leto--is a junkie of sorts, who resorts to stealing her television every week or so. He hauls it on down to the pawnbroker (in one of the most beautiful title sequences I've seen) with the help of his friend, Tyrone C. Love. They get their cash, they get their pot.<br/><br/>However, these two men are humans. Both have a love interest. Marion Silver, played by Jennefer Connelly, is Harry's girlfriend. They love each other in a very real and heartbreaking way. Tyrone has his woman as well, although we don't get to know her very well through the course of the movie.<br/><br/>But things begin to spiral out of control. Sara is tricked by a telemarketer into thinking that she could appear on the Tappy Tibbons show that she watches so much. She obsesses about adorning her red dress--but it won't zip up all the way. So she seeks a doctor about some weight pills. Thus begins Sara's disintegration.<br/><br/>Marion and Harry, on the other hand, are dreaming about opening a clothing store. Harry sees that if he gets money from the drugs he has, they could scrounge up enough to open their business together, along with the help of Tyrone. But they get hooked on the pot--and here begins their story.<br/><br/>All of this comes crashing down in one of the most gut-wrenching climaxes in movie history.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's use of subjective imagery, camera speed techniques, and fast cutting gets us deep into the heads of our characters. Characters that, in fact, we are with all the way through. His images portray an accurate and miserable world of drug addiction, sexuality, and desperation. Mattew Libatique uses hue change and color filters to give us different feelings throughout the three different seasons (or acts) of the movie.<br/><br/>The performances by the actors are absolutely flabbergasting. Ellen Burstyn's Acadamy Award loss was, perhaps, a crime. Her performance was so powerful and radiated sympathy for her character, the sweet and lovable Mrs. Goldfarb. It is truly frightening to see what she is reduced to by the end of the film. Jared Leto and Jennefer Connely give all-star performances as well. They are truly in love during this movie. They convey such realism. You identify with them from the start. Marlon Wayans also acts very well in here, too--proving that he can do more than stupid comedies. His dramatic acting is astounding to see, especially if you watch 'Little Man' right before this.<br/><br/>An honorable mention goes to Mr. Clint Mansell, the composer, as well as the Kronos Quartet, for delivering one hell of an emotional score. It is currently a very popular soundtrack, and rightfully so.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a hard-hitting and on-the-nose kind of film that only comes along once in a while. Kudos to the actors, the director, and to Mr. Hubert Selby Jr. for writing this beautifully sad story."

","This movie is an amazing movie. It is one of the most daring movies I have seen, aside from Broke Back Mountain. I'll start by saying that this movie is not for everyone. This movie is beautiful in its harsh brutality and realness. Most people who go to watch movies expect predictable plots and happy endings all of which are nice, but not in conformity with reality. Ellen Burstyn is phenomenal. The speech she gave to her son Harry about how lowliness was killing her was touching and hard to hear. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans surprised with the brilliance of their acting. Jennifer Connelly was equally great. The ending of this movie is one of the most brutal and sad endings I have seen and it helps to appreciate life that much more. Man can make himself great, but this movie shows you how he can be as destructive as the devil to himself. As I have said before, this movie is not a popular movie, not meant for simple people. It is a movie for intelligent people, spiritual people, philosophical people. In order to really appreciate your life, you must see how much other people have it worse than you. This movie will help you see that. I recommend this movie to any person who likes to meditate on his/her life, to any dreamer, to any intelligent being who will movies like The Transporter to those who cannot admire true beauty."
"brahmabull_07","10","1","2","8 January 2007"," A harrowing but essential movie
","After watching this movie I felt sick in the stomach. 'Requiem for a Dream' is a story of four people, whose lives are dominated by substance addiction. The film offers no hope or optimism for a society where drugs are a sad but prevalent fact of life. It serves as a reminder of the lengths of depravity and indignity the afflicted are willing to sink to, for no apparent reason other than to feed their dangerous addictions and to get their 'fix'. Anorofksy's real contribution to the film is the way in which he captures the protagonists' descent into madness. The final frenetic montage which closes the film remains to be one of the most powerful and moving set of images I have ever seen on a screen. It captures the horrific sense of indignity and desolation that has irrevocably destroyed the lives of the characters involved.<br/><br/>I usually take movies for what they are: leisurely entertainment. However this movie had such an affect on me that I honestly felt like reaching out and violently shaking the four characters involved. I too was gripped by a feeling of helplessness, desperately wanting to see some sort of rehabilitation or renewal take place for the poor souls in this movie. This movie, while not for everybody will kick you in the guts. It is an experience which will leave you angry, shaken and saddened, while also spectacularly impressed."

"drownnnsoda","10","1","2","29 December 2006"," Disturbing, Haunting, Realistic - Amazing.
","""Requiem For A Dream"" is honestly one of the most brutal, hard-hitting movies I've ever seen. It's a different kind of movie experience, and you won't finish watching it and think, ""Wow, that was great"". You'll think ""My God, that was devastating"", and that's the real power in the film. The movie focuses on four people living in New York City - Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), his television-obsessed mother, Sara (Ellen Burstyn), and his best friend, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). As each of them try and find solitude in their lives through drugs (everything from heroin, cocaine, to dieting pills), the hopes and dreams they once had began to become distorted as they focus all of their attention on feeding their addictions.<br/><br/>Disturbing is the main term that could be used to describe this movie, because that's exactly what it is. Watching these people go through such hell is an awful thing, but it does send a clear message, displaying the possibilities of what can happen if you seek pleasure from an addicting substance. But this is no typical drug-addiction film, it's much, much different. Don't expect your typical ""teenagers addicted to drugs"" fare. This movie is much better (and realistic). Aronofsky's work is extremely stylish - he uses plenty of quick, flashy imagery and tends to use speedy camera tricks that alter the audience even, as if we're experiencing what the characters are. And he's successful at it. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr. (and also written by him), the screenplay is amazing. The characters and the dialog are all realistic, and the entire thing is just one bizarre experience.<br/><br/>The acting in the film couldn't be any better. Ellen Burstyn is mainly the lead and a lot of attention is focused on her, and she is absolutely brilliant, playing the widowed mother who is desperate for attention, and wants to wear her red dress on television. Only problem is, she needs to lose some weight, so she becomes addicted to dieting pills. She's an excellent actress and is believable as can be, her performance really shined. But the other cast members also shined. Jared Leto is the secondary lead, playing Burstyn's son, and is also great, playing a very complicated character. Jennifer Connelly plays his girlfriend, and she was also amazing - the audience can more easily be in touch with her emotions and you can feel a strong connection to her character, because she kind of becomes caught up in the middle of the drug-hustling that's being done by her boyfriend, and finds herself an addict soon after. And Marlon Wayans, who I'd only seen playing a goofy stoner in the comedy horror-spoof, ""Scary Movie"", was excellent in his role too, giving a surprisingly good performance as Leto's best friend/co-drug dealer.<br/><br/>""Requiem For A Dream"" is a horrific film experience. The way the film ends will haunt you for days, and you won't forget it. It's not a movie that you can sit down and watch repeatedly, because if you did you'd feel horrible. It's an emotionally draining movie, and that's partially why it's so amazing. This film doesn't just focus solely on drugs, but it focuses strongly on how these substances affect the lives of different people, and the tragic results of their decisions. You won't want to miss this movie, but don't expect to feel good when you watch it. A must see. 10/10."

The movie deserved that much, is all, from the writers to the director to the actors whose skill made it so terribly real.<br/><br/>I've since thought that the worst thing about this movie is its rating. Teenagers shouldn't be banned from seeing this film ... this terrifying depiction of the possible consequences of drug addiction should be *required* viewing in every secondary school in the land, and it'd have far more of an impact than any DARE program or ""Just Say No"" ever could.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that won't happen, because far be it that our children should watch a film that has (gasp!) deviant lesbian sex in it, however much it's the least erotic non-rape sex scene in cinematic history -- and is also likely a reason that this film didn't attract Oscars. (I've long since thought that Jennifer Connelly got her Academy Award in A Beautiful Mind for being little more than eye candy because the Academy didn't dare to give her one for her incredible performance here.)<br/><br/>I couldn't honestly tell you whether this was a ""great"" movie or not, but it is a *necessary* movie.<br/><br/>9/10."

The unemployed son is involved in drug trafficking as a means of support and when he feels he needs a lift a quick jab with a needle seems to do the trick.<br/><br/>We watch the slow degeneration of the two characters as their addictions take hold. In a schizophrenic frenzy mother starts imagining she is on stage at the television station with the audience wildly enthusiastic about her presence in her lovely red dress and the son is developing an infection on his left arm at the site of the multiple injections.<br/><br/>Mother and son love and care for each other in their unhealthy states, the son advising his mother that the pills she is taking are dangerous and addictive and that she should give them up. Mother believes the doctor knows best so she doubles up on her doses. Her mind then becomes very troubled indeed. The refrigerator (with the food in it) starts jumping towards her. Or so she believes. It's a frightening experience for her Parts of this film are not for the squeamish. Injections are bad enough but when the needle goes into the son's suppurating ulcer it's a disgusting sight and the electric shock treatment on mother's brain is terrible to watch. The two characters are obviously fading fast and are on a road which leads straight to hell.<br/><br/>The photographic effects of mother's delirium as she imagines events from her past life and as a TV watcher projects herself into the limelight of notoriety are extremely well done. Also, when the son is at a low ebb and injects himself, we almost feel the sense of relief that he is feeling as we watch the fleeting images on the screen.<br/><br/>The two main characters mentioned above hold the viewer throughout the film. The other characters also well played illustrate how so many others suffer in their association with their drug-addicted friends. There is a sense of hopelessness in the whole film despite the efforts of over-worked medical staff.

"madricci","10","1","2","23 December 2006"," The value of life, packed in suffering and pain
","I haven't read the somewhat 1400 comments on this movie,but I'm pretty sure that many of them tell the same. This is the only movie I've ever seen that I don't ever want to watch again, for no money in the world. But it's also one of the greatest I've ever seen.How do these things go with each other? Well, I'm a very empathic person with experience in acting, and no movie ever before could touch me so deeply and make me burst into tears. Why? It is so unbelievably cruel, honest,dark, hopeless and yet so revealing concerning the precious gift of life and the things that make it worth living. When I watched it about half a year ago, I had no idea what it would be like, I thought, well, maybe a pretty good movie about drugs, I also hadn't read the novel which I did now, it's almost as disturbing as the movie.Anyway, after about 45 minutes I had to fight to stay in front of the TV because I felt and experienced everything the characters did and I thought I couldn't stand it any longer, I thought I'd go insane. Especially the fast cut-scenes in the end and the unbelievably disturbing sound were almost more than I could sustain. I have some experience concerning drugs, and some shown feelings and situations were not new to me, but so was the brutality and honesty they were shown with, free from all disguises and useless package. When it was over I couldn't stand being alone and went to a friend, who used to live in the same house. When he opened the door he immediately asked what was going on with me, because I was so pale. I told him I'd seen the movie and he just smiled and said: ""Oh, alright, I understand, with me it was the same."" And then we talked about it, for more than five hours, and after a certain time I realized we weren't talking about the movie anymore but about life in general, about our hopes, dreams for the future and so on. At that point I understood the movie's value and also its beauty. It leaves you, as Frodo says in The Lord of the Rings, naked in the dark, and it's up to you to figure out whatever can help you get into the light, which means, what can make your life rich and fraught with love. And it shows that, no matter what hell we are going through, we need love to survive and we have to fight for it 'til our very last breath, like Harry Goldfarb does in the movie. If I ever gave a 10 here on IMDb for a movie without thinking, I do it for this one. Parents, if you want to prevent your kids from taking drugs, show them this movie and talk about it afterwards, believe me, they won't ever even touch a joint! After I've read some comments now that say those who like this movie don't live in reality, I have to update mine. I can give you guys only one answer: Sorry, but it's you, this movie is reality! I had a lot of friends who died from drugs and I saw them during their last time alive, two of them committed suicide. I know what they were going through and how they felt. And you want to tell me this is unreal and they just got what they deserved? You make me sick! Don't talk about anything you've no idea about just because you're afraid!"

","I'm not sure I've ever read the phrase ""downward spiral"" more times than I have in these reviews, so I will do what I can not to use it. Having said that, Requiem is probably the one of, if not the most, impactive films I have ever seen. Its style and its content are both top notch.<br/><br/>A Warning: I watched this film for the first time in broad daylight with a group of friends in college. The mood (among those who viewed the film) was upbeat at the beginning. Having heard a lot about the film before we watched it, we all thought we were prepared for what we were about to experience. I will only say that after the credits rolled (and I sat in silence with 8 or 10 of my friends for probably 5 minutes) I promptly stood up and walked out the door without a word and went home.<br/><br/>Part of the reason I was personally affected by the film was that I had a very strong empathy where Ms. Burstyn's character was concerned. She reminded me intensely of my own mother. Watching her transformation was incredibly difficult. It is usually assumed that drugs were the cause of each of the 4 characters' downfalls. Contrary to this opinion, I found that Mrs. Goldfarb's particular descent was caused instead by loneliness. Her son's willful neglect for her (epitomized in the scene that finds him crying in a cab after his visit) brought the elder Goldfarb to a state of mind in which the adoring attention of a television audience was her ultimate goal. She needed approval from somewhere.<br/><br/>The darkness that slowly envelopes each character creeps into the viewers subconscious throughout the film. The knowledge that things are turning bad slips slowly into the film until, finally, it's too late. Rarely has a film ever brought this bleakness so clearly into focus for me. I was ashamed of myself, as ridiculous as that sounds.<br/><br/>The most powerful scene of the film was, for me, the last encounter with Jennifer Connelly's character. Curled up on her couch with the spoils of the previous night's 'efforts', she smiles like a child being held by her mother. I wanted to be repulsed, instead I was sympathetic.<br/><br/>Although you will find people who have seen this movie and do not really 'feel' it the way I did, it's been my experience that most are truly moved (but usually not in a positive way). You WILL feel empty. You WILL fell dejected, but most of all you will be glad you watched it."

Over time, their choices take impact and they find themselves doing things they would have never even considered earlier on. The statement of power within addiction becomes clear as day. Looking from the outside in, Requiem For A Dream takes you to an unclear reality of false love and hope. I would recommend this movie for ANYONE."

When they get addicted they also get desperate as its usually the case... and thats all!<br/><br/>So i don't know why this movie in on top 250. Maybe drugs taking is so popular? Maybe people that have never taken a drug before want to see how its like? For me is was just boring. For me it could be about four slim people eating chips until they get fat.<br/><br/>Acting and Directing was great, especially Ellen Burstyn.

","I don't know too much about film. I have seen many, but haven't studied them in detail or produced any myself. Perhaps a typical viewer? For me this movie is my personal favourite. If I had to choose regardless of genre, this is the one. No other movie has shaken me so much in such a way. It is the one film where I can't find any flaws. The story is perfect, it is told filmatically with excellence, the music is among the best film music I have heard, and the actors impress me massively. Each part wouldn't necessarily win an Oscar (though I believe they would have deserved it), but they all work seamlessly together, creating av overall perfectly told story that everyone should experience."

However, the effect this film has on you is simply mindblowing.. a film hasn't had an effect on me like this since I watched the Japanese version of The Ring (which ranks highly as one of the most mentally disturbing film I've ever seen).<br/><br/>The acting, sense of togetherness you feel to the main character and the sheer shock at the film's climax are something you simply have to experience. I'm essentially re-iterating all that has been said in previous reviews of this film but after watching this film I felt I had to comment on it's brilliance.<br/><br/>It takes a certain person to watch this film and if you've never known addition of any sort, this will probably be horrendous viewing to you.

The movie is beautifully shot in a bizarre but unique manner. The characters are very human in their reactions and remain unpredictable and, in some cases, repulsive.

","One of the best recent movies I have seen: its pacing and style completely blends in with the whole story. What has been achieved is that we get to feel like the characters in the film. We go from a fairly ideal time where drugs enhance feelings (called Summer) to a downfall (Fall) and complete misery (Winter) when everybody becomes dependent on drugs to produce certain good feelings and escape reality. Harry (Jared Leto) ends up in North Carolina with an arm amputated due to an infection from frequent heroin intake. His friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) ends up in a colony where he forced to work in jail. His girlfriend Marion (Jeniffer Connolly) ends up prostituting herself to get some drugs and his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) ends up in a psychiatric hospital fed forcibly to treat her drug-induced anorexia (as she wanted to lose weight). The main theme is exemplified by the scene of Harry running to Marion on the pier but not attaining her and in the process falling. In a sense it shows how concentrating on your dream and going to it can cause you to fall if you are ready to do anything to attain it."

","Truly out of every film I have ever seen this has to be among the top. It earns its place in my most revered films not because of a stunning storyline, or special effects but because of its depressingly life like representation of addiction and the filming and musical score accompanying it.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the lives of two drug abusers, Harry and Tyrone, Harry's mother and his girlfriend. It follows through their moving journey, one in which addiction and debauchery are common themes. The acting is superb from all four central characters, it is truly believable to the audience and at times the viewers can find themselves awe stricken by the realism of it all.<br/><br/>The camera crew are geniuses and this in no small way contributes to the film as a whole. During the frequent grittier settings the camera is placed in ways that perfectly accentuates the scene. The sets, although mainly unchanging throughout, are created maintained in such a way that the audience is truly led to empathise with the characters and the slum like locations in which they dwell.<br/><br/>The musical score too is on the brink of perfection with truly stunning music that accompanies each moving scene beautifully. The main theme, that is used fairly frequently throughout, is a haunting piece that truly feels to the audience like it reflects the personae with the film.<br/><br/>In short it is a one of a kind film that quite simply cannot be missed. However it is not for the weak of heart and it is definitely no fairy tale. This is a stroke of genius upon the otherwise mediocre movie map that will quite simply shock you to the core."

","It shows you normal life and how your dreams of fame won't happen to a lot of people. How people on it are supposedly gods and you can't taste that. In addition to that it shows how the addiction sits in and never truly lets go. If you really watch it there is addictions to other things that you may not catch until the second time you watch the movie. But the message is the same.You watch the rise and eventual fall of each main characters in the movie. You see when or during they're hooked and watch as they crumble under the weight of they're own addiction. And the acting is some of the best ever seen. This movie will truly blow you away. It's not something that will leave you saying,""Good movie what else is on."" You will stay in the same blown-away mood until the next morning. I recommend this movie to be watched in schools without talking and to only watch the movie. Instead of Gary the drug free Elephant during pep rallies. Then they'll understand how bad drugs are.

"dragon-90","9","1","2","27 May 2006"," A Reason To Get Up In The Morning
","Incredibly powerful and sobering, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is one of strongest anti-drug movies ever made. The lives of four people, a mother and her only son, a beautiful artistic young woman, and a charming young man, are destroyed by addiction in a parable of illicit and licit drug use. This extraordinary film by young director (and co-writer) Darren Aronofsky shows how Americans crush their positive energies with chemical crutches be they heroin or little blue pills prescribed by a doctor.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn won an Academy Award (2000) for her performance of sad Sara Goldfarb who sinks deeper into delusion about being on her favorite infomercial TV program as she gets hooked on prescribed medications. Her son Harry (Jared Leto), his buddy Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) hope to get rich off just one more score but get hooked and watch helplessly as their lives disintegrate.<br/><br/>The direction is slick and arty with interesting visual effects that create a fast and furious pace that mirrors the drug rushes that sequence the film. In little over an hour and a half we witness a complete meltdown. The acting is superb from start to finish and even supporting roles such as Louise Lasser's Ada, Sara's long-suffering friend, add depth and dimension to this tragic tale. A must see but not for the faint-hearted and don't expect a typical Hollywood happy ending."
"tangsoojanitor","10","1","2","26 May 2006"," Actually an incredibly grim urban fable
","I have read a lot of reviews for Requiem For A Dream which complain and grouse about its being ""unrealistic"" and ""only showing the worst case scenario."" These people are failing to realize: that is exactly what Aronofsky set out to do.<br/><br/>This is not supposed to be a realistic everyday film (though some of the horrific events therein certainly do happen). The surreal, stylized filming, the bright colors, the fancy camera work, the almost musical-like atmosphere surrounding the whole thing should tip everyone off that this isn't a documentary. Nor is it simply an exploitation fest, hungry for shock-value and nothing more. What this is is a dark, grim fable. It DELIBERATELY seeks out the worst-case scenario, showing everyone just how far drugs can go. The message is, okay maybe this doesn't happen to everyone who does drugs. But KNOWING this can happen, knowing that it is a possibility, why risk it? <br/><br/>Also, everyone who commented that the storyline about the bad doctor giving the old lady speed couldn't happen, you're all fooling yourselves. Many members of my family work in law, many specializing in medical malpractice, and you would not believe when you get into cities like that how many quacks are out there just looking to make a buck. They make their living on the fact that doctors are supposed to examine you thoroughly before dishing out the drugs. Their business IS all the unstable people like poor Sarah Goldfarb who wouldn't pass the mainstream examinations by ""good"" doctors. They're exactly like the underground plastic surgeons or the administrators of illegal back alley abortions. They're out there, and there are a lot of them. Basically, they are upscale drug-dealers, probably why Aronofsky included one in his film. A subtle contrast. Harry is grungier dealer, but in theory he is exactly like the doctor who destroys his own mother. Different walks of life, same evil. There's an essay topic for an independent film student..."
"tammyd24","10","1","2","20 May 2006"," Wow
","This movie was recommended to me by my sister who described it as a rape of the senses. Being a survivor of Rx medication addiction, she thought I would find meaning in this movie. And she was absolutely correct. The thought of taking the same road as any of the characters makes me shiver. The acting is outstanding and definitely warranted an Oscar nomination for Ellen Burstyn.<br/><br/>I was totally blown away at the accuracy of this movie and the realism it presented. For anyone thinking of walking down that path of addiction, in whatever form it may take, please see this movie and then decide if that is how you want to live your life.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of this film is haunting and moving at the same time. Every note is so precise to match the mood of the scene you are viewing, that when you hear it outside of the movie, it brings you right back to the image. Definitely a soundtrack to own.<br/><br/>I really think that this should be on the viewing for high school students as a tough life lesson without the physical. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone."

One friend told me that he was unable to eat for a day after seeing the movie, another said the movie made him seriously depressed. I did not believe that a movie could have such power, but after seeing it, I feel similarly shaken. I would not recommend this movie to the faint of heart, or as a means of ""entertainment"". The movie deals with four addictive personalities and explores the mind of the addict, focusing on their feelings of frustration, terror, and strong conflicting emotions about their addictions. the four main characters start their lives from relative peace and security and plunge into an unfathomable well of loss and unimaginable horror.

"screwcalories","8","1","2","21 March 2006"," rollercoasting *(caution: spoiler)*
","No doubt at all that Requiem has a beautiful style; its raw, energetic, and acidic. You watch it thinking these characters need your guidance. I sat wanting to interfere with them, shake them out of the delirium they had fallen into; you really end up caring about them. They generate so much venerability its so painful to see their ultimate demise.<br/><br/>The element that stood out the most for me was the drug montage. The images of the pupils dilating and the sounds that accompanied the sequence was so direct and fast that it portrayed the trios loss of control very well. <br/><br/>The scenes with Sara are heart-wrenching. She just exudes so much pathos its a real blow to the guts watching her spiral downwards. The speech she gives to her son Harry about being old and alone is touching in a strange way; she sounds whiny,almost pathetic, but you can see she is on the edge of hysteria so it is also frightening and Harry's reaction in the taxi is stunning. You get a chance to see his humanity here. When buying the television for his mother its just a cheap ploy to try and make up for being a bad son, ultimately its an empty gesture, but when he breaks down in the taxi we see he does truly care for his mother; he fears for her and genuinely wants to do something to make her better but his inability to cope with so much emotion leads to him shooting up in said taxi and after the 'drug montage' which makes this movie so memorable, we see him cold, composed and never quite so emotional for another person again.<br/><br/>The fridge for me added some interesting dark humor. Its uneasily funny when it jumps about, grows a mouth and tries to eat Sara but it is Sara's reaction to the hallucinations that turn it from humorous to frightening. <br/><br/>I thought the acting was brilliant from all, and the story was very strong, however Tyrone's relationship with his mother, as seen in the flashbacks, was not really needed. I didn't think this aspect was delved into enough to make it truly important. <br/><br/>At the end, its difficult to say who came out worse. Out of all the characters, you get the feeling that only Tyrone will come out of it OK. Being in prison has acted like a rehab; he's forced to go cold turkey and after whats happened to Harry you think he'll be straight once he gets out. He will get on with his life.<br/><br/>Sara's mind has been so destroyed she isn't aware of her circumstance (ignorance is bliss after all)and so consequently she removes herself from it all. Plus she may be mad, but she isn't lonely anymore. She has constant company living in the psychiatric ward and people to care for her; Marion is more difficult, she's now relying on entertaining the sexual desires of 'Little John' in order to fund her addiction and honestly there seems to be no end in sight for her. Harry is in a similar predicament; losing an arm has saved his life, but hes also lost his mother and his love. Personally I felt Harry was worse off, because Marion become detached from herself (not unlike Sara) she seems cold and unemotional, whereas Harry still 'feels'; he still needs or wants (difficult to tell) Marion but he knows shes lost to him. <br/><br/>Thats the thing about this movie; it makes you think on a number of levels. Not about wider issues perhaps, other than drug culture, but it makes you feel more than anything else."

","Needless to say, anyone who has viewed this film with an open mind, and has carefully considered the cinematography and sound, will be able to conclude it is a wonderfully made piece of art. Also, it is quite disturbing also, visually and mentally. The characters are portrayed to perfection; anyone who has read the novel by Hubert Selby, Jr. can agree with that statement. This is one of very few films that truly ""moved"" me. Not moved necessarily in a good way, but moved. It should be noted anyone considering viewing this must keep in mind it will not leave you feeling happy and ready to take on the world. Rather, it will possibly upset the viewer, and if it doesn't accomplish that, it will at least leave you pondering much of your own ways in life.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films made in the last twenty years, and the mix of great visuals, amazing sound, and a great cast combine to make it so. I own the film and have watched it at least twenty times. One thing I can say with confidence is I have never duplicated the feeling I had when I first watched it. I was left so speechless it amazed me, as few movies can really do that to me. Every time I watch it, I am left feeling reflective to say the least, but the first viewing is almost an out-of-body experience which will go un-matched for most. I say watch it, and really take it in as a whole, otherwise you will have missed out on a great opportunity to learn something about yourself and life in general."

","This was truly one of the most depressing films I have ever seen. I generally dislike movies about self-destructive people because I find them tedious, but the acting and directing were so good that I would recommend it. The script left something to be desired. I found certain parts of the film unrealistic -- at least two things come to mind. I don't recall exactly when the film was supposed to have taken place, but even if it was 20 years ago, electroshock therapy would never have been given to somebody when the staff knew for a fact that the patient's problem was pill addiction and not mental illness. The patient also would not be asked to sign a consent when she clearly was not able to consent. I know things like that happened in the 1930s, but not in recent years. The arrest of two of the main characters also did not ring true. Yes, they were in the south, with the stereotypical bunch of redneck cops, but last time I checked, you can't arrest someone for being a drug addict unless you actually find drugs on their person, and if the cops did find it, that scene was left on the cutting-room floor; it appeared from the script that the doctor saw the track marks and called the cops. I don't believe that would happen. It was as if the scriptwriter decided to purposefully exaggerate what would really happen just to punish these people. It would have been better if things evolved more naturally. The film did an excellent job with the special effects, which helped the viewer see the world through the eyes of drug addicts."

","This is DEFINITELY one of those films. ""Requiem For A Dream"" is next to one other, the best movie I've ever seen. Darren Aronofsky has done here what directors like Tarantino and Spielberg have been trying to do for years with their desperate attempts at further greatness with duds like ""Jackie Brown"" and ""Munich"". Aronofsky blends this beautiful portrait of the most horrible and savage demon in the world with its equality of cool atmospheric elements, strange string music, strong characters with amazing backgrounds which are shown in the movie, a factor seldom done by filmmakers and the honesty. The raw and harsh honesty that we as humans grow addictions. We're willing to risk anything; our dignity, our health, our pride, our love and friendships to satisfy our addictions. This is such a beautiful film and will probably never gain that reputation by majority because of its harsh reality and storytelling. I write this review, not for the film buff looking for a good unknown film, not for the Ellen Burstyn or Jared Leto fan, but for parents. Parents only. Pleae, parents, if your son or daughter confronts you with this movie, please please please don't be dissuaded by its content or rating or subject matter or whatever. Let your children see this movie. Let them see it before they hit high school. Watch it with them! Talk to them about it before and after. Use it as an example in your talks with them about drugs. Tell them about your past. Talk to them about their future. Tell them the dangers of addiction and to never let any addiction be so strong that it ruins everything around them. This film is graphic. It's harsh. It's brutal. It's disturbing. It's real. It's beautiful. This does deserve just an ""oh, that was a good movie."" It deserves examination and respect and recognition as a living film that will grab your attention and show you the true meaning of what it means to be addicted and how it can ruin you forever. Watch it with your kids and see."

","Requiem for a dream is a film about addiction, the balance and use of images and music is very well used in this film. Even more special, and even beautiful , is the hidden symbolism in this movie.<br/><br/>The symbolism is hidden within the seasons. At first you have 'summer' , everything is beautiful , happy , sunny and positive. Just like the summer is , everything is full of life and the 'good' side of drugs is represented. Then comes 'autumn' the tide turns. The dark side of drug use comes forward. The characters' lives go down in a spiral of negative emotions. Even worse is 'winter' because the extremely horrible , but maybe also inevitable , climax comes forwards. Their lives are worth nothing. But isn't their any hope when 'spring' the season of birth and awakening is yet to come ? This even comes more forward when all characters lay down in fetus position. It even looks like they are ready to be reborn.<br/><br/>I just want to say that this is my favorite movie. And I really suggest you go see it at once!"

I would also strongly urge you to look at the movie in a non feeling way at first , because if u look at the drugs and think that it is centered around only the drugs , it isn't.

This is a brutal, honest, and terrifying depiction of the effects of drug abuse, centered around 4 characters.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this film is AMAZING. The four lead roles all give excellent performances, I was surprised with Marlon Wayans acting skills in this movie, he was terrific.<br/><br/>This movie possible shows what most drug users go through on a day to day basis, I'm one who has never taken drugs, and possible never will, but after watching this movie I will can say I will NEVER EVER take drugs. This film is required viewing for 11 yr old school children (apart there are some scenes of nudity/swearing).<br/><br/>And the soundtrack is one of the best I have heard.<br/><br/>A MUST SEE!!! 10/10"
"jjangles","10","1","2","21 December 2005"," A powerful, must see flick
","I saw this movie on my one year sobriety birthday from drugs and alcohol and I left the theater red faced, snot dripping from my nose, tears mixed with mascara, smeared all over my face. I was an absolute mess. I cried for about 40 minutes after the movie ended too. This movie truly captures the darkness of addiction and the pain caused to all those afflicted and all those associated with. Its a powerful, must see flick. Ellen Burstin did an outstanding job. It doesn't get much better than that. She knocked it out of the park!! She deserved an Oscar for that performance. Darren Arnofsky has created a fine, fine piece of work that will last a lifetime. Job well done!"
"Seikan","10","1","2","12 December 2005"," It's a sad and haunting reflection on society gone amok.
","It's not every day that a film challenges not only the emotions and standpoints of absolutely every individual who views it, but the censorships and guidelines of so many governments.<br/><br/>With an unhealthy record of recutting and revamping that has left Darren Aronofsky more insane than he was before he went into making the film, and an Academy Award winner headlining, Requiem For A Dream has had its share of ups and downs, raking in little at the box office due to its initial NC-17 classification, and yet has come out on top with an immense cult following.<br/><br/>RFAD tells the tale of four individuals being torn apart by their drug addictions, in what is a depressing downward spiral seeing the dreams of all involved ruined by their senseless addictions.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I have never seen a film that made me break down until I had seen this one. The final montage of the climactic moments left me haunted by the results, and in the moments that followed after the credits rolled, I wasn't able to hold myself together. It's not hard to see why if you actually watch the film, and while many would be so modest and ""cool"" to say they never cried, it'll affect everyone, and you'd be a god damn junkie yourself not to be affected in one way or another.<br/><br/>I think they should cut the Classification for society's sake and show it to all who know the meaning of what goes on in this film, because it's movies like this that have the ability to change the messed up world we live in.<br/><br/>And as a side note, Ellen Burstyn deserved that damn Oscar, hell, she gave the greatest female performance I've ever seen in my life."
"angnross","10","1","2","2 November 2005"," Unique, Chilling, eye-opening
","Language limitations often limit us to be able to portray the feelings we get from watching, reading and viewing art. This movie is art at its finest. All the cast in this movie you've seen in other pictures, but I can say with confidence that each of the four main cast members give their best performance in thie movie, especially Ellen Burnstyn whose character is one of my favorite of all time. I've watched this movie at least 5 times and each time I get something more out of it.<br/><br/>The movie is about much more than this comment to follow, but on a surface level, this is a movie that older teenagers should watch to reconsider drug habits. It would make more sense for the anti-drug squad to show this movie to teenagers then to give their contradictory ""proof"" and ""facts"" on the dangers of drug abuse.<br/><br/>On a deeper level, the viewer will find something in this movie that can relate to their lives, whether it is the empty feeling we get sometimes sitting on our couch or lying in bed or the emotion and fear caused by aging, getting old and feeling lonely.<br/><br/>I like a number of Hollywood hits for their special effects or one-time entertainment value, but this movie is a subjective, deep look at the downward spiral of 4 lives that goes beyond cheap thrills. I related to the movie and I don't even drink or do drugs. It made me rethink some things in my live, I cried at parts, thought of family/ friends.<br/><br/>This review is vague, not really telling you much, but i'll finish by saying you MUST watch this brilliant film."

","""Requiem for a Dream"" is a wallop of a follow-up to ""Pi"" for director Darren Aronofsky.<br/><br/>The casting of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly as junkie Brooklyn Jews is a bit far-fetched, but they turn out to be excellent, completely involved actors and quite passable with the accent.<br/><br/>The editing takes a ""3 Kings"" approach to drugs, going inside the head and body of abusers, but paced and accompanied by an increasingly mad soundtrack played by the Kronos Quartet.<br/><br/>Ironically for the no one under 17 rating I would be like the mother in ""Almost Famous"" and push my kids to go see it while screaming ""Don't Do Drugs!"" at them. It did feel like an updated, brutal ""Reefer Madness,"" like ""Cold and Sober"" and other addiction movies like ""Drugstore Cowboy"" but without any of the upside or hope, and this is way more visceral and visual.<br/><br/>(originally written 10/15/2000)"
"michalm-2","10","1","2","25 October 2005"," Point of view of a Pole
","This movie is breakthrough somehow. First time a movie shows the problem of drug abuse for every rank of society that widely. The cast is very well matched in my opinion, although at first I was astonished to see Marlon Wayans in a drama. At the beginning the film rather bored me but with the time passing by, the movie aroused my interests in it. For the first look everything may seem entirely different from what we can see in Poland. Here it surely won't keep away from drugs those who know polish reality, but may help those ones who had little contact with drugs. Some of my friends parted the room before its end which means this film can emotionally affect on our psyche. I'd not recommend to watch it people who are mentally weak. It would be just easy to antagonize them. But as I said, some people will remain no convinced, like my friend who kept asking me to drink some vodka while watching it and another one who got the willingness to take heroin after he saw it. You never get to everyone. Anyway, summing it up it's very good movie that is definitely worth watching. Full note of course!"
"kashuu1","Null","1","2","18 September 2005"," More than an anti-drug slogan!!
","Drugs are pervasive. This, as well as other themes found in the subtext of this film, seem to have been overlooked in many of the comments I've read here. So I'd like to address a few of them.<br/><br/>Firstly, drugs are pervasive and we are all prone to them. Whether it is the kind you buy on the street, the kind you get from your doctor, the television that usually has pride of place in our homes, the box of chocolate that we mindlessly devour as we sit mesmerized in front of the screen, or sex  viewed pornographically or indulged in physically. The film contrasts the dreams of our innocence with the realities that find us as adults hooked to our different opiates.<br/><br/>When the film opens with the television talk show, and the presenter and audience involved in an overly enthusiastic call-and-response of the show's slogans, I thought immediately of an African-American church meeting viewed by someone on acid. This was without having any prior knowledge that the movie concerned drug addiction. The image was particularly resonant because television has indeed become a new religion with global converts.<br/><br/>And one reason for its unprecedented proselytizing success is the often-fatal epidemic of loneliness that is spreading contagiously throughout the developed, modern world. Loneliness induces the state, not only of being alone, but also of being unknown. Sara Goldfarb clings to her dream of being on television mainly because it marks her out as being special, makes her interesting, makes others want to talk to her and know her where she has long been ignored and dismissed as old and irrelevant  even by her son. In a world of Jerry Springer and reality television, where being on television even as an object of derision, appears to be the ultimate goal, this movie takes on even added significance.<br/><br/>The television itself plays a central role in the film. It has multiple significances. It is Sara's opiate. It finances Harry's addiction. It symbolizes not only the lack of communication and communion between Sarah and Harry, but is also inversely and ironically their main point of contact when Harry comes to visit his mother to steal and sell the television, and later, when he buys her a bigger and better television, from Macy's, no less, to make up for his past behavior.<br/><br/>This lack of communion emerges as the heartbreaking refrain of the film. Marion has money from her parents, but not the love and attention that she craves. She has had lovers with money and compliments, but finds true tenderness only with Harry, a poor junkie who adores her, and who is the only person to believe in and encourage her to pursue her dream of becoming a professional designer. Harry loves his mother and wants her to be happy, but chooses a present that underscores her unhappiness instead of giving her what she really desires  his time and his love. Sara's friends rejoice with her when she is chosen to appear on television. But none of them steps in when she starts spiraling downwards on her diet pills. <br/><br/>Another recurring motif in the film is the irresponsibility and insensitivity of the caregivers of our society. We see three doctors in the film, and all are abominable. The diet specialist never even looks at Sara, far more for examining her or questioning her about her feelings or health. He simply prescribes dangerous drugs that help to increase his net worth. The doctor in the hospital who sees Harry's arm and who obviously recognizes the seriousness of his condition, never makes an attempt to care for Harry. He simply calls the police and washes his hands, like Pontius Pilate. And Marion's therapist has only one desire to see Marion on the couch  spreadeagled for his sexual gratification. That he is always seen coldly consumed with his eating, or that Marion responds to his self-absorption and satisfaction by stabbing him in the hand with her fork, if even only in her mind, is an indication of the director's excellent use of visual storytelling. We also see two male nurses  who restrain and force-feed Sara without an iota of caring or compassion. The only real caregiver in the film is seen at the end  the nurse who tries to comfort Harry after his amputation, which only heightens the pathos and irony, because the caring has come much too late.<br/><br/>And finally, we have the overlooked storyline of Marlon Wayans' character, Tyrone. His misguided desire to improve his situation and lead the rich life, leads him to a life of forced slavery. The director highlights not merely that he ends up in prison. He also underlines the uncaring, neocolonial ethos of a system that denies medical treatment to prisoners in need, and that treats convicts, whatever their physical or mental states, as slave labor. The prisoners are there to work, without pay, to help sustain the system. And there, ""niggers from New York"" come in for special abuse.<br/><br/>It is extremely sad when Harry, the character that perhaps evolves the most in the film, realizes, too late, that drugs  whether a new television, diet pills or heroin, are not an answer to any problem. What intensifies that pathos is that he actually tries to be there for his mother and girlfriend earlier in the film when he visits his mother to tell her about the television and when he tries to tell Marion that the drugs are not available. But each time, the women are too strung out on their drugs to be able to respond to his feeble attempts. <br/><br/>Anyone who dismisses this film as an anti-drug slogan has missed the important stories that are being told, visually and verbally, as well as the fine and subtle acting by the entire cast led by an obviously talented and complicated director."
"samsma","10","1","2","28 July 2005"," Disturbing and depressing yet Beautiful and Poetic
","during the duration of this film I had to pause it 10 times simply for the fact that I felt that I was going insane. This is hands down the most disturbing and depressing movie i've ever seen. But in a very beautiful and poetic way. Pain can be beautiful because it is human. I absolutely appreciated the non compromising attitude this director took with this movie, it never lets up, never lets you breathe, holds you under water and injects pain into your veins. If you watch this movie you will be affected. Unless you are seriously out of touch with artistic forms of expression. I appreciated how it affected me, I loved how sad it made me, because it was real, that was the story, it was sad, If they had all ended up on a beach in Jamaica at the end I would have felt cheated. I kept turning away, squirming in my seat, holding my hands over my mouth and biting my lip. At the end tears came, a constant flow of them, I felt so lost so depressed so pitiful for those characters. It was just brutally honest. This is what film is for, it is not a cheap, sensationalistic piece of crap that is usually used to bring forth emotion in people. It is completely and totally honest. And If you are fragile emotionally do not watch this film. Although to be honest, I am very fragile, I watched it alone and I found it made me stronger.<br/><br/>On a final note I'd like to add that Ellen Burstyn not winning the Oscar is one of the biggest travesties of modern film. She played this character so brilliantly I had my jaw dropped any time she spoke, during one scene she rips your heart out about five times and beats it against the ground. She is so broken so torn. It was absolutely magnificent. I wish I could tell her that she deserved that Oscar more than that sappy sell out piece of crap that won instead.<br/><br/>anyway,it made me completely uncomfortable and broken but I will appreciate that and adore this movie for the rest of my life, it is truly a beautiful film even for a girl who's favorite movie is Monty Python and the holy grail."
"Duzniak38","10","1","2","28 July 2005"," It will break your heart....
","Wow. This movie totally blew me away. I have to say it has been one of the most brutal, shocking yet refreshing films I have ever viewed. The film partly revolves around the life of Sara Goldfarb, a TV junkie who loves chocolate, who lives alone in her apartment. We witness various events in her life, such as how her son Harry steals her television set from her to pawn it for drug money, how much she loves her T.V. shows (JUICE) and her sugary junk foods, and how she really is a vulnerable, depressed and lonely woman. After winning an opportunity to appear on a television show, she posts her application form and then chooses a stunning red dress which she wore to Harry's graduation as the outfit which she will wear on television. Being a little overweight, the dress does not quite fit, so, determined to be able to wear the dress in time for her T.V. appearance, Sara decides to go on a diet. An eggs and grapefruit diet. The experience is gruelling for her, and we see how over the weeks she struggles over the temptation to indulge in doughnuts and chocolates. However when Sara's refrigerator starts jumping around and scaring her to death, she decides to do something. She decides to go to a doctor and start taking diet pills. Four pills which will be her meals for the day. Taking them seems not so bad at first. But what we discover over the days and weeks is that these pills are bad drugs. Drugs that are slowly ruining her life. It starts to come to the point of terrifying, when her fridge becomes alive and even more crazy as she starts to hallucinate. So she goes to the doctor. But the doctor doesn't seem to be interested in these weird events in the slightest, and instructs her to continue taking them. Still waiting for a reply from the T.V. studio, Sara takes the train to the studio. This scene really captures how these pills have affected her. She has changed from a moderately happy woman with good health to an unhappy, unhealthy, untidy, unstable, lonely and depressed lady, who only wants to star on television. After the studio calls the hospital, Sara is taken into care and is forced to eat some proper food in order for her to regain health and proper weight. In the end the doctors decide to treat her with ETC. At the very end of the film we can see how much Sara has been affected. The story of Sara Goldafrb is an unsettling and heartbreaking one ... the simple idea of how these pills ... these drugs have made this poor, vulnerable old woman's life spiral downward, making her a shaky, nervous lady, obsessed with her T.V. appearance. I was so sad by the end, crying to myself as my sympathy and sorrow for the character poured out of my heart, as I realised how devastating and upsetting her life turned out, after all of the terrible events. I was amazed by the absolutely stunning performance by Ellen Burstyn. It was truly dazzling and totally believable. I was affected greatly by the acting and the character in both a good and bad way. The film revolves around Sara Goldfarb's son, best friend and girlfriend too - Harry, Tyrone and Marion - three characters who deal and do drugs. The film follows them, and what they do in order to get drugs - for example, taking a trip to the supermarket. Marion, Harry's girlfriend (played by the beautiful Jennifer Connelly) is a drug addict who sleeps with a couple of men to get money, but whose talent is sketching. When Harry decides to save up enough cash in order to buy a place so Marion can set up a store, it seems nothing will go wrong. But after Tyrone gets put in jail, Harry uses all the saved money to bail him out. When failing to find any drugs to buy, Harry and Tyrone go to California - or was that Florida (!) in order to buy. In the meanwhile we also see how Marion has degraded herself to stripping in front of crowds of men, using a dildo with another woman. It concludes with Harry being taken to hospital, after we see how injecting drugs has turned Harry's arm into a horrible sight... Tyrone is taken to jail and Marion loses all dignity. We witness the various drug-related outcomes in their lives. Marlon Wayans, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly ALL play amazingly well roles, with excellent, convincing performances. The stylish use of the split-screen technique, huge close-ups and exaggerated sound effects add to the glossiness and the soundtrack is haunting and unforgettable. I highly recommend this daring, brutal shock-fest for all of those with a strong stomach in search of a powerful and unnerving trip into the narcotics dependent darkness of modern America. A must-see ... cinematic history..."

You are introduced to her as a sad, lonely mother who has nothing but good intentions in what she does. And as her story concludes at the end you will want to do nothing but mourn at the unfairness of it all. Of course most of this applies to the rest of the main characters as well. One specific scene, though, when the mother (and you'll know what I'm talking about when you watch it) is giving a speech to her son is really just what broke my heart and nearly brought me to tears.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 10 because (1) it was just so damn powerful and (2) also because I have never seen another movie quite like it.

Very, very intense movie and this is probably way I liked it so much. The degradation of the human being is so well portrayed with the help of the great performance of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans. This is the story of Sara - the mother, Harry - the son, his girlfriend - Marion and their friend - Tyrone. All four of them have different dreams and hopes but all of them get destroyed by the same evil: the addiction to drugs whether they are pills or actual illicit substances. They choose the easy way to reach their dreams and that brings them to perdition. You can actually feel the desperation that every character reaches, the hole in which they sink deeper and deeper.

","I'd heard a lot of reviews and a lot of good things about requiem and finally got a chance to see it on a film four freeview. Nothing could have prepared me for the sheer emotional intensity of this movie. The movie is based around the lives of four people who become addicted to drugs. It is a simple storyline and it follows the different characters as they slowly descend into a drug induced world which is harrowing to watch for the viewer.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's visual style is impressive and the sequences in which he uses to show the injection of heroin are very well done with sharp fast edits. I have heard Requiem compared with the mess that is Spun and it is hard to believe how people can mention the films in the same breath, they are very different and Requiem as a whole is a far superior film.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn's performance as Sarah Goldfarb is sensational and i have never seen such a believable and touching performance. The rest of the cast is superb as well, Marlon Wayans shows that he can act, and Jennifer Connolley and Jared Leto are perfectly cast as a young happy couple torn apart by there addictions, a scene between the two of them where they are talking and stroking each other gently is the most beautiful and touching scene i have ever witnessed.<br/><br/>At times requiem is hard to watch but at no time could i take my eyes away from the screen, it is hard to say whether i actually enjoyed the film but it was fascinating and compulsive viewing which kept me interested for the whole of the film. The raw power of the film is something i have never experienced before, it is heartbreaking to watch these characters sink further and further into a drug induced despair and even harder to take the ending.<br/><br/>I sat at the ending of the film for sometime shocked, hurt and moved unable to even cry.<br/><br/>This is a special film but is not for the faint hearted or easily shocked for everyone else it is an absolute must see.

Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his mother Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and Harry's best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). Harry and Tyrone start as drug users yet as the movie progresses they become frequent dealers. Harry's girlfriend Marion is also a drug addict who dreams of one day opening a cloth store and designing her own clothes. Harry's mother, Sara Goldfarb lives alone. Her husband died and her son Harry only visits her when he needs to sell the T.V. to the pawn shop to get money for a fix. Then Sara will go buy the T.V. back. This process has been going on for a while. Sara has no real friends and feels she is a no body. Sara also has an obsession. She is obsessed with T.V. That is why she is thrilled to get a phone call saying that she is going to appear on T.V. She wants to wear her red dress that she wore to Harry's graduation. One problem, it doesn't fit, she has put on weight. One of her friends recommends going to see a doctor. The doctor gives her weight loss pills. She eventually becomes addicted to these and things start to get bad.<br/><br/>The four main heroes all start off with a dream. It goes well for a little while. Yet towards the end, the fate of each character spirals out of control, providing the twenty most brutal, depressing, harrowing and terrifying minutes ever put on film.<br/><br/>This film will make you cry and might even make you feel mentally of psychically sick. It is indeed one of the most depressing films I have ever seen. It is also brutally honest which makes it all the scarier. Anyone thinking of taking drugs after watching this movie is an idiot.<br/><br/>This movie focuses not on the drug dealers or the drugs or even the users. This movie's main focus is one word, addiction, and what an addiction can do to you. It shows the psychological affect behind addiction and what people are willing to do to get one more pill (or whatever their addiction might be).<br/><br/>Aside from the pure emotional ride this movie will take you on, this movie is incredible in another way. The visuals are stunning; the entire way this movie was filmed and directed is just incredible. The acting is also top notch, especially Jennifer Connolly and Ellen Burstyn. The score is also amazing. The violin's playing throughout the movie are haunting and moving especially as they provide an up tempo haunting sound for the ending when the characters dreams come crashing down on them.<br/><br/>This film is not for everyone. If you are squeamish or if you get upset very easily you might want to steer clear of this film, although you will be missing an incredible film. This movie will stick with you for a long time. This movie also gives a new meaning to addiction, so much so that you might not want to take another sip of that coffee sitting beside you.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I consider myself to be a picky, if not downright mean movie critic. Many times I find myself not being to find even the slightest good comment about a film, however, Requiem for a Dream is a movie that I cannot laud highly enough. The film chronicles and parallels the drug use and over indulgence of the four main characters and then continues to culminate into a spine-chilling, depressing, yet enormously powerful climax. There are few movies that after the credits roll I am stuck in my chair, unable to process what I have just witnessed, and Requiem for a Dream accomplished this task magnificently. Nothing about the film rings false whatsoever.<br/><br/>The acting is great, the dialogue is real, the story is believable... Ellen Burstyn has an injustice performed on her career when she did not win the Oscar for her performance as Sara Goldfarb. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly managed to truly create a chemistry that made viewers feels the poignancy of the deterioration of their relationship. Finally, Marlon Wayans was surprising in a role that required the utmost seriousness of his character.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only thing I can say about Requiem for a Dream that is not positive is my feeling about Darren Aranofsky's use of the split screens. While I admit that they do not detract from the movie, they do not add to it either. Thus, in my opinion, anytime a device neither detracts nor adds it is best to go with a straightforward approach. Otherwise, Aranofsky's cinematography is beautiful and often times allows the viewer to feel slightly more emerged into the film than they would feel otherwise. Overall, my final say is, ""Bravo"", to Darren Aranofsky and the entire cast of Requiem for a Dream. Truly, in my humble opinion, a masterpiece has been created; 50 years from now the film industry will look back upon it and agree with me."

","This is one of the best movies I have EVER seen. I have had personal experiences with drugs and people addicted to drugs. The characters were very convincing. Ellen Burstyn did an outstanding job as Sarah Goldfarb. The scenes with her and that damn refrigerator will haunt me forever! The movie almost makes you feel like YOU are the one on drugs.Especially when watching Sarah on the diet pills. I cannot explain the feeling I was left with after watching this movie. It wasn't a pleasant one though. If you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend it. And unlike a lot of people, I don't think it is a ""message"" movie at all. I think people are generally aware of the dangers and downfalls of drugs and addiction by now, don't you? I just think it is a portrayal of a group of people and their addictions. I was amused when Sarah kept getting her t.v out of hock, after Harry would steal it. I have seen that first hand a million times. So true to real life. And Marlon Wayans showed he can do something other than comedy, and do it well. He took on a very serious role, and nailed it! The sex party was pretty graphic. Shocking? No. Not if you know real life junkies. Seems like this story probably plays out in real life all over the country every day. That's the real tragedy. I can't end this review without commenting on Jared Leto. In my opinion he is great in a serious role. He hasn't really been in a lot of movies, has he? I always thought he was HOT when I first saw him on ""My So Called Life"" with Claire Danes. But now I am far more infatuated with his music career. His band, 30 Seconds to Mars, is PHENOMENAL. Who knew that boy could sing? I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE their music, and recommend music fans to check out their cd's."

","For his follow-up to his darkly brilliant debut, PI, director Darren Aronofsky chose to adapt a tough and meaty piece of work: Hubert Selby's 1968 novel REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, a dark spiral into the abyss of barren fantasies doomed to extinction. However, in Aronofsky's frenetic, visionary, unique, and disturbing style lies the perfect setting for this story of four people whose intertwined lives are filled with eternally hopeful despair. This is a different sort of horror film. Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) and Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) are lovers in Brooklyn with dreams of setting up a small business and spending the rest of their lives in love--their version of the American dream. The two are also desperate heroin addicts, a compulsion that darkens their lives and leads Harry to repeatedly pawn his mother's television. His mother, Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), is addicted to television, which is why she keeps replacing the stolen set. One day she receives a call from her favorite show, the surreal TAPPY TIBBONS SHOW, and learns that she has been selected to appear on an upcoming broadcast. When she can't fit into her best red dress, her doctor prescribes diet pills (uppers), to which she swiftly and painfully becomes addicted. Harry's cohort, an intelligent hustler named Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), completes the foursome. With its unflinching dissection of addiction, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is a psychologically disturbing, visually captivating depiction of lost hope. The last half hour of the film is among the most harrowing of any film ever made."

","Unassumingly titled, ""Requiem for a dream"" more than justifies its interesting name. Tracing the interconnected lives of four individuals, it tells a dark, tragic story of their down slide, as they fall prey to their addiction to drugs, trading in their dreams for a dirge instead.<br/><br/>In a seemingly benign summer, Harry, Marion and Tyrone, all recreational drug users, weave dreams of a better, and legitimate life, attempting to make a fast buck by pushing drugs. But their habit slowly but surely takes control of their lives, inexorably pushing them to the brink. In parallel, the story also focuses on Sara, Harry's mother, rendered to devastating perfection by Ellen Burstyn. Sara, a widow, in her utter loneliness, begins to take weight reduction pills in preparation for a supposed guest appearance on a TV show. As her dependence on the drugs in the pills increases, so do her insecurity-induced delusions, stemming from a fear of societal rejection. Eventually, in the climatic winter of their despair, the characters, each in their own way, tumble to irreparable depths of self-destruction. The beautiful, yet eerie background score that permeates the movie adds to its sheer visual intensity, leaving the viewer inwardly hoping for an unrealistic, yet better turn of events. Ending on a black note, Requiem For A Dream sends an ominous message about the power of addiction."

This movie will be brand-marked on the back of your head and won't leave soon. The story is very weird, but also realistic. And not very optimistic, it gives you something to think about. After ""Pi"" the director of this movie is holding on to the same style,which I think is a original and great style. I look forward to his next movie (that will be ""The Fountain"" I think). It's Before this movie I never saw a movie with Jared Leto. I must say he did a very good job, just as the rest of the cast. Jennifer Connely and Ellen Burstyn really stood out.

"Piero75","6","1","2","10 February 2005"," Plenty of substances, just very little substance
","Now, let's start by making it clear that this is an extremely stylish movie. There is no denying that the camera work, visual effects and creation of atmosphere are extremely effective. The drug taking scenes are very powerful when they are viewed the first time, and the second time, maybe even the third, but by the fourth, fifth...tenth..twentieth time the same rapid sequences of drug-taking and their immediate effects wear very thin. Had the film been any longer I think I would have thrown a bag of flour at the screen.<br/><br/>The plot is very, very predictable and the visuals are tacked on in categorizable chunks. After a while you will be waiting for the next step down on the ladder of visual hallucinations. These, like the other effects, are very stylishly done and are quite disturbing at times, but there is really nothing new here.<br/><br/>For some reason this film reminded me a lot of 'Jacob's Ladder', though I think the latter is better and has a much higher re-watchability. In places the camera work was very similar to 'Killing Zoe', again, a slightly better film in my opinion. 'Requiem for a Dream' just doesn't have any substance beyond it's own simplistic message and clever effects; there is just too much repetition here.<br/><br/>Is the acting any good? I don't think so. There was really nothing challenging to be acting about unless you count stereotypes as challenging acting. Each character gets high, gets into a stuporous rage and eventually gets hurt - there is no restraint and everything is just blended together so that even a hint of a good performance is lost in the mixture (a problem I find with many American films these days).<br/><br/>However, my final comment will read, ""this movie took me somewhere I didn't want to go, and it did it effectively. It just did it about fifty times in less than two hours and then ended"".<br/><br/>Note: I loved Pi, and was quite disappointed with this film."

The film was so concise, not a frame was wasted, beautiful editing. Whether short and sharp, or long and lingering, it was just perfect. And one of the best trip scenes to boot. I won't say where, you'll know it when you see it.<br/><br/>If ""spun"" was the ying then this is the yang of drug movies. Both attempt to simulate the drug taking process through cam effects, but whereas ""spun"" took a more light hearted approach this went much deeper and darker and is the better film for it. I've taken a lot of different drugs in my time (though not the h, i'm not stupid!) and at the end of the day drugs are not funny, they tend to f**k you up. This is a film that shows the sharp end of the drug stick, then stabs you in the eye with it. It hurts but it's good!"
"mac301","7","1","2","3 February 2005"," Sad......
","The Story <br/><br/>The film focuses on a quartet of doomed souls, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embodies the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an absurd self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're careening toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines.<br/><br/>The Facts <br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is one of the most depressing films that I have seen in a long time. It is hard for me to rate the film itself. I'm tied between a seven and an eight. It is a film that I can only handle to watch once or twice. After viewing it the first time I felt as if I needed a vacation. I felt I was in a hellish nightmare. The director did a great job pulling it off. It feels too real. It felt like it happened to someone I loved and cared about. The film's imagery is unforgettable. It is hard for anyone to forget. It is a terrifying and beautiful film all at once. Many viewers may not be able to handle the film. It takes place during the span of three seasons: summer (everyting is alive and luscious), fall (things start to take a turn for the worst), and winter (everything is cold and dead). It was easily the best film of 2000. The plot is heartfelt and never lets up on the viewer until the rolling credits. It is sure to be unbelievable. The direction is great. Aronofsky does everything with style and emotion. The acting is absolutely amazing. Ellen Burstyn is by far the most memorable and tragic character in the film. Every character is loved by the audience. It's sad that the only one who has a chance of saving themself is Marlon Wayans character, who will still have a hard time. The acting and characters are some of the best brought to screen. I haven't read the book that the film is based on, but I bet this is a great adaption from it. The film's score is fantastic. It does every scene justice. I loved it! I recommend this film to anyone, especially if they are planning on using drugs or have recently started. Requiem for a Dream is a ultimately painstaking event, but it all pays off in the end. Do not miss this one you guys."

It uses complex camera angles combined with brilliant music, to make the viewer able to experience the up's and down's of a drug induced euphoria. I myself have been struggling with some drug problems. I didn't think that the feelings could be captured on film. But I was definitely wrong. Every time I watch the film, I am amazed at how accurately it portrays being inside the minds of drug abusers. All of the main characters are excellent in this film. It shows how at first, all drug users start out using the drugs to escape from reality into a ""dream"" world, but how eventually, not being able to let go of that ""dream"" ends up being their downfall. This movie keeps you in suspense the whole time, and by the end of the movie, you feel like you've experienced all of the hell that the characters have been through.

From the opening scene to the end the movie is a tour de force. Where to begin? First,the film has incredible energy. Given the subject matter, i.e. the story of 4 characters lives bottoming out, and the themes of addiction, depression and emptiness the movie could easily have been turgid, didactic and boring. Instead, what you get is a very stylized, yet moving and dare I say profound depiction of what life can do to people. <br/><br/>The actors all gave amazing performances. <br/><br/>The movie is filled with powerful images and gradually builds momentum to its crushing ending. No tidy little salvation here. Toward the end, there is a scene with Jennifer Connely's character lying in a fetal position, clutching a bag of drugs she received for sexually degrading herself, with this serene, sad smile on her face, that is as haunting as anything you'll see on film. The soundtrack is extraordinary too."

The repeating mundane and reinforcing dialogue and visuals just go to remind you of events and circumstance that you already know.<br/><br/>However, it is in the second half of the film where it really gets its message forward. It shows how four peoples lives career out of control when drugs begin to take over their lives, and not all from the illegal point of view.<br/><br/>From the second half it's a very interesting and compelling film, dropping to total despair by the last twenty minutes. The final sequence is one of the most harrowing to endure in the movies I've seen in the last few years, and tackles the issues head on without flinching.<br/><br/>Overly stylised it certainly is, but if you can endure those moments and progress onto the latter part of the movie you will have a head on crash with the ending. Harrowing is hardly the word.<br/><br/>I have to say, stunning performance from Jennifer Connelly, and an equally amazing and surprising show from Marlon Wayans.

"jrfranklin01","8","1","2","17 October 2004"," A Down the Rabbit Hole View of Drugs
","Darren Aronofsky takes us through a worm hole into four lives on drugs and living its dangerous consequences. Much like the film ""Blow"" with Johnny Depp, this movie is intended to show the false illusions concerning drugs and how selling narcotics catches up with you sooner or later. Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is an indolent kid involved with heroin. He constantly troubles his mother in selling the household television to buy heroin. Harry's girlfriend, Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) is a spoiled girl whose previous trouble with the law have her constantly checking in with a probation officer. What is surprising about ""Requiem for a Dream"" is that it attempts to completely show how drugs can devastate regardless of age or race. Harry's mother, Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), in a desperate effort to lose weight, becomes addicted to ""uppers."" Tyrone Love (Marlan Wayans) is a young black man trying to making something for himself with drugs and gangs. <br/><br/>Aronofsky gives us mind-boggling effects with the young kids use of drugs and the repetitive ""You've Got Juice"" slogan that sadly represent the attention and happiness Sara Goldfarb pines over. But the trip from moderate to severe is a wild ride. Everything seems perfect, for a time. And then all four characters get jarred around like passengers on a roller-coaster ride. MULTIPLE SPOILERS BELOW- we see how Harry, Marion, Tyrone become their own best customers in the drug trade. We also see how Sara Goldfarb becomes paranoid as her obsession and pride with a contest drives her past sanity. And perhaps the toughest thing to bear and the saddest is the ending. A far cry from any happy ending you'll ever see, Harry and Marion's addiction soon consumes what love they have. Harry lets his girlfriend sleep with another man in order to score some drug money. Ignoring a growing infection, Harry loses an arm to heroin. Marion loses what little self respect she has as she continues to whore herself out in order to get heroin. Tyrone finds out gangs are a dead end and that ""get rich quick"" is better suited for fairy tales. Taking Harry to the hospital leaves Tyrone serving time in a racist prison. And in one of the more grim and bizarre conclusions, Sara Goldfarb becomes catatonic, becoming more alone than ever in her make-believe world.<br/><br/>The most basic way the describe the film is to say ""it's a trip."" One that picks up your marbles and tosses them around a bit (congratulations Aronofsky). I was surprised yet admired the way he showed the pretentiousness of Sara Goldfarb and her mundane friends. The degradation Marion allows her self to suffer is quite shocking in the end. The ""You've Got Juice"", Evil Refrigerator, and nervousness of Sara Goldfarb work together well to show her distancing connection to reality. <br/><br/>Some things I thought were taken a bit afar or were an exaggeration from reality. One was Harry's loss of his arm. Nobody bothers to do anything about his infected arm, some make wisecracks (the police, prison guards, a doctor). Also, I thought Sara Goldfarb's devolution to a vegetable was way overblown and totally incredible. I think Aronofsky was so determined to give all the characters such a grim ending that he couldn't resist getting carried away in this regard. But it is gratuitous as we could see the devastating effects Sara suffered and her loss of Harry to prison would have obvious effects on her. While certain aspects of the ending are a bit much, the film does succeed at giving you a bad taste in your mouth for drugs. Although it may be an apropos portrayal of some of the ""potential"" consequences of a life involved with drugs, this film sure is depressing! 7/10"

","A requiem is a 'a song or hymn of mourning composed or performed as a memorial to a dead person'. Is it the death of a dream, of the death of someone because of his or her dream?<br/><br/>Whichever case, I would watch this film again because it does show real humans all the way from shear innocence, up through their emotional richness and combats, down to the numbness of it all. It reminded me of the movie-documentary made in 86 about Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols, a band close to my heart for guys and girls of my generation. In both cases, the grandeur that seems accessible at a certain times in life (no matter what age), and even easy to grab, brings unexpected downfalls, generally not reversible. Incidentally it was right on the spot within its most minute details. The 'TV set for mum' episode struck me cause it reminded me of a colleague of mine turned in no time into a cocaine addict-dealer and of the huge television set he had offered his mum for Christmas... Same social background as in the film, same legitimate ideals turned into megalomaniac transfer leading to decay, possibly to death. I have traveled a lot and made a point in keeping clean, but I have met more than one kid who didn't and I'm still amazed on how fast drugs can drag you down the drain. I do not see the plot as exaggerate, but as very well documented. I was not shocked by it, I was impressed by its honesty and almost scientific clarity. I loved the hip- hop pulse, clear, bright images, very appropriated to the feel of the message. I have no doubts it is a testimony against drugs, from someone perceptive and well documented. This movie is realistic, beautifully brought together, vivid and yes, alive. The good thing about DVDs is that you have special features, interviews (one of Hubert Selby) and insights in the making. There's only one likely scenario with drugs, and old Selby as well as young Aronofsky have written and directed it for us, majestically."

","Requiem for a Dream is perhaps one the most powerful movies that I have seen and is likely responsible for upping the quality of movies that I have watched in the last year or so. The story so involves the viewer through pity, concern and sadness for the fate of the four heroes that it makes it seemingly impossible to turn away during even the most difficult of scenes. (And there are quite a few here) All four of the main characters are completely believable due to some excellent performances from Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly and the biggest surprise for me in Marlon Wayans. I found myself following each one of their plights very closely throughout the film; relishing in their success when it appeared and rooting for them to somehow pull themselves out of the troubles that they get into. And this is the most impressive thing about the movie, it made me care. It made me watch these four characters as if this were really happpening to each individual. The actors transcended their roles in this one.<br/><br/>Equally as good is Aronofsky's pacing and cinematography and the haunting soundtrack that makes this movie come to life. Both do superb jobs of actually making this movie seem more like a documentary of the real life struggles of the characters, which is something that Hollywood often fails to do. <br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is without a doubt one of the better films made in recent memory and is one that more people should have had the pleasure of seeing. Here's to hoping that more movies are made with the passion that this one was seemingly made with."

","Requiem for a Dream is not your usual ""drug"" movie, in fact I wouldn't call this one of those anti - drug movies, this movie is about the four characters harbored around their addictions, not allowing themselves to live a full life. The director gets the best performances from everyone in the film, especially from Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, and Ellen Burstyn. This film is an experience you forget you are watching a movie because the characters in the film portray the worst possible paths of life. A lot of people who have seen this movie can't get by the ""depressing"" feeling they feel after watching but if you look through that this is a masterpiece relating simple emotions(love, friendship, parenthood, and person freedom) and turns them to hell. The soundtrack to this movie is amazing conveying all of the pain and love from the film.<br/><br/>One of my favorite newer movies."

","You don't need to take acid and listen to Pink Floyd while watching this movie to feel extremely trippy. Allow me to be frank, this movie is one of the most f*cked up movie I have seen; and it it awesome. It comes up there with A Clockwork Orange and similar titles. David Arronofsky is a genius (and probably a little insane, like most geniuses). His use of quick cuts, upper shots, split screen, and time motion are absolutely awesome. That's what attracted me to this movie in the first place, stumbling upon it on the IFC, I realized that it looked like a masterpiece and so I did what any film critic would: I turned it off. I knew I could not watch it from the middle and love as much. So I went out and rented it and watched it from the very beginning to the very end and it was absolutely amazing. The repetitive violin music is chilling and stays with you for days. The plot is somewhat loose, still great, and the way the three stories are intertwined is amazing. It's pretty much the story of four different people and how they go through four different and personal hells and end up f*cked over in the end. Amazing piece on society, drugs, and something that will stick with me until death."

","Imagine you're trying to reinvent yourself for the better. Trying to lose a little weight, trying to make money to afford the good life. What if the attempt drove you into your own personal hell? That's pretty much what we see among the four main characters. Each turns to drugs for various reasons, from speed for weight loss to heroin for cash. Each character devolves before our very lives as their drug of choice takes hold of them. Not to spoil, but the movie ends on a down beat, in my opinion. However, this ending is the only type that's really suitable, unless you want to go into the cliché that everyone will turn their lives around and all will be well.<br/><br/>This movie made me rather uncomfortable, but I suppose that that was the whole point. To that regard, it was a very effective character study that could have been handled a lot worse, given the subject matter<br/><br/>9/10"

","This movie is an example of the grim effects that drugs will have on your life and the price that you'll pay to keep up a addiction that does more harm to your life than good. If you would like to movies that show this from another point of view I would recommend Blow even though it doesn't show the depressing effects of such substances but it does show that drug dealers always have an up and a down in their lifes and that they could be on top of the world for one minute and be double crossed the next. But in this movie there is also an up and a down for these three people but the down is shown to be more graphic and depressing then in the other movie and it shows that a person will show there true face when you can't help them or when your in trouble. In this movie the lead roles are played by people that did a magnificent job and they showed the raw emotions that are displayed when you are on a binge and the effects it has on your every day life. As I try to do in all of my reviews I like to point out if this movie is appropriate for you. In this movie there is pervasive depictions of drugs use and graphic sexuality and rather strong language so if you are one of those sensitive types I highly recommend that you do not view this movie but if your not this is a very well done movie."

Ellen Burstyn should have won the Oscar for this film without a shadow of a doubt. Her acting in this film is one of the top five female performances ever. Julia Roberts could never, ever produce a performance as excoriatingly painful as this. I was totally and utterly blown away by Ellen Burstyn. The rest of the cast are just as good, with particular praise for Jennifer Connelly. She is a beautiful girl who goes to hell, a tragic waste so common in real life. And that's the point of this film. It's all too real for comfort. I don't know when I'll be able to watch this magnificent film again, but I know I will have to.

","Frequently cited as an anti-drug movie, ""Requiem"" is really a movie about the dark side of the American Dream. All four leads want to attain something in life; appearing on a game show, opening a boutique, stop ""scuffling"", etc. The common thread is that none of them has any commitment to doing the hard work that most of us associate with the attainment of life's goals. This theme is introduced and repeated in the film's central metaphor, the juice commercial. Ironically, we are introduced to the commercial as the mother, addicted to her TV, watches over and over. While the infomercial promises that all can be accomplished in three easy steps (i.e, the shortcut which is central to all the mistakes that all the characters make), in telling fashion, we never learn the third step, which, of course, does not exist, just as success is not a 1, 2, 3 process. Lacking any commitment that would help them attain their goals, all the characters start to (or continue) using and/or dealing drugs to get them to their goals as quickly as possible. Eventually, they all wind up destroying their lives through a series of bad decisions which stem from drug use but are BASED on a total lack of commitment by the characters to do what is necessary instead of expedient. Ultimately, all wind up institutionalized except Jennifer Connelly, who self-destructs so far that she winds up performing degenerate sex acts to stay high. In the film's cruelest irony, she becomes the greatest ""prisoner"" of all. This is a brilliant movie at every level. The acting is superb, the direction is great as is the screenplay and other cinematic elements. This was really the best movie of 2000 but the subject matter was too tough for the voters. Do not underestimate how complex this movie is. I'm still talking about it 4 years later."

","Darren Aranofsky´s Requiem for a Dream is one of the most forceful anti-drug narratives ever to be committed to celluloid. It´s a basic fairly tale, but the perfect combo of writer/director Aranofsky´s direction makes this one impossible not to watch. This is not a film for people weak of mind or soul. Aranofsky, who rocketed to fame with his first indie film, Pi (one of the strangest film I have ever seen), is not afraid to take chances, and this film represents a big one. He takes his camera and makes it his weapon: he uses fast and slow motion and he runs a lot of times a 10 second chain of quick cuts from unwrapping the drug till a character gets a high. I really think that every actor with a major role in this film is an artist in the truest sense of the word. Each of them is shown in a state of physical and mental degradation. The action is strong, and the dialoque real.<br/><br/>The movie starts slowly, introducing each of the characters and establishing their relationships. Everyone in this film has their own dreams. The central figure is Harry (Jared Leto), a young man who lives hand-to-mouth because nearly every cent he saves, earns or steals goes towards buying something he can inject into his veins. His best friend and business partner is Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) who shares many of Harry´s aspirations. His girlfriend is Marion (Jennifer Connelly), who, like Harry and Tyrone, is an addict. The fourth significant player is Harry´s widowed mother, Sara (Ellen Burstyn), who is as addicted to television as Harry is to drugs. The spiral of all consuming addiction is what Arasnofsky has captured with great effectiveness. This spiral ends in the 15 brilliant last minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream, in my opinion the best film of 2000, is hard to watch but impossible to look away: it gets under your skin and stays there."

","Requiem-Mass for the souls of the dead<br/><br/>Dreams<br/><br/>Requiem For a Dream is not only a movie about drugs, but a movie about dreams and the inherent loss of those dreams. Dreams run rampat throughout each characters life and exclude none. We see Harry's dream of wanting to marry the love of his life and make it to the 'big time'. His love, Marion, has the dream to one day own a clothing line or shop of some sort. This dream is seemingly going to be supplied by the selling of drugs but is in actuallity takin away by this devastating habit. The way the movie painstakingly presents these two dreams makes the audience immediatly relate to the characters on a deep level. These dreams are held by many people and this movie succeeds tremendously on the level of making this movie appeal to the vast majority.<br/><br/>Sara(Ellen Burnstyn) presents the viewer with her dream to be on television. This dream is caused by the intrinsic notion for acceptance by not only herself but from other people. Tyron(Marlon Wayans) dreams are induced by his childhood rollmodel, his mother. Again all dreams that instantly hook the viewer with its glaring reality.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie the dreams are presented as a mirage and only that. In comes the harsh reality of drug use and the murder that insues. Not the murder of a person but of a dream. The way this movie presents the decay is realistic in every way and presents the viewer with the harsh reality that drug ensues on its victims. A killer of dreams.<br/><br/>Form<br/><br/>This flick encorporates many different elements taken out of thin air by the awe-inspiring Darren Aronofsky. With every frame the viewer recieves a new mood ranging from pure utopia to complete chaos. The scene that comes to mind is Marion in the bathroom. She is initially undrugged and normal. Somehow this shot makes the viewer feel normal. Then it cuts to a utopic shot where the viewer is incorporated into the drugged out state of mind.<br/><br/>The film brillantly blends the chaotic form with the unscathed at the beginning and slowly goes to pure pandamonium. At the beggininng Aronofsky sprinkles a little bit of turmoil into an otherwise unchaotic movie. This is how,in reality, the use of drugs begins. This is why so many get hooked and the way that thhis movie uses the frames to elaborate on this is beautiful.<br/><br/>The climax of this story is done to perfection. We go from each story as they get more chaotic. As the commotion builds the movie goes from scene to scene more quickly until they all intertwine into one climax.<br/><br/>(as I am new to the world of movies and know little about form and such, I will not elaborate any further)<br/><br/>Acting<br/><br/>Ellen Burnstyn is the gem in this catagory. You never feel that this is an acting job, but rather a reality especially in her drug-induced speed frenzies. She potrays her character very well at all times, from her beggining as a scared but loving and lonely parent. To her days of desperation as a drug addict with a broken dream. The viewer always feels her loneliness and desperation to be back where she once was.<br/><br/>10/10"
"psikill","9","1","2","7 April 2004"," This Film Is Probably The Best Campaign Against Drugs...
","`Requiem For A Dream' is a realistic film about drugs, what they can do to a person, and how they destroy their lives, their dreams, their plans, everything. Darren Aronofsky does an excellent work, surely his best until now. And, `Requiem' is probably the best of its genre, and the most realistic I've ever seen. It tells the story of four lives, each with their own addictions to drugs, and how they start to go down the drain as the months passes and as the story progresses.<br/><br/>Spoilers `Requiem For A Dream' is a simple story. It involves the lives of four people, Harold (Jared Leto), Marion (Jennifer Connely), Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and Mrs. Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Harold's mother. As the story starts, Aronofsky introduces us to the characters, what are they addictions, their daily behavior, how they interact with people, their dreams, aspirations, etc. Harold and Tyrone are partners in the drug business, and they start doing business on the streets, consequently the money comes rolling in. They consume it, they sell it, and they buy it. Meanwhile, Mrs. Goldfarb receives a call, a call that says that she is soon to be appearing on her favorite TV show. She thinks the call is a prank call, to cheat her, but, with full of hope and simplicity, she decides to trust in the person on the other side of the line. As the opportunity to appear in a TV program becomes more real, she decides to get thinner, entering also, in a world of drugs. A different kind of drugs, but one as dangerous as the ones her son, Harold, was consuming. As the months pass, passing from Summer to Winter, their state of mind and physical appearance start to decrease. The addiction to drugs starts to increase. The number of drugs in the city is constantly decreasing. This factor takes Tyrone and Harold to Philadelphia to buy some new drugs, but as they arrive there, they don't expect what's waiting for them. Marion is the most addicted, she can't live without drugs. She decides to get drugs through other means. Mrs. Goldfarb starts to get annoyed by the fact that the TV program doesn't get back to her, and eventually her mind starts getting tired. The consequences of these actions and behavior are the most realistic and spine-chilling I've ever seen. End of Spoilers<br/><br/>`Requiem' is marked, mainly, by its morbid direction. Darren Aronofsky has done a fantastic job. He uses quick shots to represent the use of drugs, to demonstrate how the drugs affect the brain: it's quick. The visuals of the film are absolutely spectacular. I've never seen nothing like that. I had already seen `Pi', and the direction of it isn't much different than `Requiem', but, either way, I was absolutely astonished. The acting is very realistic, specially Ellen Burstyn's. I know many people have said this, but it doesn't hurt saying it again: best performance since `The Exorcist', she should have won the Oscar, surely. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connely are perfect, portraying the teen couple, who are deeply in love, but unfortunately, are addicted to drugs. Marlon Wayans has his best performance of all time as Tyrone C. Love(jumps from `Scary Movie' to the best film he has ever done). The plot is very absorbing and, without a doubt, thought-provoking. Along with the direction, the score by Clint Mansell cooperating with The   , is one of the best in the movie industry. It was as absorbing as the plot. Absolutely magnificent. Great soundtrack.<br/><br/>Finally, `Requiem For A Dream' is the best film I've ever seen about drugs, and the most realistic. After seeing this one, you'll see the world of drugs with another perspective. Either you'll like it, or you won't. Are you the kind of person that accepts reality as it is, or, are you the kind of person that just wants to ignore it? One thing's for sure, it will definitely raise in you quite a number of moral issues.<br/><br/>PsIKiLL's Rating: 9/10"
"hans_damm","Null","1","2","5 April 2004"," Visually stunning and highly provocative (an interpretation of the film)
","[Tiny spoilers; won´t ruin the film]<br/><br/>One thing has to be said about the film-making of Aronofsky; he is constantly in pursuit of fulfilling his own dreams when it comes to the cinematographic issues of this film. Requiem is so unlike any of its predecessors in drug films. He has twisted the issues of the ideal drug film and has put together a highly provocative film that shatters the idea of the American Dream; hence the title of the film. So don´t have the idea that this film solely pictures the outcasts of the American society, namely the drug addicts, because it tries to picture addiction as a phenomenom in any way that it can be defined. I think this personel quote of Aronofsky sums up the key issues of this film well: - ""I try to live my life where I end up at a point where I have no regrets. So I try to choose the road that I have the most passion on because then you can never really blame yourself for making the wrong choices. You can always say you're following your passion.""<br/><br/>Although each protagonist in this film experience the Fall of mankind (as experienced by Adam & Eve) as a result of their individual fatal indulgences, the paths taken by the protagonists are in relation to their uncontrollable passions which render the lives of the protagonists non-regrettable. As Aronofsky puts it; if you choose the path with the most passion, then you can never blame yourself because every other possible path would have yielded less passion. This key element in the film is shown at the end, where each person have completed the Fall and is in a state of sin but still has a smile on their face. And the corporeal changes of the protagonists are similar to the ones seen in the Passion of Jesus. Here are the similarities: 1) In the film, Sarah's hair and face is ruined which is similar to the fact that Jesus wears a crown of thorns. 2) Tyrone ends up in jail which is a loss of liberty similar to Jesus who was crucified. 3) Harry's arm is amputated. The big inflammation was caused by needles in the same way that Jesus was nailed to the cross. 4) Marion disgraced her body because she succumbed to her drug abuse and had to sell her body for drugs. This humiliation is similar to that fact that Jesus was cruficied on a hill so everyone could see him in the most humiliating position. <br/><br/>Maybe I have overinterpreted the film but the similarities are striking. And Aronofsky grew up in Brooklyn, NY (the film takes place here) so he knows of this urban alienation that threatens to overthrow everyone who gives in to their passions and follows the passionate path that is attractive, yet deceitful. And Aronofsky gives us the proof through Sarah Goldfarb: ""Every nobody dreams of being a somebody, not just anybody."""

","To be honest, Requiem for a Dream is not a great movie. Especially in the beginning it is very weird at times and one cannot really say that it is exciting or entertaining. What one can say with certainty though, is that it is at all times interesting and that it remains above mediocrity at all times. The sad thing about this film is, that the distortions our addict friends' go through, do not always work in the films pace and sometimes they do the film more wrong than right. What makes this otherwise only' OK movie, worth watching in the end though, is a great and disturbing finale, which will make you remember this film for a long time after you have seen it. In the case of Requiem for a Dream, the ending definitely made the film, which as a whole might be an interesting character study for some and possibly great prevention for anyone who thinks about taking drugs. If you like these kind of films I can recommend Bully and Irreversible to you, which I thought were both better than this one. But then again, you could also try Memento, which is even more over-rated on IMDB, than this film. Requiem for gets a Dream 8,5 out of 10 ranking at # 46 and Memento gets a 8,7 ranking at # 14 in the IMDB top 250. My guess is that these two films are that high in the top 250, because the ending of a film, is the last thing you see and the endings of those films really stick around in your head and in Requiem's case it is really a top notch ending. But people, let us NOT forget that the rest wasn't too great and that a great ending alone does not make a great film.<br/><br/>

","If you're impressed by this film...its because you've never been on the wrong side of the tracks. This is a movie by outsiders for outsiders.<br/><br/>Despite a promising first scene, its ignorance was frankly jaw dropping. For instance, without revealing anything of the plot...you don't get 'promoted' by drug dealers, it doesn't work like that. Career dealers sell as much as they can and buy as much as they can afford. Likewise, the scene in the supermarket store room where the dealer turns up in a lorry to sell his wares to a crowd of smaller dealers - obscenely ridiculous.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie really comes down to the fact that they didn't do their homework properly. Its not a case of artistic license - since a more informed film would have considerably more powerful.  Requiem's author, Hubert Selby Jr - freely admits that the sum total of his own first hand, personal experience of skag was that he used to 'see' them across 'a' street thirty years ago. He wrote Requiem in 6 weeks. Draw your own conclusions....<br/><br/>If want to know what smacks really like, then you want to watch and read Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh and Junky by William Burroughs, both long term addicts. The truth of life on heroin is considerably more horrific and its underlying causes fundamentally more complex than this something as contrived and ill-informed could ever serve to demonstrate.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you want to hear the prejudiced views of people with absolutely no personal experience of heroin or its addicts....this is the film for you!"

","*Possible Spoilers* This film was so hyped up that I (stupidly) bought it without renting it first. I figured that any film about the horrors of addiction had to be worth buying, especially considering the amazing reviews that this ""movie"" had received. Boy did I make a mistake. After sitting through the first hour of this ""movie"", I couldnt wait for it to be over. Don't get me wrong, the film displayed a genuine moral message, that addictions, no matter what form, are destructive. Yet I found the overtone of the film to be far more hellish than the reality that we live in. For instance, the doctor who gave the speed to Sarah (the old woman) was totally indifferent to the fact that the pills he gave her were causing psychotic reactions and were highly addictive. And when Harry went to the hospital after his arm had become severely infected, the doctor didn't give a s**t that Harry was near death, he called the  police without treating him first. The doctor acted like he'd never seen dying smack addict before. It was entirely unbelievable and frustrating. The scene in which Marion was performing for all of those businessmen was absurd. She f*cked another woman in front of dozens of cheering perverted businessmen just for a fix. This scene contained just one of many generalizations that the movie established, such as: all businessmen are greedy testosterone driven rapists, all doctors are out to get your money, and don't give two s***s about you, and all drug addicts will either end up in prison, resort to prostitution, or spend the rest of their lives in a psych ward after failed shock therapy, which by the way is rarely ,if ever used any more. The movie offered no alternate endings or situations that suggest positive solutions to overcoming addictions. This movie screamed ""IF YOU DO DRUGS YOU WILL DIE!!!"" at the viewer. Now I'm no drug advocate, but give me a break. The movie might as well have consisted of God coming down from the heavens and pitching all drug users into the fires of hell. Its propaganda either way.<br/><br/>In summary, highly overrated, and way too far fetched to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>4/10, just for trying."

","***SPOILER ALERT*** Dark and gruesome but at the same time extremely realistic movie about the use and addiction to drugs both legal and illegal and the tragic results to those involved. The movie ""Requiem for a Dream"" doesn't take place in the ghettos of the inner cities that we're used to seeing stories like this but in the middle-class and mostly Jewish neighborhood of Conley Island in Brooklyn NY. <br/><br/>The story of ""Requiem for a Dream"" centers around four people, Sara, Eilen Byrson, her son Harry, Jared Leto, his girlfriend Marion, Jennifer Connelly, and Harry's best friend Tyrone, Marlon Wayans. Sara lives by herself with her son Harry in a high rise apartment in Conley Island. Widowed she watches TV and wants to be a contestant on a show that she loves but feels that she's too heavy and not attractive looking enough to be on TV and have all her friends see her. <br/><br/>Sara's son Harry is a local neighborhood hustler who steals TV's or whatever else he can get his hands on to make some money to get himself through the day. Harry's girlfriend Marion seems to come from a good family but she's in love with Harry and as we all know that ""Love is Blind"". Marion doesn't seem to care what Harry is doing and where he might well end up, she just want's to be with him, and feels that they both together will somehow make a go of their lives because Harry has a good mind for business and will work himself up the ladder at whatever vocation he takes up. <br/><br/>One day Harry's best friend Tayrone comes up with an idea that they can all make lot's of money by selling drugs and that he has a connection that will get them started in the venture. Meanwhile Harry's mom Sara gets a reply to an application that she sent to the TV show that she watches all day and night that she's been accepted to be on the show as a contestant. Sara starts trying to lose weigh by taking pills that she buys over the counter or what her doctor prescribes to her and in no time all she becomes addicted to them. <br/><br/>Harry Tyrone as well as Marion at first are making big money in their drug business but after a while with the threat of the police as well as other rivals drug dealers, and not to mention the addicts that they deal with, their drug business starts to dry up. Before long all three like most drug dealers also become addicted to the very drugs that they were selling.<br/><br/>Darren Aronosfsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" is one of the most depressing as well as realistic movies about urban life in regards to drug addiction that's ever been filmed. I have to remind the readers that it takes a very strong stomach to be able to sit through and watch the movie. In the end we see what drugs can do the the human mind body and spirit and it isn't very pretty. <br/><br/>Hollywood has come a long way in the making of movies about drug addiction since the Frank Sinatra Film ""Man with the Golden Arm"" back in 1955. ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a movie everyone should see regardless of it's really disturbing bleak and down right pit-in-hell ending. If it were made back in 1955 when ""Man with the Golden Arm"" was released and if millions of people saw it back then the drug problems of today would be a hell of a lot smaller."

","I was expecting this film to be a little bit better, considering its rated like #25 in the 250, but all it really was is a bunch of repeated disturbing images that take front seat to the interesting storyline.  Ellen Burstyn plays an elderly Brooklyn woman who becomes addicted to diet pills, and fantasizes her own dream world, at the same time her distant son(Jared Leto) is having his own drug problems.  The repeated visuals are very weird and are bound to stay in your memory for a long time.  The only real reason to see this film is to see a really weird, and somewhat visually fascinating film.  I cant give it any more than a 6/10."

Among other scene, the blood splashing on Harry's face when they amputate his arm will haunt me forever. A couple of movies tried to tackle the drugs issue by showing users slowly declining into total addiction which leads to death or insanity, for example Trainspotting and Basketball Diaries, but Requime is the only one to show you exactly how bad it can get without the ""feel good"" ending. All I can say is ""wow""..."

","Yeah, this movie made me want to kill myself.  It was VERY effective in gaining my empathic support such that suicide seemed like the only viable option for most of the characters by the end of the movie.  There was no glimmer of hope for any of the characters by movie's end except for the sweet escape of death.  This movie certainly would put the brakes on any would-be drug abuser, still young and impressionable.  That, especially if you gently fibbed that the movie was based on true events.  I think they'd stop their drug use with a dead halt (along with considerable counseling and support, of course).  Anyway, off my soapbox on that point I must say I'd not rate this movie very highly.  I'm torn, on the one hand it should be seen by *some* people, on the other it shouldn't be seen at all.  So if you're a burnt out highschool student looking to drugs for support, I'd give it a 9/10.  If you're a normal, every day Joe-Blow looking for some kicks, look somewhere else, 5/10."
"sketchups","10","1","2","24 August 2003"," I just bought it today...
","And I am counting down the minutes until tomorrow, when I can get rid of it again.<br/><br/>I found Requiem For A Dream to be more like a documentary than a film, in the way of the lighting, the cuts, and the overall feel of it. The acting is superb, and cannot be faulted, particularly Ellen Burstyn's.<br/><br/>
The reason I didn't like this film was because of the way the cuts were used. I can see why they were used in the way they were, but I felt that at times they got in the way a little bit, almost as if instead of more scenes the director just decided to fill up the time with lots of cutting of short scenes which seemed to be almost the same every time. Because of this, I felt it got boring.<br/><br/>Also I felt there was a slight lack of explaination in the film as to why the people got hooked on drugs in the first place, with the exception of Ellen Burstyn's character. I understand that in some films, explainations are not always necessary, but I feel that more explaination would have worked better in this film.<br/><br/>The plot itself isn't overly complex, but I felt some things were hard to follow, though this could just be that in some scenes the score was louder than the people talking. Because of this, some parts can be very boring, as the viewer does not know how that scene came about, or what the actors are saying in the scene.<br/><br/>Overall the film is well acted, but incredibly extremely boring. Watch it only to admire Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto's acting abilities.<br/><br/>

"bgood26","7","1","2","17 August 2003"," Shattered Dreams
","""Requiem for a Dream"" is written to scare the hell out of anyone who even thinks of using drugs.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn was Oscar worthy as Sara, the lonely Jewish mother who passes time by watching TV and talking to the other old Jewish women on her block in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. She's important to no one until she receives a mysterious call telling her she's going to be on TV. She finds a red dress that she hasn't worn in years and no longer fits into. She sees her doctor, who prescribes weight-loss stimulants. She quickly becomes addicted to both TV and the pills, begins hallucinating, and eventually suffers full-blown schizophrenia.<br/><br/>Jared Leto is Sara's son Harry. His drugs of choice are marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. He and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) score and distribute the drugs around the Coney Island-Brighton Beach area. (Wayans is an ironic choice, as he is pro-drug and thinks addiction is something to joke about, as evidenced by his ""Scary Movie."")<br/><br/>The incredibly beautiful and talented Jennifer Connelly is Marion, Harry's girlfriend. She gets hooked almost immediately, and her dire need of future fixes is rough. But her frantic search for drugs around the apartment mid-way through the film is gut-wrenching.<br/><br/>My main problem with the movie is this: Am I supposed to feel sorry for these three cokeheads? Because I don't. Unlike Sara, whose ethically challenged doctor prescribed her addictive drugs, they made a conscious decision to use. In a way, they got what they deserved. My other problem is that I did not need the extreme closeups of dilating eyes, popping pills, coke snorts, and nickle bags being zip-locked. The sound effects got really annoying too. I got the hint the first time around; they didn't need to repeat it a dozen times. <br/><br/>The end of this film is absolutely brutal. Addiction defeats all of the characters in different ways; they all suffer different fates, all horrible."
"Sara_Golfarbs_fate","10","1","2","2 August 2003"," Very intense, very beautiful and impressively thought-provoking. I wish I had a stone in stead of my heart!!!
","When I was surfing on the internet, I have seen a article about the most 25 disturbing films of all time .. And this movie was one of them along with counterparts such as Dancer in the Dark, Eraserhead, Salo, Bad Lieutenant etc. As you might have probably understood, those movies are not so pleasant to watch. Anyways, when I was in a Blockbuster in Boston, I have seen RFAD and I have remembered it from that site. I have rented the unrated uncut version and went back to my dorm, I immediately put it in my VCR. To be honest, before watching it, I didn't expect to much because the tagline says ' the downward spiral of for people because of drugs'. I thought this was another junkie movie. Boy was I wrong. When the last credits started to roll. I was in a state of shock. All I could do is to call my mom in Turkey at 2AM and sobbing like a baby for 35 minutes.<br/><br/>This can give you the idea. I consider my self as a pretty jaded person and I am not easily affected by movies(Except Schindler's list because I am jewish). But in RFAD's case this is not true. From my Perspective, This movie is THE BEST again THE BEST movie that has ever been put on celluloid, BY FAR. Never once in life before have I seen a gut-wrentching, heart-shattering and horrifying movie like this. This movie is a sad tragedy. The level of its tragedy can be just equaled by King Lear or Macbeth.<br/><br/>MILD SPOILERS BELOW!!!The movie is about four human-beings. Sara Golfarb, His son, son's friend, and son's lover. The mother is a lonely old women who wants to be on television but to make it real she should fit into her ostentatious red dress. The son Harry and his girl friend Marion are junkies whose major dream is to open a fashion store and Harry's friend Tyrone is also a junkie who wants to be a 'somebody' to reach happiness. But their goals were bullied by their addictions and as the movie goes ahead we see the hell got broke loose.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the film by telling the significant details of it but what I have to say is this is the most intense, realistic, horrifying journey that I have ever attampted to join. If you are a human, than there is no way that you cannot be affected by this flick. Especially the last 20 minute montage of this film is so powerful and so sad that a faint of heart or a squemish may want to throw himself from the window. But this shouldn't fool you because although it is not a pleasant film to watch, this doesn't mean that it is bad infact for me it is the best film of all time as I mentioned numerously.<br/><br/>The cinematic aspects of this film are no less then spectacular. The acting is the best one could ever attempt to see. I meant the ensemble cast but Ellen Burstyn steals the show as the desperate lonely mother. Giving the Oscar to Julia Roberts in stead of Ellen Burstyn is a laugh riot. The other actor are also more than amazing. They should have gotten at least an Academy Award nomination but who are we kidding ha!!!. The cinematography is one of the best, the directing and film editing is simply groundbreaking with hip-hop montages, split screens, reverse angels and close ups. A solid script and The most haunting score that has never been listened to since Schindler's list. The score perfectly matches with the progression of the movie infact it may be the third crucial element to make this movie the best of motion picture history, after the acting and the directing.<br/><br/>
Also the movie deeply focuses of the weak parts of the American society. For me The T.V and show obsession of Sara Goldfarb is a reflection of the entertainment obsessed Americans. MILD SPOILER HERE!!! When Sara went to the Diet Doctor to complain about the diet pills, doctor just didn't pay attention to Sara and said she will be allright. For me it symbolizes the isolation of American people from others. Also the loneliness of Sara is very American because I don't know a nation except Americans that the people just have to rely on themselves so much that they plan to be alone. As an individual in life Americans are pathetically lonely. And Tyrone's case. MILD SPOILER HERE!!! When Tyrone was dreaming of his childhood he said to his mom that one day he is gonna be a big man. I think that sentence was put intentionally in the film to criticise that America is also a success obsessed nation that emposes 'if you are not somebody, than you are nobody' ideology to its citizens END OF THE MILD SPOILER!!!. And these seperate things are perfectly matching with the sub plots of RFAD.<br/><br/>
Overall, This is the best film of the cinema history. Also very provacative and thought-provoking about learning the darker side of American culture by its critisizations. RFAD should have gotten 12 Oscar for Best Picture, Best Director(Darren Aronofsky), Best Actress in a leading role(Ellen Burstyn), Best Actor in a Leading Role(Jared Leto), Best Actress in a supporting role(Jennifer Conelly), Best Actor in a supporting role(Marlon Wayans), Best Original Score(Clint Mansell and the Kronos quartet). Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound an Best Sound editing but thanks to the blatant hypocrasy of the beloved Academy. Also this is a very harsh movie that never loses the high level of emotion while viewing more than once. I have watched it 18 times so far and every time I watch it I pray to have a stone in stead of my heart for not being heavily affected. Thank god for letting me to witness the zenith of cinematic beauty at the age of 20.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1 to 10, this movie is 1.000.000.000.000/10"

","Do you know someone who think drugs are cool?  Let them check this movie out.<br/><br/>This is not propaganda against drugs... this is a fist right between your eyes, and it got R-E-A-L written on the knuckles.  There is no preaching, no silly sentence, only raw brutal consequence communicated in one of the most technically brilliant ways I've seen in a long, long time.<br/><br/>I've never used drugs, and I hope I never will (hell no after seeing what it did to these people!), but of all movies I've seen depicting the drug-subject this one is the closest to reality.  Not only does it give you a feeling for what shooting up or snorting may actually feel like, it shows you what happens to your life...<br/><br/>None of the characters are dumb.  I usually yell at stupid characters, thin reasons or incoherent reactions but this movie had me growling only once. Now afterwards I have to admit, a movie on drugs with no characters with risk behavior would just... turn out to nothing.<br/><br/>These are people just like you and me, and just like you and me they are trying to fulfill their dream.  Dreaming is not bad.  But this movie shows us everything depends on what way we choose to pursue that dream, and as we all suspect, the short-cut turns out to be the long way home.<br/><br/>I seriously recommend you to see this movie, at least if you are looking for something that will kick your mind and heart into motion.  Yes this movie is a bit like getting waked up by someone throwing a bucket of ice cold water into your face, but hey!  Waking up is a good thing!<br/><br/>I give this move a 10 out of 10."
"Son_of_Mansfield","10","1","2","14 July 2003"," I have a serious problem with this movie.
","Warning: long winded, incoherent, and maybe some spoilers as well.<br/><br/>I have never done drugs before, but that does not matter. This movie is not drugs. If anything, this movie is about obsession. Marlon Wayons needs to be important, Jared Leto wants everyone else to be happy, Jennifer Connelly craves sensation, and Ellen Burstyn yearns for attention. The drugs are merely a means to an end. <br/><br/>The saddest aspect of this movie is the fact that you will try hard to deny the possibility of the events in it, but you can not. This could be reality for someone. Anyone who does not believe that only needs to watch the news. ""Woman hits man, drives home with him in the windshield, and leaves him in the garage to die. Every once in a while peeking in to say that she is sorry."" ""Man molests eleven year old girl in department store. He dressed as a security guard and took her to a remote area, when too many people came to that area, he found another and molested her a second time."" ""Grandmother poisons granddaughter, because she felt that she wasn't being paid enough attention by the child's parents. The woman put large amounts of sugar into the baby's formula and escaped before she could be captured. The child had a seizure and died."" <br/><br/>With these kinds of events happening daily, this movie's realism is in question. Why would Harry not go to the hospital if his arm was infected? Why would they get arrested for finally going to the hospital? Why didn't Sara just eat? Your answer is always the same, HOLLYWOOODIZATION! That would never happen in real life. I would never do that. One day in high school, a friend of mine got into a fight and shouted ""I don't want to deal with any more of this petty high school bulls**t!"" I remember thinking, welcome to the real world, where people do anything and everything to hurt themselves and each other. It is not possible that Harry hoped it would go away, or wanted to help everyone else before himself, or that he did not even think about it at all. The doctor in the hospital took the medicine out of the room that Harry was in. He probably called the police to tell them that junkies came to steal from the hospital. As for Sara I haven't a clue, but I still can not figure out what went through those people's heads from the headlines above. Does that make them any less real?<br/><br/>I like this movie, because I can relate to it. Sara reminds me of my mother and I am almost dead on Harry. I knew some Marions and Tyrones in school. For me this movie is all too real."

It has an almost perfect direction and outstanding performances. All the actors were pushed to their limits, doing their very best. And Ellen Burnstyn, shows that she was cheated-out in almost every acting award in 2000.<br/><br/>This film is ""A Clockwork Orange"" for our generation. It shows things that hardly anyone had the guts to show before (in so crude way, anyway). And just like the author of ""A Clockwork..."" could be seen as a genius after ""A Clockwork..."",""Requiem..."" talks more about Darren Aronofsky, than drug itself. It talks about a risky and creative director(probably the best of his generation), who could break cinema rules, and expand them in the future.<br/><br/>Why did the Academy praise ""A Clockwork Orange"", and almost ignore ""Requiem..."", if they are both very controversial? Well, ""A Clockwork..."" is set in a distant future, in England. And ""Requiem.."" is set in the US, right here and right now. It shatters the American Dream. But unlike ""American Beauty"" there's no hope for ANYONE here. Although I think that the VERY LAST SCENE in ""Requiem..."", it's a little tiny spark of HOPE.And as violence, HOPE is part of our human nature too.<br/><br/>Enjoy (or Be shocked by) this instant classic."

Style of a director is astonishing. The way he puts emotions in the scenes whit close-up pictures and fast cutting which is bay the way made excellently. Sounds are excellent - specially those during the fast cutting scenes - and music makes the emotional charge of this movie very powerful. Actors - specially Ellen Burstyn - are giving everything they have. They all fit perfectly for their roles and all of them can picture the suffering of a drug addict like their role requires. Burstyn carries out her really hard role work perfectly. Viewer feels sorry for her because she only wanted to lose some weight. Even Marlon Wayans, who is not that good actor, brings out his suffering. I can't believe this is the same guy that was in Dungeons and Dragons. Movie shows what drugs do to us. Relationships brake down, you become sick, you have to do things you don't want to, you run out of money and you always need more drugs and getting loose of them is extremely hard and heavy."
"senor_herer","10","1","2","2 March 2003"," As intense as films get ...
","Now this is film making.<br/><br/>Like others who have posted comments, I find that only a tiny minority of films have the power to affect me on an emotional level. Films like Schindler's List, Man Bites Dog, Shawshank Redemption, A Clockwork Orange, Hana-bi and even Cannibal Holocaust are some notable movies that have pressed my emotional buttons in the past and have left me thinking long after the end credits have finished. Requiem for a Dream is another to add to the list and is honestly one of the most powerful movies that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Does the fact that a film tugs at your emotions automatically make it good? For me personally the answer is yes, especially as I'd estimate that way less than 1% of all the movies I've ever seen were able to reach me on any sort of real emotional level (be it good or bad). However, this is far from being the only reason I rate this film so highly.<br/><br/>Many people find Requiem's ostensibly anti-drug message rather patronising. Some posts here even associate Requiem, unfairly, with crude propaganda films like Reefer Madness. I think this demonstrates an overly simplistic view of a film that is about much more than illegal drugs and I feel it is representative, understandably, of the attitudes of people who are so sick of society's hypocritical moralising about drugs that they have just stopped listening and hence dismiss the movie too lightly. To associate RFAD with Reefer Madness seems to demonstrate precisely the same sort of unthinking intransigence that we routinely associate with anti-drug zealots. However, whilst I sympathise with those who believe Requiem is just more patronising anti-drug propaganda, they are overlooking the incredible damage that the irrational, compulsive and addictive behaviour shown in the film can cause - be it in respect of heroin, caffeine, television, chocolate, shopping, anti-depressants, use of their mobile etc. etc.  Self deception is at the heart of this issue and I think these polarised comments arise from an unwillingness on the part of the viewer to allow the necessary introspection required to get the most from this film.<br/><br/>On the other side of the coin, I have also heard comments from people suggesting that this film has added weight to their commitment to never use drugs and that anyone who does must be a fool. This is a somewhat naÃ¯ve perspective and the same people who condemn drug use are almost certainly reliant on some `drug' of choice, be it coffee, sugar, pain-killers, anti-depressants, Jesus or whatever. I agree with these commentators that RFAD would be far more effective used in schools as a warning against the dangers of drugs than the patronising rubbish that currently passes as `drug education'. However to consider this film useful only as an anti-drug movie to scare kids into compliance is to greatly underestimate the reasons people start using these substances in the first place. After all, some people will always be attracted to drugs precisely BECAUSE of the dangers (and cachet) associated with their use.<br/><br/>I also wish that the people who spend their time pointing out, for example, that ECT is normally used only on anaesthetised patients would save their nit-picking for the crass historical revisionism of films like Black Hawk Down or U-571 rather than pointing out inconsistencies irrelevant to the message of a film. Is Ben Hur rendered garbage because of an overlooked wristwatch? I think not.<br/><br/>This is a movie that has something to say to EVERYBODY even if it is not on a topic explicitly covered by the on-screen mayhem. This is the sort of wake-up call we all need occasionally and watching with a smug `well, I've never used drugs' attitude is to miss the real point this film is trying to convey - that the obsessive reliance on any crutch, chemical, physical or emotional, in order to achieve the happiness we all crave is destined to end in disaster. This affects everybody on some level.<br/><br/>RFAD is ample demonstration of Aronofsky's undoubted talent as a film maker. I greatly enjoyed the director's debut Pi and Aronofsky has taken many of the techniques that he employed in that movie to the next level here. I can understand why some may feel that the film is style over substance. Personally though, I think this is one of the most technically impressive examples of film making and editing that I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>The performances of the four main characters are all magnificent and Burstyn in particular is incredible. I also enjoyed seeing the underrated Keith David provides a wonderfully sleazy performance even if he is limited to only a very minor role.<br/><br/>Special mention should also go to Clint Mansell's amazing soundtrack which adds immeasurably to the power of the film. From the sad, haunting main theme to the frenetic techno rumblings and staccato strings, the soundtrack is always a perfect accompaniment to the on screen drama. It is hardly original to ironically juxtapose a haunting and beautiful soundtrack with disturbing imagery in order to heighten the emotions of the viewer (the afore-mentioned Cannibal Holocaust being a perfect, if extreme, example of this) but here the soundtrack is employed to perfection.<br/><br/>This is an amazing movie - intense, gripping, disturbing, provocative and gruelling to endure. Despite being so emotionally draining, this is one of the best films I have seen in the past few years and is more than deserving of it's high IMDB ranking. However, this is not for the faint hearted or those who can only enjoy a film if it makes them feel good. For anyone else this is essential viewing.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see what Aronofsky comes up with next - let's just hope he doesn't get sucked into the system and turn into the latest Hollywood hack directing the sort of uninspiring, focus-group scripted tripe that the big studios are lamentably so good at churning out these days."

It begins with an optimistic phrase of the mother: ""I know everything will be all-right"" is like a dream that she hopes her son will get through his troubles, but she's about to discover that she will soon be overwhelmed by the same troubles. At the end, we see a mental and physically devastated Sarah, dreaming about her show on TV. It's so cruel. The direction, the performances, the edition and the music are spectacular. Very slow we see the disgrace growing in the life of the characters. The end is a supreme example of edition-story together for send a clear message, even an emotion: the fast cuts and scenes make you nauseas, while we see the four tragedies.

"doggert","10","1","2","1 December 2002"," How far are you willing to go to accomplish your dreams?
","This movie took me by a great surprise, i thought this was just a ordinary drama, and boy was i wrong. Let me just say this, you have to be psychologically prepared to see this movie. I've heard of some people that had to visit the bathroom after the movie (even during).<br/><br/>The movie has a ""innocent drug-life start' for Harry (Jared Leto), Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and Marion (Jennifer Connelly) - where they begin with simple weed-smoking. Something that won't hold for long (without having to say more).<br/><br/>Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) who plays the role extremely well, has a dream of being  famous, she has a dream of being _someone _, and begins to go pretty far to accomplish that, in this case by pill-abuse, something that causes hallucinations, angst, paranoia, addiction to the pills.<br/><br/>
The movie is incredibly well made, it shows the life of normal people and their dreams as well as desires for a better life. During the entire movie the music is emotional, depressive, and in a way discouraging.<br/><br/>
All i can say is see this movie a few hours after you have eaten. There are some very strong scenes with drug-abuse and sex.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is a movie that should be shown to teenagers that wish to experiment with drugs, (on the message board there is a post that says: `should be shown in school' - I quite agree!).<br/><br/>Once again, one of the best movies I've ever seen. 10 (++) out of 10"

I started at the beginning, with her as a sweet elderly women, then 5 seconds later, came to the end, as a ravaged, hideous, addict. I realized what a transformation she had to take her character through. I'm still furious that not only did she not win, but she lost to Julia Roberts. Gross.<br/><br/>I would like anyone who is ever considering doing drugs, or selling drugs, or anything that is involving drugs, you should see this film. It will make you think twice. It's an unnerving, disturbing, and simply beautiful piece of cinema. See it. See it even if you never plan on doing drugs in your life. See it. ****/****"

From the beginning (""WHY DO YOU MAKE ME DO THIS, MOM?"") to the nightmarish finale (the little grin on her face is too much for me), i found myself being drawn further and further into this seedy underbelly of modern tragedy. Flawless performances from the entire cast, esp. Burstyn, just add to the feeling of misery that gradually envelops you as you observe more depravity and self-torture.

"FlipperPA","10","1","2","9 August 2002"," Ugly. Hideous. Unwatchable. Beautiful.
","Darren Aronofsky is the best current director in the USA... with a runner up to M. Night Shyamalan.<br/><br/>This is one of the most unwatchable films I have ever seen. Not unwatchable, as in bad, but unwatchable, as in painful. Every moment of this film you keep wishing the despicable characters would not do what they're about to do, driving themselves farther into addiction. Why does the viewer wish the characters a better fate? Despite them being despicable, we see ourselves in the characters, and fall in love with this. This is a rare feat accomplished by Darren Aronofsky and the actors, especially Marlon Wayans. I remember saying ""Oh NO!"" when I caught this film at the underground theater (the Ritz 5, for the locals) in Philadelphia. However, Marlon Wayan proves here that... and this will shock some of you... he can ACT!<br/><br/>This is not to say Jared Leto or Jennifer Connelly were not fantastic - they were. However, Marlon is the true standout in the film. Aronofsky is amazing in his filming techniques, much like his colleague, Mr. Shyamalan. Both use camera techniques, close ups, and stories of horror and personal change to create dark, touching films.<br/><br/>Most of Americana believe that Shyamalan is the ""dark, intellectual"" director in America.<br/><br/>To them, I say ""Shyamalan is great... but have you seen Aronofsky?""<br/><br/>If you ever want to question your own past, present and future, your own mind, and the fabric of reality itself... watch Aronofsky. We all know that ""Pi"" skyrocketed him onto the film scene from pure obscurity.<br/><br/>In his first encounter with having a budget, he does the exact opposite than Kevin Smith.<br/><br/>Kevin Smith broke onto the scene with a black and white, low-budget film called ""Clerks."" Although his later, bigger budget films have been much better, he returned with the rather pedestrian ""Mallrats."" Funny, yes... but characters you care about? Depth? Texture? ""Mallrats"" had none of these.<br/><br/>Aronofsky, on the other hand, return from his black a white, low-budget effort, ""Pi"", with ""Requiem for a Dream."" This is one of the most powerful, ugly, hideous films ever made. This film should have made a splash at the oscars. Ellen Burstwyn is absolutely brilliant. Marlon Wayans should have been given a chance to act in the way Denzel Washington was after starring alongside Sean Connery. However, it was ignore by most of the mainstream.<br/><br/>Regardless of its mainstream reception, nothing can change the fact that this is one of the finest films ever... not for the faint of stomach or heart, but a must see.<br/><br/>As you can tell by my review, I rarely can watch this film beginning to end. Its too much. Its too good, too evil, too ugly. However, the fact that Darren Aronofsky has gotten all of this into one film - and a televangelist to boot - speaks volumes.<br/><br/>Never forget this anagram:<br/><br/>EVANGELIST - EVIL'S AGENT"

","This movie was interesting because of the story from Hubert Selby. And for the first hour it was thrilling to view. But then, some mistakes get clearer. It was wrong to cast Jennifer Connelly for this movie. She will always be an upper class girl, also when she is on H. It was annoying to saw her trying to look like a junkie. I think she was casted because she was an uprising star in hollywood. And every director wanted her to play in their movies. Or it was the guilt of her agent. Jared Leto fits much better for his role. He was so nervous right from the beginning, that it felt right to see his demolition. The camera also get boring after a hour. They repeated some scenes to often. The message was already made clear, but they repeated again and again the scene how to cook up heroin. And then, the cuts, were sometimes to fast. I know that this was chic at this time. But not everything which is chic fits to a story. And not every actor has to be casted because he or she will be a star. 5/10"

Also, the cinematography is uncanny and original, completing this piece.  The only criticism I have is Jennifer Connelly.

","It's surprising to see how many people are being duped by the director of this pretentiously and gratuitously violent film.  What the director offers are quick fixes of rapid fire imagery and viciously cut scenes without any need or opportunity for the audience to think hard or deeply about anything. Take,for example, his treatment of the character played by Jennifer Connelly. How is his degradation of that character any different than her debasement by the other men who exploit her for their cruel pleasure? The director consistently keeps his view of her ""objective"" in the literal sense of presenting her as an object -- upon which he projects his own fantasies of how an addicted woman would sell herself. Why doesn't he allow her to have any inner, believable life that could make her more real and make her conflicts more intense? (His objectification of her is so extensive that it feels at the end as if he is one of the men zeroing in on her pain to feed their horrifying pleasure.) Ellen B's character is more fully drawn, but even then, why does the director need multiple shots of electric shock treatment when one shot would show what she is feeling? The answer is that the director knows the fix his audience is seeking.  We say we're appalled, but we can't stop watching what the slick photography and postmodern soundtrack turn into the very kind of media-induced high that his movie supposedly is critiquing. Wake up, audiences, and try to think for yourselves. The best directors want us to do that; the worst are afraid of what will happen if we dare to do so."

"demathor","10","1","2","21 June 2002"," Masterpiece of modern tragic theater
","I have just seen this movie for the first time, after hearing many mixed comments about it. After seeing it, I agree that this movie is utterly unforgettable, and I believe it is indeed a masterpiece of modern theater.<br/><br/>The first thing that struck me about this movie was the title, 'Requiem for a Dream'  This is a seemingly ingenious, poetic title, which fits the movie perfectly.  As you probably know, the movie tells the tale of four drug-addicted teenagers trying to struggle their way through life and the depths of addiction.  It is the way in which the movie tells it that strikes the viewer, and instills an unforgettable and clear message.<br/><br/>Quite possibly the most disturbing thing about the movie is that most viewers can easily relate to one of the characters. As I was watching the movie, I could see myself (however terribly unlikely, but possible) becoming Harry.  I also could envision some people I know ending up like Marion or Tyrone. Sadly, I could also see my mother (although however unlikely) becoming much like Sarah Goldfarb.  I think this is because the individual personalities and dispositions of each of the characters is not particularly detailed, and we only get a general sketch of their behavior, which seems rather typical and not particularly unique to each character, but moreso typical to the type of person, age group, ethnicity, etc. that they are. This allows us to conceive a more broad perception of the characters, and relate them to ourselves or other people. The movie is a very realistic depiction of modern life, and the circumstances that befall the characters could easily occur in real life.  While the addiction might be somewhat exaggerated, medical conditions be unrealistic, and the behavior of some characters be also somewhat unrealistic, they all serve a function in relaying the main message of the film, and such errors are in my opinion, thus permissable.<br/><br/>There are some naysayers who believe that this movie is too intense, twisted, vivid and plain sick to deliver its message.  While I can relate to their viewpoint, as the movie is extremely harsh, I think that element is necessary to instill the full moral of the movie.  By viewing these gruesome and unforgettable images, and hearing this twisted tale, it makes us boldly remember the wisdom that the writer is trying to share with us.  It is a message about addiction, about the fall of people not so different than you or I, a modern day tragedy.<br/><br/>In short, this is a masterpiece of modern theater.  In recent times media, TV and film has pushed the limit of how far they could go in terms of being vulgar, gruesome, gory or violent.  It is only fitting that drama and tragedy also push this limit.  Requiem for a Dream is a modern tragedy that pushes the viewers psyche to the very limit, and bestows an unforgettable portrait of the downfall of people.<br/><br/>I highly recommend viewing this movie at least once, unless you are faint of heart. 10/10"
"Aidan McGuinness","10","1","2","21 June 2002"," Lament for a movie industry - films as good as this, are too rare
","Darren Aronofsky followed his bleak, but excellently innovative `Pi', with this light-hearted (sarcasm) movie about the lives of three friends - Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), Tyrone Love (Marlon Wayans) and Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn). The plot's fairly simple - Harry, Marion and Tyrone lead simple, no-end lives dabbling in drugs. They now have a chance to sell a new drug and lead happy, carefree lives. Meanwhile Sara is about to appear on her favourite TV show and decides to lose a little weight so she can fit into her favourite red dress to look her best. Just to help her along she tries out a few new diet pills so as to speed up the process. Unfortunately things don't work out for the best here (they really really don't work out).<br/><br/>There's a reason this movie is placed so highly on IMDB. It's because it deserves to. Firstly there's the acting - everyone is great. That's without exception. Despite this being a very challenging and difficult movie, the Academy still managed to favour Burstyn with an Oscar nomination - the descent of her character from normal caring mother, to a lonely, broken woman with one goal in her life is heart wrenching and astonishingly well portrayed. Leto's character descends from carefree into a ragged, desperate man, with Leto's slim figure and dark, almost skeletal visage, perfect for the role of drawn out druggie. Connolly's desperation and need for escapism from her world, and the lengths she is willing to go to do this, can make the stomach twist, and the soul wince - whether it's the dead look in her eyes as she gives herself up to buy more drugs, or the frightening blankness as she experiences the high, she demonstrates the skill that led her to the only deserved Oscar for the derivative `A Beautiful Mind'. Even Wayans, a comedian by trade, works well here as the member of the trio with the most soul, and the greatest chance of redemption from their lives.<br/><br/>As good as the acting is, it's Aronofsky's talent that makes the movie superb. Some people may glibly dismiss the style as `MTV' which implies pointless camera work - and that would be an unfair abrupt conclusion. Aronofsky does employ a lot of trickery - cameras mounted on bodies, split screens, his trade-mark `hip hop' montage, fast edits (the most edits per minute of any movie nearly), et cetera but to an actual aim: the techniques enhance the story telling, rather than detract from it. For example the `hip hop' montage is a particular rapid sequence used throughout the movie that alters at certain junctures to indicate a change in pace or mood. The various camera angles allow us to get in right on top of the character, and their pain, with searing intensity - we're not allowed escape from their suffering just because we're a viewer. Aronofsky makes us care because the movie isn't a passive viewing experience - the viewer is roped into the scenes. A word must be mentioned about the pacing and mood of the movie - it's excellently done. The movie is split into three acts, represented by seasons, which reflect the protagonist's situation. Each act is scored beautifully by the Kronos Quartet. As the movie progresses the pace picks up, and the mood darkens, cumulating in a shocking and utterly harrowing finale, that still sticks with me well over a year on.<br/><br/>
`Requiem for a Dream' is not an easy movie. It's challenging, harrowing, beautifully direct and acted. It's a movie that you will not forget after the movie because, unlike most of the produce of Hollywood today, it's filled with passion and innovation. It may have been over-looked by Hollywood but thankfully the reviewers here recognise it for the great piece that is. 100% recommended. 10/10."
"DahManDatWuzzinDare","10","1","2","19 June 2002"," A Disturbing Masterpiece of Modern filmmaking, no film has done a better job of depicting drug addiction.
","A lot of things have been said about this film (from the director of the mind-bending film, PI) but one word in particular comes to mind. Painful.  No other film has done a greater service to the issue of drug addiction.  Not only are the performances brilliant and emotionally distraught, but the images and sounds are authentic.  Edited Jay Rabinowitz has created some of the most disturbing visual montages the world of film has every seen.  Matthew Libatique does a fine job a cinematographer, infusing the frantic, distorted shots with Kubrickesque continuous shots which allow the view to breeze through the scenes like an orbiting spaceship.  Based on the book by cult novelist Hubert Selby, Jr. (whose novel Last Exit To Brooklyn was also turned into a film) Requiem For A Dream is a masterpiece, and one of my favorite all-time movies.<br/><br/>The story focuses on Harry Goldfard (Jared Leto) and heroin addict who steals his mothers electronics and pimps his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly.)  He spends most of his time with his buddy Tyrone (Marlon Wayans in a surprisingly dramatic performance) looking for ways to score and make it big in the drug game.  The scenes in which Tyrone and Harry sell drugs are make money are juxtaposed with Marion's prostitution, to create a strange ""good times"" sequence.  After witnessing a mafia hit, Tyrone and Harry are arrested and most of their money is taken away, so Marion starts seeing Arnold the Shrink (Sean Gulette, who starred in an co-wrote Aronofsky's debut Pi) and sleeping with him for money.  The scenes of illness and panic are shot in strange, distorted colors which add to the tone of the film.<br/><br/>Tyrone and Harry continue to search for that big score.  At the film continues, we start to learn how they ended up the way they are through flashbacks depicting traumatic childhood experiences.  The other big film of the year, Traffic, depicted drug use a casual activity engaged in by senator's daughters and punk private school kids, but Requiem For A Dream digs deeper.  The words of Hubert Selby are a perfect basis for a film of this magnitude, and Darren Aronofsky's creepy, symbolic stylings are a perfect match for the gritty pulp fiction of the book.  While it is the better perspective on drugs (that most addicts are incurable because they actually do drugs out of depression and as an emotional painkilling self-medicaiton.)<br/><br/>Harry's mother, Sarah (played by Ellen Burstyn in a painfully intense turn) has become addicted to speed pills, which she takes to lose weight after learning that she has the chance of being on a game show.  Soon she becomes obsessed with losing weight.  The more pills she takes the deeper she sinks into insanity, and the doctors give her more pills.  One day Harry comes to visit her to pay her back for the television and learns what she's become.  There's a very poignant scene at this point of the film in which Harry sits in the back of a cab crying after learning that his mother is an addict to.  While the cliched concepts you'll come across in films usually deal with parents not wanting their children to become addicts, the desperation of Harry is all the more realistic.<br/><br/>The twisted images and concepts that make up Sarah's world are the perfect contrast for Harry and Tyrone's gritty street life.  Sarah sits in front of a blank tv screen projecting herself into the game show over and over again like her brain is a VCR on loop.  Her social scene consists of the old maids of the building sitting out front in their lawns chairs chatting about each other's childrens and crowding around the mail man every time he comes by.  The crowning achievement of the film lies within the creepy speed-induced scenes (in which Aronofsky used fast motion.)  The images of Sarah cleaning every square inch in the house and reorganizing all her possesions.  Composer CLint Mansell is on a par with Carter Burwell for having made some of the creepiest films scores of the 90s.<br/><br/>With a infected abscess growing on his arm, Harry and Tyrone go on a trip to make more money.  When Harry sees a doctor about his arm, he gets himself and Tyrone arrested.  The cops find tons of Heroin and they are sentenced to a long term in prison.  At this point Sarah has completely flipped her lid and is being given electroshock therapy.  It is too late for Harry's arm, and the limb is amputated.  At this point Maid Marion has resorted to performing sexual favors and putting on shows for Little John (Keith David) to feed her own addictions.  We don't learn much about her, but the character seems to be some sort of collage artist.  The most melancholy of the bunch (partly because of what she must resort to for the money) the tension between Marion and Harry coupled with Harry's promises of a better life only add to the denial of their lives.  A triumph of American cinema."

","below are the reasons why I think this is a great movie...<br/><br/>1) The movie is cleverly filmed. For example, a scene when the mother was packing her house, the camera moved a cm across per minute. And end product is a camera moving slowing from right to left while the character is in fast motion.<br/><br/>2) Music did what it was meant to do, to push the viewers into a state of insanity and depression<br/><br/>3) There are some really good scenes. The conversation Harry had with his mom when he visited her and found out she was taking those pills was very well done. <br/><br/>4) The acting was also very good. If not for the two young actor/actress, Ellen did an excellent job and yes, she should have won an award at the oscars.<br/><br/>5) The film itself is about anti-drugs, but it is not just about that. It is about attachments to our own beliefs, sorrow and possessions."
"Eoin!","10","1","2","5 December 2000"," Darren Aronofsky Has Created an Another Artistic Masterpiece.
","Pi has been my favourite film ever since I first saw it in 1998. Everything about it is, in my eyes at least, perfect.  No matter how many times I watch it, I cannot grow tired of it.  I have bought the soundtrack, the screenplay, the video, the dvd, and ever since I first saw it in the theatre, I have been waiting for Darren Aronofsky's second film.  Requiem for a Dream amazed me.  Words cannot begin to describe how intense this film is.  Watching a Darren Aronofsky film, for me, is so much more than watching a movie.  You get drawn into this little world, and you experience everything.  Darren Aronofsky becomes god for ninety minutes, and you are completely under his control.  This film was nearly flawless, and I cannot name a single instance  of this film where I was not uneasy.<br/><br/>
Although this film is incredibly intense, I don't feel that the measures movie theaters are taking to prevent young people from seeing it are necessary.  Frankly, I think that the reality of the film is enough of a deterrent to drug use, and that the sexuality of the film IS NOT SEXY.  IT IS NOT MEANT TO ENCOURAGE SEXUAL DEVIANCY... IT SHOWS WHAT DRUGS CAN DO TO YOU.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is an artistic masterpiece whose full effect on the viewer cannot be described in words.  This film needs to be experienced to be fully understood, and any viewer can benefit from subsequent viewings. It may be gritty and real, but Requiem for a Dream is a truly beautiful film."
"Movie-12","10","1","2","5 December 2000"," One of the most edgy, defiant, honest movies to be released in years. ****(out of four)
","REQUIEM FOR A DREAM / (2000) **** (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>	Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" unravels like a fairy tale nightmare of sunken dreams and hopeless obsessions. In one light it is about bad role models who provide good examples for teens by showing how a life can be changed with drug addiction; in the another, it is about the desperate need of human affection, the sorrow of loneliness, and anxieties of depression. This is the most edgy, truthful, and powerful films released this year; Darren Aronofsky has proved himself to be a superior director.<br/><br/>
	In the most simplistic of story descriptions, the movie shows how the lives of four characters spiral downward after they become involved in the consumption of illegal drugs. It's summertime in Coney Island. There is a sweet, lonely widow named Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), who lives by herself, addicted to a TV game show hosted by the energetic Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald). When she receives a phony telephone call stating she is selected to be the next contestant on her favorite show, Sara decides dieting may be in order to look her best on the air. After struggling with the sight of her refrigerator and the nonstop imagery of junk food, Sara visits her local doctor, who prescribes her diet pills that work miraculously-but turn out to be amphetamines.<br/><br/> 	Sara's drug-addicted son, Harry (Jared Leto), and his similar best friend, Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans), spend the majority of their time either consuming illegal drugs, or selling them to continue their habit. When their supply is cut off, Marion Silver, (Jennifer Connelly) Harry's girlfriend, soon becomes mixed in the jumble of a loosing streak for the two small time drug-dealers. From murder to withdrawal, to sexual identity and desperation, the characters try severely to regain control of their lives.<br/><br/>
	The most absorbing factor in this film is how Darren Aronofsky so vividly captures the mental status of his characters on camera. When they use drugs, there is a short period where their lives seem fulfilled and resourceful. The graphic, often disturbing style Aronofsky uses to show the affects of drugs on his characters is hypnotic: extreme close-ups and brief, intercut images of the character thinking about the drug, then the digestion, injected, swallowed, or snorted. We then quickly see the characters' reaction of the drugs, all done in fast-motion with exaggerated sound effects to portray how quickly drugs take affect, and how quickly they wear off. He also uses a technique of a single frame containing two separate shots of characters within, a great way to show how two people alone together. <br/><br/>	Aronofsky meshes the four characters interlocking lives together with complexity and dexterity; he uses the three friends as one story, and Sara's increasing addiction to her diet pills as another. At the end he cuts among the four major characters showing us where each is heading, all to an unpleasant destination. We really care about the characters, mainly because they are so well defined and introduced. The film provides good material for them to chew on, and we taste the vivid flavor throughout. What truthfully makes Sara so empathetic is how she is compared to the other three drug addicts, and unlike them, she did not choose to travel the road she ends up on. The story gives her several fantasy sequences where she appears as a contestant on her TV show, showing the hope she still beholds and how she believes herself to still be a good-looking lady. <br/><br/>	A great technical crew also supports ""Requiem for a Dream."" The soundtrack, mostly by Clint Mansell, consists of throbbing base and pounding rhythms, is masterful and enthralling; it wonderfully contributes to the on screen occurrences. The cinematography by Matthew Libatique is gritty and the art direction by Judy Rhee is uncommonly convincing. <br/><br/>The film was originally given the controversial NC-17 rating by the MPAA. Artisan Entertainment portrayed guts when they choose to release it ""unrated"" instead of editing the graphic material relating to drugs and sex. Artisan Entertainment is asking theaters to enforce an adults-only policy, which seems kind of contradictory: why have a movie ""unrated"" when no children under 17 can be admitted, when the original NC-17 rating has the same jurisdictions? But this is actually a good movie for young people to see if they are considering experimenting with drugs. Through deeply moving characters, and emotionally disturbing events, ""Requiem For A Dream"" is the most defiant motion picture to come down the road in ages, and will make an impact on many lives."

Her slow descent into madness is unforgettable. Jared Leto is also amazing as her son- a hard drug addict who along with his friend, Marlon Wayans, comes up with a plan to make money. Leto's final fait is graphic, unforgettable and deeply disturbing. Then there is Jennifer Connelly- the most underrated actress in the movies. She starts out a beautiful, sweet, naive girlfriend of Leto's, and by the end she has turned into a hardcore addict, putting on sex shows for perverts to get her fix.

It's kind of akin to a drunken storyteller at a bar who is always afraid of losing your attention, so he exaggerates and he lies.<br/><br/>There is definitely a lot eye-candy in this film, but even the ""innovative cinematography"" often comes off as gimmicky and pointless.<br/><br/>Sometimes power lies in restraint."

","Anyone even remotely contemplating getting involved with drugs, either legal or illegal, would have second thoughts after seeing `Requiem For a Dream,' a cautionary tale brilliantly directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring the magnificent Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar-nominated performance.<br/><br/>In confronting the issue of drug addiction, Aronosky (who co-wrote the screenplay with Hubert Selby Jr.) has chosen to tell two stories that, although they run along basically parallel tracks for most of the film's duration, do occasionally intersect.  That point of intersection is the mother/son relationship between Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widow living in a rundown tenement in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and her son, Harry, a ne'er do well loser hooked up with a couple of junkies, one of whom is his girlfriend, Marion.  Harry and his friends are well on their way to becoming addicts when the movie opens and, until the supply suddenly peters out, the three of them are having the time of their lives.  Unfortunately, once they hit hard times, all hell breaks loose and their lives quickly become a downward spiral into withdrawal, crime, prostitution, illness and prison. This is the more conventional side of the screenplay.  Where the film really charts new territory is in the concomitant half which is focused on Sara, a well meaning woman whose obsession to lose a few pounds results in her becoming addicted to doctor-prescribed amphetamines.  For Sara, this leads to an eventual descent into disorientation, hallucinatory episodes and, eventually, madness.<br/><br/>Some may find Aronosky's blunt directorial style to be overemphatic, hammer-like and off-putting.  To approximate the feeling of dislocation caused by the various drugs, the director employs a wide variety of cinematic techniques at his disposal: sped up motion, jarring quick cuts, visual distortion etc.  Though it can become a bit much at time, one has to admire the effort to bring the viewer as much into the minds of the characters as is conceivably possible using the resources of filmmaking. The film is both unsparing and unflinching in showing the physical and psychological damage drugs can cause.  The last section of the film, though it could be accused of lacking subtlety, nevertheless becomes a harrowing journey into a world filled with confusion, despair and pain.<br/><br/>Burstyn makes Sara a compelling and sympathetic figure from the very start. Alone in her drab room, she watches T.V. all day, dreaming of the time when she will matter to someone again.  Burstyn does a brilliant job in showing how, thanks to her increasing addiction, Sara slowly loses her grip on reality and slips over into schizophrenia and madness.  And though we are appalled by the anti-social behavior both of her son, Henry, and of his cronies, we come to see even them in three-dimensional terms, especially through Harry's obvious love of his mother and the tenderness that develops in Harry and Marian's relationship.  The revelatory moment occurs when Harry realizes that his mother is also addicted to drugs, yet how hollow his words sound as he admonishes her to kick her habit.  Even he can do little but break down in tears during the cab ride home and return to his own self-absorbed drug addicted life.  (This is the last time we ever see them together as their lives diverge to follow their own paths towards mutual self-destruction).<br/><br/>Special note should be taken of Clint Mansell's subtle and haunting musical score, which brings an air of melancholy uneasiness to this strange world of the drug-addicted mind.  <br/><br/>Brilliantly acted and superbly directed, `Requiem For a Dream,' though not always easy to watch, reveals uncompromising truths that cannot be ignored."
"conedust","1","1","2","15 November 2001"," Beautiful, brilliant and kinda boring
","I really wanted to like this movie.  I loved Pi and had been looking forward to see what (writer/director) Darren Aronofsky would come up with next. And for a while I was completely blown away by ""Requiem"".  The acting was wonderful and the cinematography and editing were absolutely incredible - kinetic, musical and truly unique.  Given it's stunning first hour, it should have been a great film.  But a thread of truly puritanical preachiness runs through ""Requiem"" and after a while it comes to dominate the whole movie.<br/><br/>Basically, this is a film about addiction, addiction to love, addiction to food, to habit, to memory, hope, approval, the future and of course addiction to drugs both legal and illegal.  The film doesn't distinguish much between these addictions, instead it layers them atop one another and allows them to reflect off of and inform one another.  We watch the central characters struggle with and against their consumptive, redemptive and addictive impulses and we witness the terrible toll these interlinked impulses exact upon their never more than pitiful lives.<br/><br/>All four central characters are drawn in broad, bleak strokes: the gorgeous yet naive art-school girl, her equally naive street-rat boyfriend, the junkie boyfriend's junkie partner in crime and the boyfriend's diet-pill-popping, food and television obsessed mom.  Although the performances are uniformly excellent, the characters are thin shells who exist only to demonstrate their internal failings.  I admit they're exquisitely rendered shells, with far more detail and nuance than one usually sees in such cautionary tales, but in the end each character is a simple straw man, designed with only his or her own destruction in mind.<br/><br/>That's the problem.  The central point (""addiction is bad"") is simplistic, and its delivery is staggeringly ham-fisted.  Up to a point, I was willing to go along for the ride, led willingly by the truly spectacular eye-candy filling the screen and the exceptionally fine performances that drive the story forward, but after a while I just gave up.  I could see the end coming; I could see the Moral Message written in huge, black letters all over it, and I just didn't care any more.  Life is not a lesson.  Film can be, but don't we as an audience deserve a little more intellectual credit than that?<br/><br/>What could have been an accessible yet experimental observation of the addict's life, presenting both the ups and downs, the good and bad with an eye toward observational truth (with a small t), instead sinks under the weight of it's embarrassingly fatuous and self-important missionary zeal (every single letter in boldface caps).  It's like one of those cautionary splatter movies from driver's ed or an after school special about the maladjusted girl who starts slipping a little of mom's vodka into her O.J. at lunch time.  Given the money, the talent and the effort expended, such reductive hectoring seems like a terrible waste.<br/><br/>Watch it for the cinematography, the editing, the soundtrack, the very pretty young people with nice hair, and watch it for the performances, especially Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb, but be prepared to be pummeled instructively for what feels like days.  (And the ""controversial"" material in the unrated director's cut is so goddam silly and cheesy you might as well just watch the R-rated version.)"
"Homid-NC","10","1","2","6 October 2001"," Simply Breathtaking
","I had heard about this film in late 1999 through word of mouth from some friends. After one of my friends saw this film they simply said, ""Don't do drugs!"". Hearing that comment got me even more interested in seeing this film. He told me it was visually breathtaking, and left you on the floor, lifeless.<br/><br/>So, when it came to Duke University in late 2000, I jumped at the chance. I told my girlfriend to come see this movie because I heard it was a magnificent film with a strong message. I was in for a surprise. (And NO....this is NOT a date movie! :) My girlfriend will vouch for that!)<br/><br/>Not only is it a magnificent film with a strong message, it is literally the only film I have seen in the past few years that actually scared me. I saw the characters slowly decline throughout film wishing I could do something for them. The impact this film has on people will change the movie industry forever. This was GROTESQUE but not gratuitously. This was extremely shocking images that weren't there for show, but to explain. To help you understand why some things are better left alone and how life is ruined so easily.<br/><br/>My overall experience of this film was great and terrible at the same time. Seeing images that are depicted in this movie left me unable to even finish a cigarette afterwards, due to thinking of how bad it was for me.<br/><br/>This movie should be in every Health awareness class. It will definitely change your mind about picking up a syringe. 10 out of 10! BRILLIANT!"

","Requiem for a Dream is a predator.  It finds a place inside of you and burrows deep down inside until you hurt.  It knows what you are thinking and what you fear.  After seeing this movie I felt so sad and so alone that I was immediately in love.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream, directed by Pi's Darren Aronofsky, stars Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans...yes, I said Marlon Wayans. Ellen Burstyn plays a Jewish widow, living in New York, named Sara Goldfarb.  Leto plays her son, Harry.  Jennifer Connelly plays Harry's girlfriend, Marion, and Marlon Wayans plays Harry's best friend Tyrone C. Love.  One day Sara gets a call from a man, telling her that she is going to be on a tv show.  Sara, who worships the television, gets extremely excited but finds that she can't fit into her favorite red dress.  Her friend tells her about some diet pills she knows about.  Meanwhile, her son Harry spends the majority of his time getting high on heroin with Marion and Tyrone while dreaming about scoring an uncut pound of heroin to sell.  Sara starts taking diet pills and starts to get addicted to the dangerous uppers.  Form here each character starts spiraling on the their own road to ruin.  The movie soars through every drug-induced emotion with an amazing visual ecstasy. Requiem for a Dream is not only a powerful story but is also a stunning visual masterpiece.<br/><br/>I hope the Gods are honoring Ellen Burstyn right now because she has done an utterly amazing job in Requiem for a Dream.  Never have I seen such ""no holds barred"", totally open acting.  She has a true talent.  Jared Leto does a great job as well, transcending the majority of immature stuff he has done so far.  Jennifer Connelly is a great actress that I think should be in more movies.  She is much more interesting than the majority of air-brushed actresses these days.  And we can't forget about Marlon.  Oh Marlon... WHAT ARE YOU DOING MAKING MOVIES LIKE SCARY MOVIE!!?!?!?!?!  Marlon, you have such a breakthrough performance in this movie!  Leave that lame comedy crap behind!  You can act...well!<br/><br/>Anyway, Requiem for a Dream is a must-see for anyone that does drugs, has done drugs or is thinking of doing drugs because this movie will hit you where it hurts.  But it hurts sooooo gooood."

Everything about this movie is ingenious. From its heart wrenching original score to the brilliant acting jobs by the entire ensemble this move is a spellbinding work of art.  The subject matter is handled far better than any movie before it.  Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans emerged from their homes in the shallow end of the talent pool. Both gave amazing performances as junkies who will do anything for a fix. While I wasn't shocked by the display of talent by both Jennifer Connely and Ellen Burstyn (because I was already aware of the immense talent that each of these two women have),  I was equally pleased with their performances. The fact that this movie was not nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Score is an outrage, but it is far too late to do anything about that.  It is also an outrage that someone as bland as Julia Roberts won the Oscar for best actress over the amazing performance of Burstyn in this film.<br/><br/>This film is one of the most disturbing and depressing movies I have ever seen.  I don't suggest that you see this film alone, but I do suggest (almost demand) that you see this film.  It is a lesson in film-making, and one of the most amazing ones ever."

Watching this movie is to drugs what Scared Straight is to crime but with the VOLUME ALL THE WAY UP.  This movie is as intense as any that I have ever seen. It should come with a warning label. Some folks will need therapy just to deal with the trauma of having watched it.<br/><br/>I can't bring myself to condemn this movie, if it de-glamorizes heroin use, its probably worthwhile, but think twice before you see it.

"kmarshall","10","1","2","23 July 2001"," Unbearably powerful; ranks as one of the greatest films of all time
","It has been two days since I have watched Darren Aronofsky's second feature, Requiem for a Dream, and I have just now begun to regain some sense of composure.  Aronofsky has created one of those rare films that are so astonishing in emotional power and technical brilliance, and it has had the effect of leaving me staggering for two days following the experience.  This film is an achievement that is easily worthy of mention along side Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line and Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>The content of Requiem for a Dream has been established in most of the comments before mine, and thus I will instead address a few select points. With the addition of Requiem for a Dream to his resume, Darren Aronofsky must now be considered one of the most visually arresting directors currently working in cinema.  I must once again address comments pertaining to Aronofsky's supposed use of ""MTV visuals"", and wonder whether it is the wish of this society to remove all innovation from the use of the film camera.  Those who condemn Aronofsky's style remind me distinctly of the boorish studio executives who took it upon themselves to cut Orson Welles' Touch of Evil because his technique was too revolutionary.<br/><br/>In the style of all great visual directors, Aronofsky uses the camera to not simply capture his story, but to convey those emotions and psychological intangibles that an actor is not capable of providing the audience with.  As the characters in Requiem for a Dream spiral further into the tragic abyss of drug addiction, Aronofsky is able to, in every single sequence, provide the perfect shot with which to establish the psychological condition of his actors--a condition that cannot be portrayed in any other way due to the very nature of illicit drugs.<br/><br/>Behind Aronofsky's talent is an emotional experience of unbearable power, punctuated by astonishing human performances from all four of the lead characters, most notably Ellen Burstyn in one of the most brilliant performances I have ever witnessed; her loss to Julia Roberts continues to prove that the year 2001 held the most shockingly commercial Academy Awards ceremony in the history of the institution.  The descent of the characters is completed with one of the most brutal, shocking, and emotional sequences in cinema history, a frenetically edited finale which generates such emotion that it cannot be adequately described with mere words.  Finally, Clint Mansell's brilliant soundtrack must be mentioned, as it is as vital to this film as any of its other aspects.<br/><br/>In closing, Requiem for a Dream is a true masterpiece in every sense of the word, and stands as the most important parable of addiction ever captured on film; this film not only should, but must be shown to every child considering illicit drug use.  Much like Malick's aforementioned The Thin Red Line, Requiem for a Dream will be considered truly great in 25 years, when the likes of Gladiator and Shakespeare In Love have long since been forgotten."

","After seeing ""Requiem for a dream"" by mastermind Darren Aronofsky, it only sickens me more over the academy's choice to crown Julia Roberts with best actress at the oscars this year.  Not only was Julia's role a sterotypical one (one woman against ""the world"") it also couldn't hold a candle to Ellen Burstyn's role as a diet pill addicted woman in Requiem.  Really, the only drug movie that has ever really disturbed me emotionally and scared me (and I saw the rated version).  However, the elements of fright are used well to weave a tale of four separate people dealing with their own drug problems. Much better than the overpolished, cliched ""Traffic"", ""Requiem for a Dream"" seems more realistic and really shows almost the worst case scenario among people using drugs for recreational use. A good movie for high schoolers and up to see who are contemplating using drugs because this shows what it can do to any person's life.  Hopefully Aronofsky's upcoming take on Batman, Batman:Year One, will be even half as good as this movie is.  10/10 Superb."

"jhclues","9","1","2","8 July 2001"," Hard Look at Drug Addiction
","The devastating, downward spiral of four individuals addicted to drugs is examined in lurid detail in `Requiem for a Dream,' directed by Darren Aronofsky, who paints a vivid picture of the physical and psychological damage that can be incurred by unrestrained chemical abuse.  And it's not a pretty picture.  Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) and Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) are young and in love, but they have a problem; their recreational drug use has long since passed the point of `recreation,' and the sad part is, they don't seem to realize it, or if they do, they're into big time denial.  Harry's friend, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), is in the same situation, and together they spend most of their time and resources trying to score their next fix.  Even the fact that Harry has to repeatedly hock his own mother's television set for drug money doesn't clue them in to how deep their addiction runs; which is a truly sad state of affairs.<br/><br/>	Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a widow who lives alone, and only wishes that her son, Harry, would come around to see her once in awhile, besides when he needs her beloved TV, which is her only real companion in life. Sara doesn't realize it, but there's troubled times ahead for her, too, which begin with a telephone call informing her she's been chosen to appear on a television show, which to her is like being given the Holy Grail. Immediately, she begins to prepare for the moment, but she is bothered by her weight-- her favorite dress doesn't fit anymore.  She's just too fat (she feels) to go on TV.  The solution she discovers, however, is easy. Prescription diet pills, provided by a doctor recommended to her by one of her friends in her apartment building.  Diet pills, nothing more.  It seems so harmless.<br/><br/>	Director Aronofsky doesn't pull any punches with this film, and shows-- often in graphic detail-- just what drugs can do to a person.  Some of the images he presents are hard to take, and are not easily forgotten; like the effects of a needle on an arm when injected repeatedly into the same spot over a prolonged period of time, or the delusions caused by ingesting vast amounts of `speed.'  But the visuals he offers are not the only powerful images; the psychological implications are quite potent as well.  Each character at one time or another seems to comprehend, during one of their few-and-far-between lucid moments, what's happening to them.  But they either do not want to address their situation, or they can't.  Either way, it's harrowing to watch, let alone contemplate.  <br/><br/>	Ellen Burstyn was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her work here, and rightfully so; her performance as Sara, a woman who gets taken unawares and must do battle with an unexpected demon, is astounding.  It's a challenging, decidedly unglamorous role, and Burstyn certainly gave it everything she had, and it paid off.  Sara is someone with whom you can sympathize on a number of levels, while at the same time, the way she comes into her situation is so disconcerting it makes you want to keep her at arms length, because it's something you don't really want to have to think about.  Out of sight, out of mind.  It's an emotionally taxing part-- for Burstyn, of course-- but for the audience, as well.<br/><br/>	Jared Leto gives an extremely convincing, believable performance, also, but his character tends to evoke mixed feelings.  On one hand, you feel terrible for him, but on the other, you realize that-- unlike Sara-- Harry came to where he is because of his own unsound judgment and choices, which casts a rather subjective pall over his circumstances, and therefore the way you relate to him.  Still, there's no getting around the fact that it's a depressing situation (to say the least) for everyone involved.<br/><br/>	The same can be said of Connelly's character, Marion, who seems to go deeper into her situation than the others with her eyes wide open, and it's disturbing to see someone so young, vital and seemingly intelligent allowing this to happen to herself.  Connelly, who admirably of late has forsaken mainstream cinema for roles of more substance in independent films (like `Pollock' and `Waking the Dead'), turns in a memorable performance here, capturing that dark side of human nature and expressing it so well in terms of her character and the path she chooses to take.  And of all of the characters in the film, it is through Marion that you really get a sense of the degradation and loss of self-esteem that comes with the territory to which these people have staked a claim.  And it's just almost too horrendous to consider.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Christopher McDonald (Tappy Tibbons), Louise Lasser (Ada), Marcia Jean Kurtz (Rae) and Peter Maloney (Dr. Pill).  A powerful anti-drug film, `Requiem for a Dream' is a stark and realistic look at a problem that affects everyone either directly or indirectly, and it's so effective because there's no attempt to candy-coat the issue.  Aronofsky tells it-- and shows it-- like it is, and like `Trainspotting' and `Traffic,' it gives you a real grasp of just how far into our lives the tentacles of this evil reaches, and how vulnerable we all really are to it. This film may be a sobering trip, but it's definitely one worth taking.  I rate this one 9/10."

","I am a bit late viewing this movie, as I live in a small town in Tennessee, one whose local cinema would never consider showing a film such as this...it wasn't until I purchased the DVD that I was able to see it.  I was anxious to see ""Requiem for a Dream"" because I had loved ""Pi"" so much...and I was in no way disappointed, even though the two films are vastly different. While ""Pi"" was stark (mainly because of the b&w cinematography), claustrophobic and had an overwhelming sense of the  main character's obsession and paranoia, ""Requiem"" is loving despite the cruelty, haunting, beautiful, and heartbreaking.  The cinematography is stunning; even when these characters begin to fall apart before our very eyes, the camera and the lighting still seem to capture a bit of beauty about them, finding a bit of hope, at least for a while.  The soundtrack is amazing, and a perfect compliment to the images and the story.  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly all give wonderful performances, but this film belongs to Ellen Burstyn.  She literally owns every scene she is in (and even a few she is not, because you are still thinking about her character, Sarah, even after the story has moved on). Burstyn deserved the Oscar for this film...to the devil with Erin Brockovich and her push-up bra. I am a high school English teacher, and I would love to be able to show this film to every student in my classes, for many different reasons, the first being to show what great characterization is all about; the second reason would be to show the dangers of addiction...but did I mention I live in a small town in Tennessee?"

You see, our minds do not like emptiness and we are desperately looking for something that might help us to get rid of that emptiness along with the guilt and pain associated with it. Something that gives us the right to say ""I know who I am. My life has a purpose. I am here for a reason"". Whether they realized it or not, the people in the movie chose something to fill those spaces. Something they needed. Something that for a short period of time made their pain go away. Something that gave a meaning to their existence. In the end, they paid a terrible price for it. Sooner or later, we all do. The difference between us and the characters of this movie is that unlike them, we understand the consequences of your actions. At least we convinced ourselves so.  Do you think that your way to achieve happiness (or chemical balance in your brain) is the right one? See this movie. You will regret it though because it will make you face the reality for a moment.

I saw this movie three times in the theaters, and ended up weeping every time at the end. This is truly one of the best films I have ever sat down to watch. Screw D.A.R.E, give this movie to schools, and watch the drug problem disappear. You feel like when watching this movie that you know these characters.

The MPAA did a grave injustice of making this NC-17. This is a must see for anyone who wanders the dark side of drugs.

Enjoy.<br/><br/>Ok, I am sitting here listening to my copy of the requiem for a dream soundtrack. Supermarket sweeps, oh boy, this is the point of no return and it is about to get messy. I listened to the soundtrack before I see the film, and...well I really wanted to see the film after listening to this music. The last three songs, well they were hard. They were hard to sit through. My hairs were standing on end and I felt, well I can't honestly say how I felt but it was not a happy feeling. It was a feeling of knowing something bad was going to happen but not knowing what. Now this music is among the most moving, beautiful music I have ever heard, but it is hard. So this leads us onto the movie.

Sara is Harry's mother, she is old, she is alone, her husband has died and the only time she sees her son is when he comes round to pawn the television for crack. The only thing in her life is food and TV. One day she gets a call telling her she is going to be on TV, yay, this is great, she is so happy. So she goes and gets her best dress out, her red dress, and she tries to get into it but she has put on too much weight, she is fat. Her neighbours give her tips on how to lose weight but eventually she settles for pills. One blue in the morning, one white at lunch, orange in the afternoon, and green in the evening.<br/><br/>Then we have her son Harry, a nice boy, wouldn't really hurt anyone on purpose. He can't help it that his mother reacts so badly to him `borrowing' the TV. He tries his best to be good, but that crack is just soo good. He has a wonderful girlfriend who he loves more than anything, Marion. She wants to become a fashion designer, and she too is on crack. Harry's best friend Tyrone is the cool man, he is the man who knows people, he can get the crack real easy. So Harry and Tyrone set up a business, buying a little crack and resell it, buy a bit more sell a little more. Things are starting to really look up, they have a nice pile of money and things are going good. Summer, last summer. Then crack runs out, the fall. Only a few people have any and they are selling for double the price. So Harry and Tyrone have a good idea, if they go out to Florida and buy some there, then bring it back, they can sell it for twice the price and become rich. The beginning of the end.<br/><br/>This is the most intense, violent film I have ever seen. It is not an action violent film it is an emotionally violent film. There is actually only one scene of violence in the film, it is sudden and largely hidden, but it is shocking. Much like the rest of the film. A lot of the more horrifying scenes are hidden or not shown. What is shown is horrifying but what isn't shown is even more horrifying. The film will not attack you with a gun and explosions, it will not attack you with coarse language (nearly no swear words). But it will attack you, it will squeeze your heart until you can't breathe anymore and your body shakes and quivers. And it all happens so quickly that one cannot prepare for it. There is plenty of warning that it will not all go well, but until the moment before it does the viewer has no idea it will be that bad. Ok, selling and doing drugs is a bad idea, everyone knows that, it isn't much of a warning that something bad well happen. Everything is so nice and normal throughout the entire film, there isn't any warning. And then suddenly you are in the very pits of hell. I've seen many shocking films, horrible films, films that have been banned in half the world. But from now on I will always think of those films as Julia Roberts films. They are fluffy, they are nice. Fight club is weak and fluffy, bad lieutenant if a nice stroll in the park. there has never, and most likely never will be a film as...there isn't a good enough word to describe it. there will never be a film as uncompromised and sick and disgusting and horrifying and REAL AND BEAUTIFUL and everything. It is hard to write a review of this film. It is hard not to feel emotional and sad when writing about this film. I knew that the end was shocking, that life turned bad, but, I never ever could've imagined it would be like this: I don't want to tell you, I want you to see it one day, when you are ready, and I want you to feel lost, I want you to feel sick, I want you to feel afraid and small and pathetic. This film won't let you get out in one piece. I feel like I need to hold onto it in my head forever and if I ever forget I will have lost something I needed to know. anybody who sees this film and feels nothing should be locked up, there is something seriously wrong with a person who feels nothing when they gaze upon this film.<br/><br/>But, I don't feel dirty. Sometimes there are films that show a dark horrifying side of life in such a way that they make the viewer feel dirty, but this, no, no it doesn't feel like a snuff film or a piece of porn, it doesn't feel dirty, it feels real, it feels sad. The thing which makes this film work so amazingly well is the characters and the actors who portray them. We are not forced into liking them, they are not incredibly special and wonderful and we feel incredibly sorry for them. But we do feel for them, we don't hate them, we care about them and we like them, but not so much that the caring totally about them gets in the way of viewing this film. It is hard to explain. The viewer feels for the characters, they are likable, but not to the point where we just collapse emotionally at the thought of what is happening to them. The viewer is kept alive and in touch with every tiny thing that happens on the screen, and this is what makes them such an incredible experience. The first thing I said after watching this `That was the finest piece of film making I have ever seen, absolutely. But it is the worst piece of entertainment I have ever seen.' I do love this film, I will own it one day, and I will see it again. I love it because it does not lie to me, it doesn't pull any punches and pretend to make things better or worse. It is real, it is completely uncompromised.<br/><br/>Ok, I have ranted and raved about the emotional aspects enough. How about the actors? Well let's start with the Oscars. Every single award ceremony in existence means nothing anymore. That Julia Roberts won all the major awards and Ellen Burstyn only got a couple of awards from awards ceremonies no one has ever heard of is an outrage.  It is impossible to describe her performance in more words than one. Perfect. It is gut wrenchingly real, the grinding of the teeth, the hyper-tension. And that fridge!!! That f***ing fridge!! Never in my life have I been more scared by something in a movie. And it is all brought to life so well. As for Jared Leto, he is excellent. He should go on to become a very fine actor. His performance here is also wonderful, everybody is wonderful. The direction is startling. I have heard a lot of people complain and say it is just another stupid cut cut MTV directional style but it isn't. The incredible amount of work that was poured into the film is amazing. Watching the making of and listening to the audio commentary, it is amazing, why they choose to do this and how much trouble they had to get this just right. And if it had been done any other way it would've lost the impact. Amazing, amazing describes it all.<br/><br/>This film is important. It is more important than fight club, it is more important than any single film made in the last twenty years. This is a film which should change the art of film making, it should help change the censorship system and should change the way people view films like this. But it won't. it made less than $4 million American dollars over a period of 9 months in America. Compare this to the mummy returns which is already up to $140 million in 2 weeks. It is so sad. This film should be shown in high schools. It should be a class all by itself. If the governments want to deter kids, hell, anybody from taking drugs, from getting into prostitution, if they are really serious about showing how bad it can all be, then this is the film to show them. When I have kids, the day that I think they are ready to handle it, I will show them this film. It will do more to help them keep away from this scene than I could ever do in talking to them, more than any stupid government campaign could ever do. I will never take diet pills. I will never do any kind of drug. I will never ever have anything to do with the sex industry. Not totally because of this film but it has certainly made me resolution rock solid, more than anyone or anything else could ever have done.<br/><br/>This film will open your eyes, for better or worse you will have learned something. And the most horrifying part of all: the acceptance. As they curl up into a fetal position they accept what has happened to them. They accept that they will be raped and tortured and will never again do a single beautiful enjoyable thing with their lives. They accept it and it is real.<br/><br/>So, should you see this? Yes, no maybe, I don't know. if you feel that you really cannot cope with it then don't. we do not want anyone freaking out and mentally collapsing. But, if you think you can, if you want to see something different, something unique and real, then this is the film. But just remember, it will not be easy. This is the hardest film I ever watched. And it is also the most rewarding."
"jakkea","10","1","2","29 April 2001"," Shocking, amazing, awesome, etc: Requiem For A Dream.
","There is something I have been telling my friends & family for a few months now. I have been telling them that there are three directors to watch out for, from America. The first is Harmony Korinne. The second is Paul Thomas Anderson. And the third, is Darren Aronofsky, whom debuted 1999 with the movie Pi, and made this movie; Requiem For A Dream.<br/><br/>The first time I saw Pi, I was... Not shocked, but amazed. I thought to myself that Aronofsky never, despite Pi being his first movie, will do anything better than this (Pi). I couldn't be more wrong.<br/><br/>The first time I saw Requiem For A Dream, I was shocked. Thrilled. Amazed. F*** Trainspotting, this is how it IS. And Basketball Diaries? C'mon, that's a feel good movie! The direction by Aronofsky is sheer brilliance, (and so is the acting, of course, especially Ellen Burstyn). The photography, is amazing and so is the music. <br/><br/>Actually, it's just been a couple of hours since I saw it, and I haven't really landed yet, so to speak.<br/><br/>All I can say is that this motion picture probably changed my life, today. 'Cause, you see, I will never, ever, touch a drug in my entire life after this. But the movie isn't only about drugs; it's about addiction, and Aronofsky shows that in a brilliant way. <br/><br/>A word I (almost) never use when I describe movies and/or music, is art. But this movie truly is art. Art in the way that you can't get it out of your head, no matter how hard you try.<br/><br/>And the last 15 minutes of this film is the most powerful sequences I have ever seen in a movie.<br/><br/>Requiem For A Dream is THE best movie of the 30th century, so far."

","Have you ever witnessed an event that not only moves you, but those around you who also witnessed it? You don't know these people, and probably won't see any of them ever again, but in the few minutes you are together and are all feeling exactly the same set of emotions, a bond exists that I couldn't hope to describe.<br/><br/>During the closing credits of Requiem for a Dream, Darren Aronofsky's new picture about 4 people whose lives spiral out of control due to drug addiction, the whole theater all but held hands and promised: ""Let's never, ever touch any of that stuff"".<br/><br/>""Requiem"" tells the the story of Sara, a middle-aged woman who becomes addicted to diet pills in her futile attempt to feel needed. Sara's son Harry is involved in drugs, he not only sells but also uses heroin, and as the movie progresses he, his girlfriend Marion and his mate Tyrone become heavily reliant on the drug. Their reliance is artfully relayed by director Aronofsky, through close ups, fast editing and exaggerated sounds of the drugs, the methods of usage, and then the obligatory dilated pupil.<br/><br/>The end result of these addictions is disturbing for each character, and although we can see it coming from a long way off, we keep hoping that things will change for these characters. In retrospect however, it is probably for the best that we see the long term effects of drug usage, as this movie will certainly deter you from ever considering drugs. In fact, it is my opinion that this film should be shown to high school students everywhere... It may well be the one thing that gets through to them."
"dclxvihell","10","1","2","4 February 2001"," Requiem For A Dream brings the statement 'The road to Hell is paved with the Best of Intentions' sharply into focus
","There are very few films that exist that leave the audience emotionally devastated as they leave the theatre.... Requiem For A Dream is a condensed reality brought alive throughout the medium of film via Hubert Selby's novel, Darren Aronovsky's exceptionally capable direction, the stunning performances by each of the characters and Clint Mansell's hypnotically beautiful yet sorrowful score. The film's incredible power comes from the sheer beauty and in some cases, naivety of the characters. Their choices, despite being filled with hopeful aspirations, lead each to their own personal hell and self-destruction. The tragic ironies that each character encountered in terms of their past and in terms of there present reality, left Me emotionally pummeled as a viewer. At some points, it was almost unbearable to watch (not that I looked away). If ever there were an anti-drug film to deter future users, this would be it. This film is a must see for every individual, no matter from what walk of life.... even if you are not a film goer. I will not call the film a piece of art outright (although it is certainly that) but rather a piece of brutal reality polished and mirrored in the art form of cinema. I extend My warmest thanks to the creators and distrubutors of this film. It is films like these that give Me the hope that even though the quality of films these days have degenerated somewhat, that something somewhere went right in creating and bringing this work to audiences worldwide. To finish up this review I will borrow the words in agreement from the previous reviewer and state that Requiem For A Dream is incredibly powerful cinema."

","Subsequent viewings and much consideration on the matter have forced me to concede this film a 10/10 score.  I admit it; I am perhaps no better than the depraved, lifeless cyphers that beleaguer this film -- for I am an addict of fine cinema.  Films such as these may tarnish my soul and forever render me socially dysfunctional.  Yet I cannot deny their scope and power. Requiem for a Dream is not about drugs, but the carnal distractions that prevent us from realizing our dreams.  It is a requiem because it is the soundtrack to a life unfulfilled.  This is a very musical film, from the rhythmic portrayals of habit to Clint Mansell's (Pop Will Eat Itself) fitting score, often nearly drowning out the film's dialogue.  I have read the book, and though there are moments which cannot be captured in film, Aronofsky more than makes up for this by bringing out elements of the story which could not have been captured in prose.  Thank you for daring and moving me.  Undeniably the best picture of the year.<br/><br/>P.S. Look out for Hubert Selby as the ""laughing guard"" in the final sequence."
"Waltdog","10","1","2","6 January 2001"," You Think You Know
","I have already posted a comment praising this movie.  This comment is directed toward all who have commented negatively about the film.  I am the first to say that everyone is entitled to their opinion, as I believe this is true.  However, many people have said that this is a bad movie because the cinematography is unoriginal.  In case you all have not looked at the trivia section of this movie, it contains over 2000 cuts, as the average movie contains around 700.  Also, some people said this movie is unrealistic.  I am willing to put my life on the line and bet that 99 percent of those who said that have never been a heroin addict, let alone tried the drug.  I have never used drugs, but I have friends who have(Even one who lost his life this summer because he jumped out of a car under the influence of speed).  None of us know what it is like to be drug addicts. And in case some of you don't know, screenwriters do usually research things before they write about them, as do actors before they portray something. With this said, I would like to say once more that I respect everyone's opinion, but the reasons for those opinions may not be solid."
"smragan","6","1","2","22 December 2000"," Sophomoric is the right word
","I loved Aronofksy's visual style in Pi, and was really excited, at least in the beginning parts of Requiem for a Dream, about getting to see that style executed in vivid color.  But the plot of this movie almost seems to be a joke on the most time-worn arthouse cliche, which is that arty films are inevitably depressing.  Requiem for a Dream is so depressing its boring. Paraphrasing the local paper reviewer, not only is there no hope for the characters, there is not even a possibility of hope.  We know from the very first scene in the movie that it can only get worse for these people, and it does, forthwith.  And then it keeps on going for another thirty minutes. And then for another thirty minutes.  On the way out of the theater, my friend wondered aloud why he hadn't walked out halfway through the picture, and had instead chosen to ""sit there and let Aronofosky stab me in the eye with a hot poker for another hour.""  The reason, we eventually decided, was that the voyeuristic experience of this film is essentially pornographic. It may be lacking the visual gore of, say, Hellraiser III, but it is just as Sadistic.  You get to watch these four people writhe in agony for about two hours.   First you're nauseated, then you're numbed, and then you're relieved that it's only a movie and slightly exhilirated because it could never happen to you.  If that sounds like your idea of a aesthetic experience, then Requiem for a Dream may work for you.  It didn't for me. I kept remembering something George Lucas is reported to have said: ""Emotionally involving the audience is easy.  All you have to do is put an adorable little kitten up on the screen and have some guy wring its neck."""

","I almost left the theater to puke, and that is praise, and it's true. I had heard good things about this, but I was not too impressed with Pi, so overall I was expecting it to be ""good"" at best. But, seeing this movie was an experience unlike ""seeing a movie"" had ever been before in my life. Seeing this movie is more an experience that rivals losing your virginity, attending a parent's funeral, or getting in a car accident. I almost left the theater to throw up not out of disgust (although there were a few disgusting images), but out of anxiety. I've never walked out of a movie, and almost had to leave my first one not because of how bad it was, but because of how good it was. I was sitting there thinking ""please be over.. please be over.."", so that I could leave. Now that I've had a day to recover, I am going to go see it again, I should be detached just barely enough to appreciate the technique this time. I really hope that ""Batman Year One"", his next project, does not turn out to be for him what ""Dune"" was to David Lynch."

","Trainspotting showed the pleasure of them, Blow showed the selling of them, and this clever drama shows the effects of addiction to drugs, from director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler). Basically the story revolves around the lives of four individual characters, and what they experience as they take their quantities of drugs. These are Sara Goldfarb (The Exorcist's Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ellen Burstyn) who is hooked on game shows and sweet foods, desperate to lose weight with diet pills, that she gets addicted to and overdoses, causing hallucinations, increased loneliness, and eventually she goes to hospital, after going to the game show studio and looking a drugged up wreck. Then her heroin addict son Harry (American Psycho's Jared Leto), along with his friend Tyrone C. Love (Scary Movie's Marlon Wayans) who both pawn a TV for a new one, and for drugs money, and Harry unfortunately is victim to overdose, but Tyrone pays the price being put in prison for possession. Finally, Harry's girlfriend Marion Silver (A Beautiful Mind's Jennifer Connelly) is helping with their drug dealing and profit, but is degrading herself by spending time at stag parties with other men. Also starring Flubber's Christopher McDonald as Tappy Tibbons, Happiness's Louise Lasser as Ada and Volcano's Keith David as Little John. This film uses clever split-screen technique, fast paced montage-like moments, especially when characters take their drugs, huge close-ups and exaggerated sound effects, all creating convincing highs and lows of drug taking. The cast is very good, the film is almost all disturbing, the music by Clint Mansell throughout is great, and the theme is very powerful, it has been called one of the most depressing films ever made, but it is an essential drama to see. Very good!"

Aronofsky proves not only that he can direct a ""bigger"" movie, he also shows how one can do so without selling out. To be more precise: ""RFAD"" is one of the most disturbing and depressing movies that came out of the US for a long time. From the opening scene to its final curtain it's...well, a requiem for the characters, who are all perfectly portrayed by their actors. Ellen Burstyn is unbelievable. The power of her performance can only be compared to that of Björk in ""Dancer in the dark"". Aronofskys direction is even more experimental than in ""Pi"" and some of his ideas, like his combination of sound and picture are really innovative and give his movie a musical feel -without creating a long music video. On the downside, you could say that this movie offers no hope, no solution - but then, this would've been a lousy compromise."

","I watch a LOT of films (on average 1 a day) and I'd been told about this one for years so felt like there was a big gap in my movie knowledge. Even are the first 15 minutes I felt the sense of impending doom. There are so many quick cut edits of pills flying into peoples mouths, a TV being turned on, a pupil dilating. I thought, OK, maybe they've just come out of film school and this is still a 'neat' tool to them. By the end of the film you've seen these edits repeated ad nauseam for no further impact. If you think this sort of thing is clever then you're probably one of the people that gave this movie a 10. The thing that annoyed me the most about this film is the story - essentially the film is about drug abuse. Thats it, there's no other sub plots or 'place to get to', so you'd think that a film that gives itself a tiny premise would then dig right down into the complexities of drug abuse, perhaps make it a character examination because drug abuse is an incredibly complicated subject. Nope, you never know why these people become addicts, you never feel anything for them because you no nothing about them about from the fact they are drug addicts, nothing about their life outside of taking drugs is shown. This is not the real world! Most of people in western society have taken drugs at some stage growing up and many still do - they don't all become junkies. And the ones that do become junkies don't have their arms chopped off, become prostitutes or go to mental homes. The makers of this film has an opportunity to show how drug abuse really works in society but decided to take the easy route and make a 'Gosh, drugs are bad!' commercial. If only they could've spent 5 minutes giving some characters some depth I might have cared about what happened to them but I guess we're not supposed to care about them because they took drugs. So they're just bad people right. Do yourself a favour and watch Train Spotting instead - it's still a drug movie that pulls no punches but they bother to actually put a story in there for the viewers too and show that drugs don't always lead to addiction and that most junkies aren't just junkies: each one is a complex individual and thats how they should be portrayed. Shame on you Requiem for Dream."

"ignatz928","4","1","3","15 June 2005"," Probably too effective
","This movie is probably the most effective anti-drug statement ever put on film. What watching it proved to me, less than that being a junkie isn't any fun, is that I don't have as strong a stomach as I thought. I've made it through some pretty rough movies, but even those were basically just entertainment. Requiem is a different matter, and is the first movie where I couldn't make it all the way through; after enduring the first hundred minutes,I fast-forwarded through the last twenty. The movie depicts the lives of four people living on Coney Island whose lives go awry due to drugs. Harry Goldfarb, his girlfriend Marion, and his friend Tyrone are already drug users, but as the movie begins seem to have their use pretty well under control. Marion dreams of opening up her own clothing store, while Harry and Tyrone are trying to set themselves up as drug dealers. The fourth character is Harry's mother, a widow who spends most of her time in a dreary apartment eating candy and watching a bad self-help show. So the movie isn't exactly a laugh-fest to begin with. But hold on, it's gets even grimmer from here. Stylistically, the movie is quite impressive. I had previously seen his debut film, Pi, which shares a similar, deliberately grungy look, as well as aggressive editing. I wasn't a huge fan of that film, which at least in my memory seems rather lacking in substance to match its style, but I do remember being impressed by its rapid montage, repeated multiple times, of the obsessed protagonist swallowing pills. For Requiem, Aronofsky elaborates on those sequences with montages of the addicts' drug taking, showing only small details, such as the needle being readied. Working with a bigger budget here, he's able to pull out all of the stops, including split-screen, speed-up motion, and micro-photography, in order to convey the highs and lows of a junkie's existence. But this movie isn't just a director's show; the actors are also very impressive, though largely because of their sheer willingness to pretty thoroughly abase themselves for their roles. This is particularly true of Ellen Burstyn as Sarah Goldfarb, who never flinches from her painful role. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans manage to make their junkie characters sympathetic enough to care about what happens to them. I never expected that there would be a movie sex scene involving Jennifer Connelly that I wouldn't want to see, but it's here, which may or may not be a somewhat dubious distinction (it was in fact at this point that I decided to skip all the way to the end). Despite its generally harrowing quality, there are points where Aronofsky's willingness to go to extremes starts to dip over into absurdity. A scene where Leto and Wayans encounter a cop and Leto imagines stealing the cop's gun plays more like a stand-alone commercial than a scene in a movie. Another fantasy sequence, this one belonging to Sarah as her mental breakdown begins, literally breaks down the wall between reality and the movie by having her imagine that the talk-show crew invades her apartment. The effect isn't disturbing so much as jarring, by reminding us that we're watching a movie- something that the rest of Requiem, for all of its overt stylishness, avoids to stunning effect. But while the acting and the technical aspects of this film were very good, why I thought it fails is because of the intent behind it. The movie amounts to little more than the world's most extended anti-drug commercial. At some level, I think that all movies should be entertaining; not necessarily fun, but involving and satisfying to the audience. Maybe it's that I'm just too conventional to accept Aronofsky's brutally honest vision, but I think that there's a problem with a film that wants to put the audience through as much discomfort as possible. Instead of telling a story or conveying a mood through the camera, Aronofsky seems to want to use it as a weapon for mounting a sensory assault on the viewer."
"nightbreed420","5","1","3","1 December 2004"," such a tired topic
","I'm so tired of supposedly 'edgy' films that focus on 'accepted' drug use and 'unaccepted' drug use. The self-image issues were also overblown, masked with 'trippy' surreal scenes and corny over-acting. The fake ""New Yawk"" accents were also horrible. I have to say I laughed throughout this whole movie. I just found it so patronizing and comical that my only reaction was endless laughter. <br/><br/>The only thing that saved this movie was the amazing camera-work. It seems like Aronofsky (with this movie and also Pi) can direct the cameraman and edit much, much better than he can direct actors. Either they under act or they overact.. the characters are just never believable, thus there is no way I can ever identify with them. Disbelief is not suspended and immersion in the otherwise powerful imagery is made impossible. Maybe Aronofsky was trying to do archetypes, which makes unbelievable characters like Special Agent Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks so wonderful and memorable. The thing is, Lynch can do powerful imagery AND get powerful performances out of his actors. Aronofsky just falls on his face trying to be Lynch."
"Travis_Bateman","7","1","3","12 January 2004"," Some *spoilers*. Nothing too deep.
","Well, I finally got around to this movie, and overall I thought it was good enough (hardly great/brilliant/superb).  An easy enough story;  4 people getting involved with drugs under different circumstances, all hoping to be 'W-I-N-N-E-R-S'.  The catch:  Nobody wins.  The story is actually handled well initially.  Everybody's role is established.  The hopeful young couple. The friend with a one-track mind.  The naive and lonely old woman. Through drugs, all of them get more power.  Harry (Leto) and Ty (Wayans) make a lot of money, Sara (Burstyn) has boosted self-esteem & confidence, and Marion (Connelly) simply has control of her life & herself for once (as seen by her handling of the Shrink).  The first half of the movie is their HIGH, the second half is their big fall.  Harry and Ty lose their money and are mere pawns of the underworld, Marion is under the mercy of the Shrink and Big Tim, while Sara just unravels.  It's like a train wreck, but surely the movie is more than that?  Or at least I had hoped.<br/><br/>Now, onto the acting/characters.  Ellen Burstyn is fantastic as Sara, and you really get to feel for her because you know a little bit about her and what's she's been through, and what she really wants and dreams of being. Leto, Connelly, and Wayans are really good in their roles too, but I just got didn't get enough of them (not in the good sense).  Just flat-out weak character development.  Harry is a dopey kid with a generally good heart, but we don't get much more than that.  Certainly not enough to really sympathize for what he's about to go through.  But, Oronosky and Selby do a good job with one scene in particular where Marion is on the pier, clearly symbolic of the only thing pure in Harry's life, if only for a short while. Drugs stand in Harry and Marion's way, but nobody does enough to make that connection evident.  Speaking of Marion, again they sort of touch on the fact that she was a victim of abuse (the nightmare, ""Hell"", drugging up at the sight of her own body, The Shrink, etc.), but you never really know and you're left with nothing to do except move on with the story and in several instances, pretend to care more than you actually do.  This is also evident when things go from bad to worse and everyone changes.  Ty has even less development, as they briefly go over his relationship with his mother near the beginning and futilely at the end, but it seems all too rushed, and Oronosky and Selby appear to just want to tie up all the loose ends in a neat little bow with his particular fate.  Too much focus elsewhere and not enough on good old fashioned character development, which then hurts the plot itself because it IS the characters and not much more.<br/><br/>
The directing was original, but almost overbearing at times as I said, the techniques almost getting in the way of the actual performances (I mean, we get it, there's something wrong.).  But that's not to say that Oronosky's work wasn't clever or smart, because it was.  I just feel that director's style should totally gel with all the actors, as opposed to one taking away from the other.  So, Requiem ends up being the train wreck that was expected, but you really only feel for a couple of the passengers, one for the horrific things she puts herself through to get a fix, and the other because you're human and so is she, but a little more misguided than you and I and not fit to be in her son's world.  There should be more sympathy towards them, which was what Oronosky/Selby wanted, but I dug down and found nothing.<br/><br/>It's a good movie, but I don't get the rating.  As of this review, it's an 8.4 (lots of 10s), but I'd have it closer to an even 7.  An earlier poster said that maybe people aren't accustomed or used to the shock of a movie such as this (perhaps the directing style also), which would explain the high marks, and I'd have to agree as there seem to by many young people rating it high as well.  Directing overshadows the acting, pure shock was chosen over genuine emotion.  I mean really, the decisions by the young people were all by Free Will, none of them ever intending to quit, so how can I feel badly for them compared to Sara? There were some other things such as RFAD dragging at several points, despite the chance it was intentional.  As far as a ""message"", it's not much more than stay away from drugs, simply because everyone other than Burstyn doesn't give you much reason to think otherwise.  Entertaining, but I was expecting much more than this.  7/10"

","The message (or idea) of this movie is that 100%, everyone, who take drugs die in a painful death, or they live a life you can´t really call a life! Thats not true, and to say that it´s stupid, like this whole movie.<br/><br/>But the fear of drugs it tries to spread is not the only one in this movie. When Marion needs drugs, she goes to a BLACK ugly looking guy. Why do you think he is black? Continue yourself...<br/><br/>Well, if the makers of this movie had made Philadelphia (a very good movie, with very good acting) all of the people around the main character had also died because of AIDS. Why? I doesn´t mater, it´s just shocking and cool... His friend would be an ugly black guy Tom Hanks would probably die in terrible pain and shout: ""If you´re gay you will die of AIDS!!!"".<br/><br/>Also, the whole movie is a huge logical mistake! At the beginning they take drugs, and it seems they´re used on it, as they already took it years. Then suddenly in half a year (or a bit more) they die. How does this fit? It doesn´t!<br/><br/>If you want to scare someone of drugs (and of somebody else?) this is your movie! But if you believe this, you´ll never try just one cigarette, or drink a cup of coffee because you´ll die, and the doctors will kill you with electric shocks or something else (thats the point of this movie!)...<br/><br/>But the movie has also another message: Life sucks! Life is ugly and nothing worth! And because of this message I really hate this movie (I loved it to give it a 1/10!!). If you want to see a good REALISTIC movie go and watch Philadelphia. It has another look on the life, which says: Even you´re practically already death, there is still something worth fighting for!"

"Gary-161","Null","1","3","5 November 2001"," A good t-shirt movie
","Overcooked?  This film is akin to having a blow dry with an acetylene torch. If, as a film maker, you are going to comprehensively humiliate yourself with a truly awful picture, the kind that makes 'The Boost' appear subtle, then it's important to have Jennifer Connelly along for the ride. Jennifer usually lets her t-shirt do the talking, which is why I've got a soft spot for her. She persists in exploring the issue of sexuality, memorably having sex against a wall in 'Heart Of Justice' with Eric Stoltz. Well, memorable because she wasn't wearing a t-shirt at the time.  Seizing the chance for yet another t-shirt movie (who can forget 'Career opportunities'? It was white) and dutifully losing the odd pound for the sake of authenticity, Jennifer gives us a butchers at a nice purple t-shirt and then extends her range with some lurid sex scenes. In fact, we get to see more of Jennifer than ever before, so enamoured is she of her t-shirt that she becomes forgetful about the rest of her ensemble. But back to the sex, we get a hilarious scene where Jennifer performs a sexual act which, to the un-initiated, should be excrutiating.  Instead, Jennifer's face suggests the mild irritation of having to deal with a poorly adjusted panty hose. Later, she vomits at the camera perhaps making courting couples in the theatre nostalgic over their first date.  The trouble is, despite all her sterling efforts to explore her dark side and become one of those 'real' actresses, as opposed to a t-shirt actress; decadence does not, and arguably never has, suited our Jenny.  She seems curiously out of place in all her films, in a way I can't quite put my finger on, but here it's easy to spot.  She's way too old for the part.<br/><br/>Still, this is as nothing compared to the indignities heaped upon poor Ellen Burstyn's head.  ""You should stand back and let it happen"" states director Aronofsky, clearly in awe of history.  No, a hands off approach is the last thing you want in regards to the old school who will chew the scenery with the best of them, going so far over the top that they need a parachute to get down the other side.  With gravity defying hair not seen since 'The Bride Of Frankenstein', Ellen is put through some ridiculously silly scenes, my favourite being a laboriously scripted lament at a kitchen table.  You half expect that flashing arrow with 'author's message' from the Woody Allen scripted 'What's New Pussycat?' To come down and point at her head.  If Aronofsky had thought of it he would have settled for no less than Burstyn flying around the room on the arrow in a grotesque parody of the title sequence of 'Bewitched' before no doubt flying into a carnivorous dish washer.  Besides, doesn't all this trendy Quentin Tarantino-esque benevolence strike one as patronising and a sort of un-earned vanity?<br/><br/>Still, the rum goings on in this preposterous picture seem to have afforded it 'classic' status amongst the undiscriminating and easily impressed, that is, young people.  Have you met them, the young? They get into all kinds of scrapes but are mostly armless.  They pull our legs with great earnestness declaring that 'they've been there' while in reality they are more likely to have sustained no more than a grazed knee taking this film back to the rental shop.  Personally, I blame the parents, as does Mr Aronofsky by the looks of this film.  He doesn't so much wear his influences on his sleave as put up a giant billboard.  You can pick any two films but 'Liquid Sky' springs to mind, coupled with any Tex Avary cartoon.  He even manages to crib 'La Jetee', the ultimate film student cliche, probably appropriate as this is really one of those ten minute 'let's pretend grown ups' graduation films extended to nearly two hours. I think the whole thing smacks of desperation and laziness as film makers have less time (if any at all) to make their names in a fiercely competitive market that spits people into TV land if they don't make a big noise as quickly as possible. This is puerile stuff from a 32 year old. To say this bogus 'alternative' film making has more integrity than so called 'mainstream cinema' is a bit naughty.<br/><br/>It's a good t-shirt movie but little else."

I cannot deny that.  All the characters are leading such happy lives and it gives that happiness off to the audience in vibes; perhaps this is why watching the last half was just so dreary: Hubert Selby, Jr. completely murdered his array of potentially content lives - and director Arronofsky doesn't spare the viewer a moment to look away.<br/><br/>I disagree when commentors here say that the final images are brutal and disturbing... it is not so much the violence as it is watching your best friends suffer and atrophy.

While I would never disagree with a person arguing that ""Requiem"" is a powerful testimony against drug use, I strongly object to any equating of the film with reality.  We cannot get ahead of ourselves -- this and other movies reflect stories that in no way can be regarded as more than fiction.  I argue that if you're going to spend the money to see a film at the theater, it may as well be something uplifting; don't we see enough tragedy and loss in life as it is?  With that off my chest, I want to say that while effective in delivering its ultimate anti-drug message, ""Requiem"" is a rather unsurprising cinematic effort.  As soon as a couple fundamental plot elements have been set in place, it becomes pretty apparent that the characters' lives will be going in a particular direction.  It's that expected direction which prevents the film's impact from being as powerful as it could have been.

Aronofsky uses every trick he learned in film school: split screens, fast motion, slow motion, extreme closeups, trick photography, repetitive shots, etc. While he no doubt thinks he is being innovative, his repeated attempts to call attention to himself is simply annoying and distracting. Someone should take his camera away for assault on the audience with a deadly weapon. There is a good score performed by the Kronos Quartet."

","Very exaggerated film, but has two hot points: How much bad thing is television - if you sit all day watching shows and drug addiction. Exaggerated situations -according to this story- happen to the heroes (madness etc,) and the point is, that -as for the drugs addiction we don't understand how occurred to the couple of the story, as for the girl, it is enough clear that she suffers from a sort of mental disease- but for the son, it is not clear how he got involved in drugs - the friendship with the other dealer, or money hunting is not enough explained how it becomes a good reason to get into drugs. Mother's madness to the end is the main reason of the exaggeration of the scenario. A point to mention is that from that point it is a good thing to accuse mental institutions and the methods they use to interfere in illness. Also before that atrocious end, it is well explained how bad thing are pills for loosing weight. Despite all that, acting from all four actors is superb, movie's rhythm also."

","This is one of those movies I heard would 'change my life,' that I HAD to see it because it was SO profound.<br/><br/>Well, to me, it wasn't. Honestly, it's just a bunch of drug clichés, loosely latched together with a sad storyline. The familiar subject matter and emotions it instigates are of course authentic, and therefore relevant to many people, but again exploting drug culture better than any film before it doesn't seem to be a landmark achievement to me, it seems to be a drug film. Following this, I watched Pi by the same director and that stands as one of my most hated movies I've ever seen. Perhaps I just don't like the director, or perhaps nothing special is really going on.<br/><br/>I've been exposed to drugs plenty in real life, this is absolutely nothing new to me. Capturing some of the stigma and sadness on film? Perhaps, but some segments are quite fictitious, and I don't think this film really needs to be on the top 250 list. One mans opinion."

But recently I thought about the movie and decided to give it a shot. After all on IMDb, it's #52 on the top 250. What did I have to loose? <br/><br/>Well, this movie is a trip, and I mean an intense one. This is an excellent depiction of what drugs can do to you and the horrible graphic consequences of continuing the downward path. The acting, we have Ellen Byrnstein, one of the finest actresses, you might remember her from The Exorcist. I felt so awful for her character in the film, now she doesn't get on drugs intentionally, she just wants to loose some weight because she was picked to go on a TV show. So she starts taking diet pills that have the same drugs as speed in them, so unknowingly she continues taking them uncontrollably. Her son played by Jared Leto, his girlfriend Jennifer Conelly, and his friend Marlon Waynes are drug dealers and heavy users themselves, but continue their search for a dream like paradise.<br/><br/>This is a good movie in general when it comes to effectiveness, but the best made picture?

","It takes a lot for me to walk away from a film before the credits roll. Usually I linger around 'til the end comes around to launch a scathing and acrimonious assessment of whatever piece of garbage I happen to bear witness to. Requiem for a Dream wasn't even worth that.<br/><br/>As is, I have my bones with Darren Aronofsky as an institution. A glorified plagiarist with virtually nothing to say and a name that seems borrowed from a local dentist, so I have certain (negative) predispositions but even then I'd reckon I'm mature enough to give credit where credit is due. Alas, there's sweet bugger all by way of that.<br/><br/>Firstly, what genre is this film? Confine it to a single box and it doesn't fit the mould and that's through no act of self-awareness but rather a generous helping of amateurish directing.<br/><br/>How about Jared Leto, ladies and gentlemen? Flat and lifeless. Straining to sound like a New Yorker so he conveniently forgot to actually embody the role of a drug-addled pusher aspirant. It doesn't help that the character is written in one-dimensional fashion and is, like every other character in this flick, totally unlikable.<br/><br/>And lastly, what is this film trying to say? It just meanders (or rather aggressively juts) between one 'point' and the next without addressing anything. I spent a full hour trying to draw something away from the film that was insightful and meaningful (like how I did with Trainspotting) and realised that only an ungodly act of contrivance could do that for me.<br/><br/>You're better off not watching this. You'll gain nothing, enjoy nothing and feel nothing."

","Maybe this movie pushed the envelope when it was released but people who voted this movie into the top 100 need to watch more movies. I watched this movie tonight and anyone could predict the outcome (and each of the events that lead to it) for all four main characters in the first five minutes. The films only attempts at twists are in easily predicted fantasies and delusions. Aside from Sara I found it impossible to relate to or have any compassion for any of the remaining characters. I wished that the film makers would just hurry up and bring their story lines to their obvious conclusions. It's not that it's a horrible movie it's just ridiculously overrated ala Fight Club, Pulp Fiction etc... Not that it's a bad way to kill off a couple of hours but you won't strain any brain cells."

"RaulFerreiraZem","3","1","6","3 June 2018"," drugs are bad mmkay?
","Requiem for a dream stands as one of the most overrated films i've ever seen.
From the ridiculous over the top melodramatic one note plot to the awful uninspired dialogue to the characterless characters theres almost nothing reedeming about this film except maybe its original soundtrack.
The film tries to develop this idea that the 4 main characters have a dream and each one of them has their dream destroyed by addiction but if we have a closer look at it we can see that, for exemple, tyrese's dream has no substance at all to it, in fact we can only assume that his dream is to just be with his girlfriend since he never has time to develop as a character and the only thing the film gives us as a backstory for him is two flashbacks of him running to his mother. Tyrone is a majorly unexplored character as he has basicly no screen time at all,and when he does he is either dancing in fast forward or having sex.
Sarahs dream is to be on tv. And even though she was just fine before she got ""invited"" to be on television, once she does, she starts to obsess over losing weight to fit her dress to the point where she gets addicted to amphetamines.
Marion's dream is to be a fashion designer, but she ultimately has no idea whatsoever what that means since all she ever does is cut pictures off of magazines and all we're shown in terms of her chasing her dreams is a ""i worked some numbers out and this could really work"" by harry. 
Harry's dream is pretty much just be a boyfriend to marion and have enough money to get his fix.
Anyway all of this goes under when for some reason which the movie refuses to show us(instead he rather show us 5 different scenes of sarah allucinating) the gangs(which ones?the movie doesnt know either) go on war and the drug market is mostly emptied.
The sole fact that Aronofsky thought it would be better to water down the film with repetitive montages than actually showing the reasons behind the gang conflict is enought to label this as a bad movie but whatever.
The ending seems really rushed and forced. The police had no reason to arrest tyrone since driving a drug addict to the hospital is not a crime and they didnt have enought to get a mandate to search his car and find his drugs, and if staying in the hospital lobby was risky then why didnt tyrone just leave harry there and left?
its almost like aronofsky had this ending envisioned but didnt really bother to make it seem convincing
At the end of it not even the cool soundtrack can move me,not when i can see that anti drug moralism was the driving force behind this film. The characters are undeveloped, the photography is okay, the soundtrack is kind of cool but it is overused, the ending seems really forced and unrealistic and overall this film has a really moralistic exploitative feel to it.
not great, not good, its actually pretty bad

Naturally, having read such rave reviews I expected a great movie.<br/><br/>I was wrong. Very, very wrong.<br/><br/>I thought that I had found the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" of drug movies but instead I had found a movie with average to sub-par acting and a plot which contains every cliché from the genre. The only things commendable about this title are the soundtrack and the directing, and to be entirely honest, this isn't even director Darren Aronofsky's best work.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER BELOW!!******* <br/><br/>The film follows the exploits of three dumb kids (a white guy, a white girl and a token black guy) as well as a vain and insecure woman. The three dumb kids, who have no brains and less virtue, decide to make some quick and easy money by pushing illegal drugs onto their local community. One day, the token black in the group encourages them to 'sample' the product and they all become addicted to heroin. At this time, the vain and insecure woman, in a separate story arc, decides to opt-out of a rigorous weight loss program by taking addictive weight loss pills instead. The movie is a bit vague but I expect that she is taking some sort of methamphetamine, which were once marketed in the west as a weight loss product.<br/><br/>To cut a very, very long story short, the white guy contracts gangrene from dirty needles and loses his left arm. The white girl decides to whore herself out for drug money and, finding that the money is insufficient, starts doing live sex shows instead. The black guy ends up in jail (bet you didn't see that coming) and the vain and insecure older woman lands up in an Asylum after the methamphetamine's rewire her brain.<br/><br/>Now that's a ground-breaking, creative and interesting plot right? Right??? I didn't think so either.<br/><br/>So why did the other reviewers give this movie such wild reviews? Now that, kind sir, is a damn good question. My only explanations are that either I am extremely insensitive to the shock value of these sorts of movies or the other reviewers have grown up and live in pillow-walled hug boxes. My money is on the latter option.<br/><br/>I give this film a 4/10 ranking because of its soundtrack and directing and believe me, I am being extremely generous. <br/><br/>This film is worth seeing if you are interested in directing from a technical standpoint as the director has a very unique and interesting style. As an entertainment product - don't bother. Save yourself an hour and a half and watch something else."

While well acted, the direction is severely lacking and under educated .Each character arc is played out too quickly and we're expected to believe that a 6 month addiction to amphetamines is so severe, it leads to psychosis that only electric shock therapy can cure. One falls in to sex slavery after a few weeks without heroin, another loses an arm and the last is jailed, basically for being black. While addiction is a terrible thing, the main theme of the film seems to be massively under researched and over sensationalised."

","""Requiem for a Dream"" is an adaptation of a novel by Hubert Selby Jr., with a script credited to Selby and director Darren Aronofsky. It basically spins a yarn about the utter horror of lives ruined by drug addiction, focusing on four pathetic characters from Coney Island. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is an aged couch potato, dreaming of TV stardom, who gets hooked on diet pills. Her son Harry (Jared Leto) and his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are determined to make a big score; Marion (Jennifer Connelly) is Harry's girlfriend.<br/><br/>Right from the start, it's clear that this will not be a conventionally told narrative. Aronofsky leans heavily on quick cuts, and a wealth of imagery. In fact, his film is stylized to the point of utter insanity. It's definitely not to all tastes, and spends so much time having the characters wallow in misery that it inevitably comes as a relief when the film ends. It's that potent. It does take a while to grab hold, but holding it together is Burstyn's incredible performance. This viewer thought that her character was the most sympathetic, even in her delusion. All four leads deliver compelling performances, but hers is truly something special.<br/><br/>The supporting cast features a number of familiar and reliable actors: Christopher McDonald (as a motivational speaker), Louise Lasser, Keith David, Mark Margolis, Ajay Naidu, Peter Maloney, Dylan Baker; Selby appears on screen as a laughing guard.<br/><br/>Selby and Aronofsky play all of this with grim conviction. At no point did this viewer really believe that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel. There are moments in this that are truly bizarre (like hallucinations involving a refrigerator), making the whole film take on the tones of an absurd nightmare.<br/><br/>Not necessarily an ""entertaining"" film (at least, not in any conventional sense), but it is very effective in what it does.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."

","Requiem for a Dream follows the lives of four individuals who use drugs on Coney Island. As their dependency grows, their relationships start to set them apart. Each person develops their own unique brand of personal hell.<br/><br/>All of Darren Aronofsky's past work has an underlying theme of obsession. In Black Swan, a ballerina puts everything including her mental stability on the line for the pursuit of perfection. In The Fountain, a doctor struggles through space and time to cure death. In Pi, a mathematician pushes the limits researching a number that could serve as the blueprint of the universe. Requiem for a Dream is no exception, following Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) as they live out the life of heroin addicts. Harry's mother (Oscar nominated Ellen Burstyn) finds herself on a different fix, but the outcomes of all four characters are horrible and painful to watch.<br/><br/>The style of the film is polished and cut frequently (it has more than double the cuts of an average movie). One of the most distinguishing aesthetics of Requiem for a Dream is the clever use of split screen. The dual screen isn't presented to show collages of multiple actions in plot, but to illustrate the mental divide between each person. Even though a connection seems to be present in certain scenes, the characters are separated by their true motives and growing individual dependencies.<br/><br/>As beautifully and creatively put together this film is (the soundtrack is iconic as well), it is ironic that the majority of people watching already know the horrors of doing hard drugs. Requiem would be far more effective as a movie about self destructive substances to teens, but because of the explicit sex, language and violence it will never happen. If it were to be used in place of drug education videos, you certainly wouldn't see a classroom of sleepy eyed students waiting for the bell to ring."

","This movie is so real and painful, which makes it so worth watching. Four healthy though unsatisfied people had their own set of dreams, which slowly warped into an obsession, then it gets disturbing as the obsession begins to take over their lives, ruining them. It shows how we are able to f* ourselves up because of the things we want, sometimes even involuntary desires. The cinematography and the pacing of the movie had a freakish effect on inducing an unpleasant feeling in me, but in a good way. The movie starts out pretty normal, as if nothing could really go that bad, but as the story progresses, disturbing thoughts of what may happen begins to creep in. Most of the shots of this movie is taken so that the audience experience exactly how the character is feeling, I must say that certain compositions are unique and are never seen before. A must watch if you're of mature age."

","Requiem for a Dream depicts a story of a retired mother, Sara Goldfarb, living in an apartment all by herself - only having her neighborly friends living near. Her son, Harry, is a drug dealer and an addict, along with his pal Tyrone, and his girlfriend Marion, whom wished that she could be a fashion designer.<br/><br/>Sara spends most of her time watching her favourite reality show on TV. One day, she gets selected to appear on that show. She wishes to go on with her special red dress but cannot fit in it due to her weight. She goes on a diet but doesn't seem to all work that well. Her next choice is diet pills, which wasn't a very good idea. Sara starts taking them irregularly and develops an addiction.<br/><br/>Harry, Tyrone and Marion on the other hand, struggle to keep up in the drug business and begin losing money and drugs.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, we see all of this get worse as their addictions spiral out of control.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is really sickening and it breaks all expectations. It is absolutely fantastic but not one of those films you would feel comfortable watching twice (although I have watched it more than twice). Every actor in this film play their roles brilliantly, especially Ellen Burstyn. It's incredibly gut- wrenching. The directing and writing by Darren Aronofsky is phenomenal.

","Great art brings clarity. The art itself may be about deception or confusion or disillusion, but the artist finds clarity and purpose. This is why it is so important for art to take on 'sensitive' topics. As much as the moral guardians would like to imagine that the problems of the world would vanish into thin air if they were swept under the rug, this is not the case.<br/><br/>We are confronted with these topics, and we contemplate them and interact with them, whether directly, indirectly, or hypothetically, but our viewpoints are small and biased, naught but ethereal pockets floating in the air, cloudy with our perspectives and shrouded by our worst features, our doubts and prejudices and nagging thoughts that we know aren't true but tag around anyway.<br/><br/>Great art bypasses these pockets. It is not ethereal or intangible; it is substantial and corporal, like a tower or a bridge or a skyscraper. It takes the thoughts and feelings that are impossible for us to understand by ourselves and projects them into the realm of reality. Great art's light isn't always white, but it is always bright, blinding even, blinding enough to sweep away the darkness, which is not anger or sadness or any number of unpleasant emotions, but rather ignorance and dividedness, the corrupted cloud of not knowing.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is a film that embodies this truth more than most any I have seen. It is a film that makes order out of chaos. It does not reduce chaos to order, mind you. It takes the chaos and lays it out in the light, revealing its true nature. The impulses and choices and situations shown in this film are some of the darkest there are, but the powerful direction of Aronofsky lays them out in full color, divorcing them from the perceptions we have in our heads, demystifying them while hitting us with them full force.<br/><br/>If you're a lover of music, or you've at least seen Amadeus, you'd know what a requiem is: a Mass for the dead. Requiem for a Dream, thus, is a Mass for the dreams of the characters, which die throughout the film. If you know the definition of the word requiem, the end result of this film isn't be that surprising. It's not trying to be surprising. It's not trying to pull one over on you, to hit you with a twist. This is not a Nolan or Scorsese film, a flight of demented fancy.<br/><br/>It is a march to death, to demise, to ruin.<br/><br/>Generally, in film, strings are only used for dramatic scenes. Think the use of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings in the climax of Platoon. In this film they play close to the beginning of the film, as two of our main characters move a TV over the opening credits. Throughout the film, variations of that same piece come up over and over again, as do many of the film's montages and cinematic tricks.<br/><br/>This is not a fragile film, one that sways back and forth through its runtime. It is sturdy. It stays put. It is unbreakable. It breaks you. Empire rated this the #1 most depressing film of all time, and I find it hard to disagree. It is common in depressing pieces of literature or cinema for the characters to discuss their dreams and ambitions. In most films, the artist lets you feel, at least for a second, that these dreams are possible. This film offers no such illusions. It brushes your wishes to the side and descends into deeper and darker territory, the cuts getting faster and faster until all sense of life and hope have been lost to the unrelenting march of despair.<br/><br/>Some films sweep you away. This film pounds at you until you are a gray puddle of goo. But then it ends, and after one last rendition of the title theme, you hear waves and seagulls. You are free to pick yourself up and put yourself back together. Resonance pounds through your bones. And around the time you put the last piece of yourself back, you realize you have experienced one of the greatest pieces of art of all time."

Those flashbacks or whatever they're called are not necessary. Four lives four different paths and endings. Movie was strong and put us directly in struggles of characters as they try to do their best to keep themselves sane and high. The thing about mother is on shaky road, doctor prescribes four different medications but they are probably the same only thing different is dosage as is written on them and he does that easily without thought some people might start to use them all at once as she did. After a while she got addicted and got crazy just like that but there is thing that she wanted to be famous so that destroyed her easily because she was not fit to take it just like that. Addiction that went towards sweet went on medications and it was worse then before. Movies shows us power, struggle, expectations, need and greed and it does it in unique way. 3.5/4"

But this is not a defect. In fact, its the greatest quality of this film: it changes the way we think. Shocking and assertive, it shows how a person is able to dispose of their own luck, focusing on what he want and wasting the good things he already have. And the more disturbing becomes when we recognize, in the attitudes of the characters, our own attitudes or people we know. Decidedly, its a film that puts anyone thinking, it was made for this and not as entertainment.<br/><br/>The script is exceptional, the concept is innovative. The way the director drove all the work is very competent and was decisive for the final result. Speaking about final, the end of the film is disturbing and not recommended for sensitive people, as well as several other scenes. The actors performance is good, particularly Ellen Burstyn, who is unrecognizable in her role. The sets and costumes are regular.

You can hear if long after the movie's over. Ringing in your ears, there is a kind of chill associated with it.

Their tragic consequences are as unlikely as the dreams of grandeur they lovingly nurture. All of the flaws to realism should make it apparent to the viewer that these are not the actual circumstances, but are instead the nightmares of feeling as the dream slips away. It's a story of people desperately fighting to rise above their reality, while descending further into the murky mess of addiction. Do they really end up in the brutal condition the movie leaves them? Of course not--that is just a different kind of fantasy, the fantasy of fear that has replaced their summer fantasy of hope and belief.

I'm glad I did. This movie is incredible. The first 15/20 minutes I did find a bit slow but that's just me. I need to be hooked from the offset otherwise I start drifting. Once the story developed I found every second compelling. The visual effects are neat and adds to stimulate your own mind rather than the film itself. This film is clever in that it puts you in the mind of the character and you understand every thought they are thinking. By the end of this movie I was so engulfed and on the edge of my seat. Each character faces horrific circumstances but hey isn't this the moral of the story to brainwash the fact that drugs are bad.

For example, for most of the film, the heroin shooting is shown only as a collection of objects, all shown in the same order: powder, spoon, flame, needle, dilated pupil. Or a popped pill.<br/><br/>In keeping with the minimalist approach, the three young main characters are one-dimensional. The older character, who is the mother of one of the two young men in the film, is fleshed out more, but still doesn't rise to a level where we can identify her as a distinct person. (Ellen Burstyn was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award for this role in the film.) Like a piece of minimalist music, the film beats on the same instrument throughout, with slight changes in intensity as the only variant. The soundtrack was provided, appropriately, by the Kronos Quartet, which adds to the relentless, droning atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>But we are dealing here with drug addiction, an enormously complicated and personal thing that doesn't submit to the minimalist technique. No internal or external causes are provided for why the young characters picked up the needle in the first place. Fate isn't that interesting.<br/><br/>The three young characters begin the film as happy heroin shooters, but when their supply is cut off, they become very unhappy heroin shooters. That's essentially the plot for them. The mother character is also broken at the beginning. She is a widow whose son is always off pawning her TV to score drugs. Her only solace comes from watching the recording of an inane TV infomercial that promises salvation through weight loss. She becomes obsessed with recovering her youth. On the advice of a friend, she visits The Most Negligent Doctor in Brighton Beach (the American Brighton), who prescribes buckets of diet pills.<br/><br/>The film then shows the decline of all four characters into their various forms of degradation. Mom ends up committed to a mental institution. We are shown three of her electro-shock therapy treatments. The son and his partner in scoring heroin end up getting caught in a Southern state on a trip to Florida to score. The son is seen shooting heroin into a necrotic vein; the arm eventually has to be amputated above the elbow. His partner we see writhing in withdrawal symptoms on a prison bed, there being no treatment for him in the unenlightened correctional facility where he is held. The son's former girlfriend becomes a sex worker at private parties to support her habit.<br/><br/>Which is all very gruesome of course, and earned the film notoriety for its harrowing last 20 minutes. Still, it seems mechanical and pointlessly cruel. The ends each of these characters finds is of course realistic; the fact that all of them meet such horrific ends is less so. So the artificiality of the movie eventually works against it. The lack of any knowledge of the characters' motivations is unsatisfying. There is only horror instead of compassion.<br/><br/>There were no dreams, and a requiem is an entirely different kind of music.<br/><br/>A much better film in the genre of heroin-will-ruin-you-seriously, is ""Trainspotting"". Better music, real people, and even humor."

Highly recommended.I have never, ever felt as disturbed, shocked or affected by a film as this. Showing the consequences of indulging yourself with drugs has never came more to view than in this film. The characters fall succumb to their addiction and fail to leave them, having them imprisoned, restrained within an insane asylum, and end up as an amputee in a hospital, only to be waiting to be carried to prison shortly after. If there was a movie to change people's views and thoughts on urban life, this would definitely be it.

","I first watched this film with a friend but I didn't pay a great deal of attention. After remembering the title and reading reviews, I bought it.

Quite a dull beginning with a lot of speech but the back story really heightens the dramatic ending. I love the directing specifically in Requiem for a dream.

","Before he directer movies about Noah's Ark, Darren Aronofsky had a set of skills behind the camera that incorporated audiences into his films like no other independent filmmaker. In his darkest and most profound work ""Requiem For a Dream,"" we engage with four lives ruined by a dangerous aspect of our society- drugs. Four different addicts all see their lives crumble into pieces from seemingly habitual drug usage that unfolds into a mind-shattering and destructive addiction. Sara (Ellen Burstyn in a profound performance) is a lonely widow hooked on diet pills while her son Harry (Jared Leto) is a junkie hooked on heroin with his lost girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his buddy. All four characters have desires and goals that get crushed by the addiction of drugs that flat-out ruin their lives. With flawless details on the atrocities and horrors of drug abuse, Aronofsky shows you everything bad about drugs. He shows you, not tells you. Aronofsky has done something special. He makes you feel as if your the one using drugs, not the characters. Instead of watching various failures abuse themselves, he places you inside their skin through his kinetic and speedy camera-work and the artistic cinematography composed on dark lighting and terrifying sounds to drag you into a brutal and flawless nightmare. With legendary performances and a diverse range of people to show how drug abuse can happen to any people of any race, age, or gender, ""Requiem For a Dream"" is an important classic useful for educating the public on drug addiction and on how to get the blood pumping from an audience while simultaneously swooping them off their feet. Arronofsky and sacrificially Ellen Burstyn deliver work for the ages that can only haunt you and stick in you gut like an actual drug."
"Gideon24","8","0","1","6 March 2015"," A Harrowing Look at Addiction
","The war against drugs, of which we are fighting a losing battle, was effectively brought to the screen in 2000 in Traffic but the reason we are fighting this battle, the horrors of drug addiction itself and what it can bring you to, was the focus of another winner from 2000 called Requiem for a Dream, a bone-chilling look at the horror of drug addiction and the virus that the business behind it has become.<br/><br/>The film, brilliantly realized by director Darren Aronofsky, weaves together three stories about drug addiction that clearly demonstrate that addiction does not discriminate and that no matter how an addiction starts or for what alleged positive purpose was its genesis, once the line has been crossed from recreational use into addiction (and we never know when that line is actually crossed), we all begin the same swift, downward spiral into a quicksand of consequences that usually leads to one of three places: jails, institutions, or death.<br/><br/>The primary and most heartbreaking story revolves around a middle-aged woman named Sara Goldfarb, played by Ellen Burstyn, in a powerhouse performance that should have won her an Oscar, who begins taking diet pills so that she can fit into a particular dress that she wants to wear when she appears on her favorite television show, an event for which she has been planning for years, but has received no confirmation that it's actually going to happen. This story is particularly unsettling to watch because when we think of drug abuse we don't think about middle-aged women and we don't think about diet pills as being dangerous, but Sara's obsession to lose weight takes her to such a dark place that she starts hallucinating that her refrigerator is talking to her. Burstyn effortlessly imbues Sara with a sadness and confusion about what is happening to her that is positively haunting.<br/><br/>Jared Leto plays Sara's son, Harry, a recreational drug user who is so deeply steeped in his own addiction that he doesn't see what is happening to his mother and decides that he and his running partner (Marlon Wayans), should start selling drugs but really don't have a clue as to what they're doing, evidenced by their complete ignorance about the first rule of selling drugs: Don't get high on your own supply. Watching Harry and his buddy's downfall is so pathetic because we can see all the mistakes they are making even if they don't.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly turns in the performance of her career as Harry's girlfriend, Marian, whose casual use of drugs with Harry gets so out of control that Harry can't keep enough drugs around for her so she has to go elsewhere looking for them and doesn't care what she has to do to get that high she so desperately craves. Marian's addiction finds her taking prostitution to a dangerous place she never imagined, yet at the same time, not terribly concerned about how easy it is to get what she wants, using nothing more than her body.<br/><br/>Hubert Selby's screenplay, based on his own book, pulls no punches and offers no apologies for this twisted look at drug addiction that, to the uninitiated viewer might seem a little over-the-top, but for those who have ever dealt with addiction or love someone who has dealt with it, there are emotions and events and images presented here that have a basis in reality. <br/><br/>Aronofsky's bold directorial vision and some spectacular performances, especially Ellen Burstyn, make this film worth watching...it's not an easy watch, but there are rewards to be had here and it might actually make you think twice the next time someone offers to buy you a beer."

","Pretty safe to say I've never squirmed my way through a movie as much as I did for this one. I'm not as squeamish as I used to be over the sight of physical damage to the human body, but Harry (Jared Leto) sticking that needle into his already severely abused arm caused me to turn my head more than once. I'm reading what an impact this film had on other reviewers here and I'm pretty convinced this is as powerful an anti-drug message as one could find anywhere. ""Trainspotting"" made it's point just as well on the other side of the pond some years earlier, but this one brings it closer to home. Aronofsky's style is manipulative in a way and tended to grate on me after a while, but when you think about it, that's the way it is with addiction. It requires users to use a split screen personality to hide their dependency while engaging in hyper-kinetic repetition to maintain a high. Ellen Burstyn's performance was magnificent and to my thinking, deserved the Oscar that went to Julia Roberts for ""Erin Brokovich"". Leto and Connelly were convincing in their portrayals, though comparing their roles today to a decade ago shows how much they've grown as actors. I haven't seen Wayans as much so I don't want to short change him, but he did a fine job here as well. This isn't the kind of movie you simply watch and forget about, it's haunting message and grotesque visuals will stay with you long after the film is over."

","If you want to watch something to relax and entertain then don't watch this. It is not Hollywood mainstream. <br/><br/>A blockbuster in its own right though. A blockbuster of extreme, graphic, an in your face film of what happens when you take drugs. <br/><br/>The end is extreme with the four lives portrayed in the film but real. Real as it did happen back in the time period it is set in and today still does perhaps different respects. <br/><br/>Electric shock treatment is not as common place perhaps now but illustrates how extremely brutal people can be, uneducated and irresponsible e.g. the doctors. It reminds me of the Hitler era, medical leadership leading to the extremely brutal treatment of others who only really need clean living and companionship. <br/><br/>As of the other characters, they depict more real reality but with no help to hand. Too many people slant drug users as scum etc. but the reality is, if life gets too tough and goes not go to plan it could flip anyone to drugs and it is then time to help these people in the right way.<br/><br/>The film perhaps makes one as ask where is the real justice, compassion and above all human rights and human hands extended to others in need of help. People just really in desperate need of help to come off drugs and turn there life around to get some sort of normality and happiness back.<br/><br/>In summary, I felt sick watching it at points, even dizzy but not in a true sense. However, if you want to educate yourself about the extreme sadness and horribleness that drugs can lead to then watch it and there are worse cases no doubt.<br/><br/>The acting is fine and must have been difficult to get into character.

","The story is not that great. Sure it comes from a rarely used basic premise of addicts and junkies, but the story unfolds so very predictably. The thing that makes it special is the execution, of how all the technical stuff bind together to create a hallucinating movie experience. Moreover, I watched this movie right after I spent the night before in lacking sleep. It took me some minutes to clear things up and get back on stuff. The technical stuff and I mean all of them, the fast- forward style, the coloration selection, all the messed up camera angles, the irritating and ever-present music scoring, and of course, the gruesome scenes of the consequences make this movie strong in conveying the message of how messed up the life of a junkie is and will be even more. I praise the acting performance by the four main cast. It's clear then how Leto, Connelly and Wayans can gain the trust of some of the big production names to cast them on later works. But I especially salute Ellen Burstyn for her performance that is able to portray the most physically irritating changes of what will happen to a junkie's body. Yet again I give this movie a 6 out of 10 score because in my opinion it is not very suitable for an entertainment. It does help to convey the message of never touch addictive substance for good."

","As director Darren Aronofsky's second feature film, Requiem for a Dream is also his best. Through its graphic and hard-hitting depictions of drug abuse, the film also serves as a lesson on the American Dream and the impossibility of ever truly achieving it.<br/><br/>The story of Requiem for a Dream revolves around four addicts living on Coney Island. The first is Sara, an elderly woman who has been selected to appear as a contestant on her favorite game show. Determined to lose her stout figure for the show, Sara becomes addicted to weight loss pills that cause her to slowly lose her grasp on reality. Her son Harry, along with his girlfriend Marion and his best friend Tyrone, is a heroin addict who becomes a dealer in order to feed his addiction and to help Marion open a fashion store. The three of them run into innumerable problems, however. Harry's arm becomes horrendously infected due to the repeated use of unclean needles. Sara looses her mind completely. Marion descends into prostitution to continue her worsening addiction and Tyrone is caught in the middle of a gang shooting which he barely escapes. By the end of the film, which I won't go into too much detail, the four have lost everything they hold dear.<br/><br/>As I had previously stated, this film acts as a metaphor for the elusive American Dream. Sara, Harry, Tyrone, and Marion all had a dream of their own that they ultimately failed to achieve. Sara wished to be grand prize winning contestant on the game show, but her addiction became so severe that it drove her insane. Harry and Marion wanted to settle down together and open a store together, but their addictions drive them apart and they finally descend into depravity. Tyrone simply wants to make his mother proud, but his actions end up costing him his freedom. The events of this film suggest that, whether ones actions are good or bad, the American Dream is something that can never truly be achieved. Every choice that we make has a consequence. It is not only drug dependency that hinders ones success, but also issues of money, power, violence, and racial, gender, and sexual tolerance that contribute to the death of our dreams. Perhaps this is what the title of the film, Requiem for a Dream, stands for.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is an incredibly powerful, moving, and haunting film that stays with you long after the end credits have rolled. The film's performances, particularly Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto as Sara and Harry, are all top-notch and unforgettable. Keep in mind that this film contains some very unsettling and grim situations and imagery, but those who can bear through it will love the film as I do. This is one of my top ten favorite films of all time."

I am a fan of many movies / directors on the dark side but this one was just too much for me. I am a huge David Lynch fan, I am a huge Gregg Araki fan, and even a huge Darren Aronofsky fan, and I would never say this isn't a good or worthwhile film, but I was not glad I saw this movie and would not recommend it to others unless perhaps, as was the case with at least one review here, the viewer is facing addiction issues and needs a kick in the pants. <br/><br/>This film started very low and I watched in horror as it continued to redefine my comprehension of low; a momentum that both grew in intensity and continued till the very last moment of the film. I may have been able to appreciate this storytelling a little bit more if I had liked the characters more. With the exception of the character played by Wayans, I had very little or no sympathy for these people on such a startling downward spiral. They seemed doomed to lose from the start and it was no surprise at all that their lives were not turned around; that is, as I said, with the exception of the character played by Wayans, who it seemed had some very real redeeming qualities but was not strong enough to withstand the overwhelming power of the downward momentum of those in his sphere. But how low those characters did go. It just hurt too much for characters that I mostly didn't even like."

Yet, you can't help but be drawn in to their characters, to feel nothing but the utmost sympathy for four helpless, hopeless drug addicts that spiral into a form of life barely worth describing. <br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn is incredible. Darren Arenofsky has created a masterpiece. I can never watch this film again, but my god am I glad I watched it once. Incredible."

","Requiem for a Dream is an astonishing and life changing movie directed by Darren Aronofsky. While definitely for mature audiences only, I believe one can gain a better perspective of drug addiction by watching the film. The story is startlingly too real and will leave the viewer on the edge of their seat with an eerie feeling of depressing doom. Aronofsky uses this film to portray dark truths of drug addiction through the eyes of the addict, giving us insight into a darker place many Americans are affected by. As a viewer, one is drawn into the minds of four not so unordinary people affected through their drug use in the most artistic and touching story. While there are many false illusions, the reality of dead ends and inevitable doom is always hiding in the darkness.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream takes place in New York City. We follow the lives of heroin addict Harry Goldfarb, his mother Sarah, his girlfriend Marion, and his best friend Tyrone played by Marlon Wayan(The Wayans Bros). Harry, Marion, and Tyrone all have dreams of bright futures and start selling heroin to raise money. As they begin to make money, all three characters seem to be happy. Their illusions of happiness and partial success are most likely due to their increasing drug use throughout the movie. Aronofsky does a wonderful job using quickly cutting scenes to show them getting high. As their drug use increases these cut scenes become more frequent and quickly paced. One begins almost to not even notice. This greatly helps to show how drugs, particularly heroin, cause Harry, Marion, and Tyrone to slide faster and faster into their worsening addictions.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, Sarah spends her time as a lonely mother and widow alone in her apartment watching infomercials. Harry's mom is lucky enough to be invited to be featured on her favorite show for an episode hosted by Tabby Timmons. This is a dream come true! She decides she must wear her favorite red dress she wore to Harry's graduation on the set. This becomes the beginning of her downfall upon realizing she has gained weight and that the dress no longer fits. In effect, she visits a quack doctor who is quick to prescribe her weight loss pills which are actually speed. Now Sarah spends her days heavily medicated on increasing doses of amphetamines. She sits high and endlessly watches her infomercials, anxiously awaiting a letter from Tabby Timmons to follow up on her invitation to be a television star.<br/><br/>As another season passes, the beginning of the end starts to unfold. Tyrone gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time and is thrown into jail. Harry and Marion spend most of their money to bond him out. New York City also begins to go into a heroin drought due to gangs and violence. With limited money and supply of drugs, Harry, Marion, and Tyrone begin to grow more and more desperate. The more they need money, the more morals get tossed out the window. At this point all false signs of happiness have been removed. Sarah is growing delusional and extremely dependent on her balance of speed during the day and depressants to sleep at night. Her prescriptions cause her to fall in to a fantasy land of television and food pushing her to insanity.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the ending, one must know that it is not a happy one. Driven by desperation, Tyrone and Harry decide to drive down the entire east coast to Florida in search of drugs. This irrational act leaves Marion and Sarah in New York remaining in their own desperation. It is a fact that hard drug addiction primarily ends by placing individuals in jails, institutions, and even death. Our four characters undergo great personality changes throughout the movie resulting from their savage addictions. None of them fall short of these endings either, but one must watch the movie to find out for themselves.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is one of my favorite movies because its intense story line and artistic style of filming. This psychological thriller also has an educational aspect in the fact it teaches viewers the dangers of drug use. How appetizing do the words amputations, prostitution, murders, prisons, and electroshock therapy sound? These are few of the many things Aronofsky uses as examples to provide warnings not to fall into the dark culture of drug addiction. This film leaves me with little negative feedback. I believe it paints a perfectly dark and somewhat gruesome picture of reality. The music selections and artistic scenes go hand in hand in creating their own unique type of beauty. One cannot put into words the cycle of drug addiction. It is a place where people find themselves alone and helpless. This movie is great because it allows us to experience the pain and sorrow from the safety of our couch. Any movie that is able to withdraw emotions from me, whether good or bad, is a movie that was made correctly. Requiem for a Dream is extremely emotional, and it leaves the viewer feeling breathless and alone.<br/><br/>Above sits a desperate and lonely Harry contacting his love, Marion, from a payphone.<br/><br/>In conclusion, someone is truly missing out if they do not watch Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream. While the subject matter remains touchy for some and downright depressing for all, this movie has a bluntly real plot with the potential to change lives. Drugs are bad, and there is no better way to show this other than being a junkie and living out a more personal horror story. Becoming a desperate drug addict is obviously not a wise choice, so I recommend watching the film instead."

The camera went unflinchingly to the bare ugly fact to addiction when a tightly cut sequence of the depraved prognostics enduring their punishment(*ss to ass underground sex show and electric therapy and amputation surgeon )with contrast to the fleetingness of the pleasure it brings us(the fast-paced and highly simplified shots implies the swiftness of consumption of drugs) and their greater hope for the future, whether realizable or not. The daring visual way is so well suited in this particular movie that any other movie's possible usage will appear to be a pretentious failure to me. This film is the kind of film that you are not willing to go through again, not because of its quality, but the uneasiness it gives you is so cumbersome and memorable that it's like you yourself's personal travelogue to the grave."

","If you watch the films of Darren Aronofsky you know that they are dark and often about how life can be tragic and often near the end or on the way out. And I finally watched this classic cult gem ""Requiem for a Dream"" and this film is indeed gritty and dark as it shows how the themes and issues of media propaganda, culture, lust, and substance abuse can control and overtake life as we know it. Set in the depressed area along the abandoned beaches of the Coney Island in New York you have a lonely widow in the legendary Ellen Burstyn who all she lives for is to watch TV in her apartment as the info salesman is selling more and more on her as it will take her wallet and her soul. Along with that her son Harry(in one of Jared Leto's first roles)is a drug addict as he lives for a heroin needle to be stuck in his arm and his buddy Tyrone(Marlon Wayans) is the king street dealer who helps supply it all. To round out the trio is Harry's girlfriend Marion(Jennifer Connelly)who will sell her body with lust for drugs, money or any favor she can get. This is a film that shows people with no hope will gain happiness thru addiction, yet it showcases just how powerful addiction in the form of media propaganda, substance abuse, and selling the body can overtake one's life. Overall this is a dark and powerful satire of addiction that one must see."

"koromofanboi","10","0","1","6 December 2013"," One of the most brutal, devastating accounts of addiction in media
","""Requiem for a Dream"" is not so much a film as it is a groundbreaking achievement in all aspects. One would not expect an ""anti-drug"" film to work as well as this one does, but ""Requiem"" is not an ""anti-drug"" preach in the traditional sense; it covers four people's lives and the downward spiral they all individually go on as their journey into drugs progresses.<br/><br/>The first half-an-hour or so is excellent at building up a kind of suspense rivaled only by that of someone like, say, Stanley Kurbick. For this half-hour, the characters are at their happiest places; but due to drug use, something sinister is lurking around the corner, and from the start you know this will never be a happy film, as despite how accustomed these characters seem to drugs, the viewer knows this will never be the same throughout the film.<br/><br/>The first act ends and everything for the characters goes downhill from there. As expected, each character is given a distinct personality - the most instantly notable performance here, in my opinion, is probably Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb, the mother of Harry, one of the three teen protagonists. In one of Burstyn's most intense performances, she is a complex and confused woman; perhaps her story is the saddest because her addiction was not at her will. Still, character development as a whole is nearly perfect in this movie - all building up to the devastating, tragic ending which is instantly one of the most regretful and depressing scenes in cinema history.<br/><br/>This movie hurts to watch, due to its heavy themes and the absolute despair built up from the very beginning, and all climaxing down in the brutally tragic ending. ""Requiem for a Dream"" will make teenagers - and adults alike - hesitant to ever do the drugs they may have dreamed of once. Essential, but not an easy watching experience."

It does not really care about the people watching it, it'll just go on with it's own stuff.<br/><br/>The story of this movie is excellent, honestly fantastic. It kept me on the edge of my seat all the time watching it (even though it is not a thriller, but a drama). The story honestly scared me, and I usually don't get scared by movies. It was even scarier then all horror movies out there. IT's scary because of how realistic it is, the consequences in this movie can happen in real life (DO NOT DO DRUGS, PEOPLE!). The characters are perfectly portrayed in this movie by their respective actors. Fun fact: Jared Leto who played Harry in this movie actually befriended a couple junkies for this movie just so he could get an idea of how the drug problems were...he also lost a lot of weight. And let's not forget that beautiful theme tune that I am surprised didn't get an Oscar for best soundtrack.<br/><br/>Requiem For A Dream is one of the scariest non-horror movies of all time and will to me be one of the greatest movies ever."

When I watch a movie I want to enjoy it, not cry, and I guess that's what most people think. While that's OK, from my point of view you have to watch a couple of dramas once in a while. And I warn you, Requiem for a Dream is not your usual drama.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't really criticize junkies, it just shows what happens when you try to forget about something in the past with the help of heavy drugs. But it doesn't stop there, no, it goes beyond, namely it criticizes not the dealers, not the crystal business, but the pharmaceutical industry, that's right, because you can also become a drug addict legally, all you need is a doctor to sign you a piece of paper.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything so I'm going to stop right here.<br/><br/>Long story short, this a movie that'll change the way you think about pharmaceutics.

"marrya-ma","Null","0","1","27 November 2013"," Movie Review
","It is natural for every human being to crave and yearn for a fixation. Whether it its alcohol, drugs, sex, media, or food, everyone is enamored on something or the other. Innate compulsion. In Requiem for a Dream, we understand what happens when your addiction deludes you, and that some addictions are metaphors for others. What is worse is that substances that are illegal are the only ones deemed immoral. In this film, we learn that it makes no difference whether society has deemed it morally remiss or not, if you rely on a material substance as a means to survive, with the exception of food and sex, then you are no different than a regular drug addict. <br/><br/>The film introduces Sarah Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), who plays the role of an elderly, overweight Brooklyn widow who lives a repetitive, boring lifestyle with her peers. When she is given the opportunity to appear on a popular self-help television show, she decides she wants to lose some weight in the hopes of fitting into a small red dress that she wore years ago to her son's high-school graduation. Unable to stick to a healthy diet, which would deny her the comfort of carbohydrates, she turns to diet pills. The pills turn out to constitute for legalized ""speed,"" ultimately resulting in hyperactivity that sheds the weight, though discreditably. <br/><br/>Her troubled son, Harry (Jared Leto), begins running a small drug enterprise with the help of his best friend, Tyrone (Marlon Wayons). Though they succeed almost immediately, they become heavily addicted to the substances as the need to test the ""merchandise"" grown. Harry's girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly) becomes an advocate of theirs, though her addiction surpasses theirs, eventually leading her to a different realm altogether, one nobody could have imagined. <br/><br/>As the downward spiral begins, Harry becomes detached from his loved ones. No longer do his mother and him maintain their close ties, till the point that they begin to escape each other's memory. Harry and Tyrone become fixated on making up for the financial losses they generated by abusing their products that their friendship is put to test. Regressing into her own deteriorating world, Marion consigns to oblivion regarding everybody she knows, placing heroin as the sole key to her happiness. <br/><br/>Over the course of the movie, we learn that addiction, when turned to, always gets the best of you. The characters gradually lose consciousness of what caused them to first begin their habit as they sink lower. Gone is Sarah's ambition to lose weight, Harry's to be financially successful, and so on. The film makes clear to the viewer of the perils of substance abuse. It is formidable, it is lurid, and it is above all, penitent.<br/><br/>The transition of the characters' personalities is evident throughout the course of the film, especially Ellen Burstyn's as she hauntingly portrays the loneliness of old age and insecurity. Her transformation from innocently trusting to hopeless addict is sympathetic and disconsolate, never desperate or despondent. It was heartbreaking to watch as this plain and sincere woman watched her dreams die. <br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream ends on unsettling note. It was a thought provoking, powerful, electrifying story. Aronofsky knows that in order to properly tell a story about being entrapped, he must not make any room for the viewer to be left asking, ""Is everything going to be okay?"" Since as the film came to a conclusion, I knew that nothing was okay. At some points, the film is distressing to watch; yet at the same time, we are engrossed. In a film so much about everyday addiction, I found it appropriate that I had trouble looking away, making my ability to resist stronger."

Darren Aronofsky directs his gem with this movie. It's the movie that appears at the top of his directing resume. Jared Leto turns in the performance of a lifetime. Marlon Wayans was fantastic, turning in a performance you don't expect to see out of him. But the best acting was done by the great Ellen Burstyn. By the end of the movie, your heart feels so broken by what she's become. The transformation of her character ties a knot in your throat. There was a scene in the movie (don't worry, no spoilers) where I was sitting in my chair, watching her character progress. And I kept thinking ""stop it. Just stop it. Please.""

The one everyone loves. Because it's terrible? No. In fact, it's a very dramatic and intense soundtrack. Far too dramatic, for some of the scenes that it's put over.<br/><br/>It honestly just sucks me so far out of the moment that I can't take any scene seriously, because they use the exact same segment of the exact same song over, and over, and over again. It's almost as if the content of the scene and the emotion of the characters means nothing without music shouting ""Hey! Feel something! A dramatic thing is happening!""<br/><br/>Music is important in a movie, and can enhance a scene very much. However, this movie abuses its soundtrack. There are too many montages of bad things happening while the music plays. We get it, the characters are on a downward spiral. Show us the spiral through something other than another montage.<br/><br/>Again, this is something many people can get past without a problem. As for myself, though I find this to be a huge problem, I don't think it's a bad movie. It's nothing grand and amazing, but it's nothing terrible and embarrassing either.

","Requiem For A Dream is one of most powerful movies I've seen. Watching it scared me. It's listed as drama, but when fear is the overwhelming emotion it arouses, it is to me a horror movie, as was ""The Hotel Rwanda,"" another movie that frightened me....that one based on a real life event, RFAD based on the fictional novel of the same name by Hubert Selby, Jr. <br/><br/>Not for the faint of heart....extremely challenging to watch-----many times I wanted to look away, to have the movie stop, but could not pull myself away from watching.... high drama.<br/><br/>Here once again in cinematic history we have one of THE most amazing acting roles by male or female -- Ellen Burstyn's character of Sara Goldfarb--not given the public accreditation it deserved. That year,2001, the Oscar went to Julia Roberts for her title role in the movieErin Brockovich--- which is akin to having given the Indy 500 trophy to the car that came in 5 laps after the lead car crossed the finish. The two acting performances are so far apart---Burstyn's simply incredibly excellent, Robert's merely so-so------that they aren't comparable. Why Burstyn did not get the Academy award for this performance is...disheartening. It's almost as if Hollywood is shallow, and money-driven...?....you think?<br/><br/>Burstyn's performance blew me away. Every now and then we have an actor rise in a role to a level beyond what most actors are capable: such a performance was given by Kevin Bacon in Rocco's 1995 film ""Murder In The First."" I usually am not that enthused by Bacon's acting (sorry, Kevin) who can't seem to get out of his own way, but in this role he was spectacularly beyond himself. His character took on a persona all to itself. Similarly, Burstyn's Sara Goldfarb has a lifeforce rarely seen on screen. She went through such astounding shifts to create all of that urban mother's angst...!! I could not take my eyes away from her expressive, pain-riddled face: one scene, a hospital scene which focuses on her face, is as hallucinogenic as any I've ever seen heightened by altered lighting, color, and accelerated timing. Truly disturbing.... truly GREAT cinema. <br/><br/>The other actors are fantastic. Not a bad dramatic scene to be had. Leto, Wayans, and Connelly wear their hearts on their sleeves, and Aronofsky's direction is superb at allowing them to display that rawness. This is a movie about destruction, about loss of the self, about delusion, and failed hopes, coupled to the damaging effects of chemicals/drugs. For very good reason Burstyn's character reminds me of that amazing scene in ""Ironweed"" where Streep's Helen Archer drunkenly takes a stage to sing and imagines herself acclaimed successful...juxtaposed against the reality of no one caring. <br/><br/>Failed visions, delusional thinking, brain-damaged perceptions---all brought to the screen extremely well in this powerful film by Aronofsky. <br/><br/>Burstyn should have received that Oscar, hands down. As good a performance as any you'll see. <br/><br/>I give this movie a 9+."

The cinematography is excellent in capturing the rather intense thoughts of the characters as they face the horrors of their addiction.

Its a strong warning for whoever abuse drug in a senseless way, which you clearly cant control the use.<br/><br/>I smiled the first half and felt sad the second, the ending is pathetic to the point of being the worst part of this amazing movie, but the damage was done. I was too immersed in the story and it kinda brought me back to reality.<br/><br/>A nice find for whoever want to see the devastating effects of hard drugs on what should have been the perfect life, a movie i wont forget."

","A movie juxtaposing drugs with the Moirai. Their salvation as well as their destruction There's no other words I can use to explain it. The techniques, the character development (constructive or deconstructive) and the soundtrack. Mansell seems to really be the most emotionally charged movie composer since Ennio Morricone and Darren Aronofsky portrays this 'pleasant nightmare' with such powerful techniques and force that you the viewer can slightly taste the characters euphoria and feel the anguish of their fates. I was glued to this movie from the first second until after the end credits were complete. This is a what some would call a perfect dramatic combination with the best soundtrack for a Drama since 'Shakespeare in Love', 'Fight Club' and 'American Beauty'; a feeling of a building success in the characters whilst also a presence of macabre and limbo, an amazing storyline and most what I'd call the third most important addition to this picture (after the directorial techniques and soundtrack of course) is the powerful performances. This movie shows that even failed actors like Jared Leto and comedic actors (also pretty much failed) like Marlon Wayans are still very talented.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn outshines all the performances though, I'm in fact shocked that she did not receive the Academy Award losing to Julia Roberts (who lets face it, just didn't compare). This movie is highly underrated. If I had any say in the Academy this would have been the first controversial yet deserving movie to win Best Picture before others like 'Crash' and 'The Hurt Locker' (both amazing films as well).<br/><br/>All I have to say is if you only have time for one movie in your schedule, make it this one and I swear an oath that you will feel anything but regret."

","I had heard about that this movie would be a real downer. But there is few thing in life that can make you feel awful, and at the same time loving it. This is one of them. The story are following a bunch of drug users from the early days of euphoria towards the downward spiral of destruction. It is told excellent and you are starting to feel so sorry for the characters in the film, that if you thought about doing drugs., think again. I think that Empire said it best: <br/><br/>""If you ever find yourself inexplicably contented with your lot, slip this into your DVD player and normal service will be resumed... this is a film you watch once, then repair to the pub to stare fixedly into your beer for the night, vowing never, ever to watch it again.""<br/><br/>I hope that if any drugs user see this film, they will stop and think about their choose in life."

","""Requiem for a Dream"" is genuinely one of the best movies I have ever seen - and I am a BIG film buff (or consider myself to be). Although this movie is arty, which I usually hate in a movie, it is used brilliantly well in this movie, and Darren Aronofsky's directing is second to none. The acting is fantastic, and realistic, and the story may seem predictable of a drug movie at first (don't do them, they mess you up type of thing), but it really is an amazing movie, exceeding all my expectations. Another thing that made me love this film - and I suppose - equally loathe it, was that it was heart-wrenchingly sad. Not only did I cry, I screamed! Sounds corny, but so true, the ending pained me very much (I won't give away any more than that), but it really hurt. This movie packs a serious punch, and I hope you can fall in love with it as much as I did."

","before i wrote this review i realized that it already has almost 2000 reviews! so i have to be different, how? just by being simple and focusing on some points. the movie is about 4 persons 1-the mother 2- the son 3- his girl friend 4- the friend. all of them are drug addicts, and each one is trying to reach his or her dream. the mother wants to be in a show to tell about her son and her husband who died and she goes crazy in order to reach her dream, the son and his girl friend and their friend are doing nothing but trying to have their drug and take it. this is so real, this is what addicts lives are about, only trying to get the drug, take it and that's all. the movie is the best anti-drug movie ever made, the only default about the movie is that it sometimes look like a real show or a documentary or like a program and that somehow can make you bored, but in general it is a very real, touching and useful movie. at the end addiction ends in one of the following 1- you die 2- you go to jail 3- you go insane and lose your mind 4- you live your life only for your drug and in all cases you will lose your dream or you fail to reach it. the movie takes you in a journey first; you see how the first dose comes, second; you see how addiction comes, third; you see how is the addict life, thoughts and feelings finally; you watch how the addict ends up to.. but the movie does not give a solution or an idea for how to quit. but it alerts us to drugs and how it change lives and destroy it. i am an ex- addict an that's why i saw this movie one of the best. but it also suits other people not just addicts. don't miss it."

","This was dark, depressing and sad. But this painted the true reality of what life is like for drug addicts. It really opened my eyes and it provoked me in a way. The techniques they employed to create the general tone of the film was just so well done and made it more brutal, yet realistic. It's an intense movie.<br/><br/>I didn't necessarily have a favourite character in this film, but I felt the worst for Marion Silver. She didn't deserve the result of where she ended up. She was just in love with a man who got caught up in the wrong things and ended up becoming reliant on the drugs and therefore trying to get money for drugs in some horrible ways. I just felt bad and some women go through this and it does break my heart that these things happen. All the characters in this film showed the different but damaging ways drugs destroyed their lives. Each of them impacted me in a different way.<br/><br/>I would recommend to a very selected few. Only people who are mature, can handle intense movies and heavy things that include drugs and prostitution<br/><br/>This was an intense film but wonderfully crafted by the writer and the director. It really opened my eyes to the damage that drugs have in your life. The techniques employed, just made it more effective and real.

"edvardminge","10","0","1","23 August 2012"," Most brilliant told story within modern film?
","This might just be the best film i've ever seen. At least the best directed one. There are so many people looking after just joy or the feeling to be entertained by a movie. This movie has the focus on the theme. Getting caught up somewhere in between drugs and the American dream. I like all the elements that are used. The cinematography - that really paints a picture of how the general emotions are with the characters. The way the film uses the months as simple symbols of the direction in the developing of the film. <br/><br/>All the actors are so real. I believe in them constantly. And that makes the movie much more realistic, and that again makes the message the movie is trying to send out even clearer. If you dare watch this movie a little bit open-minded it should take your attention pretty good! Because there are so many of us that are just like the character of Ellen Burstyn - Slaves of entertainment. Watching television, all the fun. This movie isn't fun, and it should not be judged for being ""dumb"" or ""boring"".<br/><br/>It is a very subjective movie from the director/writers point of view, and that is what makes it so real. The objective movies that are most more general, with less feeling, doesn't speak as loud as this movie. To make such a movie takes guts and deserves big attention. Some of the point is that as the movie runs we start to care more, and more for the characters, and that is what makes the ending so good (Without spoiling anything). Something i have managed so see in all Aronofsky movies i've seen is the great power of that hug between to characters in the climax of the whole film. I could really end saying: ""Nothing is as emotional as a good hug in an Aronofsky film!"""
"croberton","10","0","1","22 August 2012"," This film is as beautiful as it is disturbing, that is the main message.
","In requiem for a dream the four character's lives descend into chaos and distress because of their addictions to drugs, three of the character's descent is due to their own actions. Those characters are Marion, Harry and Tyrone played by Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans. Jared Leto was in American Psycho(Paul Allen), Fight Club(Angel Face) and this film, all of these films were released in 1999-2000. Leto then went on to star in Daid Fincher's Panic Room with Jodie Foster and Forst Whitaker in 2002. Prior to his three film appearance in 99-00 he starred in Urban Legend a scream styled thriller also starring Rebecca Gayheart(Scream 2) Tara Reid(American Pie) and Robert Englund( A nightmare on elm street. <br/><br/>That film was average but it gave him a decent start to the film industry. The visuals in this film are superior to many films you will ever see or have seen. Darren Aronofsky shows the characters pupils dilating after they experiment with drugs, he depicts the entire process the effect a drug has on the human body. He shows step by step how the characters take the drugs, with syringe shots, bodily cell shots, the opiate injection scenes are brilliantly shown which is exactly what a viewer would want to see in a film of this genre. There are similar shots in this film when compared to Trainspotting(1996). There are rapid motion shots in both of these films with the character's and hospital scenes. <br/><br/>However on the contrary, Danny Boyle's film is delivered on a more amusing tone then requiem is. Requiem has a more somber tone regarding the consequences/toll that the character's experimentation with drugs result in. But the despondent feeling that requiem leaves on each viewer shouldn't diminish the enjoyment and concept of the film. The film is extremely forthright as is trainspotting as to the exhilarating and horrifying fluctuations of incessant drug use. The real differentiation between the two films is the culmination of each conclusion. Trainspotting leaves the viewer with an uplifted cleansed feeling towards their outlook on life since Ewan Mcregregor's character Mark decides to abandon his life as a carefree drug user and move on to a more significant lifestyle that he deserves. Severing the annoyance of pesky acquaintances prodding him for drugs or support when they should be dealing with own priorities then relying on someone who is a mate as they state it in the film as the film was from the UK and is set in London.<br/><br/>Requiem is set in the area of Coney island New York. Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto's character have brooklyn accents in the film. Whereas Jennifer's and tyrone's character's have regular voices. Both these films are detailed and psychological in the vignettes they show of the characters drug use and the aftereffects of their usage. Overall both films are classics of their genre. There aren't many films that focus on the positive and negative affects of drug usage as splendidly as these two films do. The majority of the character's in both films survive their behaviour which is pretty realistic. <br/><br/>For someone to actually succumb to their drug use involves heavy abuse of very potent substances. In trainspotting the four characters Mark, Begbie, Spud and Sick Boy diverge from each other at the end of the film. They finalize a scag deal and split up to pursue the rest of their lives solely. In requiem each character comes out of the abysmal experience of drug usage as well but for both films their next odyssey is unexplored. In Trainspotting Mark's Journey is clearly laid out by Boyle but in requiem Aronofsky doesn't delve into the character's next pursuits. Aronofsky concentrates on the fact that all four people have conquered their drug use and will likely go on to live more fulfilling lives in every aspect. With that being expounded both films end on a relatively high note. <br/><br/>These two films are among my favorites and they both leave an indelible mark on the perspective of drug use in real life and in film. Since these two films were released I haven't seen a film that has covered the same terrain has these two do. The impact of both films is undeniable because the candor shines through in both films whether you entirely adore both films or have some qualms about the film's real messages. All in all, I believe these films deserve the recogniton they've received from both the critics and audiences worldwide. Kudos to both directors for stepping outside the boundaries of what is expected in a film and giving audiences an insightful vision to a world that is full of ecstacy and agony."
"T-Boe","9","0","1","19 August 2012"," Horrible and raw, but probably a necessary watch.
","This is a tough film to watch, because the main theme is of addictions and their consequences, and how we're never really in control of them.<br/><br/>I didn't enjoy watching it at all, it's actually quite terrifying, because it illustrates so well how addictions can consume and ultimately ruin lives. Initially, you tend to think that you have nothing in common with the 'drug addicts' portrayed in the film. But as the film progresses, you learn more about the characters and their spiral out of control, and it becomes evident that they are relatively normal individuals, each with their own issues, but with ambitions and dreams as well. Then you begin to question how detached you really are from them.<br/><br/>Drugs make up a large part of the film, but it definitely isn't a film about the effects of drug addiction. Drug addictions are devastating, you don't need a film to tell you that. Rather the film explores how and why the individuals got into their positions, and when you realise this, then it becomes really tough to watch. <br/><br/>I can't really explain further why I think this film is good. There are some things which I thought didn't have to be in the film, like a rather pointless (in my opinion) sex scene. I will probably never watch it again, and there is no real solution to the message it sends. I don't even know if it will change me or my outlook on things significantly. But it deserves a watch if you've never seen it, it may change your life."

","As a young Adult I found this movie so truthful to what happens around us. People probably think that Aronofsky exaggerated with the effects of drug addiction and that never happens in the real world. Although it can be raw and provoking, it should be shown to young teens and adults to educate them with the effects of drugs.<br/><br/>Aronofsky made the film so much more interesting,that when every time the character took drug he showed a clip of it. He repeated it over and over again which made a great effect. Especially when Harry is going home after he found out his mother Sara is taking drugs to the extreme. He then starts crying, but takes Heroin to kill the sadness. <br/><br/>With the small budget they had, its great what they did. The music and filming techniques added so much more onto the movie. The actors added so much more and should be noticed for it. Ellen Burstyn was great as a drug addicted elderly.<br/><br/>The ending was brilliant, switching from each of the characters moments faster and faster until the movie ended. It shows the world what CAN happen if you addict to them. <br/><br/>There where a few things the movie could have improved on, such as when Tyrone was put in jail and Harry had to use all of there drug dealing money to bail him out-they didn't explain it and could have made it more clear in some parts of the movie.<br/><br/>Although a few thing were unclear, I'm surprised this movie didn't get much more notice than it did. Its truthful, confronting and Aronofsky did a great job in portraying the underworld of drugs."
"brando647","9","0","1","31 July 2012"," A Powerhouse Drama about Addiction
","Man, this movie is intense. I was introduced to the work of director Darren Aronofsky when I was in college. I'd never heard of him or his movies, but I had a friend that would rave about how excellent he was. Once I finally got around to checking out REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, my mind was blown. I couldn't even smoke a cigarette for the first three hours after the movie had ended. With this one movie, I was convinced that Aronofsky was a director to keep tabs on because this is a man who knows how to get under an audience's skin. The movie based on a novel from Hubert Selby, Jr. It follows four people caught in the throes of addiction: Harry Goldfarb (Leto), his mother Sara (Burstyn), his girlfriend Marion (Connelly), and his best friend Tyrone (Wayans). Each of them has their drug of choice, and each of them experiences the highs before the true danger behind the choices they've made becomes a reality. Harry and Tyrone are heroin junkies, content with pawning Sara's TV for a fix. Marion is a girl from a comfortable background with dreams of designing her own clothing and a love for cocaine. And Sara withers away in miserable retirement until she's presented with an opportunity to appear on her favorite infomercial/game show and her desperation to get in shape for her big appearance leads to a debilitating speed habit. This is not a movie about overcoming these obstacles, it's about the horrors of addiction.<br/><br/>Fair warning to those who haven't seen this movie: it can be a little rough for the feint of heart. REQUIEM FOR A DREAM combines a powerful story with amazing performances, a killer soundtrack from Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet, and hyperkinetic editing that will get your own heart rate jacked. Thanks to Aronofsky's talented vision, the audience experiences the highs and lows of these characters and will have you wincing in pain along with them. The final act of the movie, when everything goes full tilt, is intense. It pulls no punches in depicting where addiction can lead. This would be the perfect anti-drug PSA because, as is usually the case in real life, addiction wins. It's not something that be shrugged off or sugar- coated and Aronofsky (and Selby) shoves your face in it with horrifying depictions of the consequences. You watch as these characters desperately try to rationalize what they're doing, finding excuses to justify their actions. Each of them has their hopes and dreams Harry and Marion want to open a boutique to sell her clothing designs, Tyrone wants to honor his mother's memory with his own personal success, and Sara just wants someone to care about her. Unfortunately, their habits (and, in one case, an apathetic health care system) win them over, slowly destroying them until the final gripping montage shatters any remaining hope for them. I can't stress enough how powerful this movie is and, love it or hate it, everyone should watch it at least once.<br/><br/>Now, a movie about addiction won't work unless you care about the characters and that's another aspect where this movie excels. I want to know how in the world Ellen Burstyn lost the Academy Award for Best Actress to Julia Roberts (for ERIN BROKOVICH, where she flashes her cleavage and pretends to be a lawyer). Burstyn is amazing in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, more than any other performance in the film. She is a tortured soul and I don't know about anyone else but I felt more for her than any other character. She's retired, widowed, and just wants someone to pay attention to her. Naïve, she doesn't even appear to know or understand that her one and only son is a junkie. She does what she has to do for him, even if it means a weekly trip to the pawn shop to retrieve her TV. When she is given a chance to appear on TV, she's just so desperate to lose the weight and you hate to watch her begin the slippery slope of pill addiction. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly do a fantastic job as well, and even Marlon Wayans is commendable here. I want to know how Wayans can prove he has some serious acting chops here, and then throw them away to continue making movies like WHITE CHICKS. Depressing as it may be, I absolutely love this movie. A real movie is more than just spectacle, it's substance and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM has it in spades. It will leave you unnerved."

I was doomed and I won't/don't do drugs! I hated what I felt at the end of this movie. I don't think I'll ever watch this film again. <br/><br/>If the object of this movie was to scare the holy crap out of me- it worked.

","I watched ""Requiem for a dream"" at the end of last year just because I had seen Jared Leto's name in the cast and the movie is a drama. So, at first I didn't expect it will be such a powerful and impressing movie. I was passing through a bad period of my life, I had a different kind of addiction ( not drugs or things like that, I was addicted to a person and this is as well a very dangerous addiction). Of course that when you build your dreams on fictive bases nothing works at last and you'll find yourself drowning in despair. I had the chance to taste a bit of this failure, of course that not in such a tragical way as this movies's main characters did. <br/><br/>I think it will remain one of those few movies that I will never forget till I die. Marion and Harry, two young people with dreams and hopes for the future lose almost everything for the sake of drugs. Their addiction transforms them into shells void of purpose. But what impressed me the most was that even drowned in misery, their love to each other was the only thing that kept them alive, the only thing that humanized them. I mean, from all other points of view they became only some lame animals controlled by their instinct of getting drugs, but love saved their souls somehow, if this was possible.<br/><br/>After all I don't think the message of the movie is the common: ""DON'T DO DRUGS!"". No! It's way more than that. ""Requiem for a dream"" represents a real warning for all illusion lovers, for all the people who avoid the real world to flee into a feigned one!"

The subject of addiction needs a powerful and personal message and Aronofsky delivers just that. Ellen Bursyn gives a performance of a lifetime not to be missed inside of this artistic masterpiece. The daily repetitive actions of addiction are highlighted by brilliant editing (even if a bit over done) to effect. To be clear, I had to cover my eyes during a few seconds of a few scenes and this story was quite personal for me. Not unlike One Flew Ocer The Coocoo's Nest, this will make for a difficult second viewing but remains a special DVD on my shelf to it's vision and message.

"RemusDutulescu","10","0","1","9 June 2012"," Requiem for a dream - or how to fry your brains in three simple steps
","I don't have the slightest clue how to start this and I'm afraid that I'll end up ranting the whole time. Requiem for a dream is the kind of movie that leaves you a bitter taste when you're done watching it. One of the geniuses behind this masterpiece is Darren Aronofsky, the movie director and the same person that gave us Pi, another personal favorite. Why did I say another? Take a wild guess.<br/><br/>Now, I'm going to ask - not necessarily you - what's the difference between a speed junkie and someone addicted to food, TV, tabloids, you name it? What if there comes a moment when you can't distinguish what's real and what's an illusion because of your excessive hobby? I know it's a bit disturbing to picture someone massively hallucinating from reading too many pop magazines, but that was not the point. The point is that our sickened society hit a new milestone with its hypocrisy, becoming unable to make the difference between heroin addicts and TV potatoes. What's the connection with the present movie, you might wonder? Well, the main idea that Aronofsky (successfully) pictures is that there's no practical difference between ANY kind of addiction, be it crystal meth, junk food, or idiotic TV shows.<br/><br/>Take a normal teen, right? Like any teen, he experiments. In some cases, he can even make a passion out of these little escapades. First some hash, then a little bit of snow, some speed now and then and he ends up with his own thing in no time! Mix up a good pal to help with business and an adorable girl with similar ambitions as our guy and the result is perfect. Did I mention the over-protective maa'? But aiming too high isn't good for business, neither for personal health. Can I be less specific than this? No? OK. To sum up the whole plot, this movie presents the lives of a junkie teen and his mama, starting from a point where things seem to be alright, if not fine, and ending up at a point where they are unrecognizable. Did I mention that the old's lady is a TV junkie? <br/><br/>I don't know much about filming techniques, but I guess the best people gathered and formed the best filming crew ever, for this movie. For example, take the simple 1-2-3 technique. Integrated like it is in this movie, it makes wonders and takes the immersion to a whole new level. And the whole movie is built like this, which surprisingly doesn't make it boring one second. Add a marvelous soundtrack (including Clint Mansell's godlike Requiem for a dream, made special for this movie I think) and you have an equally astounding, exceptional and haunting movie.<br/><br/>If you haven't figured it out yet, this is the kind of art that makes you think about certain things. Like a lot.

","I had barely heard anything about this movie, seeing as I was 10 when it was released. Then one day about 6 months ago, I saw that it would playing on IFC, so I set it to record. After I watched it, I just felt entirely numb. It's hard to describe exactly what I was thinking afterward, because it made me think about so much, but at the same time, I could think of absolutely nothing because of the horror that I had just seen. The next day, I went to buy it on BluRay because I honestly just had to own this movie. <br/><br/>I never watched it since then. I just didn't think that I could handle watching it again, but I just watched it for 2nd time after owning it for months. As impossible as it sounds, this movie is even more tragically haunting the second time you see it. Throughout the entire movie, I couldn't look away, even though I knew everything that would happen to those 4. If anything, it seemed to make the movie so much darker. I was literally cringing in my seat for the last 15 minutes. <br/><br/>This movie is about as close to perfect as I have seen. Obviously, the content isn't the reason for it.. as it is terrifying, but that's what makes it so beautiful. It was directed, acted, edited perfectly. I have major respect for those involved in the making of this film. <br/><br/>A lot of people may say this film is over-hyped, but I honestly don't see it. One of the most amazing films, as a whole, that I have ever seen."

","As the credits rolled, I took a deep breath, and I thought ""what a moving film!"". I tried to recommend it to friends, but I couldn't bring up the words ""this is a beautiful film"". This is an intense, stirring, thought-provoking film - yes. It is about doing drugs. About being addicted, into the deep pits of obsession.<br/><br/>It is the mark of a great director to provoke the sensorial impressions of this film: quick frame succession, surreal look, obsessive soundtrack - the imagery and sound closely explore what we think we know about hallucinogens.<br/><br/>The question I found emerging as the film moved on was ""how low can you go?"". It is a crescendo - of seasons, of scenes, of pace. And the answer the film gave me was ""lower, and lower, and lower..."" - addiction has no end to how much human degradation it can bring."

","Say what you will about Requiem for a Dream, but it goes right for the jugular with no pretensions or ironic detachment. There's a kind of emotional honesty and directness you don't often see in film. The smörgåsbord of crazy cuts, special effects, and other directorial techniques just help to make the film more of a bodily experience, an unending feeling of grimy degradation that ends up sticking with you long after the movie's over. Aronofsky would go on to learn some restraint and direct better movies after this, but there's something to say for the balls-to-the-walls visual insanity of Requiem.<br/><br/>The story follows the parallel tracks of four drug users, all in a downward spiral. Ellen Burstyn, as a body-obsessed older woman who becomes addicted to mysterious pharmaceuticals has the most interesting storyline. It's a story we don't see too often, and it makes you pause and wonder how easy it would be to slip into this kind of life. The other characters are more familiar types, verging on stereotypes. Marlon Wayans probably gets the most superficial role, but Jared Leto and Jennifer Connolly as tortured lovers are never really convincing either. (Of course, the movie relying on Wayans and Leto as its leading men is probably its most egregious flaw).<br/><br/>In the end, however, the film's power is enough to mostly muscle through the ordinariness of its story. There are times when Requiem for a Dream can seem like an after-school special about the evils of drugs, but if it is, it's the best after-school special ever."

","Don't misunderstand me: Requiem for a Dream is quiet a good movie. Its fascinating, thrilling and entertaining, and actually it also makes me think about drugs and society.

There are many common things you can compare - as for example the protagonist who has a girlfriend, who has to prostitute in the end for financing their drug addicition. But I missed the feeling, the sadness, these special kind of empathy which overcame me in Candy, it actually was intense enough to make me cry - an emotional feeling that can only be evoced by really good and realistic movies; some sort of comparison with the protagonist, as you are twitching in his role and feel his dilemma.<br/><br/>If you'd ask me: Its worth watching, but id prefer Candy, and suggest you Candy if you want to watch a Movie about Drug, Addiciton and tragic."

"Wuchakk","7","0","1","26 March 2012"," Unrelenting denunciation of drug abuse
","I didn't discover Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000) until after discovering its great score. We've all heard this powerful score somewhere over the last dozen years or so since it's been cut & pasted ad infinitum, but I wasn't aware of its name or what film it was originally derived. I finally tracked it down to ""Requiem for a Dream."" The reason it was hard to uncover is because the movie was unsuccessful at the box office, likely due to its NC-17 rating, even though it's generally regarded as a near masterpiece, albeit in the downbeat sense.<br/><br/>""Requiem for a Dream"" is a film about substance addiction, legal or illegal. The film stars Ellen Burstyn as a Brooklyn widow who has to deal with her addict son (Jared Leto), whom she loves too much to render the necessary ""tough love."" Jennifer Connelly plays the son's girlfriend and Marlon Waylans his best friend, both equally addicted.<br/><br/>The film utilizes various creative picture/editing techniques to relay its tale of a slow descent into hell on earth. The characters are understandably kind of pathetic and the story is only moderately absorbing, until the end, that is. The climax is a powerful indictment of drug abuse, legal or illegal. So potent, in fact, that I literally wept (!).<br/><br/>The NC-17 rating mainly has to do with a shocking climatic scene involving Connelly's character at some stag party, but there's an R-rated version that relays all the information you need to know. I've seen both and, although I prefer uncensored films, the edited version is worthy. Besides, the cut scene is available on youtube for anyone who's interested.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: While the story is only mildly absorbing it has great acting and is filled with kinetic filmmaking, which is both interesting and sometimes annoying. But the ending is pummeling in a horrifying sense, and the score is a veritable masterpiece. However, the film's unrelenting denunciation of substance abuse keeps it from being entertaining in the conventional sense, which isn't a problem for me, but it might compel others to never want to see it again, if at all.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+"
"timgoeree-316-344437","9","0","1","14 March 2012"," Real drama.
","It's unbelievable that this movie was released in 2000 and very few people have seen it more than a decade later. I just discovered it in 2012 but after 12 years it's still like nothing else. It's been compared to other so-called drug movies like Trainspotting, which makes some sense but ultimately is unfair. Compared to this, Trainspotting is a comedy. This movie is a drama in every way.<br/><br/>I won't go into the plot because I don't wan't to spoil anything and let's face it, reading about it 12 years later? You know what it's about. What I will say is that this movie is not for everyone and that it bends the rules of what we can call entertainment. It's not fun or entertaining like most movies or even documentaries are but it's interesting nonetheless. A lot of negative criticism towards this movie seems to come from the fact that a lot of people actually will not want to see it. Not because it's bad but because it's probably too realistic to be comfortable.<br/><br/>So it's good and not mainstream (yet). Looks like we've got a cult classic, no? Well, yes and no. Yes because it should be considered a classic and no because it's not glamorizing anything. Trainspotting, for all its intents and purposes, is great and gritty but also funny as hell. This movie isn't. It starts pretty boring like most movies and ends with drama but nothing is funny, save one or two lines of text. That leaves little to glamorize and limits its cult appeal in a lot of circles.<br/><br/>What this movie does do, and what is sets apart from most movies, is simplicity. It shows four people and their drug addictions. You don't get to know and love them before they get addicted and you don't get to know every detail about why they do what they do. They're pretty normal people with normal dreams and lives. The movie explains more details about some characters than others but you don't get to know a lot about them and you don't need to. You'll see their lives fall apart and you'll feel bad for them. Not because you love them but because of the way things are shown.<br/><br/>And that's the beauty of this movie. Even though most of the actual drug intake isn't shown, the effects become clearer by the minute. All of the results of the character's actions are shown, and they're not pretty. Sex, violence, family issues and racism are themes that are all there and don't leave much to the imagination. There are a lot of subtle moral issues as well, which gives the movie even more depth.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have about this movie is about one scene. You'll have to make it through but it's absolutely out of place. Some of the characters experience psychoses during the movie. Not much of a problem except that one of them looks like it's taken straight out of an 80's horror movie. You can place it into context but it's a bit too much. Thankfully the best part is still to come so you'll be able to overlook it but it's a shame no less on such a masterpiece.<br/><br/>See it with an open mind and you'll love it if it's your thing."

","As a whole I felt the movie was excellent. The visuals were well done and the editing was outstanding. The actors really put themselves into their roles. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly had very good chemistry, while Marlon Wayans showed he is a talented actor and not just a talented comic. Ellen Burstyn. Wow! She was amazing. I can't believe an older woman would allow herself to be filmed like that. She has some serious guts. Hands down the best female performance I've watched this year, not even close. I was totally amazed by her.<br/><br/>All in all, I would say Requiem For a Dream is a great movie. It had a profound impact on me and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I watched it on opening night. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. This is a movie everyone should see, but unfortunately not enough will."
"RaynarRogers","7","0","1","30 January 2012"," Really thoroughly enjoyed but questioned the choices made
","The film in terms of theme did exactly what it was supposed to do. It created a world we as an audience invest in. The effect of drugs needs not to be known to audiences before the film, it is what we learn about more than anything- closest to the first hand account I've seen on many films (especially Sara), and it's the directors choices that we engage in and feel the dream like state ourselves in many ways. <br/><br/>However, each character goes on a downwards spiral character arc and each left with a story that goes on from the film that we may never know about. I wouldn't call the end a resolution. The closest character to have a resolution is Harry and so I almost felt let down by the film makers because 3/4 of the way through the film, I realised they were all on a bad arc and it would end bad for all of them, so I expected the end to have a little less prediction. I think if one character managed to struggle out of that spiral, the film would have had more worth. <br/><br/>That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the film, the style, the acting and the decisions made in terms of camera angles, fisheye, pov etc. It made me want to write about it, so it did have a big impact on me, but the strengths were that I was immersed in a world that had been created and come to life and the weaknesses were that the story-line was unfortunately (regardless of the amount of unexpected events that happened) predictable in the sense that we were led to believe throughout the film that they weren't going to overcome the addiction and therefore we expected what was coming."

So, I was disappointed because I cannot recommend it to family members because of this. But my full and final rating that the movie is very good and the acting was the best.

","I normally watch a lot of movies(Believe me, at least two movies a day..) Among all of them. RFAD is positively the most intense movie I have seen till date. The climax stands out to be the most devastating climax I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The story is about four people who, in the starting of the movie, make different plans about the future. This is a good part. Then, they slowly start getting into drugs and addiction. This is a not-so-good part. It has some pretty uneasy moments. Now the really messy and the tough part. The part of complete downward spiral in their lives. Believe me, this part is really disturbing to watch. The atmosphere of the movie changes from happy to sad in a gradual manner. The overall depressing mood gets more and more defined and finally, towards the end of the climax, the movie gets practically unbearably painful.<br/><br/>This is one hell of a movie that is definitely gripping. The acting was well done. Specially, the role of Ellen Burstyn was very effective in the movie. Her acting was flawless. Director Darren Aronofsky handled the subject fabulously.

","I could tell I was going to like this film from the get go. Now I must preamble that I am not very queezy and can usually watch any movie regardless of content, so the drug use didn't disturb me as much as it might a typical viewer. That being said, the credit sequence is very gripping and the movie wastes no time giving you a solid profile of all of the characters. I found myself immediately connecting to all of the characters in various ways, but particularly with Harry and his mom Sara's relationship. They both care for each other in a very real sense that isn't often portrayed accurately in films. Both Jared Leto (Harry) and Ellen Burstyn (Sara) turn in incredible performances that piece the film together well. Leto in particular impressed me after comparing this role with his other cult classic role from the same year, Paul Allen from American Psycho. Leto plays a very different character in this film and he makes himself almost unrecognizable as the drug addicted youth. I was also very impressed with Jennifer Connelly as usual but it was Marlon Wayans that really surprised me. I'm used to seeing him in comedic roles, and this was certainly the opposite, and he nailed it.<br/><br/>The camera work in the film is superb often utilizing multiple cameras in one view. The editing was great particularly toward the end of the film. And the score. What can I say about the score that hasn't already been said. Haunting, mysterious, phenomenal. <br/><br/>All in all the film was terrific although I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. Great story and even better characters. A must watch for cult classic lovers."

","Since it has been about 8 years since I first saw this movie, it may seem counterintuitive that I would review this movie now. If I had reviewed this movie 8 years ago (at 15), I would have given it 10 stars. It was the best movie I had ever seen at the time. I was way into the drug culture and had already experimented with half of a dozen. The ironic thing is that now that I have cleaned up (no drugs and no cigarettes), I find the movie to be an abstract piece of art. The abstract nature of the movie is why I give it three stars. The message is foul: drug addiction is a slippery slope and inescapable. My life experiences have shown this to be absolutely untrue. While Aronofsky does a great job with the visual and dramatic aspects of this movie and the Kronos Quartet empowers it with beautiful noises, the moral is dead wrong. It is almost as if the director has never done a single illicit drug. If you want a more realistic experience of drug addiction being inescapable and miserable, read or watch ""A Scanner Darkly"". If you want a more realistic experience of drug culture, watch ""Trainspotting"". In ""Trainspotting"" the characters clean up multiple times willingly and they almost make it look easy -- until you see that they slide back into it easily. The beauty of this movie is deceptive. This is the ultimate poison of the film industry. With dramatic elements, you can make a lie seem so unquestionably true. You can see this mentality seeping into modern film and 85% (according to the rank of this movie) believe the lie. The best analogy I can provide is to tell the tale of a vegetarian. This vegetarian killed a pig once and went around swinging the corpse and attacking people out with it, screaming, ""Meat is murder!"" How could something so beautiful be so wrong? Simple. Ask an American blonde to assimilate gravity into molecular theory."

"boothstr96","10","0","1","26 June 2010"," An Essential Film
","Darren Aronofsky treads waters I believe no director has treaded before. His entire film depicts the theme of the nature of drug addiction. The four characters affected by it provide a stronghold for Aronofsky's point. Never have I seen a film that delves deep within the soul and changes a person. If you have any sort of addiction at all, watch this film, it will change you. I guarantee it. Many people hear and even comprehend the downside to every addiction. But until you see it in plain black and white you do not know what you are really going through. See, an addiction is able to continue its course of poisoning the soul because it masks the truth from the being it parasites from. That person believes they are in euphoria. Yet, to everyone else, they look utterly ridiculous. It takes watching addiction run its course to realize our own addictions and how to resolve them. Aronofsky realizes this and geniously uses cinematic techniques such as change in tone, setting, and trippy special effects to come across with his point. The tone of the film shifts as the addiction takes over. It becomes more grimy as the film progresses. The setting adds to the grimyness of the plot seeing as the main characters live in a less fortunate or ghetto neighborgood. Last of all the trippy special effects are straight disturbing and strike the soul within the human being watching the film. It makes one realize that they think they may have it so great. But anything you are addicted to it too good to be true. Overall, Aronofsky crafts a film that delves deep within the conscience of the human mind. It does more than any other film I have ever seen. Every thing in this film was perfect for the message Aronofsky was trying to accomplish. It takes seeing this movie to really understand the impact of the message portrayed. I can honestly say that I am a changed person after watching this film and I highly suggest you watch it, no matter who you are. No matter if you have an addiction, know someone who has an addiction, or have no addiction at all. This film will open your eyes to the reality of life and make you want to help those who succumb to their own minds and give into impulsive demands. Ten stars for this one. A truly perfect film."

","Requiem for a Dream: A harrowing look at the perils of addiction ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a Darren Aronofsky production. It was released in the year 2000 and has received numerous prizes and good reviews. We will mainly focus on how the special effects add to the story of this movie.<br/><br/>""Requiem for a Dream"" is as powerful and intense as film-making gets, hence, it is a rather drowsy title for such an explosive film. ""Screwing Up"" or ""Deterioration of your Happy Life"", as each character in the movie is shown in a state of both mental as physical degradation, would be more on track. The special effects only add to the explosiveness and the eruption of misery and despair that gets thrown at you throughout the movie. All the lighting, the editing, the cinematography and the special effects; everything serves the dramatic progression of the story and makes the story all the more gripping and convincing. The story starts off slowly, but surely rockets into a whirlwind of utter misery. One scene of sadness stacks upon another in no-time, making it all very heavy to endure. You truly feel compassion for these four individuals, even though you know they are not real. We surely know we had to pick a tear from the corners of our eyes. We personally think that this is because this is how it happens in real life. Essentially, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is very realistic. Drug usage starts off with 'innocent' usage, for fun. The four characters live in Brooklyn, I mean, who doesn't do drugs there every so often? But soon before long, the drug use starts to become a normal part of their week, or even day. That is when they can't function without their fix and their lives just plummet from happy lives with a little drugs every so often into a complete nightmare. <br/><br/>Aronofsky used every trick in the book, from split screen to sped up showing of short clips and images, manic editing, point-of-view shots, slow motion and various other special effects. The 'sped up showing of short clips and images', or, as we like to call it, 'quick transition' of images, shown when either of the four main characters are consuming drugs, is like a drug in itself. It portraits the feeling of being high, as life passes in flashes when you are high (not speaking from personal experience), everything is distorted. Showing what the characters feel like in a 'distorted' manner gives extra depth to the way they feel and makes their drug-trip even more convincing. The 'quick transition' technique is shown over and over throughout the movie to show how the people in the movie can't help doing the same gestures again and again. As we mentioned before, the 'quick transition' technique is like a drug in itself. In a strange way, it is very addictive, you want to see the next after you saw one. It is like a fix when you watch it. You crave for the next. When the characters get their fix, you get yours. <br/><br/>A mixture of superb sound in combination with skillful editing and strong acting makes the story ever more gripping. The scene in which Harry Goldfarb's mother, Sara Goldfarb is so high on her 'diet pills' that she starts cleaning the entire house for hours and hours because she has so much energy, with the beautiful music on the background, composed by Clint Mansell and performed by the Kronos Quartet, truly touched our hearts. The scene is sped up, this enables the viewer to see how much Sara is influenced by the drugs and how incredibly sad she really is, all this in a short amount of time. This is called fast-motion. All the sadness and realization of how much power the drugs have on Sara gets thrown toward you, all very fast. The heavy, compelling music strengthens the feeling of sadness and compassion for Sara. She truly is a slave of the drug which was prescribed to her by her doctor.<br/><br/>Additionally, throughout the movie characters hallucinate, a.k.a. perceive the absence of stimuli, regularly. This side-effect of taking drugs like heroin is wondrously portrayed in the scene in which Harry hallucinates about Marion. Harry is in his room, just used drugs, and finds himself seeing Marion through the window. She is standing at the end of a dock. He runs towards her and when she turns around Harry ceases to hallucinate. Aronofsky magnificently used a number of special effects to strengthen the image of hallucination. One of which we like to refer to as 'sudden disappearance of objects'. First, the window disappears. Secondly, the bed disappears. Finally, the whole room disappears. This gradual process is also a special effect. It is integrated into this scene to express unclarity and slowness, both associated with hallucinating. These were merely a few of many tiny effects integrated into the movie. The effects are either new, or they are improved effects of existing movies. Either way, they fit the movie exceptionally well.<br/><br/>All in all, Requiem for a Dream is definitely a flagship title concerning special effects, as the movie is tremendously profound in this. The way in which the movie implicates its audience is truly splendid, as it does not allow you to be a passive viewer. The tragic character development triggers heavy emotional response from the viewer. The director really wants you to feel, to experience, to emotionally sense the characters on the screen. Tragic, though marvelous."

The script is solid and minimal for the most part.<br/><br/>The director decided to tell this story as visually as possible. He adopted a kinda rapid cut montage style to great effect and it really helps to set the different tones of various scenes, especially the last few minutes which are harrowingly good.<br/><br/>The story is brilliant. Although the actors all suffer the most exaggerated worst case scenario by the end your so shocked at what you're seeing that it doesn't sink 'til afterwards and you realise that it was just trying to make a point with it's final over the top onslaught of horror and to be honest it probably shouldn't have ended any other way.<br/><br/>A former drug addict myself I recommend this to anyone who is thinking of starting to or currently abusing drugs.

I can't help but watch it constantly<br/><br/>I've only seen the directors cut (something I can only rent and am unable to fins to buy) and I know it contains absolute horrific images<br/><br/>Yet the film is so damn good I'm drawn into it, all the time<br/><br/>And every time I watch it, I shake rattle and roll in my seat. I grab my hair, I put my hands over my eyes and pull them back. I turn down the sound and then back up again.<br/><br/>I even do this in a simple scene when Ellen Burstyn cries in front of her son and also has that proud look on her face that she'll be on television. While filming this scene, the camera man lost control of himself so you can see the camera move. Certainly a strong testament to her performance<br/><br/>The score is absolutely brilliant and draws me in. When I see these characters destroy themselves I go nuts, but I love this hateful trip.<br/><br/>This film is as good as feel-bad movies get. Is there such a thing as a great feel-bad film. Well what else is Requiem for a dream?<br/><br/>Crowd-Pleasing?....No....Polarising, oh yeah<br/><br/>And I take pride in embracing this kind of cinema, Aronofsky is a tremendous talent. One of my favorite directors<br/><br/>He shot this film in a way I usually wouldn't like for a film, but it works. It really does<br/><br/>At the same time, I'm the kinda person that loves seeing tragedy so well crafted on screen. I love tragedy. I feel more invited to watch films again if it ends on a dark note...or say brutally honest note<br/><br/>I don't think Aronofsky agrees with all his characters actions. He's showing us the consequences of screwing yourself. Yet we don't sneer at these characters. We don't wanna see this madness happen, but it's a fact that it does...well I've never heard of this kinda thing happen to an old lady but it could happen.<br/><br/>When people say, it's not a film for everyone. They are right. But think of a film like 'How to lose a guy in 10 days' it is not for everyone does not get called that, yet that's the way it is<br/><br/>So is 'everyone' people who don't want films left to their own interpretation or a film that doesn't end on happy notes or deal with traumatic truths.....think about that people<br/><br/>Who do they mean by everyone? I consider people who go through this kinda thing in life part of the human race, and though people should be mature enough not to go there, I hope the good ones can escape the madness"

Is this really how people put themselves through hell trying to get drugs? When the credits ran, I cried and cried. Why? I still don't know. The impact of thinking that could possibly ever be me. Or that even somebody I know could have went through something like this. But why it made me so sad? I don't know. It is very much one of the most terrifying movies I've ever seen. But not in a slasher, pop-up kind of way. It's real, and it's hardcore. It's so real that it really terrifies you. I recommend every mother and father showing this movie to there children. I'm still young, and have never done drugs. Never resented them, just haven't tried them. I now resent drugs because of this movie. I know I will never ever ever ever mess with hardcore drugs.

","Perhaps the hardest thing to portray beautifully in a movie is to show the vulnerabilities of human beings without losing the plot. Kudos to Darren Aronofsky for his mind-blowing direction.A great work with the camera with superb innovations like split screen techniques.The film starts with a light note surrounding the 4 central characters and then with time delves deep into the murky & horrific world of drugs.Everything starting from the direction to acting is so terse and pin-pointed. This is a film that is so distressing and depressing and yet a food for the soul.The true consequences of drug abuse is shown in a brutally genuine way. Jared Lato and Jeniffer Connelly deliver their best performance as vulnerable youths whose lives are shattered due to a vicious nexus of drug abuse.Even Marlon Wayans delivers a nice performance.The horrific turn their life takes will simply numb you. But the show-stealing performance comes from Ellen Burstyn who breaks every ground of acting while portraying the character of Jared Lato's mother, a loner who wants to get back to her olden days & in the way falls prey to drug abuse in the form of diet pills.The horror in her eyes that grows day by day as the movie advances will cause a lump in your throat. And in the end of the movie the director justifies why the movie is titled so.While Ellen Burstyn has to be admitted to a hospital for electroshock therapy where she remains only a shadow of her old self, Jared Lato also ends up mutilating his hand due to rotting of it by drug injection.Jeniffer Connelly is forced to prostitution to satiate her needs for drug and Marlon Wayans lands up in jail and is shown to dream of days when he was young and used to sleep like an innocent boy with his mom. The metamorphosis of the characters from simple people into shattered selves is simply heart touching. This was a movie which unjustly missed on Oscars. At least Ellen Burstyn should have been awarded for her role.The depiction of a lonely lady, the longing to eat, the horrific hallucinations and at last a finished character was played superbly by her that is unparalleled. Its heartening that the movie is at 60th on IMDb's list of best movies but i would have liked it to be within best 30. This is a movie which will numb your senses at least for sometime after you watch it. Its not a tear jerker and neither a documentary but the portrayal is tremendously disturbing and dangerously true. I recommend everyone to watch it and get a true angle to drug abuse. Its a cinematic beauty as well as educational. Please watch it. A complete 10 on 10. Nothing can get better than this."

This was a fantastic film and if you plan on watching it prepared to be shocked. This film goes far beyond the effects of drug use. This film examines severe personal meltdown. Having watched it I genuinely didn't know if I wanted more or if I had actually seen enough. During the film I felt pain, sadness anger but also sheer delight. This is by all means a shocking film to watch but its done so well that you cant not call it brilliant. The development of characters (Burstyns in particular), the chilling music, the complete relevance this film has on society today are all factors in what make this film one of the best. I would consider it a must see. It will shock you and move you but you will feel better for seeing it. Before my friend lent me the film I asked what made it so good?

","I know it's been more than 9 years since it's release. But I only had the chance to see this piece of art yesterday, and haven't quite stopped thinking about it yet. It's one of those movies you'll hardly forget.<br/><br/>Although it doesn't have a great plot or memorable lines, it caught my attention right from the amazing opening credits' shots. A contrast between quietness and movement. The main theme transmits some kind of anxiety, mixed with the feeling of inevitable fate. And that's the best about this movie - the photography and sound, rather than the plot itself.<br/><br/>The story is divided in three parts, metaphorically titled after three of the four Seasons. It picks us up and drops us inside a world of drug abuse and addiction, firstly showing whatever profit it might give (""Summer""), only to enlarge the fall (""Fall"", actually) it causes. Finally it ends up in a ""Winter"", which is, itself, the requiem for a ""Spring"" dream that never comes. But as I said before, the plot wasn't the greatest thing about this movie, to me. The way they transport you inside the characters' feelings is almost surreal. Every time a character consumes drugs, it's shown in a figurative, somewhat disturbing, way, with a great image/sound conjunction. It's almost like a preparation for what's to come, as they were testing your capacity to perceive it. It reaches it's peak quite close to the end, in the most intense scenes I've ever experienced. The way they represented a ""bad trip"" after severe pill abuse, almost made me feel like I was the one having the ""bad trip"" (although I never had such an experience, I can't compare it to anything else). It actually made me want to make it stop and shut my eyes and ears, with the perception that it wouldn't ever stop. The final unfolding, which lasts for about 4 (very long) minutes, is a never-ending stream of sensations, feelings, disturbing images and pitch sounds and music. When this stream finally ends, it's like a breath of fresh air that only lasts for a minute, until we're brought back into the cruel reality in which the plot culminated. The final requiem for each character's dream.<br/><br/>Overall, I cannot say it's a beautiful or even entertaining movie, in its common meaning. It's more like an incredible sensorial experience through the meanders of drug abuse and it's consequences. Does it have a message? Definitely, although not an optimistic one. Does it really matter, in this context? I don't think so. Though, I'm sure I won't forget it soon."
"czarnobog","10","0","1","13 February 2010"," Cinematic Masterpiece - Best Drug Theme Film Ever
","A few film directors (notably Oliver Stone with ""The Doors,"" Donald Cammell-Nicolas Roeg with ""Performance"" and Jerry Schatzberg with ""Panic in Needle Park"") have successfully captured the essence of certain drug experiences, but Darren Aronofsky goes deeper than anyone with this exploration of addiction.<br/><br/>""Requiem for a Dream"" is based on a novel by one of the most controversial and important authors in the history of literature, and Aronofsky did it justice with his innovative and astute direction.<br/><br/>The first thing that stands out, from the very first frames of the film, is the totally original soundtrack. It's amazing that this was one of the first movie scores by composer Clint Mansell -- and even more amazing that although the film received a slew of nominations and awards, the composer was only nominated once. The ""modern music"" score forms a lush, smooth platform for the choppy but never incoherent storyline and erratic camera moves, and a masterful array of electronic sound efx punctuate the emotional beats.<br/><br/>The story is centered around Jared Leto's character, a nice Jewish boy on a very bad track, and the three people closest to him. Ellen Burstyn should have taken the Oscar for her multi-faceted performance as his nice Jewish mama victimized by a pill-pushing doctor, but all four characters are brilliantly portrayed as we follow them on their paths of degradation. Economic snippets of early life flashbacks add depth to their characterizations.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is equally adept at capturing the dizzy rapture of drug abuse and the sad descent of the users. The moment when Leto first persuades his girlfriend to fetch some drug money is as fine a cinematic moment as has ever been filmed. While most filmmakers would use close-ups for such an intimate moment, Aronofsky uses a long medium two-shot from behind. Jennifer Connelly's expression (in profile, no less) conveys a wealth of disturbed emotions, while Leto's hidden face and hunched posture are all we need to experience his total shame and desperation. For the first time the nice boy realizes he is now something less than nice. And his higher class girlfriend realizes she is about to cross an irreversible line for him. Or more correctly, for the drugs he has hooked her on. Their happy-go-lucky love affair is no more. Replaced by love of the drug.<br/><br/>This film is worth watching on so many levels. The great performances. The brilliant film-making techniques. The uncommon score.<br/><br/>If I were a parent, I'd watch it with my children as soon as I felt they were intelligent enough to understand it. It's like a vaccine shot against drug abuse... and against falling into other people's messes."

There were some parts in it that I could barely watch such as the ones where Jared Leto (Harry) would show his bruised arm.

","This is an astoundingly truthful and honest depiction of drug use and abuse; and the way society deals with it.

It a beautiful story of addiction in all its forms woven around a story of precarious triumph; where easy gains from illegal drugs (made profitable merely by the virtue of being prohibited) can turn into an easy descent when that scarce commodity becomes scarcer. And when almost all seems lost, it shows an unsympathetic society can go further and take the rest. A damning indictment of a society that would rather fund incarceration than treatment (money well spent the sanctimonious may cry). Even the unwary and innocent are not spared as they are sucked too into the same vortex of self-abuse and addiction, only to be abused more by the cack-handed therapy of the day. A symphony of human misery. A masterpiece."

Compelling but very hard to watch at times, this is one movie that pulls no punches. I have to say, though, that I didn't perceive its theme as being along the lines of ""here's what will happen to you if you take drugs."" The movie doesn't preach or moralize, it just depicts. I did not find myself pitying the characters, but could not help but empathize with them. First time I saw this film, I watched it with my brother, who's also been around a bit, and who responded much the same as I did. My second viewing was just a couple of nights ago and was only partial (part way in and to the end). My reaction, even though I knew what was coming, was about the same.

There's an extremely hallucinatory scene that just blows your mind away.

While many people come into positions in life such as the main woman, it is not quit full of as much servitude as one would expect, especially in the wake of some sort of payment, which endorses our capitalist system well. The belief that drug addicts can not exist in a society, especially one where they are not hurting or being hurt, exist no where else on earth than the US. Even Mexico and poor countries have abandoned this view. As such, this film full-fills the desires, political agendas and wishes of the US government, in labeling drugs and drug addicts in such a way as to de-humanize them, effectively giving everyone a sense of media based representation of realities, and not real people. It does raise some interesting issues, but most people find themselves shocked rather than woken up to some alternative realities existing in their own society."

I saw some of Darren Aronofsky's experimental film work at a film festival in Toronto a little while ago. He comes up with some interesting stuff. Reqeuim is not an easy film to watch, because it is harsh and because it is also artsy, which is an unusual combination. I found myself drawn into the films story and at the same time repelled by the way it ended. I suppose it could not go any other way, but it is a bleak message, lacking in any kind of redemption for the characters inner and outer troubles. It all ends up in one big stinking mess. It is dark work and not entirely rewarding, but it is probably some of the more important film work that has been done lately, anywhere.

"samtfindlay","5","0","2","19 July 2009"," Melodramatic and preachy
","'Requiem for a Dream' is by no means a subtle film. It sets out to be an anti-drug film and goes about achieving this in the obvious manner - by depicting addicts in a downward spiral.<br/><br/>A few points. First of all none of the characters have particularly enviable lives to begin with, and whilst they end up in a far worse place than they start, one feels the drugs are only a symptom of a root problem - the pointlessness of their lives and the existential boredom it brings on. Furthermore none of the characters are remotely interesting people and it is hard to sympathise, much less empathise with them. Ellen Burstyn's character is pathetic to the point of being plain irritating and the three other main characters are a less than stimulating combination of moronic and dull. It is in this sense that the movie really fails - I simply didn't care about these people. And without engagement with the characters the movie becomes little more than an over wrought pornography of detached human suffering.<br/><br/>The movie is also irksome in its preachiness. It tries to bludgeon its message into viewers with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Simply put: take heroin and your life will be destroyed. Oh and forget all your dreams and aspirations, they will never come to pass. Heroin is without a doubt a heinous drug, but this message could have been conveyed in a far more effective and skillful manner and without talking down to audiences - as indeed it was in the far more accomplished 'Trainspotting'.<br/><br/>The movie is, for all this, artfully constructed and well-directed. Nonetheless some of the techniques fall flat and err on the side of gimicky. The split screen used at a few points during the course of the film is just plain annoying and serves little discernible purpose. The strongest aspect of the movie is probably Clint Mansell's haunting score (which first came to my attention long before I saw this film when the piece 'Lux Aeterna' was used in a trailer for 'The Two Towers').<br/><br/>Worth seeing, but not spectacular and certainly not life-changing."

Each scene is wonderfully shot and sub par acting is hard to find in this movie. Requiem for a Dream is one of the most under appreciated films of all time but still one of the best and most powerful. Movies like Requiem for a Dream are hard to find, but be warned this movie is not for the faint of heart as it goes deeps in all aspects of drug addiction. I promise you that once you see Requiem for a Dream you will never forget, because from this powerful film, you just don't get entertainment, you get a pivotal lesson about life. So right now you can buy it of the Playstation Store, Xbox Live Marketplace, Itunes, and obviously netflix, this movie is out there, after this film, you will never understand why it hasn't gotten the attention or popularity as other movies."

","If you've never done hard drugs before, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM will make sure you don't. If you've puked your guts out over your bed, stayed unwashed for a month straight, and sold your mother's TV for a fix, well, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is like last Wednesday.<br/><br/>To say Darren Aronofsky's unflinching mind-bender is an intense cinematic experience is to sell it short - it is a scooping out of your intestines and playing with them before trying to squeeze them back into your torso, all while you're conscious.<br/><br/>Jared Leto and Jennifer Connolly are two young lovers (Harry and Marion) hooked on heroin and dreaming big, nebulous dreams of saving their drug-dealing money to buy a business. Marlon Wayans is their junkie friend, Tyrone, along for the pipe dream.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn is Harry's pill-popping mother, Sara, enamored with an afternoon television game show enough to hallucinate herself into it.<br/><br/>Aronofsky shines his glaring light not just on the emptiness and false hope of heroin addiction, but on the seemingly innocuous addictions of prescription drugs. While Harry, Marion and Tyrone run the gamut of heroin's follies (street killings, their ""savings"" dwindling to nothing while promising themselves they'll make it back with One Big Score, being driven to prostitution, gangrene from needle overuse), Sara becomes obsessed with losing weight via pills to fit into a red dress for an imagined TV appearance - by the time the dress fits her skeletal frame, nothing really matters anymore.<br/><br/>Burstyn's bravura performance admitting truths about the emptiness of old peoples' lives is scary. It is astounding how deep she goes.<br/><br/>When Harry discovers his mum is popping weight pills, he lectures her, ""You don't wanna turn into a dope fiend."" Of course, this hypocrisy falls on deaf ears.<br/><br/>Araonofsky is an emotive film-maker. Everything that comes at us from the screen is geared towards stirring our innards, presented in the most jarring manner possible. Yet Aronofsky does not try to shock with the actual taking of the drugs, like TRAINSPOTTING; instead, whenever his characters fix, it is purveyed in a few crash cuts of iconic visuals. Makes it all the more effective, focusing on the consequences.<br/><br/>With the Kronos Quartet soundtrack evoking darkness and disturbia, REQUIEM touches nerves we thought we'd wiped from our memory in young rock bands and college parties and street denizens spouting all the same inanities, like listening to people in jail holding cells, all saying the same things so many times (""What are you in for?"" ""It wasn't my fault."") that it becomes physically nauseous.<br/><br/>In most movies when down-and-out characters proclaim they're going to Buy That Store or Make That Score, it serves the story arc to achieve their goals - in REQUIEM, the characters are doomed to fail. That's the way junkies are built - all the platitudes in the world cannot change their nature. As a reformed alcoholic once told me: ""Every alcoholic is between drinks."" Which doesn't bode well for the inherent nature of humanity. Two years after telling me this, she proved it.<br/><br/>REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is about the incorrigible ones, those who self-fulfill the prophesy of their weakness. It is a noxious paean to losers the world over. And a horrifying warning to the rest of us who used to get sucked in to driving these losers around to ""a friend's place"" and waiting for one hour in the car while they just went in ""for two minutes to pick up something."" <br/><br/>Mr Garrison from SOUTH PARK put it best: ""Drugs are baiyd. Mm-kay."" <br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."
"Simple_Complexity2012201","7","0","2","23 April 2009"," Not overrated, but for the completely wrong reasons.
","*Spoilers Ahead*<br/><br/>Aside from the chemistry between Harry and Marion; the movie doesn't get good until about 43 minutes in. I.E, you see Marlon Wayans ass naked which is worse than watching execution videos.<br/><br/>It really portrays an intimate relationship between two drug addicts very well; something I loathe; because the happiness felt in these types of relationships are never authentic.<br/><br/>The drug seeking behavior scenes could have been portrayed much better; a better example would be the basketball diaries. Watching a person drug seek (especially for things like speed) is absolutely repulsive and pathetic.<br/><br/>Another thing I like about the movie, though it had no place in the movie itself as it seemed off key; was the fact that they put speeders on par with the ""harder drugs"" which is so true; but yet people are eluded from the truth of this; the power of a drug resides solely on the person and not the drug itself; think about it, it makes perfect sense doesn't it? In a culture ran by fear is it any wonder why Benzos are slowly but surely earning the reputation as the most nightmarish withdrawal of them all? As much as I hate to use the word corporate elite; it's somewhat true in respect to drugs and their power. But when you free yourself from this retardation of fear and drown yourself in the truth you soon come to realize that it's YOU who dictates the power of a drug, and as outlandish as this may sound; I would wager that caffeine can be a more powerful drug than ice if the circumstances are correct. Smiley TL;DR, You choose your own poison, and you suffer the consequence of it, this movie portrays this well.<br/><br/>The reason I believe this movie deserves it's reputation is because it was made in 2000, in an age where a lot of people were blinded and eluded from these things; sad thing is; they learned about them in the completely WRONG way. Which is even worse.<br/><br/>The music is very good but very terrible at the same time; It doesn't fit the movie well at all. The music represents how an audience would view drug addicts and not the actual struggle itself. It's completely off touch. It literally sounds like music that would be played during some grotesque war between good and evil.<br/><br/>Like every other movie that takes itself to seriously, this is just a movie and it is far from reality; if there were a movie that truly represented the spiraling life of drug addicts it would not be something people would want to see. Because in the end people don't want to see bad things; they want to see things that make them feel better about themselves by comparing themselves to exaggerations and false representations of real life things.<br/><br/>Only a fool would be touched by a film like this; saying words like ""powerful."" when they should be saying things like ""I don't think i want to do drugs anymore.""<br/><br/>Besides; after about 1:20 mark the movie just becomes pointless like I previous mention; completely treads from the true reality.<br/><br/>The main problem I have with this movie; is that it doesn't seem to have a down hill snowball effect to it; these kids seem to start off at rock bottom and stay there.<br/><br/>The Basketball diaries is MUCH closer to the TRUTH.<br/><br/>In conclusion - Overrated fantasy with a bad taste of directing gimmicks and unfitting music. 7/10"
"jzappa","10","0","1","10 April 2009"," A Brutalizing Foray into the Vanguard
","I was in the seventh grade when I impulsively borrowed a VHS tape from an older classmate. I knew nothing about it. It simply looked interesting. I went home and watched it. I had no idea how to react. I felt numb. I felt truly horrified and became obsessed by the feelings this movie gave me. At first, I thought this meant hate, but I gradually found myself fascinated by the notion of seeing the film again. And I realized that if a movie can make you feel so strongly, it's a special film. I have seen it a cautious handful of times in the many years since, and it has yet to lose its effect. Incidentally, I owe a great deal of credit to this film for opening a door for me to pursue more, better, powerful films.<br/><br/>Much of what haunted me the first time was the performance of Ellen Burstyn. It is rare that we find movies that feature such dauntless, ballsy and absolutely frighteningly real performances. On one continuous level, she is the embodiment of so many million frail, forgotten old ladies with small worlds and big worries but simple pleasures. What gives her a savory glimmer of hope in the story is such a flight of fancy to such a normal, lonely old woman. On another continuous level, the culmination of her character's course into a nightmarish dreamscape is utterly harrowing. There is nothing to be found in the brutalizing climactic sequences that she says or does that is not excruciatingly undergone by Burstyn. Old women don't get many substantial roles in movies, but isn't Burstyn's Goldfarb the call to action for more? Rarely do we get performances this raw, unrelenting and real from anybody.<br/><br/>What is remarkable about this landmark gateway for the new century of American film is how emphatically director Darren Aronofsky shows the psychological conditions of his addicts. When they use, a window opens fleetingly into a world where everything is as they dream. Then it slams closed, and life is basically a scrounge for the money and drugs to open it again. Nothing else is nearly as motivating for them. Aronofsky brings a new imperativeness to the drug movie by trying to recreate, through his idiosyncratically personal approach, how his characters feel, or yearn to feel, or are scared to feel.<br/><br/>As this down-to-earth nightmare suddenly begins, a widowed housewife is chaining her television to the radiator. It's no use. Her son frees it, and wheels it down the street to a pawn shop. This is a typical visit, we amass. Anything in his mother's house is a conceivable begetter of cash for drugs. The son's girlfriend and best friend are both dependent on drugs as well. So is the mother: to television and sugar. We recall the actors, however remotely. Honestly, save for Marlon Wayans, I had hardly noticed the central cast in any films I'd seen previously. Or at least that's my subjective perception after seeing them in this, to which there's no comparison to the vast majority of the rest of their work, no matter how impressive. Ellen Burstyn's Sara Goldfarb is mussy and overweight in her blowzy house dresses. Her son Harry, played by Jared Leto, is bony and preoccupied. So is his girlfriend Marion, played by Jennifer Connelly. His best friend Tyrone is played by Marlon Wayans, who has minimized all the juice and nerve of his zany personage in the silly movies he's made with his brothers and is just trying to survive in a diplomatic enough way. Tyrone worries, rightly, that he's in trouble but Harry is in more. Burstyn isn't disinclined to play Sara Goldfarb entirely as a disintegrating undoing. Leto's suppurating arm, whipped by too many needles, is like a logo for his life.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is transfixed by the way in which the camera can be used to project how his characters see things, showing us some things and withholding others so that we are first submerged into a nonobjective abstraction and then snatched back to neutrality with the chill of the imperturbable real world. As many times as I've seen modern-day visual stylists produce new and innovative camera and editing techniques, those of Aronofsky's, which he has not recycled for his successive efforts, remain truly original and unique. As much as stylistic conventions and easier, more pleasant viewings are important for the sustenance of cinema, its survival depends on mutations and new forays into the vanguard.<br/><br/>Aronofsky uses extreme closeups to show drugs immersing his characters. First we see the pills, or the fix, filling the screen, because that's all the characters can think about. Then the injection, swallowing or sniffing because that obliterates the troublesome outside world. Then the pupils of their eyes dilate. All done with intense amplification of sounds. The movie was given the valuelessly ignoble NC-17 rating by the MPAA. Anyone under 17, or over, no matter how young or old, who feels like they may be inclined to dabble with drugs might want to see this movie, which plays like a virtual hell. Many from my own age group have claimed to be much less intrigued by the idea of hard drugs after seeing this film.<br/><br/>These sequences are done in fast-motion, to show how rapidly the drugs take effect, and how unsatisfyingly soon they wear off. The intervals flirt with hopeless discomfort. Aronofsky cuts between the mother, a prisoner of her apartment and diet pills, and the other three. Early in the film, he uses a split screen in which the space on both sides is at the disposal of the other. Sara and Harry each have half the screen, but their motions enter into each other's halves. This is an forcibly persuasive manner of showing them alone but together. In an unforgettable ending sequence, he cuts between all four major characters as they lurch toward their irrevocable journey ends."
"ethersong","10","0","1","5 April 2009"," the most incredible movie I've seen in a long time
","I love deep movies. I am one of those bleeding hearts that just sucks up the intensity and movement that can change your life and expand your mind in ways you didn't think were possible. Let me tell you, very few movies move--most attempts at depth are superficial and riddled with all sorts of holes and errors and don't seem accurate or helpful (like Star Wars for instance)<br/><br/>Let me tell you, this movie moved me more than any movie has in a long time.<br/><br/>We all have our dreams, and we all have the substitutes for those dreams that we go after thinking that somehow we are getting somewhere. These personal addictions, whatever they are, are the death of us. I have never seen a movie depict this as strongly as Requiem for a Dream. The brilliance of this movie is that it can happen to everyone, anyone, young or old, successful or not. It is a contemplation on the drive that human beings have but how most of us would rather choose the easy way than to fight for real change and a real better world. In a culture that is saturated with drugs, quick fixes, shortcuts, and get rich quick schemes there is no movie more relevant.<br/><br/>This movie is disturbing and rightfully so. It is gruesome and it is sexual and it is full of drugs and horrible sequences. Everyone needs to watch it. Honestly it doesn't matter if you're offended by these things. We all need to face this type of tragedy. We all need to understand and really feel this message--how the world is continuing to rot from the inside out. We talk about so many problems in this world but rarely does a movie bring it us to the core. <br/><br/>This movie should change lives. You will feel different after this movie."

","This was barely a movie... more like a bad trip.<br/><br/>I started watching this movie around 1 am, and finished somewhere around 3 am. Immediately afterwards, I almost broke down in tears. The downward progression of these four pitiful individuals is enough to make you sick. It truly could be the most moving movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>This movie is a horrifying close-up of the junkies down the alley, the pill-freaks up in the single apartments. It takes you from the initial high to the very end. Every one of these four actors deserves some kind of award... they had me convinced 100%. Not once in the movie do they actually say ""heroin""... it's always slang.<br/><br/>This movie features a scene that is one of two scenes I've had to look away from while watching. Actually, several scenes could qualify as a ""can't watch"" for many people. But this movie is a ""MUST WATCH""... trust me. If not you, show it to your 16-year-old."
"adiomedo","5","0","1","17 December 2008"," Watchable but overrated
","This is just ""Panic in Needle Park"" with indulgent camera effects and---with the exception of Ellen Burstyn---sub-par acting. Jennifer Connelly and Jared Leto mail it in.

As for the goofy camera tricks, I just wished, as I always do with these goofy ""wow, I'm SO drugged out"" gimmicks, I could find drugs that work like that! In the pantheon of drug movies (and I've seen quite a few) this one falls down near the bottom.

"jessejace","8","0","1","6 January 2008"," Misunderstood
","It's a shame how many people mislabel this as a ""drug movie"" (or an ""anti-drug movie""). It's not about drugs. It's about addiction in all its forms. If it seems heavy-handed, it's because it doesn't waste time dabbling in the extras. This movie does what it's supposed to do with a high rate of efficiency.<br/><br/>Few other films simultaneously reach such extremes of beauty and brutality as Requiem does. Watching it will wipe you out for a while, but you'll be back for more in time. My main gripe is Clint Mansell's music score, which sounds more like it should be played on a $20 Casio than by the Chronos Quartet (and which, inexplicably, has become ""one of those soundtracks"" that finds its way into trailers for other movies ALL THE TIME)."
"rob94","9","0","1","5 January 2008"," outstanding,,,
","there are plenty of films that portray the horrors of drug addiction, however there has been none that have nailed it with quite the same brutality and honesty as the mesmerising Requiem For a Dream.<br/><br/>I think that the characters were excellently cast with Jared Leto as the determined Harry Goldfarb as well as Jennifer Connely, but who could forget that fantastic performance by Ellen Burstyn as the lonely widow who's one dream is to fit into her treasured red dress for when she is a contestant on her favourite television show. Towards the end I found Requiem for a Dream very uncomfortable to watch, which is, I'm sure what Darren Aronofsky set out to achieve. Then I found the last scene sinister, powerful and in my opinion absolutely incredible. this is the side of drug culture that we do not see or hear about. Forget Trainspotting, forget Traffic, forget The Panic in Needle Park. If you want to see the reality, if you want to see what drug addiction is doing to our people watch Requiem For a Dream, if you're sure you can stomach it."
"blink182010","10","0","1","3 January 2008"," Shocking
","This film was devastatingly amazing. Darren Aronofsky does not hold back at all, this is a rare film, one that does not contain a happy ending, in fact the ending is as far away from happy as you can get. Ellen Burstyn was robbed of the Oscar which she rightly deserved, all the actors were believable in their roles and made you feel sorry for them even though their turmoil was their own fault. This film shows drug addiction from a different, more shocking side and beautifully portrays the emotional turmoil that addiction makes people experience and shows how low addicts go to get a fix. This is one film that you will never forget and will change your life forever."
"jkagermeier7762","9","0","1","26 January 2007"," Bonus features on DVD worth a look-see
","One of the bonus features on the DVD dealt with Ellen B. frantically cleaning her place and how it was filmed. After a long shooting sequence, Ellen wasn't 100% confident/happy about it and RE-DID it! I highly recommend watching some of how this film was made in the bonus features on the DVD. This film's beauty was not accidental, but instead, came from superb acting and all-around professionalism that may help point out why this film makes such a lasting impression on its viewers. This uncommon film may have its uncomfortable moments - some disturbing scenes (perhaps - depends on one's point of view), but they help make this film a standout because it offers us a view into a world we may either wish to deny or flatly refuse to accept. What should be disturbing isn't the film, but that the world it portrays does exist and likely not as far below the surface as we may ever wish to admit."
"kbone32-1","8","0","1","28 December 2006"," Certainly an Oddity
","This movie is kind of a weird one for sure. I will start with the negative because the movie starts off rather slow and stupid. I remember sitting there watching and thought this is probably the biggest waste of time I could have ever encountered and had the movie continued in it's lacadaisy ramblings it would have been. There was one scene where Jared Leto and Jenn Connelly disable an alarm and sneak onto a roof top and upon coming back inside set the alarm off and escape out the way the came in..Whoa what rebels..And all that to talk and fly paper air planes. Also another short fall is Jared Leto's accent which is New York then it's Boston then it's nothing Ellen Burstyn seems to have the same problem. The directing I find to be annoying as well. They have this scene they use when the characters take drugs and after the first 10 times it kind of gets a bit much. After the other 50 times it gets rather annoying. The end was a bit much as well. The director uses a technique where the lives and situations of many characters are building up to a point such as you would see in, say, call it murder (1935 I think) with Bogart. Done correctly this is rather a neat effect. Instead here it is done way to fast to the point where you could have just blacked out the screen and got the same effect. It was a bit over the top as well as the braking up the screen into 2 or 3 mini screens. That being said when this film takes off it takes off. The performance of the characters as well as how far and fast their lives are sinking is incredible. I have never seen a movie with so many (in my opinion) negatives and yet still blow you back in your chair. After watching you will say holy smokes did that really happen. The remainder of the film is highly intense to the point where it pulls it up out of the hole and turns into a must see for anyone as well as a film you'll want to add to your collection to view again."

"scrotumblender","10","0","1","28 May 2006"," Greatest movie ever
","This movie was never shown in Dutch cinemas and that's a shame. I had never heard of this movie until some of my friends mentioned it. That was in 2004, 4 years after. But to come back to my point: This is the greatest movie ever and I will surely recommend it to everyone I know.<br/><br/>Like a lot off people before me said it's a heartbreaking story of addiction in every way possible. For example Ellen Burnstyn's addiction starts with her television-set and then expands to something much bigger. Darren Aranofsky is by far the best director I'm currently aware off. I had never seen Pi before but I sure will after seeing this movie although I don't think that that movie can beat this. <br/><br/>The storyline is about 4 people each with their own fears and addictions. Sarah Goldfarb has become a TV-junkie after her husband had died. Her son Harry is mostly a heroin-junkie but does all kinds of drugs together with his girlfriend(Connely) and best friend(Wayans).<br/><br/>The movie starts when Harry is stealing his mother's TV again in order to buy some drugs. From that point on everything is going downwards for the characters, but it's not unbelievable at all. Most drug-movies aren't portrayed as realistically as this one. My mom is an elderly lonely woman and this movie shocked me badly. I was actually thinking about the fact that this could happen to her as well. There's no use explaining the whole storyline because that would spoil a part of your viewing pleasure. What I can say is that all the actors in this movie are perfect for their characters. All the actors aren't well known in Holland except for Ellen Burnstyn ( The exorcist of course ) Ellen Burnstyn has to be the best female actor in the world today. The scene in which Harry finds out his mom is on uppers just rips my heart out, I can't describe it. Marlon Wayans proved he is a valid actor, in Holland he's only known for the Wayans bros. Jennifer Connely and Jared Leto are the perfect counterparts and you can feel the chemistry between them the entire movie.<br/><br/>I would also like to mention that the soundtrack of this movie is incredibly good. Every time I hear the song: Lux aeterna ( the main theme) it brings back the feeling I had after I had seen the movie. <br/><br/>To make a long story short: Perfect story , good acting, great director and a stunning soundtrack that still gives me the chills every time I hear it.<br/><br/>It's a movie you want to see but the second time it's even harder to watch."
"LuckyGraveyardBoots","8","0","1","9 May 2006"," art film at its finest
","Unfortunately the only thing I'd heard previously about this film was that Jared Leto's eyes are dreamy, so I put off renting it for a bit. I have no idea how it got to be the success that it is - it's basically an art-house film with cutting-edge interpretive camera work and grueling to watch besides. The only big problem I saw was, why on earth is Jared Leto's character addicted to heroin? His girlfriend Marion is a jaded, little-girl-whore type, his best friend has mother issues, and his own mother, Sara Goldfarb (played by Ellen Burstyn) has probably the most convincing and affecting drug addiction ever - a lonely, old widow who gets a phone call saying she'll be on TV and consequently becomes addicted to diet pills. The uppers make her irrationally happy, and she keeps going on nothing more than a dream of recapturing her old self, her family, and her happiness. Ellen Burstyn is amazing (you may remember her from The Exorcist) and I have that much more respect for her when I found out she was the co-president of The Actor's Studio after Lee Strasberg died - along with Harvey Keitel and...and...Al Pacino! Returning to the topic - the camera work is the main thing here. In some parts it gives the impression of being on tranquillizers, diet pills, crack, what have you - also despair - and in the last scene, with cuts in between extremely traumatic experiences for each of the main characters, it literally gives you a headache, but you still can't look away. In that way, and also in its extremely sympathetic approach to drug addiction, it's fearless in a way you don't see much anymore. I shall end with the conclusion that Jennifer Connely is an execrable actress, and that Requiem for a Dream is a must-see."

"moreofisscience","9","0","1","7 May 2006"," Requiem=Pi squared?
","One of the reasons I enjoyed Requiem for a Dream was that in many aspects (especially the visual) it was very much like Pi, only amped up a notch. As specific examples: the quick montages of Susan taking one extra pill every time mirror those of Max in Pi doing the same. Also, Aronofsky has taken out his trusty camera that straps to the actor and points at their face. Again, he uses this in both films in moderation and to great effect. Finally, I found that in both films, at the climax, there was a rush of confusion and emotion. In this case, as I was watching the small scene where Harry's arm is being cut into, I was immediately reminded of the drill scene in Pi. So, I would say that throughout this film I got the sense that Pi was simply practice for Aronofsky, and his final goal was Requiem: there is only one character in Pi,as opposed to four; Pi is black and white, while Requiem plays with color to set the mood throughout; etc. This is Aronofsky at his finest, and I believe he may have set the standard for drug-related drama."

","What an unrelentingly bleak story. I found it almost unwatchably sad for the last half an hour or so.

Great performances, and great casting too. The Leto/Connelly combination is superb - such a physically beautiful pairing and they play the romantic lovers roles so endearingly that it makes it even harder to watch as they slide into a despairing, sordid junkie hell. I suppose what makes it so tough to watch is that the characters are inherently likable, aspiring only to simple, understandable human dreams for fulfilment. Personally I like my films to have some crumb of comfort to them, some note of optimism to cling onto - not this one, and while I'm in no hurry to watch it again, it is unquestionably a great piece of work and highly recommended. But be prepared to go through the mill when watching it.."

","There are only a couple other films that convey the reality of severe addiction the way that Requiem for a Dream does.

It is not a fun movie, but it is in exceptionally when written, directed, and acted movie that is worth experiencing. At times, the film is so dark and caustic that you endure the film as much as watch it, but that is because it is courageous and honest enough to convey the living hell of heroin and speed addiction.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, the characters are already messed up, but they still have hopes and dreams -- to some degree, you can still see who they are as people. The film shows the recklessness of the younger characters and the pain and longing of the mother evolving drug abuse into addiction and dependence. As it does, dreams, hope, and self are forgotten. The characters become defined by the consuming need to maintain their habits. In the end, there is not much but loss and ruin. The film is also brave enough not to wrap up everything with a tidy Hollywood ending; it takes you to the point where things have to break, and it gives some resolution, but leaves the specter of what has happened and what is yet to come lingering in the way that it would in real life.<br/><br/>Some people call this movie preachy, but it is not. It is *accurate* which is a pretty big anti-drug statement, but it is not one of those shallow films trying to teach you a lesson. Other people are so put off by the grim reality that this film presents that rather than accepting that addiction can be this awful and realizing these characters are just normal people consumed by addiction, they write the characters off as shallow and the movie as negative, but again, the tone of the movie is not gratuitous or hateful, it sympathetic enough to honestly present the horrors of severe addiction."

","I don't know why I'm just now getting around to reviewing this film - it truly is a modern masterpiece and one of the most powerful films I've ever seen - and I watch a lot of this kind of thing. Anyone who has gone through addiction or personally has a friend or family member that has should be able fully relate to this film - and those that haven't should look at REQUIEM FOR A DREAM as a realistic portrayal of the devastating effects of drug abuse. I will keep my synopsis brief, as no words I could come up with could possibly describe the sheer ""rawness"" and honesty of this film...<br/><br/>Harry, Marion, and Tyrone are kids who are recreational drug users - a little pot here, a little blow there, a taste of H once in a while...no big deal at first. Then the friends decide to deal heroin to make some cash and begin ""sampling the goods"" a little too often. Soon the group is spiraling into the descent of lies, denial, and sheer madness that is hardcore drug addiction. Meanwhile, Sara (Harry's mother), is fighting her own addiction to diet pills and is swiftly losing the battle. Everyone involved is on a one-way path of self-destruction until the shocking and harrowing conclusion.<br/><br/>REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is honestly one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. Being able to identify with this film - I can attest to the realism of some of the things portrayed and feel that it is one of the best ""cautionary tale"" pictures ever made.

"Tazmanhomie","9","0","1","8 February 2006"," Aronofsky's expert depiction of exponential decline into helplessness
","Pragmatically speaking, there is little more to the plot of Requiem for a Dream than watching four people take six months to approach the inevitability of completely destroying their existences with drugs. Aronofsky's depiction thereof, however, is positively masterful. The hundred minutes are woven together into three signposted segments (summer, fall and winter), each of which is a continuous aptly scored orchestration of addiction and emotion, punctuated only by Aronofsky's rapid-cut drug-use sequences.<br/><br/>Summer sees the four all content, with their respective addictions well-supported, their lives all headed in the correct directions, albeit down ominously crooked paths. The score is light. Aronofsky concludes summer with an emotional and lengthy confrontation between Harry and Sara Goldfarb - clearly the longest cut in the film, and the first in which the characters begin to feel uncomfortable. This uncertainty and tension spills over into fall, when everything begins to turn sour, and the score begins to intensify. The framework supporting the quartet's addictions begins to fray, as Sara begins to increase her drug intake, and the relationship between Harry and Marian begins to falter.<br/><br/>Hitherto, Aronofsky had depicted a fairly stagnant summer, with situations slowly worsening through fall; winter sees the supportive framework around each character collapse, with Sara's physical and mental condition deteriorating, Harry's arm worsening, his relationship with Marian shattered, and Marian's reliance upon prostitution to support her addiction, all with exponentially increasing intensity. The score and cutting subtly follows suit; through the entire winter movement, the music increases in intensity and malice (Marian's score, little more than a light piano melody, grows eerier as the music around it intensifies), and the cuts from scene to scene become faster, and the horrors depicted in them become harder to watch. When the film has finally surpassed its climax, Aronofsky offers no comforting ending: just a portrait of the shattered lives of four helpless individuals.<br/><br/>The purpose of the film is clear: portray the unforgiving result of hard drug use, and; to show how a situation which has been stable for a long time can spiral into oblivion in a fraction of that time. Aronofsky, with a film which lives up to the term 'requiem,' as well as the four lead actors in the film, succeed in depicting exactly these things in a film which demands its viewers are made to feel as uncomfortable as possible for at least ten or fifteen minutes leading to its climax. Very powerful, very moving, and quite excellent."

"stodruza","7","0","1","25 January 2006"," This is a powerful and great simple story, but the material is too spare to be great.
","Harry Goldfarb is a not a bad guy, he has many redeeming qualities just the wrong dream. He cares about his mother, has a nice good looking girlfriend that likes him, and at least one friend. And we see those redeeming qualities in scenes that are too short, and maybe a little too pat. OK, this is the scene where he shows us that he is caring son, this is the scene where...that's how the scenes ultimately come off; striped to the bone of most nuances of humanity and as a vehicle to move the story along. I don't like Leto's work much, but it is still difficult to blame his performance and not the script's abridgment in this movie. One could almost sense Aronovky struggling with the limits of the budget, but that's still not an excuse for the underwritten quality of the scenes in this film. When you're making something this powerful, you go to the United States Department of Health and Human Services or NIDA for the extra cash to shoot three or four more scenes. <br/><br/>Consider the following scene. Marion and Harry go to have a wild time, off drugs, if we can imagine that, on the Atlantic city boardwalk. It is important for us to see them bonding while not on drugs, since only then when they do commit that unpardonable sin to the self, we can fully empathize with each of them. They ride the Farris wheel, then go grab a hot dog, and after that end up on the roof like they did in the film. A sequence, and not individual scenes no lees. <br/><br/>Aronovsky would have done well spending some time in humanizing the characters further before unleashing their devastating fall. Before you tear it down you have to build it up. If one hasn't built all of the relationships and the characters up before tearing them down, then there really isn't much to tear down. Our emotions are continually obligated to grind and shift from gear to gear following the choices and actions of the characters, instead of cruising easily in automatic.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Requiem, with its balls out creativity, relies too much on those same special effects for emotional substance which should have been created with more action and perhaps dialog. That kind of creativity can only underline what is already there, not create it by its presence. It seems to me the kind of special effect shots Aronovsky uses play best when they are part of a cohesive symphony rather than an elongated short story. This is a powerful and great simple story, but the material is too spare to be great. <br/><br/>This is a great film for Aronovsky. Standing on the shoulders of the visuals of his mostly unmatchable student film Pie, Requiem explodes with raw energy and socially attempts and succeeds to some degree to undue as someone has written, :""...everything that Tarantino has done to make drugs glamorous."" It is a great little story, and a very good film. All it needed to be great are the few things that I talk about. 20/20 hindsight is a wonderful thing, but judging from his work on Pie, and now this film, cutting his story aesthetic toward minimalism when it doesn't exactly serve the content might be ingrained in this director. If I am right, time will tell if and how his films will mature."

","I saw a screening of this film before it opened, to prepare for an interview with Ellen Burstyn. Nothing I had heard about it prepared me for what I saw. In fact, when the lights came up, a man sitting next to me (with a thick French accent) said 'Why would anyone make a film like this?' Although the characters in the film aren't particularly likable, it's hard not to feel for them as drugs (street and prescription) take over their lives, and plunge each of them into their own private hell. The split-screen gimmicks and altered film speeds work perfectly here --all contributing to the visual assault that, by film's end, leaves you feeling battered and crushed. The plot is minimal, but the performances are wrenching and (pardon the cliché) not for the squeamish. Watching Burstyn's descent is terrifying, something akin to seeing your favorite aunt being tortured, and wishing you could reach into the screen and help her. Wayans is amazing, a total surprise.

","After watching ""The day after tomorrow"" and ""Spider man"", this movie was like a punch in the face.<br/><br/>Reality. That's what this movie is all about.<br/><br/>Summary: In two or three short sentences, this movie is about the Goldfarbs (Leto and Burstyn) and two friends of the son (Wayans and Connelly). All of them have a story, all of them has a problem (anorexia, prostitution, drugs, prison...) and... A DREAM. The goal is to get to that goal, whatever the consequences are... In the end... well... you'll see!<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is a must-see movie. Not only is the story truly interesting, the actors are great and the music is absolutely fantastic (if you've seen ""Lord of the rings, The two Towers"" and the most recent ""Zathura"", those movies have the same kind of soundtrack).<br/><br/>Personally, I started to cry after seeing that movie... Why? I have no clue... Probably just because it's real."
"tedschram","8","0","1","24 November 2005"," great acting, but some characters are a little unrealistic
","I thought this was a very good movie, well acted, and with an important point to get across, which it mostly succeeded in getting across. In reviews for ""Spun"", which this movie is sometimes compared to, people would say that Requiem is the better of the two. Requiem is more serious while Spun is more comical. Both movies, I feel, have some issues with plot and character writing. For instance, I find Mrs. Golfarb's shallowness and weaknesses and childlike obsession with the red dress and the TV show and all a little hard to believe. I've known some 60-year old ladies who are nothing like that! Also, the speed with which she gets committed at the end of the movie, it just seems a little unrealistic. It got the point across, and her acting was so good that it wasn't too distracting while I was watching it, but now that I think about it, it does take away from the overall impact of the film.<br/><br/>Since Spun takes a more comic angle, they can be a little looser with reality."

It's not the simple Holiwood movie, a film director didn't play with such things as pop music, he shows the truth, not all those old and boring L.A. tags, he shows the real life as it is.

At first, drugs actually appear to be improving their lives. I thought this was going to be a lighthearted, pro-drug movie.

It's like seeing ""Jaws"", and never again being able to dive into the ocean without a little tinge of fear.<br/><br/>If High Schools showed this movie, drug use would plummet.

"MacAindrais","7","0","1","16 November 2005"," Great Camera work and imagery, yet almost absent storyline.
","Requiem for a Dream: ***<br/><br/>The Camera work of Requiem for a Dream is interesting and wonderful. Arnofsky uses split screens at times which was something not often seen, and fast moving sequences in which the drugs are taken. Very slick stuff, even if it becomes repetitive. Aside from the interesting visual experience to be found in 'Requiem' there isn't much else to be had. The story line is marginal and though this is perhaps intentional, it offers us little in regards to sympathy for the characters. The only person I felt for throughout the movie was Sarah, the mother. Ellen Burstyn does a fantastic job here and makes her character seem real. You will feel sorry for her. As for Leto's, Wayan's, and Connelly's characters, I certainly felt very little, if not nothing at all. They bring about the products of their own demise. We learn somethings about them along the way, but their stories feel forced. Wayans character has a flashback to his childhood with his mother, which has some fantastic cinematography, but it feels pointless and clichÃ©d. We learn that Connelly wants to be a designer but other than her drawing occasionally in between hits, and the attempts of Harry (Leto) to get her to open her own shop, it registers little with us. Harry Goldfarb has one pivotal scene with his mother in which we see that he does love her, and is sorry for pawning off her television regularly for drug money. This scene is far and away the most emotionally involved, and my favorite, scene in the whole movie. I hoped that after such a fantastic scene that this emotion would continue, yet it doesn't. We see Harry's concern for his mothers new found diet pills, yet thats it. He cries afterwards, then it is no longer mentioned. All of these things may very well be intentional, but they take away from the emotions we should feel for all of these people. Seeing Sarah being torn apart and spiraling into insanity was very realistic and it grabs you and punches you in the guts, but not the others. In the end, this movie feels more like a collection of pictures that have been jammed together. Despite these flaws, I'm still giving this movie a 7/10 ( or *** out of four stars if you will) I give it such a grade because this movie puts this collections of pictures together and offers fantastic visions and insight into the mind( or lack of) a drug addict. Most of the scenes are a visual representation of something, and all of such shots are useful and never unnecessary. Thirdly, even if you only feel sympathy for Sarah Goldfarb, you feel so terribly for this character that you literally will feel, I mentioned above, like you've been punched square in the guts. The most important reason however is that this film is important. It is a gritty look at the tortured lives of addicts. It shows how horrible these drugs are, and no sane person will leave this thinking "" gee we should go get high"" It will turn you off, and leave you flacid."

","While I have great respect for Darren Aronofsky I know this film would not exist without the original story by Hubert Selby Jnr. They are both to be commended for their genius.<br/><br/>This is an extraordinary film, perfect in every way (apart from a couple of minor glitches I noticed, not worth mentioning).<br/><br/>I particularly like the way Aronofsky has cameo appearances by Selby (prison guard in kitchen), his father Abraham (man on train in hat), and James Chinlund (long-haired man on train). Similarly he had Clint Mansell in 'Pi' as a student photographer.<br/><br/>I also like the reuse of particular actors between the two films - Sean Gullette, Samia Shoaib and Ben Shenkman especially.<br/><br/>There are so many aspects to this story - a snapshot of ordinary lives, interactions between mother and son, a relationship turning sour, a friendship stretched to breaking point, the quality of life ultimately destroyed.<br/><br/>In my opinion, only Tyrone really ""survives"", even though his final scene shows him on a prison cot, suffering withdrawal symptoms. It seemed to me he never became as deeply addicted as Marion or Harry, and was able to exercise some control over his habit. So even though he's in prison, he's still alive and relatively sane, compared to the main other characters.<br/><br/>Sara has a nirvana of sorts at the end - although her brain is fried. In this state she can live completely within her head. Being in hospital means she's cared for in the basic ways - food, shelter, hygiene - and can concentrate on herself.<br/><br/>There is hope for Harry - also in hospital, and with his infected arm removed, he may yet have some kind of life. For Marion, though, I fear, there is only further decline."

","I just saw this movie, and I am feeling absolutely blown away by everything about it. The cinematography, while being stylish, never strayed from the point of the film. The acting in the movie was spot-on. The overall theme of the film was well-expressed, and many scenes from this movie will stay with me for the rest of my days.<br/><br/>The movie is basically about the lives of four people spinning out of control because of drugs. The great thing about the way the story is told is that it is extremely dramatically shot and edited so that it never loses its fast pace.<br/><br/>This movie certainly makes you feel like the characters as they descend into the hellish lifestyle that comes along with drug addiction. This is probably due to the great acting and the well-written story that never stumbles on itself. Like said before, the pacing is so damn fast that you never feel like it's dragging on.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, this movie is definitely one that shows how drugs can destroy lives, and it does it very effectively. It was extremely impactful, and I suggest it to anyone who feels like they can handle the subject matter."

You must see it for yourself and decide if you like it or not, if you like the technique Aronofsky used or if the plot and characters suits you or not...<br/><br/>And here is the contradiction: if you have not seen it you've missed a one of a kind piece of (art)work which could change your life. After you've seen it... the effect could be so deep and the shock so great that you can fall in a depression (at worst) or you could see what and how big are the changes you should make inside of you.<br/><br/>I've read comments saying it's bad because of the technique (the recurring pills, the dilating pupil) or because its message is lame (don't do drugs)... Yes, you can say that. But you can also say that about other classic movies, in fact no matter how good a movie is, if you separate the techniques and the subject you will always find flaws in it.<br/><br/>Some comments also say it's bad because of the unrealistic ending... but wait a minute...it's not a reality TV show. And lets be honest: do you think it's possible to tell an important message, to reach to everybody's beliefs and shake them like hell without exaggerating a little?<br/><br/>Then there are comments saying this movie is bad (and yet some of them give 10 points out of 10) because it made them feel bad, depressed after seeing it. Well... I think that that was its intention... To make people feel bad, to make people think again before doing something alike (and not only alike...to make people think of human condition).<br/><br/>Well, I think it's a movie that you can like and dislike in the same time, a movie with a profound effect on you, whether in a good or bad manner and you are the only one to decide that, not your friends, nor some reviews or comments (like mine :-P ).

"compeverything02","9","0","1","29 October 2005"," Impossible to take lightly
","Its hard to start this review out. So I'll try and explain what I felt while watching the movie, instead of explaining the movie itself. Heres how I look at this film: You have ""horror"" flicks, you have ""thrillers"", you have ""dramas"". This movie fits into every single one of thoughs categories. To me there's really not many scary movies out there. My idea of a scary movie isn't ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Halloween"". Tts movies like this one, movies were the base of the story is so deep that it makes you want to cry, movies that make you look at the people watching it with you, and saying, ""I never want that to happen to that person"". This IS reality, there is nothing scarier to me than reality, it has the ability to touch your emotions in a way that no monster flick could ever do. When the hair on your arms and neck stand up and you have to fight the tears in your eyes so that the people around you don't notice your emotions, and you soon realize that they are trying to do the exact same thing, you know that the film has a meaning, has a reason, and should be taken seriously. Thats how this film is, and if you are able to take it lightly, and get up from it without having a second thought, then maybe you need to watch it again and pay closer attention.<br/><br/>I don't believe in reality TV, thoughs two words are the biggest oxymoron's that have ever come across my mind. But this movie really makes me think. Through this entire movie I thought of the pain my mother would feel, and that I would feel if I were in this situation. I'm not going to spoil this movie for you, but even if I told you word for word what happens, watching it gives a whole different meaning to the movie. I like to use the term ""Shock and Awe"".<br/><br/>Be warned that there are parts that many would be offended by, but that is simply the reality of the situation. Please, do yourself a favor, and don't pass up this movie, it could change your or someone you knows life, as corny as that sounds to be drawn out of a movie.<br/><br/>Jeremy."

If you want to have a look into (potential) drug addiction life, then this movie is it. 10 out of 10."
"wheresmyshoelace","9","0","1","26 October 2005"," Better Than Pi
","Darren Aronofsky's follow-up to the art-house hit Pi is the tremendously controversial cult smash Requiem for a Dream (2000), a haunting portrayal of drug addiction adapted for the screen by the original author Hubert Selby Junior. The film deals with the separate addictions of four inter-related characters. Marion Silver, her boyfriend Harry Goldfarb, his mother Sara and best friend Tyrone C. Love all suffer parallel drug addictions, which sprout from the pursuit of a better life.<br/><br/>Harry Goldfarb (Jarred Leto) and Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) start off with the pipe dream of dealing their own supply of heroin and working their way up to a ""pound of pure"". This dynamic duo's scheme quickly turns sour when they find themselves addicted to their own supply. This film is proof that Marlon Wayans (Scary Movie, White Chicks) is not just a talented comic but also a talented actor. Jared Leto of Fight Club and Alexander fame does phenomenally as Harry, Sara's druggie and wayward son trying to support his girlfriend and mother.<br/><br/>Sara Goldfarb, played by Ellen Burstyn, who was nominated for an Academy Award and Golden Globe for her boldly brutal performance, is an elderly widow dependent on television's deranged self-help infomercial to cure her loneliness as well as her diet pills, which feed her hopeless obsessions. Her downwards spiral is horrific and shocking. Overall, the best female performance in years, especially for such a daring role.<br/><br/>Marion Silver, Harry's seemingly innocent girlfriend played by Labyrinth's Jennifer Connelly, is the most downward spiraling character of them all. The all-American girl by the finale becomes the absolute victim of substance abuse and leaves you with a sense of unrest and unease. Her absolute desperation drives her to perform horrific sex shows in exchange for drugs, which is a last resort after abandonment from her heroin-providing lover.<br/><br/>While all of the addictions suffered by these four desperate characters are different they share a similar basic need; the sensation of escape, the overwhelming thrill, and as well as a connection to something other than themselves (and the overwhelming thrill). These initially mild drug addictions drive the characters to unimaginable lengths. The source of all of these soul destroying paths is Harry and Tyrone's naive need to launch a scheme to become players in the Brooklyn drug market, Marion dreams of being a fashion designer with her own boutique, Sara develops her own fantasy; the potential to make an appearance on her beloved television makes her fixated on stuffing herself back into a favorite red dress for her date with stardom.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's unique visual style is itself a drug. It provides the viewer with the need for more and a feeling of longing, which will last for hours. From his extreme close-ups, split screen and bird eye spiral shots, this film is a visual feast fit for any film buff. Aided with a terrific score written by Clint Mansel and performed by the astounding Kronos Quartet. Requiem uses this to its advantage, the climatically devastating montages of each character's decent into hell is so horrific, but engaging, you find yourself unable to look away. While being visually engaging the images contrast the oral aspect, as it is a delight to the ear. The score provides a pleasantly haunting theme which is used throughout the film, occasionally mixed in which mechanical-like chants which set the tempo as well as mood.<br/><br/>Overall, Requiem for a Dream is a feast for the senses, as well as a stunning wakeup call about addiction and substance abuse. Each story has a unique arc as well as an emotional strong-point. This brilliantly made film leaves you with a strong taste of sadness and failure, which is quite ironic, as it is a highly accomplished and quite brilliant movie. It will likely leave you feeling devastated and exhilarated at the same time."

Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly)wants to succeed as well. They do this by selling heroin, making lots and lots of money.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn)is a widow who spends her days sitting outside with her elderly friends and watches the Tappy Tibbons show. She soon gets the opportunity to appear on the show and,wanting to wear a red dress that she wore years ago, starts taking pills to help her lose weight. <br/><br/>Soon, these four people take the proverbial highway to hell: Their addictions start to slowly destroy their lives.

Their dreams are long gone. The only thing that is important is to get their next fix.<br/><br/>All of the performances in the film (To this day, I am shocked by Marlon Wayans performance.

She gets an opportunity to be happy again in the form of the pills. But she pays a steep price for her happiness (As do Harry, Tyrone and Marion).<br/><br/>If you want to scare someone who has a serious drug problem, then this film will do the job.<br/><br/>There is also an unrated version (Which is just a tad more shocking).

Drugs.<br/><br/>This is a special and out of the ordinary movie in so many ways. It's quite unique for an American movie. It has a more European look and feel to it. The story is good and strong and well written. You get caught up in it and won't leave. You don't really get to know that much about the characters, but at the same time you get so know so much you feel sympathy for them and feel that you know them. While the story may be a lot slower than you average American movie it's also a lot stronger and touches you in a way your average movie doesn't.<br/><br/>The acting is just great. Especially Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb does a great job. She is sad, sane, insane and happy all in one movie and all at the same time. Her character is absolutely crazy and she portrays this very well. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are good actors as well and really shows it in this movie. Their performance is very good.<br/><br/>The movies cinematography is odd. It's not typical American in any way. Never the less it's great. It's way better than in most American movies exactly because they dear to be original. Without this almost experimental kind of music video looking cinematography this movie wouldn't be as strong as it is. It's one of those things that makes this movie stick out of the crowd and makes you remember it.<br/><br/>You can't say anything about this movie and not mention the score. It is beautiful. It's a mix between classic and electronic. It has a simple theme that is played over again and it's something you remember. It is used all through the movie and at the beginning it sounds nice while at the end is sound awful. It changes with the movie, with the mood and boost the mood very well.<br/><br/>As for special effects this movie has actually quite a few. More than I expected, but they don't over do it. In fact I didn't really notice that they were special effects. They bring out the mood and the story very well and are also very well done.<br/><br/>Requiem For A Dream is not one of those movies you watch and just forget.

","an interesting form of filming. In my time, watching many drug films, I've found they either show self destruction (The Basketball Diaries, Trainspotting) or just trippy experiences (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.) This film shows both. The film moves at a rather fast pace to emphasise how quickly the effects of drugs take a hold on people. Each story is separated by a short scene, which show essentially what they are addicted to, be it pills, shooting up or money. The films generally dark nature shows each person spiraling into oblivion and although conflicts seem to be resolved, the scenario left to us is not one of hope, but defeat, that although they have survived the worst, nothing will be the same, and it never gets better. If you have never seen a drug film before, make this one your first."

Sara, the mother played by Ellen Burnstyn thinks she is going to be on a game show geared toward self improvement. She gets overly excited and starts to take pills to lose a few pounds for when she goes on TV. Her son Harry and his best friend Tyrome on the other hand keeps his hope set on drug money and the life he'll someday get to live so he can support his girlfriend Marion and she can finally open up a boutique like shes always wanted to do. Their dreams soon fail when sara becomes addicted to weight loss pills and Harry and Tyrome soon become addicted to the very drug they were going to get rich off of. The suffering is so believable and gradual so its like taking a walk to the park in the middle of the day. In the end all one can wish for the characters is death but even that seems hopeless. The closer and closer the movie gets to the end the anxiety just keeps growing and the viewer is left spellbound in front of the screen wishing they could just turn their head or shut off the TV.

There is my opinion here: <br/><br/>This movie is the most controversial, strong, descriptive and feeble that I have seen in my life, and that that I saw the censored version, imagine the uncensored version, I find an excellent option to see, and in my opinion, it is a fair movie to teach to all the drug addicts of the world, in the situations so precarious in those that fall for its addiction. I have not still seen the NC-17 version, and practically it would not be so interested in seeing it, since the movie left me in shock to see so much violence and crudeness joins. In the boards I left a message asking of what I got lost in this respect. As final decision, I vote it 9/10 for: Originality, Realism and controversy in a situation common to world level. Congratulations to the cast and crew."

","After months of anticipation, I finally got a chance just to sit, alone at home, and watch this artwork by Darren Aronofsky. I'd like to say that the cinematography is beyond genius, thus you I also have to say that the editing projects Aronofsky thoughts about drugs and their affects. The four main characters rolls are so convincing that you feel like crawling into the fertile position at the end.<br/><br/>Well done to Jennifer Connelly, at first it's a bit hard to get into her character, and then by the end you feel so sorry for her. Marlon Wayans, from comedy dope head to a powerful drug addict. This is a very big leap to take from comedy to a heavy drama, but Marlon shows you he can handle himself in such a powerful movie. Jared Leto, I found I was convinced by Jared's character the most, next to Ellen Burstyn, from his powerful entrance to his weeping end. This character is not to be stereotyped, as we see he can be a typical junkie, but at the same time a normal son with compassion and love for his mother. Ellen Burstyn, she should have won that Oscar for her performance. She projects the true side affects of such drugs, loneliness and having to conform to societies wishes. Her character I felt related a bit to Jack Nicholson in 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'.<br/><br/>I feel that if you haven't seen this movie you haven't lived."

","Everyone should see it, thats a start...<br/><br/>But I don't know if I can say it was good. It was marvelously created, and I can think of NO movie that has impressed an emotion (or a whole flock of them) as strongly as this film. Innovative direction and truly spectacular acting makes these characters come to life and feel uncomfortably human and in too many ways, not dissimilar from myself. The storyline is also very original and particularly suitable for depicting the kind of misery the author and director were so obviously aiming for.<br/><br/>It even motivated me to get off my ass and do some community service. But it just made me feel so entirely depressed and sick by the end of it, that I can't say I enjoyed watching it. But wow what a film."

","I had heard so many wonderful (and controversial) things about Darren Aronofsky's REQUEIM FOR A DREAM. How sexually explicit and graphic the drug use was in this film, how the MPAA would not release this with an R rating and all that nonsense. Unfortunately, I was overseas when this movie came out so I never got a chance to see it. Luckily, I recently rented it and was absolutely stunned. This is simply put the best film I have ever seen. I thought the acting was magnificent, the situations realistic, and it truly shows what happens when drug use takes over every aspect of your life. Having lost countless friends to drugs, I can truly appreciate the nature of what these characters had to go through and I am thankful that the director chose to shoot it realistically and not stylistically. I just wish they would show this movie in schools."

","This movie is so well-done from the beginning up to the end. Darren Aronofsky does a great job in this movie. The acting from Ellen Burstyn simply is brilliant, and should of won the Academy Award for best actress. Her character like the other three main characters(Jared Leto Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans) have a very hard life that just keeps getting harder. Marlon Wayans brings some comedy into the film, but very little. THE MOVIE IS DEPRESSING. No doubt about that so if you are looking for a laugh don't watch this one. Still the movie does an excellent job in every aspect. I won't say how the plot is because i hate ruining movies but it is very engaging.<br/><br/>Bottom line i recommend this movie to everyone and give it 10/10 which i don't do very often. so that means go and see it.<br/><br/>Peace"

","First, I have to say that I never felt a movie hurt me before. It slapped me in the face, punched me on the kidneys, kicked me in the bowels. But I think it's the director's systematical work for the movie made me the way I felt.<br/><br/>No sense in explaining or summarizing the film. I want to write about the system. Aronofsky has instituted a rare system for his movie that makes it run on itself. The sequences for certain drugs, the sequences for drinking coffee, turning on the TV, split screens and all details build up a skeleton for the film. The story then finds its space to fit in. It's excellent work. <br/><br/>It's like Edgar Allan Poe's masterpiece, Raven... Mathematically perfect, calculated with absolute attention, Darren Aronofsky's film is like a poem you can write in two years. The perfectness of the piece squeezes your heart and mind bit by bit until the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Will I watch it again? I'll say, of course. Don't you listen to a song you like a million times even it's depressing or whatever?.."

","This film is flawless. A simple idea executed perfectly. Without subtlety, this is a truly intoxicating experience. The characters experience a transition from mundane, but happy lives to living nightmares, where death seems to be a better option. Drug addiction is a common theme in films but this film is limitless in the scope of the issue. From young people needing cash to the lonely and elderly. Their lives change in a way I could never imagine.<br/><br/>Inovation is also prominent, with split screens used in tight rations, camera-work to increase the intensity of a certain scene, whether violent or serene. Music is important and the musical score here is catchy and emotive, perfectly suited for this film. The acting is also amazing. This film, unlike others of its time does not rely on visual effects, but the skill of the cast and crew which makes this film a work of pure genius."
"Jonny_Numb","9","0","1","7 August 2005"," gives new meaning to ""a true cinematic experience""...
","There are many fine montages in ""Requiem for a Dream,"" edited rapidly and done repetitiously in a way that conveys a point explicitly within a few seconds (whereas most movies would take the more conventional, straight exposition route); however, some of these montages whiz by to the point where they lack clarity. For instance, there is a scene early in the film where Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto with a Brooklyn accent) and Tyrone Love (Marlon Wayans in a non-comedic role) are shown hanging around a closed carnival booth after dark--we see hands pull something from behind tires (and also what appear to be garbage cans) and then rip open clear plastic pouches of cocaine or heroin while car alarms blare over the soundtrack. Maybe I'm not astute enough to realize what is going on (are they stealing and selling car stereos to help finance Marion Silver's (Jennifer Connelly) break into the garment business? what?), but that leads to my overall impression of ""Requiem for a Dream"": the details of the plot are consistently choppy, but ultimately irrelevant. Like the drug-addled culture it at first panders to, then thunderously condemns, ""Requiem"" is more about the propulsive powers of addiction than a straightforward narrative--in essence, any narrative that emerges is an outgrowth of the characters' actions, and in the end, things are wrapped up in a bleak, downbeat way (really the only possible conclusion that can be reached). Co-writer/director Darren Aronofsky (who cut his teeth on the stylish but showy black-and-white psychodrama ""Pi"") uses every stylistic device imaginable to convey the escalating effects of addiction (passages of drug use are signaled by montages of prepping heroin works, rolling blunts, and excited cells in the bloodstream); anyone who has had even a passing infatuation with illegal substances will be surprised at the accuracy with which this is conveyed--Aronofsky's decision to speed up or slow down film, use a fisheye lens, steadicam shots, or even show waves of heat rising from a closed refrigerator, successfully hypnotizes the viewer in a manner as gripping as a dissolved drug. The characters, and the paths they have chosen (including Ellen Burstyn--who really WAS robbed of an Oscar--as a widower who becomes addicted to diet pills) are compelling, misguided, and all too human; their rationale for remaining hooked on the substances that ultimately determine their downfall is a fascinating mix of human loyalty, commitment, and betrayal. Aronofsky's visual attentiveness doesn't detract a bit from the finely-wrought performances on display, and rather complements the characters and heightens our own cinematic high. Its overriding theme aside, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is an artistic triumph and a masterpiece of cinema that is better experienced than described."

","I'm going to skip the synopsis and get straight to the review - if you need the detailed background info, look at the other comments or go to the ""Requiem"" IMDb home page.<br/><br/>This movie is hands down amazing.<br/><br/>If you're shallow, you will watch and leave in disgust an hour or so into the movie.<br/><br/>If you have the capacity for engrossing, deep, personal, disturbing dramas, you will be glued to your seat in amazement.<br/><br/>This movie is both physically and emotionally beautiful - the directing and camera-work is unbelievably executed. The great use of editing and filming styles takes a good drug drama to an awe-inspiring one. If you're a fan of artful photography and directing your jaw will be ON THE FLOOR for the whole movie. The sheer style this movie shows is incredible, from the first moment the Summer Overture kicks in to the very last, frantic, depressing second in which the film ends.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch. These might just be the roles of a lifetime for most of the actors/actresses in Requiem. It's hard to take your eyes off of Ellen Burstyn in the scenes she is in - her emotion and sincerity is great. It gets better as she falls deeper into drug addiction - her acting as a upper-junkie is mind blowing.<br/><br/>Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly all do an amazing job in the roles that they play - the desperation and sickness comes out brilliantly for all of these actors. One of the best scenes, without a doubt, is when Harry (Jared Leto) confronts Sara (Burstyn) about her addiction to ""uppers"" when he realizes she's grinding her teeth - you can clearly see that Harry is distraught. It's perfect acting on both parts - many props to Jared and Ellen for that.<br/><br/>The climax is probably the best part of the movie. That is, of course, if you can handle it.<br/><br/>It is the most harrowing climax to a movie I have ever seen. That's actually an understatement.<br/><br/>It's disturbing, controversial, depressing, disgusting, revolting, and most of all just FRANTIC - and that's what makes it so good.<br/><br/>The whole thing will make your heart and mind want to burst until the last second when everything crescendos into a mass of hopelessness, and the end credits roll.<br/><br/>It's a moment you'll never forget."

","This movie goes there. It reaches into your mouth, yanks out your heart and stomps on it with stilleto heels.<br/><br/>Nothing can match the way this movie demonstrates the wrath of addiction. This addiction which lies completely in the characters own minds; eating them away. The characters are just ordinary helpless people with the junkie factor is thrown in there, making them unlovable. Regardless, you find yourself falling in love and becoming completely attached to them. This is probably due to the fact of the brilliant acting done, especially by Ellen Burstyn. She really is Sara Goldfarb in this movie. Also Jennifer Connelly is beautiful in that dirty junky way and plays her part perfectly. Jared Leto does a fine job, and not to mention is quite the looker in this movie. Also, I was surprised with how well Marlon Wayans did in such a serious role.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything because this movie is best when you don't know what the f*ck is going to be thrown at you (which is how I viewed it; it was just a blockbuster movie picked at random, I didn't even read what it was about!) so be ready for the trip of you lifetime."

","My friends and I joke that this movie should take the place of the Dare program, but with the intense visuals, engaging story and characters, and the last 15 minutes, I can't help but to wonder.<br/><br/>The story revolves around four individuals (Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connoly, and Ellyn Burnstyn) who become victims of their own addictions (Heroin, Cocaine, and Diet Pills), and thus begins the downward spiral. I'm not going to go into great detail about the spiral, because, quite frankly, it's not something I want to think about.<br/><br/>The combination of great acting with superb directing is what places this film among some of the best ever committed to celluloid. What particularly surprised me was Marlon Wayans; having only seen him in dumb comedies (Scary Movie 1 & 2, Don't be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the 'Hood), he actually proves his acting chops in this role. This isn't to diminish the other actors, though. After all, ""Requiem"" is an ensemble effort.<br/><br/>Arronofsky really takes care in building up the characters before breaking them down, and by the end, you're left with nothing but a requiem.<br/><br/>On a side note: I've sat through slasher flicks, I've seen my share of ghost stories and psychological thrillers, but this is the only movie to date that has ever given me nightmares. If that doesn't say anything about a movie, I don't know what does."

","The movie is about drugs and how they ruin your dreams, not like that commercial where the kid has a little weed and blows off his head, the hard stuff that is actually addicting. Throughout the movie people get protrade in a very real light. This is no stupid would never happen movie, it is a happens millions of times a day type of movie.<br/><br/>It does get a little too real at times and made me wish that this was some horrible piece of fiction but it is far too real. I wish that the world didn't have the dark little corners like this that aren't really corners, their more like most of the room making the lighted bits seem very bright.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely my favorite, and I don't like picking favorites or even making a top list its more like there is ""Requiem For A Dream"" then there is everything else. Although you do have to have a strong stomach for it. Even the music is really good, I own the CD but haven't found a good copy of the movie to buy, nobody around stocks the full version. I also believe that everybody, with a strong stomach and who would care, should watch this.<br/><br/>Oh and don't take my word for it, go out and rent it.

"PhilipChandler","10","0","1","16 July 2005"," More than drugs here......
","So many people who have reviewed this movie have premised their review on the assumption that this movie is simply about drug addiction and the depths to which it will drive seemingly decent people. Am I the only person who sees more than a depiction of drug addiction here? Am I the only person who sees this movie as a complex montage, portraying the incredible sadness being old and lonely, and having no real friends? Am I the only person who sees this movie as being about love, both experienced and lost, because the characters who were in love with each other danced to the tune of the commercial world in which we all live; a world in which advertisements for juice and diets without red meat are sold as the panacea that will lead to ultimate happiness? Am I the only person who sees this movie as being about the loss of innocence, as a person who so badly wanted to start her own dress-design business, like the other characters, does not understand that dreams cannot be realized without hard work? Am I the only person who sees this movie as being about the commercialism of all that we hold dear? What, after all, is the first drug to which the audience is introduced -- a drug that the average moviegoer consumes over a period of several hours every day? We see an old woman addicted to TV -- the irony, of course, is that she pays for this drug almost every day by repurchasing her TV set from a pawnbroker in order to feed her own habit, even as her son steals the TV set every day in order to sell it to the pawnbroker to feed his habit. Is this not ironic? Does this not set the tone for everything that follows? Four characters live on the incoming tide of summer, happy in the belief that they will soon realize their dreams: Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn, who was robbed, criminally, of an Oscar), old and lonely, receives a telephone call informing her that she will appear on her favorite TV show, from which she simply cannot tear herself away. Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), her son, does all that a penitent son can think of doing for his mother -- which is to buy her a new TV set. An addiction is fed right there, **by Harry*, even as Harry realizes, with true horror, that his mother is on amphetamines prescribed by a script doctor to make her lose weight. Sara is obsessed with fitting into her red dress, and dreams at night of cupcakes and doughnuts before the uppers kick in. Another addiction is stated, yet not emphasized, in this sequence. Am I the only person to see how Sara is already addicted to two drugs -- TV and food -- as she struggles with loneliness and depression? During summer, all appears to be going well for the four central characters. But like all false dreams, these four characters (Sara, Harry, Jennifer, and Marlon) are fooling themselves. Harry and Marlon dream of becoming drug distributors so that they can retire, and Harry euphemistically describes himself as a ""distributor"" to his mother, even as he realizes, with true horror, that she is on speed. Jennifer (Marion Silver) has genuine talent as a designer, yet falls into the trap of experimenting with both cocaine and heroin -- which, perversely, intensifies the love she feels for Harry. But once again, commercialism is the target here -- quite literally, they find a quick fix to shore up their relationship. The hard work that is necessary to sustain a relationship is never performed.<br/><br/>Then fall is upon them. Harry has increasing difficulty finding the drug, and before she even realizes exactly what she is doing, Jennifer sells her body to her therapist. The viewer can actually feel the disgust and shuddering revulsion that Jennifer feels as she leaves in the elevator and then hurries down the sidewalk -- it is like oil that she cannot wipe from her skin.<br/><br/>Then winter comes. From this point, all is downhill. Sara discovers that the initial feelings of euphoria induced by the drugs have given way to a deadening of emotion -- and she doubles the dose. Harry and his friend and fellow ""distributor"" (now full-time user) Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are arrested and thrown into prison. Harry loses an arm due to gangrene from repeatedly shooting up into the same crater. Jennifer is trapped in a stomach-turning lesbian orgy as she sinks lower and lower in her quest for drugs. Harry knows that Jennifer cannot and will not visit him in the hospital, since she is so strung out that she cannot even think about Harry.<br/><br/>Sara becomes totally unhinged, and goes mad. She is portrayed as a horrifying hag staggering down the street and catching a subway to the TV station office, wondering what has happened to her TV appearance. She is hospitalized, in in a horrifying series of searing images, we see her being force-fed with a tube down her throat, being subjected to shock treatment, and becoming unrecognizable to two of her friends, who leave the hospital to cry in each other's arms.<br/><br/>There is so much more to this movie than a message about drugs. What of commercialism -- the belief that our lives can be made better simply by latching onto the latest fad diet, or by buying the latest self-help book? What of TV itself, which we watch every day, and which has replaced living for so many people? What of mindless personality shows? What of living without actually **living**? The final 20 minutes of this movie are so shocking and brutal that I would not recommend that any person who is faint of heart watch this movie. One can actually sympathize with the drug addicts -- they become real people, and the viewer feels their suffering and understands their suffering."

","A shocking, brutal, grim and harrowing account of the horrors of drug addiction, told through the parallel stories of four main characters: Sarah, A lonely, widowed, overweight and TV obsessed mother, ruing her present, takes to overdosing on prescription weight loss pills to fit in her old red dress she wants to wear when she appears on her favourite television show, she expects to be on. Her son, Harry and his girlfriend, Marion, along with their friend Tyrone get involved in underground narcotic dealings to make money and start their own business, take to use of cocaine themselves. While, Marion prostitutes her body and sells her soul to get Harry the money he needs to start up so she can ultimately settle down with him and live a dignified life. Each take to drugs as a means to fulfilling their dreams, but their dreams quickly turn into nightmares as their addictions spiral out of control and destroy them in the most electrifying climax ever seen on celluloid.<br/><br/>The performances are brilliant from all of the actors, with a special mention to Ellen Burstyn's(Sarah) absolutely phenomenal performance, her story is the most riveting. The cinematography is stunning and the background score is brilliant. The real star of the show is the director, Darren Aronofsky, who gives this movie a very unique, gritty, surreal and kinetic style. He's up there with Tarantino in terms of editing.<br/><br/>I do have a minor criticism, mainly being that some of the shot were a little too repetitive and the first half was not very engrossing for me. It is the climax that really takes this movie to another level. It left me completely breathless and on the edge of my seat and I could feel surges of energy travelling up my body. Yes, it was that powerful! I strongly recommend this film, particularly to film students, and especially to those who do drugs themselves. The realism of the horrific fates that befall the characters in this movie, might get you to think of the real and life-harming possibilities of drug abuse."

How they all start out so happy and ending falling apart with sadness and out of control behaviors, was worth watching and very powerful. I thought the performances were all good especially Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly.

The movie is disturbing and all the drugs and stuff can give you a headache sometimes. The cinematography was excellent and is one of the best.

Ultimately its comes through unscathed, powerful and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Hip-hop montages used during shots of drug taking/ t.v. watching (Sara's addiction) weave the two separate stories together as the four characters head towards their final demise. These and the various camera techniques used through the film really might have resulted in an ultra-stylized piece of work that was impossible to penetrate and appreciate the stories that were developing. However the balance is perfectly achieved and the camera work works to develop the characters, (the close-up of Marion leaving Big Tim's house and throwing up, as well as Sara stumbling down the street in a shot that would almost be more suited to a music video come to mind) as opposed to rendering them secondary to the various techniques on show.<br/><br/>The first time I watched this film was in the kitchen of my university halls. Gasps could be heard as the film entered its film grueling final sequence. Silence reigned supreme when it was over. It truly is a powerful film and hasn't lost its affect on me on subsequent further viewing. Ultimately though IT IS NOT A DRUG MOVIE. Its focus is on the characters and the battles they are having with their addictions ... whether that be dope, prescription drugs, television or the longing to be young, popular and happy and again.<br/><br/>The performances in the film are all that could asked for. Ellen Burstyn is a t.v. addict widow who gets a call telling her she will be appearing on her favourite show. Burstyn portrays Sara's descent to ultimate insanity, via prescription slimming drugs, brilliantly. Although much has been made about it, it has to be said that it is refreshing to see an older woman in a lead role and Burstyn handles the responsibility admirably; her performance the stand out in the film. Jared Leto plays Sara's hapless but well-meaning son Harry. The desperation of his situation comes through perfectly in his performance as he struggles to support his best friend Tyrone (Wayans) and his girlfriend Marion (Connelly); although I am not quite sure how he actually handles the scenes where he starts crying. Connelly has the same desperate cloud hanging over her character, as the bright but ultimately doomed drug addict designer. Wayans pulls out a great display and shows he can handle 'serious' film making as well as his Wayan's bro comedies.<br/><br/>Aronofosky has a create a truly mind blowing (really hate to use that phrase too!!) piece of art here; the joy of this film is the story that shines through the stylized exterior."

","This is an amazingly life like film that shows the harsh reality of what drugs can lead to. I am in no way against people using drugs, you will do what you please in order to make your life good for you, as seen in the film. However, after watching this I know there are a few things I would never get myself in to. It deals with the real issues of drug use, not people wanting to get high and have an amazing experience, but the pains of addiction and how far some people go to feed theirs. However, through it all underlying lessons can been seen rather than just drugs. Even if it does show the sad reality of drugs, it's a must see and very easily a movie people can relate to. I strongly suggest watching it no matter what your feelings toward drug use is. Also if you like this movie, I recommend watching Spun, as well as the director's first film Pi."

","When i saw this movie for the first time, i saw it with a handful of other people. When it was over, no one said a word. We all walked downstairs and lit cigarettes, and didn't talk for a good 15 minutes. This movie is flawless. Every character experiences a very distinct arch in this film, the cinematography is brilliant, and the film all by itself is extremely moving. I really must add that Ellen Burstyn was robbed of an academy award the year she was nominated for this movie. My 57 year old mother has used her monologue from this movie for several auditions and has gotten a part in almost everything she has auditioned for with it. I recommend this movie to everyone despite that it is extremely lewd to the average moviegoer, because it's content is so real that i don't believe that anyone out there cant relate to it in some way or another"
"bastard12345","10","0","1","17 June 2005"," A movie about the pleasure, struggles, and consequences one will face when becoming an addict.
","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon wayans and Ellen Burstyn are excellent and believable and make this movie very realistic. This story shows the pleasure, the fun and the consequence of taking hard drugs. It shows how addicts/ junkies will feel like when taking the drugs, how they will feel when they are sober, and the disgusting and humiliating things they will do to get more drugs. The plot is about Harry, (Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Connelly) and his friend Tyrone's (wayans) Life as they live it day by day taking hit after hit. While Harry's mother Sara (Burstyn) tries to overcome her addiction to diet pills. There are a lot of disturbing scenes in this movie so I don't recommend this movie to young viewers. The scenes include a lot of drug use, nudity, hardcore sex scenes, some violence, and coarse language. As much as this movie is inappropriate for anyone under 18 it is the truth of what these addicts/ Junkies face every day and can be very educational. Hope this helps"

","This is the only movie that has left me absolutely speechless... Jared Leto was appealing and extremely credible as the son who was involved in drugs himself and yet was appalled at the fact that doctors had prescribed similar for his mother. Poor little Marion, with her rich parents, was so incredibly poor as far as the life that had taken over her. And Ellen Burstyn - what more can I say - sensational as always! Jesus! If my mum ever had to deal with what she did I'd go crazy myself. Sure there were a couple of times where things weren't portrayed 100% accurately, but on the whole it was brilliant. The graphics, the acting, the whole sentiment were amazing!

","Let me put it like this: So far, this is the best film I have ever seen. You get sucked into this film and afterwards, if using drugs ever crossed your mind, you will never ever even dare to think about that again.<br/><br/>I do not think there is a better way to picture the dangers of drugs. I am not going into the details of the storyline, yet I do want to point out that drug abuse is not the only thing this film is warning about. Anybody care for some chocolate? No thanks, I'm on a diet.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty decent and up to very good. Ellen Burstyn does an excellent job, for which she rightfully received an Oscar nomination.

","I am definitely an Aronofsky aficionado and remember the wait for Pi when I saw some stills and heard the soundtrack to it in mid 1998. Requiem for me is a modern classic, a horror a sci fi. His use of editing, sound, music, is all right on the money. Watching the descent of all the characters into their own personal hells was one of the most disturbing filmic experiences I have even seen. I recently bought the DVD of requiem and have seen it regularly over the last six months and even now I find it as disturbing as I did the last time even thought I am familiar with most dialogue and I know the film almost shot for shot. It show us how much most people are addicted to any number of things, be it TV or heroin."

","Basically, this movie is absolutely one of the best I have ever seen. I watched it for the first time, and I was completely blown away. Everyone should see this movie. This made every curiosity about drugs that I had disappear. Sarah was my favorite character, and you get so caught up with her, and wonder why she is doing harm to herself. You wouldn't believe some of the things you see happen in this movie. And the craziest part is...all of what is depicted in the film, are all possibilities of reality. Everything shown in the movie could very well happen to real people in the real world. This movie scared me into not ever wanting to try any type of drug, for the fear of what could happen to me; also for the fear of becoming addicted to something that I don't need in my body. Everyone go to the video store and rent this movie."
"itamarscomix","8","0","1","24 May 2005"," Breathtaking
","Darren Aronofsky, it seems to me, is on his way to be one of the best, most influential directors of the 21st century. His work on Requiem For A Dream, like on Pi, is absolutely stunning, with brilliant use of experimental photography and editing techniques, short, thematically repeating shots (also used in Pi) and the original split-screen technique. The movie is truly breathtaking, and I mean that most literally - I was starting to run out of oxygen after the first thirty minutes. And I only saw it on VCR. I can only imagine what this must be like in a huge, dark theater. The harshness of the scenes and the fast, video-clip pace of the movie make it a very difficult, but very rewarding, experience.<br/><br/>The seemingly complicated plot covers for a very simple idea. The story (This time adapted from a novel, the story for Pi was written by Aronofsky himself and was much more complicated and original) revolves around four main characters, and tells their four individual tales, with the common elements of addiction, illusion and their consequences. This idea, though, is materialized wonderfully, and makes for a very, very powerful movie. All four characters - Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his mother, Sarah (Ellen Burstyn), his girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his friend and drug-dealing partner Tyron (Marlon Wayans), are remarkably well-developed, and each one is a full, real human being. Praise should go to Aronofsky but also to all four wonderful actors, especially Burstyn who did a really remarkable job as the TV junkie Jewish mother.<br/><br/>The movie is shocking, difficult, painful. You'll feel like your brain is being torn out and cut into little bits. But it's worth every minute. Do NOT rent this out for good light entertainment, but watch it, and eagerly wonder what Darren Aronofsky has in store for us next. I know I am."
"sonikyouth","10","0","1","21 May 2005"," powerful, beautiful expressionist film. completely relative film-making.
","as far as film-making and acting, this is the most powerful, well done movie I've seen. I'm an indie-film enthusiast and have seen many(not bragging) and this was certainly top 5 material, as well as pi, Darren aronofskys first feature-film. when you look at what makes great film-making, you see how what they did relates to the story, and why each shot/edit was chosen to be done the way it was, and i can say that Darren aronofsky got it right. that is why you feel sick after watching the movie, because it was told through the music, through the shots, through the montages and through the acting.nothing was missing and nothing fell short. to relate this to art, and it is one, it is very expressionist. the way the movie is done is a little over the top, but it is believable and it shows emotions. the story, however wasn't anything new or entirely interesting. however the storytelling(film-making, editing etc) makes up for it. it basically is not a drug movie, it is about addiction and what it can lead to. what makes this movie so good is that i could tell you right now a brief summary of what happens and you'd say ""ok"" sounds alright, I've probably seen this movie 10 times over, however after seeing this movie you are physically sick. unless you don't care about what is happening or cant follow this movie, i would find it hard to believe this movie didn't make somebody feel disgusted in the least bit."
"donimo","10","0","1","21 May 2005"," Possibly one of the best performances in cinematic history.
","Even though I agree with ""Danfish"" that Ellen Burstyn was criminally robbed of the Oscar for this film, I must point out that it was actually Julia Roberts who stole it (Erin Brokovich), not Marcia Gay Harden. Other than this one small misstep, I emphatically agree with every word ""Danfish"" said, all the way down to the amazing scene with Sara Goldfarb talking about how old and lonely she is. Probably one of the most stunning and true moments in cinematic history is this conversation with her son Harry. Every single scene where Ellen Burstyn appears is magic, including the one where she has just completely lost her mind and is deliriously wandering the streets and subway. This is probably my favorite film despite, or maybe because of, all its stark beauty. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who can handle it."

","Has anyone thought that this film had kind of a similarity to The Exorcist-(besides knowing that Ellen Burstyn stars in both disturbing films)They both have a horrifying experience to go through and the extreme disturbing images. Which is better? Exorcist is the ultimate cult classic (along with other titles). Requiem is a flat out masterpiece. I've noticed a few things that had a similarity to both films EXAMPLE: The dresser in Exorcist and the Refrigerator in Requiem (they both chase her). But that's just what I thought does anyone agree with me? Also In The Exorcist when the priests are exorcising Regan screaming ""the power of Christ compels you"" and there's like a 2 second shot where Regan's leg gets cut. In Requiem at the scary ending, Marion is going to that sex party and she's walking down the aisle then the camera does a close up. 2 second shot of a paper that says ""work"" on it and the pen marks the box and then another scary blue image shows up (my favorite part)"
"nomdesurf","9","0","1","4 May 2005"," Not to get too esoteric but...
","I was explaining this movie to someone and realized that in summarizing it I didn't initially mention drugs at all. It went something like this: ""It's about four sad, struggling people who are all on the verge of a great moment in their lives. If they can pull it off, everything will work out for them, each one will lift themselves out of their situation."" (Then, of course, came the explanation of how they each struggle with their addiction.) It occurred to me that this is what made the movie so good -- ultimately, it's about the more universal struggle we deal with between our dreams and self-destructive behaviors that prevent us from attaining them. Every one of the characters at one point or another clearly shows that they know exactly how pathetic their life is, what it will take to overcome it, and what will undo them. That's the agony of this. And, thankfully, the one redemption that helps us not totally bum out for a week."

"captain_bungle","9","0","1","14 April 2005"," Beautifully disturbing
","Darren Aronofsky's follow up to his acclaimed cult hit Pi has often been labelled as a 'drug' movie similar to that of Trainspotting. But Aronofsky would prefer you to call it a film about addiction, as everyone within the film relies on their own type of 'drug', be it television or heroin. The narrative is centred around four characters; Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Marion Silver (Jennifer Connely) and Tyrone C Love (Marlon Wayans). These characters are all dreamers, they all have a certain place and a state of mind where they'd like to be. Requiem tells of their delusional journey towards obtaining these dreams as their lives fall apart before our eyes, reaching physical and emotional lows that are truly harrowing to watch.<br/><br/>The film takes place at Coney Island, Brooklyn, amongst its abandoned beaches and run-down estates that serve as a perfect backdrop for Requiem's harsh reality, yet also its unflinching surrealism. The characters make their way through this place as it appears to decay a little every time they do, emphasising their mental and physical states with a kind of subtlety that suggests a true genius at play here. In fact, there are so many small changes to the locations, the lighting, the set designs and character's appearances that it is worth re-watching Requiem just to spot them. However, I digress, as Requiem for a Dream's true brilliance comes from the excellent performances on display, most notably from Ellen Burstyn as Jared Leto's mother, Sara Goldfarb. Sara is a widow, who spends her time alone watching TV or meeting up with her knit group. But it is the TV, not her friends that is her true companion, as she sits transfixed, watching Tappy Tibbons (an energetic Christopher McDonald) with an utmost urgency. Sara's downfall begins when she receives a letter inviting her to be on television. Of course she is delighted, it is a dream come true for her, but if she's going to be on TV she has to wear her special red dress that she wore to her son's graduation. Trouble is, Sara no longer fits in her red dress and needs to lose weight. Quickly. Sara goes to the doctors and is prescribed pills to help her lose the pounds, and it is only a matter of time before she does. She takes the pills, watches the TV and dreams of being on it in her red dress, but she is taking speed to help her lose weight and she begins to lose her mindÂ… Likewise, Harry, Marion and Tyrone have their own drugs; heroin and love. Unfortunately, the draw of heroin is stronger than the latter and they too descend a downward spiral into addiction and desperation. The parallels between Harry's and his mother's addictions are clearly drawn with the use of snappy editing. Sara picks up the remote, switches the TV on, eats a rice cake, takes her pills; all in a quick succession of beats. The use of heroin is shown in exactly the same way, the flame, the needle, a dilating eyeball etc, all edited with the same punch to exemplify that, although addicted to different things, Harry and his mother are both heading down the same path.<br/><br/>There really is no way out for these characters. There is no happy ending in sight for them, and Aronofsky rightly doesn't give them one. It is hard to categorise Requiem for a Dream, and I have no intention of trying to do so, but this is a film that everyone should see. It is a powerful, unflinching depiction of four people who we really do care about destroying themselves. We care about these people because they are our friends, our girlfriends and our mothers. They are normal people who find themselves in situations that are far too brutal for anyone not to feel for them. Harry and Marion's love is sincere and warm, not melodramatic or schmaltzy Hollywood love, and to see them break apart from each other is truly saddening as you just know that Aronofsky isn't going to give them a chance meeting at rehab to get back together.<br/><br/>Visually, Requiem for a Dream pulls all the stops. The use of split-screen is amazing, especially in an intimate scene between Leto and Connely, as they lay side by side touching each other, yet appear apart. There is time-lapse photography, super-wide fish-eye lenses, brave camera movements and expressionistic lighting, but never does it feel that Aronofsky is using these techniques just to 'show off'. There is meaning behind every stylistic flourish that graces the screen, adding a greater depth to the proceedings and involving the audience in a way that makes for uneasy, yet entertaining, viewing.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is a true work of art. It is ugly, brutal, beautiful and profound without being pretentious. Aronofsky uses effective visual tricks and styles to emphasise emotions and places without resorting to a shallow style-over-substance MTV look, and DoP Matthew Libatique's lighting and camera-work is at once realistic and surreal, and constantly amazing. Between them, they create a world that pulls you in, instantly engaging you with the characters and their lives. Then it pulls you under, showing people we care about going through some of the most saddening, brutal moments of their lives until, by the end, you'll be gasping for breath.<br/><br/>I really cannot recommend Requiem for a Dream enough. It is truly one of the most powerful, astounding films you will ever see, and demands repeated viewing. However, if you like your movies warm and fluffy with a feel-good, happy ending then it may not be the film for you."

Harold (Jared Leto). His lonely mother Sara(Ellyn Burstyn), his beautiful girlfriend Marion(Jennifer Connealy)and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). It takes place over three seasons and seamlessly shows the downfall of these characters. Starting off with summer where their dreams are all being realised and fulfilled, moving to fall where everything slowly starts going downhill and then winter, the slow self destruction of all the characters we've loved throughout. <br/><br/>The acting is sensational particularly from Elly Burstyn as the lonely widow who is heralding 'being on television' as her dream and her pathway to recognition. Leto is also mind-blowing. and so is Jennifer Connealy. Marlon Wayans is shockingly good in a serious role, carrying a smile for the first half of the movie but then a face of confusion and pessimism as the movie goes on.<br/><br/>The shame is that not that many people will see this film.

","In the corner of the cozy living room, a seventeen-year-old boy buries his face in his jacket rather than look at the screen. ""Oh my God,"" a sixteen-year-old girl whimpers. Another stares at the screen, paralyzed, unable even to blink. And a fifteen-year-old girl weeps openly, but only some of it is the horror she feels right now. She's just had an epiphany. ""I want to be a filmmaker,"" she thinks.<br/><br/>This is what happened when a group of friends and I watched Darren Aronofsky's film ""Requiem for a Dream"" - fifteen minutes after the film had ended.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of movies, ranging from incredible to despicable. I've laughed, I've cried, and I've raised my eyebrows. I've come very close to tossing my cookies, mostly at blood-and-guts fests like ""The Passion of the Christ."" This was the first time I ever came out of a movie just wishing I was dead, and, at the same time, thanking my lucky stars that I was alive. There has never been and I don't think there ever will be a movie as shocking, terrifying, and inspiring as this one.<br/><br/>Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a lonely old widow who desperately wants and needs something or someone to care about. Her son, Harry (Jared Leto) is a lost, confused kid - a bit of a sleazebag, but he seems to have a good heart. His girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connolly) is a bright, ambitious young woman who is experiencing real love for the first time. And their best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans - speaking of shocks) is a street-wise tough guy who misses his mother and wants to be loved. In spite of this, they are all happy - or rather, they think they are. Sara's just gotten a call informing her that she's going to be on television, and in a desperate effort to lose weight for the event she begins taking powerful prescription pills. And she's not lying to you - this is the best she has felt in years. Harry, Marion, and Tyrone are running a successful heroin-and-cocaine traffic, and in between all of the sex, shoots, and buying Harry's mom a new TV set, life is pretty darn good. You and I could live happily in a world like that if we were made to.<br/><br/>Except that, of course, it can't stay like that. The chills begin to travel with greater and greater frequency down the spine as the lives of each of these four individuals are shattered. Each of them is reduced to a mindless void of addiction. That's what this film is about - addiction. Addiction does terrible, terrible things to good people, and Darren Aronofsky and Hubert Selby Jr. know it.<br/><br/>The film is a must-see for any actor. The performances of Leto, Connolly, and (in a pleasant surprise) Wayans dovetail perfectly with each other, and viewers will be drawn to the humanity and honesty that each of them throws into their character. But - it's already been sung, and it can't be said enough - Ellen Burstyn stole the show and has no plans to return it any time soon. The sight of Sara running wildly down the street, emaciated and babbling, will tear your heart from her chest. Combine that with her wrenching depictions of what it is like to be old and alone, and the dream sequences in which she is a lovable aging beauty queen, and you will be building your Ellen Burstyn shrine tomorrow.<br/><br/>One fellow whose performance is not given nearly the mention it deserves is Christopher McDonald, who plays Tappy Tibbons, America's favorite television personality. We've all seen Tappy. We can all name dozens of different Tappys. And McDonald's perfect mix of dazzling smiles, charisma, and an undercurrent of evil (""Juice by Tappy! Juice by Tappy!"") is more haunting than any supernatural thriller.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky is a brilliant director. There aren't words to describe the way this film was put together. He dealt with a low budget and over 2,000 cuts, and a brilliant novel/script by Hubert Selby Jr. to produce a truly original piece of film-making. Where was the Academy when this film came out? Possibly the most heartbreaking thing about the plot of this movie is that it's not quite as bleak as we feel like it should be. Yes, you heard me right. We expect that every character will be reduced to a lame creature devoid of hope and dreams. It might even be a comfort to us if they were. And yet, in the final sequence, we see a glimpse of what is left of Sara Goldfarb's dream. ""Requiem"" has its title for a reason - she knows that her dream of being on television with her beautiful little boy for the whole world to see is dead, and that's why tears leak from her eyes in the final sequence. They don't damage her glorious smile, but they leave a lasting impression on our hearts. After seeing this disturbing, intense, depressing, horrifying film, we want to ease our own pain, by telling her and the world that it's no good. But we can't bring ourselves to do it.<br/><br/>And of course, we have nothing to say."

","I have never really felt compelled to write a review on here before but after watching this i feel i must just to tell you how much of an essential film this is.<br/><br/>From the innocent beginning to the horrible climax ending, the film is an emotional roller-coaster throughout, so much so that i know of people who have found it impossible to watch this film more than once.<br/><br/>The film follows four people who's search for happiness eventually becomes their downfall, and we see their world fall apart around them.<br/><br/>You really aren't supposed to enjoy watching this film, but this does not make it a bad film by any means. The disturbingly accurate portrayal of drug addiction and breathtaking performances by Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans contribute greatly to what is an outstanding piece of art. It makes for uncomfortable viewing, but it truly is an essential film.<br/><br/>You have to see this film, it is truly unforgettable and if you're not left speechless at the end then you obviously have no heart at all.<br/><br/>Never have both the words 'beautiful' and 'shocking' fitted a film so well."

Don't know were to start, All actors hands up a super duper job, Director Darren Aronofsky i got some good news and some bad, Good news one of the best movies ever, Bad news are that Darren will probably never do better than this, Orson Welles curses cause he did it at first try, Quentin Tarantino proved you can survive after a good debut and <br/><br/>do even better and still stay alive. Parents do you really thing some documentary's the Government makes will keep your kids of drugs, this movie will. I recommend this movie to all gods creatures.

","This may have been the most inconsistent movie I have ever watched. The first 2/3rd of the film is really not that good. Not that much happens with the characters and the story develops very slowly. It seems the director is much too preoccupied with the esthetic's of the movie. It's as if an MTV music video director has gone off. The soundtrack and visuals are actually pretty annoying. They keep showing the same clips over and over. I almost stopped watching the movie.<br/><br/>I am glad I didn't. Because the last 1/3rd of the movie is amazing!!! It's like the director sobered up and decided to moved things forward. Maybe his heroin fix wore off. With that it feels a bit like a Scorsese crescendo a la Casino and Goodfellas when things start to happen dramatically and a frenetic pace. And you start to care about, and feel the pain of the characters. The soundtrack is haunting, as is the end. All the acting is terrific, with Jennifer Connelly the star. It feels like two different movies, and two different directors. I would rate the last third a 9, but overall no more than a 7, due to the first 2/3rd."

","This movie has an excellent depiction of how someone's addiction can ruin their life. However, there are certain scenes in the movie that people can not really understand, unless they have been strongly addicted to something in their life. Jennifer Connelly's character (Marion) at first glance starts to really upset me as the movie moves along. It took me a second glance to see what her character was really depicting: an addiction. Once understood, I really understood the movie in full. Each time I watch it, I get a new perspective, and understand more of the movie, taking different things in, and understanding more and more how it all comes together. Furthermore, this is a great movie to show individuals who have debated using illegal drugs, or struggle with the temptation. It will definitely give them a look into what can and will happen as a result, and why they really are illegal."

","Believe it or not, I watched this movie while I was in inpatient alcohol/drug treatment for my own addiction. The treatment center actually showed us this movie, there were a few sequences towards the beginning that somewhat triggered my previous affliction. But as the movie progressed I was able to understand what Darren Aronofsky was trying to present.<br/><br/>The way the actual scenes of ""using"" were shown was very life-like, it briefly displayed the initial high followed immediately by the ongoing sorrow...Which progressively got worse just as it is in the real world of chemical addiction. It is a very heartbreaking and depressing film, but for anybody who has been through similar situations as the four characters, I'm sure it will give them a sense of gratitude that we hit a higher bottom than they did...it did for me.<br/><br/>The camera-work and heightening of the emotions was extremely powerful. Even the sequences with the refrigerator and the continuing decline of Harry's abscessed arm were done with great raw emotion. I watched it the first time, in treatment, and had a few complaints, then I watched it again and understood in full what Aronofsky was trying to accomplish. All four actors were superior (particularly Marlon Wayans in a serious dramatic role), and the music was passionately haunting.<br/><br/>A great vision for anybody who has been through heroin (or other drug) addiction, is currently involved in it, or wants to understand more about it. <br/><br/>Letme repeat myself...Darren Aronfsky is a genius. (See his other classic ""Pi"". <br/><br/>10/10"

","All the hype that had surrounded this movie had made my hopes for this movie skyrocket. I honestly thought i was going to see one of the best movies ever made when i sat down to watch this. You know what? It was more then that. This is, in opinion, the best movie ever made. It is one of the few movies that actually made you feel something. It made me feel angry, shocked but most of all sad.<br/><br/>For those of you who have never heard of Requiem for a dream, this movie is about four people living in Brookly, New York, all of them struggling with different forms of addiction. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) and Marion Silver (Jennifer Connely). Even though Ellen Burstyn steels the show all of the actors should get massive credits. I was very surprised about one of the actors when i saw this movie, which was Marlon Wayans. I have always seen him as a crappy and worthless actor, doing Scary Movie esquire crap films, but when i saw this movie i was shocked. The dude can act! He was awesome as the happy, high spirited friends who slowly but steadily gets devoured by his addiction. Brilliant. I truly hope he decides to do more serious films because he is, in my opinion one of the most underrated actors ever.<br/><br/>As a final word i would like to put up a warning. This is NOT a movie that will make you happy. This is a sad and disturbing movie that will crawl under your skin and stay there for weeks. There are more then a few scenes that stay on your retina for weeks without letting go. But if you have the stomach for it, see Requiem for a dream, for it is, without any doubt, the best movie ever made."

The legendary Ellen Burstyn is just amazing as the woman who wants to lose weight for a TV program.Jared Leto is superb in this movie as he was in his TV debut My So-Called Life playing Jordan Catalano and other things.The Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind) is spectacular.Wayans is also brilliant.The movie is based on the late Hubert Selby Jr's novel and he's also seen in this movie as Laughing Guard.The way this movie is made is just amazing.The director really knew what he was doing.We'll be hearing from Mr Aronofsky.This movie should make people realize that drugs are no good.Sadly it's not going to happen.Requiem for a Dream is not a pretty movie.It's reality."

","this movie is not just an eye opening experience that gives anyone who has actually done drugs before a sort of sweet and sour perspective, but it is a huge deterrent to anyone who has not already tried them. the characters are as realistically played as possible, this is truly an outstanding and gutsy movie for any director to make, and i give mad props to Aronofsky. although this movie is somewhat depressing, you really get the sense that it is real and you really start to feel for the characters and you feel for there sense of desperateness. great performances all around, i give this movie a 10, just because is impacts anyone who watches it so much. Requiem for a Dream really reminds me of The House of Sand and Fog, strictly because everyone is always in constant turmoil that the characters are in. they never really seem to be quite happy, there are some points where they seem to be really happy, but for 75% of the movie they are angry for something, and they are desperate for someone or themselves. overall this movie can really hit home if you take it in for what it really is, and thats drugs hurt people, whether you're directly involved or not."

"travis_n_woodward","8","0","1","8 December 2004"," see it twice
","You know I was pretty overwhelmed the first time I saw this movie. The crushing 'reality' that whatever your dreams are, that reality is always so much less, the disconnect between family members, etc. Plus the intense physical imagery left a permanent impression in my mind.<br/><br/>But seeing it again just recently left me with a very different impression. A good example is, Why does she have to have electroshock therapy for an eating disorder? If you want to do tube feeding just put her to sleep, and put it in. She was already strapped down, so injecting her wouldn't be a problem, nor would keeping the tube in. Electroshock therapy was done only for visual impact, and on a second more clear viewing, seemed excessive. The film wouldn't have had any appeal, however sadistic, without the scene.<br/><br/>The whole end seen just seemed tutti frutti as well; over the top crushing nihilism. Maybe I can't understand the levels to which the human spirit can fall, but the routes that all the characters took don't seem to be the only way for the characters, and again the routes they chose seemed for the sole reason of visual impact (chopping off an arm, a two way dildo, EST) After I was able to get over the shock of these images, they seemed much less interesting.<br/><br/>Plus the nihilism is only there at the end. From what I could tell, these people had hit a bottom. It seemed like they all had the ability to have more positive futures. They could all move in positive directions. None of them were locked in permanantly bad situations.<br/><br/>Still a great movie, a DVD I would actually want to have in my collection, but upon a second, and in my mind more clear, viewing the dramatic impact was reduced. Great barrage of imagery, however excessive and nihilistic."

This is one (if not THE) of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. And believe me I am very picky. Never had been inhumanity towards human weaknesses displayed in such a brutal honest and shocking way. On the one hand shattered dreams that brought into your mind and soul almost physically. And on the other had the sadness for one of the most painful problems in the world : drugs and the way people deal with drug addicts.<br/><br/>First the acting: UNBELIEVABLE!!!<br/><br/>The characters, which are so complex and yet so simple, are brought by the actors absolutely brilliantly. Ellen Burstyn is shocking! Her portrait of a lonely aging lady is genius! So intolerably sad. Jared Leto is great showing a plain guy and goodness that can be betrayed and corrupted buy drugs from the inside and also from the world outside. <br/><br/>Jeniffer Connely as a proud uncompromising strong character who becomes the absolute opposite is amazing. The weakest performance is in my opinion by Marlon Wayans who doesn't seem to live his character in a convincing way. But then again, his character doesn't have to offer much.<br/><br/>The filming was very original and recreated visually, complex physical and emotional feelings in a way that I haven't yet seen on screen.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also brilliantly selected and with unordinary sound editing adds much to the movie. <br/><br/>To sum up: Highly recommended, but be advised - it is one of the most difficult pictures to cope with, mentally.<br/><br/>p.s I apologize for any spelling/grammar mistakes"

","David Aronofsky is one of the most experimental filmmakers of our time. With films like Pi, Aronofsky helps us to discover new things with film-making. Requiem for a dream is a genius film of drug use and erotic obsession. It's a brutally honest film that dives into the deepest dwellings of your consciousness and opens your mind to new and extraordinary things.<br/><br/>The feel of the film is a mixture of slow and fast. The random jump cuts can often be confusing and many of the cutting sequences, mostly those that are focusing on drug use, are very rapid and appear very often in the flow of the story.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is a true visionary in a time of followers. He is doing something different and exclusive that is truly his own image and his own style. Though not for everyone, Requiem for a Dream is definitely a great start to look at a truly great mind."

","This movie speaks out against excess and false dreams. It shows how people can be deluded into following something that they think is right just to find out that it is wrong. Or worse, they end up never knowing they were doing the wrong thing. <br/><br/>Allow me to explain. I was once involved in a multi-level type marketing company called ds-max. Tappy's continual use of the word juice brought back a lot of bad memories about this experience. Ds-max affiliated companies have their own jargon which uses the word ""juice"" a lot. They will say ""juice by (insert name)"" to express praise, or ""juice by that"" to express approval or just ""juice!"" to stir up excitement. People will get caught up in the fake materialistic hype of dsmax and then spin there wheels and then get nothing for it in the end - just like the characters in the movie.<br/><br/>The son wanted to make money and make his mom proud. The mother wanted to follow an unrealistic dream and make her son proud. But they really should have just acted responsibly and been realistic and done the best they could to help each other. But they were too a like. There were many scenes that showed how the deceased father was the one that was able to keep the family going and set these two error prone souls straight. With him gone, the mother and son failed to use discipline and wisdom to correct themselves. And that is how people are when they are caught up in multi-level marketing company that uses cult like techniques to keep their corp of recruits faithful. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone that has problems with any kind of addiction or multilevel marketing companies or unrealistic materialistic goals. It is a great tool to ground oneself."

Everything done within the movie complemented, the in-your-face camera angles and the bitter reality that goes along with the addictions faced with the four protagonists.<br/><br/>Jared Leto is perfect as the confused Harry along with his lonely mother, Sara Goldfarb played by Ellen Burstyn. As well as his girlfriend/best friend and fellow junkies Marion and Tyrone, played by Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans. This is tastefully done time-line of the unraveling of the lives of junkies, the audiences watches with their jaws dropped as the lives of the protagonists decay, flourish, and end up in new twists showing a shocking view that a ""clean world"" normally doesn't see.<br/><br/>So, kudos to Hubert Selby jr. for constructing this mindbend as well as a congratulations to Darren Aronofsky for masterfully directing it. I myself cannot bring myself to watch it very often, it is indeed disturbing, yet amazing. It is like something revolting that you know you shouldn't look at but you want to, you need to. Like watching Discovery Health during gastric bypass or open heart surgery while eating lunch, unable to resist the mystery and turn away. Truth does seem to be better than fiction.<br/><br/>Overall Requiem for a Dream is a stunning and utterly creepily amazing film...However, I do not recommend those of you who are afraid of things ""outside the box"", who are close-minded, or those of you who immediately dismiss things that aren't ""normal""...Land Before Time (1-10,000)addicts and A Cinderella Story fans, this means you.<br/><br/>This movie needs to be watched more than once to fully appreciate.

The music, in combination with the characters and atmosphere of the film is incredible. To watch the entire film is an emotionally challenging experience. To watch only 10 minutes of the film would probably draw the viewer in, however, you need to follow the four characters through summer, fall and winter for the ending to truly hit you. It is a beautifully tragic film, and not one I would recommend for the faint hearted. I think that Aronofsky's contemporary style of directing is utterly amazing, and although I love the traditional Hollywood style, I am always open to something new. I fear many right-wing film fans would oppose this film for its 'hip hop montage' styles of editing. Like I said at the beginning, I do believe this to be the most important film there is, and although it is a film, I found it whacked me so hard emotionally, I would call it more of an experience.

","Having instantly becoming one of my favorite films after my first viewing.Marlone Wayans character Ty is one of his best performances in a serious film seein he mostly is seen as a comedian.Jared Leto is excellent and changed my view on him as an actor.Jennifer Connlly also does a great job as her character Marion.but nothing compares to Ellyn Burystns performance as Letos character Harrys mother Sara.She did an excellent and most disturbing performance.In general i thought the film was very good even though from what i heard it was rather low budget. The life of an opiate dependent person is one of desperation,sorrow and pain causing them to go to extremely desperate means to get there fix.The addiction pushes them to do just about anything to get there drug stealing from loved ones pulling off or attempting robberies and just about anything else one can think of to get a quick couple bucks. What most people don't realize is that some of these people are extremely talented and intelligent people.The film in some ways shows this.It all starts off rather good with getting a little high just for fun then the dealin to make a few bucks and to try and reach there dreams.Then the pretty realistic downfall of the characters as every one knows is the truth of what happens to a strung out drug addict.Ty getting arrested spending more money than you can earn the increase in the habbit your life falling apart and the hopelessness and desperation that is destined to follow.Heroin sold them dreams and destroyed not only there dreams but there lives.All in all i did think and still do think it is a great film and recommend it to those who like a realistic drama of a movie in which you don't get a happily ever after ending.Also not for the faint of heart.but if you can handle it i can guarantee you won't soon forget it."

","Best movie I've ever seen. Honestly. Next to Fight Club, this movie is #1. I can't get over how the director makes you want to baul, yet scream at Sara for being naive, or Tell Marion that Harry won't make it home, and how it'll be their last time to see each other. I recently finished the book, which was fantastic. The movie has such emotion, I ended up crying for about a half hour when it was all done (I'm a chick :P ) This definitely has turned me away to drugs, it's such a scare factor, yet it's so real. This happens every day to people. If you haven't seen it yet, GO SEE IT!!! I own it, and I've seen it about 20 times. Jared Leto gives an awesome performance, but not as great as Ellen Burstyn. Marlon Waynes did a wonderful job a very serious movie, since he's usually in comedys."

It's an terrible story, a life that I wouldn't even wish my worst enemy. The camera angles and the close-ups makes you even more freaked out.<br/><br/>I can find only one reason to why this film didn't get an Oscar, and that's because the jury didn't have the guts to watch it.

","Some movies are all about the mood they produce inside the viewer. These are the sort of movies that worm and cocoon their way inside the viewer's mind and make the viewer replay over and over in their mind every single sequence of the movie. These movies just don't let go of your soul. That is when you know a movie is truly great. Requiem is one of those movies.<br/><br/>The atmosphere that requiem conveys is a dark and hopeless one. We all have our burdens in life. Things that drag us down come from both outside and within. It is especially a tragedy when the latter occurs and Requiem is the first movie I know to quite explicitly make that its chief topic and convey this tragedy in all its unrelenting pain and intensity.<br/><br/>Basically, there are 4 main characters in the movie. A troubled youngster, his mother, his girlfriend and his friend. In one way or the other, they all want better than they have, a touch of meaning and sunshine in their lives. In one way or the other, they all end up turning to drugs, truly believing they are on a course of making their life better. An in one way or the other terrible fates befall all of them.<br/><br/>The most tragic fate is without a doubt is that of the elderly mother. That performance was without a doubt worthy of 10 Oscars. An old lady, whose husband has long since been gone and who has nothing better to do in life than to watch infomercials and basically wait to die, receives one of those fake ""you're a winner"" types of phone calls, which instills a belief in her that they will call her to be on television. There she can wear the lovely red dress that swooned the heart of the now-deceased love of her life and she can tell everyone all about her wonderful only son (who incidentally keeps stealing the TV from her so he can pawn it for drug money; she keeps buying it back). However, she is quite old and naturally with more weight than she had when she was young. The dress doesn't fit. She survives only one day on a restrictive diet. The one solution she finds are diet pills, which are prescribed by a doctor who notably avoids any eye contact with her at the check-up. These ""diet pills"" turn out to be uppers. They slim her down quite all right, they also make her disoriented and prone to harrowing hallucinations. In the end she runs out of her apartment into the street completely broken and disoriented, barging into an office building and in tears demanding to know why has she not been called on television. She gets admitted to a hospital and undergoes shock therapy. As a patient the only thing she can do is dream of being on the show with her son.<br/><br/>The other three fare no better. Initially, they are making a fortune selling drugs and all have other dreams they are now just on the verge of achieving. They don't even have much of a habit at the start. However, when a gang shootout creates a shortage, their addiction becomes apparent. The relationship between the son and his girlfriend deteriorates as finding ""the bread"" takes priority. The girl eventually resorts to selling her body at drug parties, while the other two head south in search for drugs. They get arrested, while the son's hand gets badly infected from intravenous drug use and must be cut off. <br/><br/>There are many things to like about this movie. The slow and subtle darkening of the tone. In the beginning, when things still all seem good, the tones are light and the lighting is natural. Slowly, but steadily it is replaced by artificial lighting, sounds become more confusing. The storyline is moved along by short visuals such as the sequences of blood surging, pill swallowing and eyes dilating. Fixed cameras are ingeniously used giving us a glimpse into the inner mental states of our protagonists. Film speeds up to give us an impression of someone on ecstasy while the entire atmosphere slows down and changes after the high wears off. At times the movie is quite scary. The soundtrack is of course very memorable and the tune will no doubt linger in people's minds for a long time. Lastly, the crescendo of the last 15 minutes is not for the faint of heart. Each destiny is intertwined with others in a sequence of absolute terror and destitude. Shock therapy, humiliating prison work, ultimate sexual debasement and losing one's arm are all rapidly spliced in parallel. It is the lowest point in the lives of each of these characters, the natural consequence of the entire movie. <br/><br/>This is one of my all time favorite movies.<br/><br/>Rating 10/10<br/><br/>Scale:<br/><br/>Positive opinion of a movie: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OK<br/><br/>Neutral opinion of a movie: 6 Adequate, 5 Average, 4 Mediocre<br/><br/>Negative opinion of a movie: 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE"

","After having read so many positive reviews about this movie, especially James Berardinelli's, I decided to take on this. The feeling afterwards is somewhat mixed and weird. As others have pointed out, I don't like so many seemingly funny gimmicks like fast forward and flashy editing. They diluted the tragical atmosphere.<br/><br/>Moreover, the character personality development along with addiction is poorly done. We only saw drug effects physically upon all of them, or at most a little more emotionally on the relationship between Harry and Marion, no more. Harry and Sara are in need of that kind of medications, no matter how director tried to exhibit them in a horrible way; Tyrone is basically OK except without freedom; Only from Marion the degradation of self-respect is appropriately depicted (but one could've done it more impressively). Tragedy is about interactive outcomes of personalities and drug addiction is sure to change one's personality. However, this movie only made the tragedy of drug addiction, but not that of personalities twisted by drug addiction, which is the biggest failure from my view.<br/><br/>I agree the director is good at filming and editing, which can't offset the paleness of plot and characters. Music is the most entertaining element of this movie. All in all, this movie could've been darker, more impressive, more thought-provoking, standing out as a tragic masterpiece in the real sense of personality tragedy, all of which haven't bee accomplished by this one. Do you want to see how addiction changes your LIFE? see this one. Do you want to see how addiction changes your PERSONALITY? The answer is not in."

","I have to confess that I love this movie. I am biased. Period.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky shows a great deal of promise both in ""Pi"" and in this adaptation of Hubert Selby's novel ""Requiem for a Dream."" This dynamic duo have definitely created a remarkable film -- complete with an engaging story that is at once familiar to the point of being cliché . . . and far-fetched in the extremity of its conclusion -- and the cast (specifically Ellen Burstyn) truly bring the film to life. The musical score neatly wraps up the film in a way that few others have.<br/><br/>But let the viewer beware: THIS IS NOT A ""DRUG MOVIE"". Look at the title: to what ""Dream"" does it refer? Selby has compared his novel to Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby,"" and, while presumptuous, this remark lends a great deal of insight to anyone who wants to understand what's really going on in the story. The death of the American Dream -- the sham that is our great nation's optimism -- is the true focus of the novel and the film. That Selby and Aronofsky speak in terms of heroin, uppers, Coney Island sunbathers, and infomercials should not obscure the nature of the film as a critique of American society's beliefs and mannerisms.<br/><br/>Perhaps this misconception points to a flaw in the storytelling. At very least it shows the destructive effect marketing can have on a potentially outstanding film. I don't claim that the film is perfect, by any means. But to look at it as an anti-drug tirade or an overly trendy melodrama is to miss a key element of its beauty and significance."

This technique comes to full effect in one of the last sequences in which all the three(possibly four)stories become one in a mind blowing editing frenzy.In raging tempo several shots of the several characters are shown,almost like the end of a psychedelic song in the late 60's(for instance THE END by The Doors).

","Requiem for a Dream, is easily the most powerful movie I have ever seen. It is also one of my most favorite movies, possibly the top.<br/><br/>
A true story, this also happened to a couple friends of mine as well. I watch the movie, and when it ends, I just sit there in awe, the credits role by, and now there is a black screen, still I am in awe. It really hits you that hard that you, well some, that you are left in some sort of shock.<br/><br/>Back to the praising, of course the most powerful factor of this movie's greatness is the soundtrack of it. The music seems to depict the mood, the feeling, the setting, perfectly for each and every scene. Just the music alone can take you from happy to melancholy in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>
Now the acting, off the charts on everyone's part, a real good thing about this movie that you might not realize at first, is that the cast is extremely small compared to most movies, there are a few hectic scenes, but besides that it is a very focused and solitary cast. Which I found to be very productive, makes you sort of bond with the characters, helps you connect. As for anyone in specific, it was a new role for Marlon Wayans, really shows his acting ability.<br/><br/>This movie does something that some movies try to do, but can not fully produce, is that it takes you on an immense roller coaster ride. Starts you off feeling good, and then, it plummets you down, and when you think it can't get any worse, it does. And at the end of the movie you are begging for this coaster to take you up, it leaves you for dead. Pretty vivid image and you will not understand it until you have watched the movie.<br/><br/>

"basrutten","6","0","1","9 August 2004"," Style over substance
","Let me start by saying that I generally like ""feel-bad movies"" and I liked ""Pi"". This movie, however, completely failed to work for me.<br/><br/>I think the main problem is that this movie tries too hard. It tries too hard to carry a serious message across and it tries to hard to be really artistic. In my opinion, the director loses himself in one gimmick (splitscreen, fast forward, curious editing) after another, and that really hurts the story and character development. All the fancy editing was probably done to create a surreal atmosphere similar to a drug trip, and it partly works, but a bit more restraint would have been welcome. <br/><br/>The first hour of this movie is a fairly boring. Sure, it looks great, but it's really going nowhere. We get to meet the characters, but we don't really get to know them. The things they do are fairly predictable and mundane, and the pace is rather slow. After the first hour, terrible things start happening to the main characters, but I had a hard time caring about any of them since they're so poorly fleshed out, and the things that happen to them are so extreme that it's hard to take them seriously. Ellen Burstyn does a wonderful job, but the other actors' performances are really not that special.<br/><br/>I admire the people who made this movie for making such a direct and tragic movie about a heavy subject, but this eventually I think this movie goes way overboard. With more focus on substance (characters and story) instead of style (flashy visuals) and a more subtle approach this movie might have worked. As it is now, it's still an interesting movie to watch, but definitely not a good one."

","I was really stunned by this film. It forced me to consider my own behaviour and escalating (poly)drug use. As for realism, the scenes with Sara Goldfarb wandering swivel-eyed around her silent yet vividly-hued apartment in a creeping investigative paranoia will ring true to anyone who's used LSD or Psilocybin. I've never seen it portrayed so accurately on film.<br/><br/>The film explores - well, at least part of it does - the dividing line between 'drugs' and 'medicine', in that the characters feel a need for a kind of healing of their pain: Whether it be from heroin withdrawal, guilt over past actions or the loneliness of a solitary existence. The doctor prescribing the pills is also akin to a drug pusher (as distinct from 'dealer'): without even looking at the patient, he is essentially uncaring as to the consequences of his prescription.<br/><br/>The behaviour of Harry and Marion when they run out of heroin and have enough only for the night is also very accurate. Harry at first says they should wait and make it last, but Marion rationalizes her way around his logic in order to get a short-term fix. I've done this, although not with heroin, and seeing it on film makes for extremely uncomfortable viewing. <br/><br/>As an educational tool on the dangers of drugs this film is mixed. It's a good scare tactic for people who have never tried recreational drugs, but i'm not sure what if any difference this film would make to an addict who could/would rationalize, as Marion did, their way around its explicit message."

Wow!  The film goes exactly where you expect it to, no surprises.  As soon as I saw the infection in the main character's arm, it was obvious what would happen and it did.  It was OK for a single viewing, but nothing here to come back to a second time. 3 of 5 stars and that's generous."

It left a very deep emotional impact, something that I hadn't felt from any of the scores I've heard before.<br/><br/>Secondly, Ellen Burstyn gives an absolutely amazing performance as a lady obsessed with her weight, because she's going to appear on television, so she takes diet pills...much like speed.<br/><br/>All the characters mix together well and the actors are very believable in their individual roles. I was surprised to see Marlon Wayans do amazingly in a serious role for once. I, for one, think he should do more.<br/><br/>Watch out though. This movie can easily make you feel a bit depressed, so be prepared for it. It's about how these people's lives are absolutely shattered by their spiral into drug addiction...it starts with them leading nice lives and slowly spinning out of control. It's very hard to watch this, it's very realistic.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>The outcome that got to me most, was Ellen Burstyn's characters'. It felt like a punch in the stomach. Seeing her go through the shock treatment was painful and watching her friends crying together on a bench after seeing her made you feel empty.<br/><br/>END OF SPOILERS<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend this to everyone...I don't care your taste in movies, you should see it.

","This is one of those movies, you can´t watch without being unable to get it out of your mind for weeks, for months, maybe for years. It tells the story of mainly four different characters, who are in touch with drug consumption. Each one of them in a different way. It begins so innocent and harmless but the further the story is told, the more dramatically it gets. You see the manifold ways of getting addicted and the momentous fates, that comes with the addiction. The four main characters are in contact with each other, they love each other, but the drug consumption devides them more and more until total isolation. It´s a movie full of hope and power and with an end that is so sad and disturbing, that you won´t forget soon... Very well done!"

","Most people are enamored with ""Requiem for a Dream"" - they are taken aback by its gimmicky direction and its undeniably strong cast. This is a good movie - but not a great one. Burstyn, Leto, Connelly, and Wayans do give great performances, however.<br/><br/>Unforunately, there is little story here. The movie, when all is said and done, is jarringly predictable, and simply goes nowhere, much like the addicts and drug dealers it depicts. The implication, of course, is that substance abuse is a downward spiral, but it makes for a messy movie with little or no plot, and more importantly, little incentive to watch again.<br/><br/>Split-screens and time-lapse photography are fun little tricks, but they are ultimately overused by Aronofsky. They eventually take the viewer out of the movie's reality, or, at the very least, become a bit dull through repetition. Some of the plot turns in the film are eyebrow-raising - Connelly's character, for example, goes from a fairly normal person with a drug problem to a total junkie almost overnight.<br/><br/>""Requiem"" is a flawed movie, but a good film. I only wish the screenplay was as strong as the actors' performances.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I just finished watching Requiem For A Dream, and I'm typing this right now so I won't miss any details, although I'm sure I will. I feel completely drained, physically as well as emotional. This film has sucked the will to live straight from my body. Its a depressing story, more depressing than any other movie I have ever seen. However, it is also a very powerful film. Believe me, I will NEVER do drugs, take pills, etc. The main cast of four are all amazing. Some of the best acting I've ever seen happened in this movie. The big star here: Ellen Burstyn. She plays the mother of one of the characters, but its not your average mother figure. She delves into true insanity in this role. Not insanity, like the funny stuff in most movies, but actual, REAL insanity. This is a performance by which all others should be judged. I've never seen Jared Leto before, but he is also incredible in his role. Everyone in this movie spirals downwards over the scope of the film. There are no heroes here. The standard plot arcs are flipped upside down, and the only winner is each character's addiction. There are truly no winners. But enough about the plot. The film-making is also absolutely incredible. All the flash shots, rapid fire camera changes, sounds, etc. There is intense film-making vision and skill here. The best scenes are those in which drugs are being used, with rapid-fire camera views of the drugs, the person, the drugs entering the bloodstream, the person's eye dilating, etc. They are impossible to describe using mere words, so I will not attempt to. However, they are incredible. Everyone who is considering trying hard drugs, please watch this film first. What begins as an easygoing having fun and doing drugs movie shows what happens in real life with its massive downward spiral. This is the harsh reality that surrounds drug use. Finally there is a film merging really cool film-making with harsh reality. This is an absolute must-see for everyone. I will NEVER forget this film, and I will never forget the characters. I will never think about druggies the same, I will never think about prostitutes the same, I will never think about old widows the same. This movie has changed my entire perspective on life. Stop reading this s****y review and just watch the film."

","I've seen that film last night and it took me a whole while to sleep. First I thought it was just another drug addict junkie film but I was proved wrong very soon. To the end I was only staring at the screen, I couldn't actually believe how cruel this film was, even though the scenes aren't as brutal as in some action films but the whole atmosphere, it makes you feel so odd. I never had this feeling before when I watched a film. The acting was so brilliant, everything seemed so real. The quick changing of the scenes, those tragic destinies of the characters, it is horrible but genius. All 3 main characters were humiliated in a way, not only the gang banging, the doctors in the mental hospital where Sara Goldfrab was made her life unworthy and destroyed the last little bit of life in her and she couldn't do anything against it. Harry who was just another dirty junkie in the eyes of the doctor, got through the horrible pain until he finally got help when it was almost too late.<br/><br/>After the film I had to watch something shallow to get the pictures out of my head, I will probably never watch it again but I'm quite glad that I did."

","A movie in my native Coney Island--that was enough of a reason for me to see this movie. I expected a moody, dark, sullen film and the ""faded glory of Coney Island about 4 people searching for their vision of happiness"" as the back of the box said. What I got was a 360 doing tumblesaults---highly stylized, almost comically absurd at times, and ultimately, just another movie about junkies, but with a bizarre directing style that got on my nerves midway through.<br/><br/>Harry Goldfarb is a twenty something living with his mother Sara in a small Coney Island apartment who has to pawn his mothers TV for money. He and his friend Tyrone (played by Marlon Wayans quite well in a rare dramatic role) already drug addicts, decide to sell some for a huge sum of money. Harry's girlfriend Marion, also an addict, serves as Harry's inspiration and encouragement for a better life together. Harry's mother Sara, a very lonely widow, who watches infomercials all day, gets a telemarketing call about being chosen to be on TV as a contestant. That potential opportunity serves as Sara's purpose for getting up in the morning, trying on her favorite red dress repeatedly and checking the mailbox incessantly. She begins taking diet pills prescribed by her doctor in order to lose weight. Soon the film showcases all 4 people suffering from their addictions and spiraling out of control. <br/><br/>Here are my numerous problems with the film. Jared Leto seems to be speaking in a comical John Travolta-Welcome Back Cotter accent obviously to accentuate his Brooklyn twang, which was silly, because Jennifer Connelly, actually from Brooklyn in real life, speaks nothing like the buffoonish Leto, who is from Louisiana in real life. That bothered me as a Brooklynite, who also does not talk like Kotter. As for the plot, there's nothing wrong with tackling a common plot theme---there are many different ways a common plot could be directed, but the way Darren Aronofsky tackled it was ridiculous. At times the movie resembled the style of 2 directors I like--PT Anderson in Magnolia, and David O. Russell in Three Kings. The way the dialogue moved and the constant references to what was on TV looked a lot like Magnolia, and the closeups of the heroin entering the body from the needle looked like that bullet penetrating the soldier's body in Three Kings. I thought that was kind of interesting and definitely different when I saw it in Three Kings, but here's the difference. It was done once or twice. Darren does it over and over in this and at one point I wanted to turn it off. It was also done when Sara was eating, complete with slurping sounds to show her coffee being drunk. I hated that! Many shots were done in a similar fast forward motion which were equally annoying. <br/><br/>But for what it's worth, the acting was OK save for Leto at times. Ellen Burstyn is eerily good as an aging, ignorant and delusional sad sack, as were Connelly and Wayans, whom I could not get out of my head as the Coolio character in Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, which was hilarious. The last 15 minutes are gut wrenching, particularly Sara's unravelling, which got under my skin. But overall, too stylized and trying too hard. <br/><br/>And what about that fridge? Thought I was watching Amityville Horror for a second!<br/><br/>Shame on you, Darren Aronofsky from Brooklyn!"

On the other hand, her son, his girlfriend and friend start selling drugs to get money for their future plans. As the film advances their situation is getting more and more chaotic, out of hand, causing a powerful and terrible disaster. Relationships break up, all the characters are separated and see themselves in the depths of a depressing and desperate plight. Besides the strength of the plot, it must be remarked the way visual and sound effects are played, making the audience feel surprised and involved in the story. As soon as the film ends, you keep thinking it over, thoughtful and shocked. There is a moving silence. Not all the films can provoke that. Requiem for a dream is excellent."

","The definition of tragedy is that it is unavoidable. It does not come from a cruel twist of fate which means it could have been different. The thing about tragedy is that it springs from the very core of the character and that it is unavoidable - no matter what the circumstances or however much you like them and wish that it could have been different.<br/><br/>This film is a tragedy in this sense. The three protagonists (or four?) could not help but fall down. They were paralyzed by their own weaknesses. This is why it is not helpful to call it an anti drugs film. It is a study of people who could not help but fall . They were all too weak, too much in love, too frail to survive even though they were likable. I feel sympathy with these characters, despite their dubious attempts to fund their honest dream - the requiem itself is based on our sympathy for their weakness - their tragedy."

","Is there really so much being said in this movie? Speed and Heroin are pretty dangerous - duh. And if this is really a ""point"" or a ""message"" in requiem (I don't think it is), it is made in a moralistic and patronizing way, as if talking to a child - by exaggerating to the extreme the warning, that is, the outcome of heavy drug use. Not exaggerating as a story of ""what"" happens to the disgraced four, but the sadistic way in which each drop of pain is squeezed and turned into visual impact.<br/><br/>But I don't think there is an anti-drug message motivating the movie. Or any message. Or a theme. At no time did this movie appeal to my intellect or my emotions - all it touched was my stomach. In the end the movie made me feel kind of a sucker - I just watched something that wasnt made for an audience, but for the sake of the director. Seemed to me just an exercise - of two things: - One: how can I (the director) take a character's fate and make it the most shocking, gruesome and disgusting as I can? Visual shock has priority over content in ""requiem"" as if Aronofsky wanted to prove he had the technique to shock as much as cinema can do. - Two: Just how many editing and shooting tricks can one insert in a film? There isnt 30 seconds of footage without a split screen, ""that didnt happen"" scene, character ""floating"" or whatever. Very annoying, since in 90% of the cases there is absolutely no reason for the trick. They add nothing to the scene, nor are called for. The director is just having his fun. In ""Pi"", Aronofsky spends the whole movie with plot tricks and turns that amount to nothing. Here he does the same exercise in editing.

","Aronofsky delivers a murky dream world set in a pitiless city (New York) focusing on hopeless situations, missed connections and the trappings of being socially disconnected from loved ones. What hits hardest in this film is the simple point missed by so many people I've talked to about this movie. The film's main message wasn't in my opinion about destructive drug behavior (that seems more like a frame or device) so much as a sad tale about the inability to relate and communicate with loved ones. Turning away from what could provide support into a family-like world of drug friends and drug fiends Leto's character continues his travels in what is alluded to in the movie having already been a long history of drug abuse and problems.<br/><br/>
I got the feeling that all of the characters had no idea what they wanted to do with their lives so they passed the time with drugs and schemes of a better life, no matter how low-life the goals seemed. At first everything is going great, ah, but the best laid plans of mice and men shall go astray as they do. this makes the story pop to life. I've known people like this in life, maybe not to this dark degree but it was an interesting allegory about modern malaise and quick fix American life. Straight arrow characters in white suits hardly make for an interesting story so down a crooked path the film travels. The film is hard to take at times and is not for everyone. I do find it troubling the amount of fetishistic worship put into this film. I suppose that in itself is noir commentary on parts of our culture.<br/><br/>Stark cinematography, excellent actor performances and pitch black tone this film frames a world of pain and suffering for the characters. The films climax is very brutal and for some it might be hard to watch. Despite what some think about the ending being hopeless, I disagree. I felt that there was a small ray of light shining into Harry's mind that maybe a reconnection with his family was possible, however it was more likely given the history of the character that only more pain was in store. When you speculate about the future of a characters after the conclusion of the film, that's when you know the director has created a great story.<br/><br/>Sharp and nihilistic cinema. 9/10"
"meta_4","Null","0","1","24 April 2004"," A trip to the first dimension
","Can we say it's safe to assume most people have taken drugs one or a few more times? I think we can. Most of us took some and then moved on, a few however couldn't stop and became junkies. Their lives started to revolve around their habit(s); they became criminals, outcasts or otherwise marked by their addiction. Can we say it's safe to assume most of us wonder what they went through? If we can believe the movies it is. More than a few are dedicated to the world of junkies, chippers and drinkers. Welcome to a recent addition: Requiem for a dream.<br/><br/>(Spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>The story is quite simple: Requiem for a dream is about four people who are in a cabride to their doom. The cab being a lot of drugs and their drivers their hunger for it. The end is quite clear from the start; the depressing images and the music (by Clint Mansell, who also did the score for Pi) predict nothing good. This is where the trouble lies with Requiem for a dream; there isn't much else to be told. There isn't much depth to the characters' personalities, because we don't see much of them, a moderate exception being the mother, Sarah Goldfarb (An excellent role by Ellen Burstyn). In my view we enter their lives somewhat too late, and mainly see how drugs destroy their lives. It reminds me of Joel Schumacher's Falling down, where the plot was a daylong journey to inevitable self-destruction of a man (played by Michael Douglas), and the point of the movie was for us to see that happening. Falling down was intriguing to the end, Requiem for a dream doesn't fare as well.<br/><br/>But Requiem for a dream is more a graphic adventure than it is anything else. Some sequences seem taken out of a 'short film', especially the rapid close-ups of substances entering veins, pills flying into mouths and pupils widening when cocaine is blasted on mirrors like exploding bullets. Not all scenes convince and the hip editing can get repetitious, but the scenes where Sarah goes crazy are marvelously disturbing (Actually, she and her whole plotline steal the show). Close-ups with a camera attached to the body (a technique that debuted in Scorsese's Mean streets), visual and auditory distortions, fast-forwards and slow-motions, play with light and color, peculiar camera angles... you name it and it's fired at your senses to keep your attention.<br/><br/>Unfortunately most of the cast can't cut it. Jared Leto may be a handsome kid but he sure suffers from Johnny Deppism too. The same applies to Jennifer Connely. Both show they learned the ability to cry and look really angry in drama school, but where's the fire man, the character? Sarah Goldfarb fares much better as a worn-out loon who has a nervous breakdown and psychosis at the same time. Boy can she go crazy! She succeeds as a metaphor so her character survives being fairly straight-forward. At the end I didn't care much about what happened to the rest.<br/><br/>In the end, Requiem for a Dream has left some traces in my mind from seeing it yesterday so that's a good thing. It succeeds in building tension, nausea, to disturb the senses and the mind, but it isn't the masterpiece it wants to be.<br/><br/>Not in my book anyway."

","Before watching this film, I had only heard about Requiem as being a film that should have been Oscar nominated. Having seen it, I strongly agree with this notion.<br/><br/>Spoilers.<br/><br/>Aronofsky gives us a very graphic look at the lives of drug users in New York. Jared Leto is great as Harry, a drug user who becomes a dealer, who becomes a junkie with horrific consequences. Watching him fall lower and lower is truly hard to do, as it is to watch what happens to his girlfriend Marion, played wonderfully by Jennifer Connelly. However, the show is stolen by Ellen Burstyn as Harry's mother who unwittingly gets hooked on what she thinks are diet pills, and falls apart before our eyes, while constantly being taunted by her fridge. I would say that the scene where her TV show characters come out of the TV is the most moving scene in the film.<br/><br/>
I actually watched this film with my (very mature for her age) 14 year old sister, unaware of how graphic it would be. I am happy to say that if there was any chance of her taking drugs before, there isn't now. She does want her friends to see it... I'm not sure whether that's a good or bad thing yet!<br/><br/>Aronofsky should be very proud of what he has produced. This film is a true work of art, and sends out the strongest message possible.

This movie is one of the most powerful films I have ever viewed. I have never personally been at the hand of addiction, or understood why people allow themselves to get caught up in such a world of destruction, but watching this movie makes me actually sympathize not only for the characters in the film, but also users and addicts alike all over the world whom live such horrid, empty lives. What addicts are willing to sacrifice for one more fix is unthinkable. Harry sacrifices his mother's respect and prized possession (TV) multiple times, his health, and also loses the dream of a promising life with his girlfriend. Marion loses her dignity, self-respect, and aspirations of an honest career. Tyrone allows his life to be controlled by crime, which can only last so long, especially as a young, poor black man in a world that still houses ignorant bigotry and racism. Sara sacrifices her health and mental sanity because of a desperate desire to be thin and popular, abusing some form of prescription amphetamine to an extreme degree. `Requiem' provides an explicitly graphic view of the crudeness of the lives of addicts, sparing no details, offering no fairytale happy ending. I truly believe that this movie alone could be one of the greatest works with the potential as an anti-drug campaign.

","Although the director and writers obviously care about the characters, the filmmaking techniques draw too much attention to themselves. The quick edits of popping pills, eyes dilating, and the effects of drug usage in the blood stream were quite effective however. But, I have to ask, is this what it takes to keep audiences involved nowadays?  Ellen Burstyn gives a courageous performance in what had to be a grueling shoot. The most harrowing scene in the film for me was not the climax at the end, but a little earlier on when Mrs. Goldfarb is riding the subway on the way to Madison Avenue to try to get on television. The director left a natural lens on the camera long enough to let Burstyn?s performance come through.   The other actors were also totally committed and the result shows in every scene. It was fun to see Louise Lasser and Marcia Jean Kurtz (memorable in ""Dog Day Afternoon"") as two of Goldfarb's friends.<br/><br/>The theme of the piece seems to be the yearning to hide the pain of everyday mundane life--whether it's done by overeating, drugs, or sex.

","I just finished watching this movie, and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It is intense, thought provoking, and mind boggling. They should show this movie in every health class around the country.  Kids will get the picture that drugs do ruin your life.  It shows so many aspects of the drug world: crack, abusive nature of prescription pills, and selling yourself for drugs.  I would strongly recommend this for anyone out there. The angles of the camera, the music, and the characters bring this movie to life.  The suspense of knowing what is going to happen next is also one of the best parts of watching the movie.

","I think the destiny let me watch that movie. I have seen another movie of the same director, I was impressed of it, I saw also, here in Imdb, that Requiem for a dream was appreciated by users and somebody else told me many good things about it, so I wanted to watch it, but it was not easy to be found. Very strangely, once, I read the program of a satellite tv channel never watched and (surprise) Requiem for a dream was there that night. The expectations have not been disappointed, it is a great movie. At the beginning you don't feel too much, everything seems normal (to be a movie). Step by step it let you feel the same emotions of characters, every one, and unfortunately they are bad emotions. After having watched this movie you feel very bad, something remain in you stomach, it is incredible. The director is able to let you enter in the mentality of a disturbed mind, disturbed by drugs, but it could be anything else that give dependency. Everything is secondary, dignity, family, love and life as well, to find what they need is the priority. Wonderful use of music, it interpret the anguish of imagines. The director is incredible using imagines mixed quickly, to make credible the dream-reality mix created in character's minds. If you haven't watched it yet do it, but don't go to bed just after, it will be difficult to sleep, you should watch another movie or go outside thinking something else. It is a straordinary movie, It have to be seen, it is a good example of the art of cinema."
"keanu7000","Null","0","1","13 March 2004"," Excellent and deeper-than-usual look at lives affected by addiction
","A superbly made movie, with excellent acting and character development to say the least.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most successful strength of the multi-dimensional film is that it simultaneously tackles a number of deep issues, including loneliness, addiction of multiple forms, dreams of being a celebrity, the quest for a better life, and outright greed.  The drug addicts in this film are not all shown to be mindless junkies, but real people who want to do better but can never seem to escape their lives of self-abuse.<br/><br/>Hands down the best performance goes to the mother (Burstyn) as her character slowly and steadily develops throughout the film.  It is refreshing to see a movie that deals with the ever-more-common addiction to prescription drugs, a type that is rarely dealt with in most drug films. And certainly her tearful portrayal of a widowed mother living without family or a purpose epitomizes loneliness, another common but often avoided social sadness.<br/><br/>Overall an excellent film, and a must-see.  Better and deeper than most drug films."

","I disagree with some of the commentary calling this a sophisticated version of Reefer Madness. This movie is as much about the anguish of being lonely and lost as it is a ""drug movie."" Let's face it if you make a movie that shows how much fun it is to get heavily involved in drugs then you are blasted for promoting hedonism and it you make one that shows some of the unpleasant aspects of drugs you get accused of being a tool of government/social propagandists. Why didn't Ellen Burstyn win an Oscar for this? Her painful slide into addiction and madness really made me cringe. I like any relatively accessible American movie that doesn't try to wrap it all up in a bow at the end and ""make things right"" so to speak. I liked some of the camera techniques and while the topic might put some folks off it is basically a well made mainstream movie as opposed to anything you could call arthouse or experimental. I guess I wouldn't reccommend it to anybody who prefers the sweeter side of the cereal."

","Darren Aronofsky, as a director, is the Michael Bay for the arthouse crowd and this movie is the ""Reefer Madness"" of its generation. I mean, this is a movie that takes itself way, WAY too seriously, is so hysterically bad and over-the-top that, in future (and assumedly more perceptive) generations it will be looked back upon the way that we now watch a film like ""The Valley of the Dolls"". This is a film for self-pitying, mopey college students who sit around in their dorm rooms listening to Sonic Youth, talking about what they think are ""deep"" subjects and strumming acoustic guitars. Grow up, you infantile navel-gazers! The only 'real' performance in this film is Ellen Burstyn's (its only major award nomination, by the way - guess why?); everyone else in it plays obnoxious cyphers and rabid caricatures. How it is that anyone who watches this film would get sucked in by its 'heaviness', by its overweening and obnoxious sense of self-importance is astonishing to me. I guess it just goes to show that, like Barnum said, ""There's a sucker born every minute."""

","My summary was my first thought when the closing credits started running. We often refer to films as ""drama,"" but the term ""tragedy"" is not used much anymore.  This film can only properly be called a tragedy.<br/><br/>There are so many things about this film that drew me in.  There are also a number of things I kept ruminating about for days afterwards.  Not only is this film a rare example of a true tragedy in recent film, but it is structured more like a play than a movie.  Movies tend to build to a massive climax that occurs near the end of the film.  From what I remember of college lit classes, many plays have a climax dead in the middle of the performance.  _Requiem_ is like that: the most intense part is in the middle.  The characters die with a whimper at the end, not a bang.  It is not a story of slow decline, but a story of rise and fall.<br/><br/>I can't write about this film intelligently.

Set over a year the film follows the characters increasing addictions. I'm sure a lot of the conservatives would write off this film due to the subject matter, but it's a better warning about the consequences of drug taking than most official warnings. <br/><br/>Whilst not detracting from anybody else in the cast, Burstyn is absolutely outstanding as Sara.

","Requiem for a Dream is unlike any other film I have seen before. When I initially began watching it, I had no idea what to expect. Within less than five minutes, I knew I was watching something different.<br/><br/>
Director Aronofsky employs erratic, chaotic, editing styles to piece together a puzzle about the pains of addiction. The film follows 4 individuals who are closely related. A son, his mother, his girlfriend and his best friend. The films carries us through their tales of addiction and destruction. By the end of the film you will feel as if you have been to hell and back. Aronofsky obviously makes no effort to use subtext or subtle means to get his points of self-destruction across. Many times in the film I found myself cringing openly at the graphic images. This is surprising considering the amount of conditioning we have towards violence and sex. Take heed: this film is a very graphic and realistic(or at least I think so) depiction of the downward spirals of 4 individuals. This is not a family film.<br/><br/>In conclusion I must commend the cast on an absolutely brilliant job. All four main characters come in crystal clear with excellent performances. Hats off especially to Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly. Marlon is a great actor and it is good to see him in more serious roles. Jennifer did an overall excellent job. Go see this movie!<br/><br/>P.s. This film inspired me to never go near any drugs, ever."

","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen by far, and for many different reasons.  Number one, the imagery in the movie and the techniques used as far as camera angles and just the picture in general are so unique and effective its amazing.  I wish more movies were as artistically shot as this one.  Someone, the most normal and average thing jumped off the screen and seemed extra creepy and eerie to me.  Also, the sound track is very effective.  Notice how the same sounds are repeated throughout the film. There are true psychological techniques used here and they are so effective. I was just sucked into the movie whether I wanted to be or not...you can't help it.  There are repetative scenes as well such as the dialating eyes, the opening and closing of the mail box, the smoking, the drug use, the blood rush...these are used thru out and are very effective.  The basic plot is about Harry (Jared Leto) and his relationships with his mother, girlfriend, and best friend, and how they each are effected by addiction. You will be jilted by this movie...trust me.  I couldnt sleep.  It touched my soul like no other movie ever has, but in a very dark way.  If only more movies could truly capture emotion and force you to feel it like this movie does, it truly is a real life rollercoaster ride, yet you never even have to move.  I will admit, when I first watched the movie, I was not sober, but that just helped me be sucked in even more.  I was laughing for the first half even, then the turning point for me was the conversation that Harry has with his mother when he comes to visit and tell her he is buying her a new TV.  It is like you see the fake comments, but hidden in there is true emotion and pain when the mother says how she is lonely.  The mother/son relationship was the most gut wrenching thing for me to see and it left me feeling like I was a bad son, but I think we can all relate to that scene were its obvious Harry loves his mother and wants to do the right thing, but just doesn't know how, or they just are too different from each other to really be on that same level.  This movie is great because it doesn't just show one stereotype, it shows the mother being addicted and going crazy and will make you think twice when you see a bum on the subway.  I don't think I can even express any more about this film in words, everything will be expressed when you watch it for yourself..."

See it, but not with your kids...unless they are teenagers, in which case, definitely make sure they watch it. I habitually avoid sad or depressing films. I figure life is sad enough as it so why wallow in it? Oddly, even though this movie is almost nothing happy about it, I recommend it to everyone. It is a powerful film.

Harry and Tycone are running a drug-scam and are doing very well, he's crazy in love with his girlfriend and vice versa, and his mother is getting on a tv show and starts using diet pills.

","Blown away. A modern masterpiece. Its going to be difficult for me to convey my thoughts about this film adequately, considering that it struck so deep but Ill give it an effort.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is a film that I think the theatre going public needs to see more of. As difficult as it is to stomach, the subject matter presented here is done with nothing short of pure genius. The themes are treated with a realism that avoids all of the predictable cliches that could surround a ""drug related"" film. Fine tuned, ambitious shooting/editing/crafting techniques. Flawless, outstanding performances. A minimal yet interesting and engaging script. This film embodies the spirit of superb film making and then takes it to the next level. I see this as Aronofsky's excellent next step after PI, another engrossing film, but nowhere near as effecting and devastating as this. <br/><br/>It should be noted that this is not an easy film to watch. The climax in this movie is difficult and painful, even though you could see it coming a mile away. There is no light at the end of the tunnel, no silver lining, just pure tragedy. Sometimes I think that this sort of<br/><br/>depraved, depressing atmosphere has its place, and Requiem for a Dream illustrates this belief perfectly. We are left with a tragedy, a real true sense of loss. And yet, we havent been brought to this point by manipulative, morally obsessed tactics - the kind of thing that would surround something like reefer madness or any piece of film propoganda. We have been brought to the tragic climax/""message"" of this film through Aronofsky's brilliant approach to film and the capabilities it posseses as communicator and artistic medium. He lets his bold, ambitious style speak for itself, and in the end we are allowed to formulate our own opinions based around the images presented to us. More often than not, those opinions will be ones of sadness and pain. <br/><br/>Why did this film strike so deep? I think that Requiem emobodies and illustrates the universal human desire for HOPE by showing us none of it whatsoever. It is concerned with the flip side of hope, the yin of the yang, the lack of it in any capacity. All we can think upon at the end of this film is the absence of hope, and that in itself is enough to instill a strong sense of it within us as viewers. <br/><br/>**** out of ****"

One of the finest achievements of the film is its ability to get under the viewer's skin and make you feel what the characters are going through, both physically and emotionally. And perhaps most scary is the reminder that drug addiction can happen with legal drugs, as Ellen Burstyn's character demonstrates. <br/><br/>You may not usually feel sorry for drug addicts, but these characters force you to feel their desperation and their pain.

The repetitive ""eye dilatation"" scene representing the drug rush...the haunting refridgerator...the careful use of POV camera shots both from in front and behind the subject and extreme camera angles... these are all skillfully used effects that help to bring the audience into the off balance world of the addict.

It seems that you'll walk out of the theater to run into one of these guys. This is a movie that shakes you, that makes you tired, sick, sad, and most important...alive."

","Requiem for a Dream""- I've been hearing about this film for sometime now. Mostly from my sons who are in their early to mid twenties & their friends. I've also seen it was listed in the top 250 films on IMDb, so I decided I'd better check it out. Was it worth all the hype......well?<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream,"" is definitely a film about addictive personalities addicted to drugs, as a matter of fact that is about all it descibes & leaves little room for anything else. The creators of this film want you to know the harrowing consequences & hell of drug addiction. That for all ages, sex, race, addiction is the same, just they go different ways about maintaining their habits. The mother gets hers from the Doctor, portrayed as a insensitive quack who only writes prescription & does not look at the patient (the mother) once during her visits. The girlfriend gets it from her boyfriend & when he can't produce, she sells her body for it. The boyfriend & his buddy, who deal so they can become rich, but end up not even being able to support their habit. Yes, the horror of drug addiction portrayed truthfully, well? Yes mostly, but no also. Sure, all these things can happen as worse case scenario, don't get me wrong here, I'm not advocating drug use for anyone......but. The creators of this film go out of their way to shock the audience, & when it comes down to showing real drug use they cop out. All we get is the same snippet editing over & over again, showing the aftermath, but no actual act of getting high. This film also cops out in dealing with the real problems of buying drugs & dealing, it touches on this subject very lightly. We again get those fast edited snippets when they're dealing. No in-depth showing of our characters dealing with others in real transactions, dodging the police, dodging would be rip off artists, narcs, putting up with all the idiots that come with the territory, nothing. We get a scene where our characters are trying to score on the dock of a grocery store. I had to kind of smile here. The average Joe Junkie, does not go to Super Walmart, on the dock to score his drugs from a Florida Orange truck. Another direct act of sensationalism from the creators of this film. I really believe that the director had in mind to make the Boggey Man portrait of drug addiction with this film, so all you would be drug users & Ice Cream habit users would get scared away from the subject, or just say....cool dude, did you watch that!<br/><br/>Really, if you want to watch films on the subject, there are much better ones out there, that deal with all the aspects of drug use deeply. Some are, ""Panic in Needle Park,"" ""Cisco Pike,"" ""Less Than Zero,"" ""The Bad Lieutenant,"" ""Fresh,"" ""Clockers,"" & the black comedy of ""Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas."" See these films if you really want to see what ""THE LIFE,"" is about.<br/><br/>""Requiem for a Dream,"" does manage to shock some, no doubt about it, but then again, thats really what it is intended for & not much else.<br/><br/>(room temp)"

","Now to say the truth, I wasn't at all excited to see this film. I am a little late at watching films and this film was in front of me for a while. All my friends saw it and they all said that the film was awful, and a real ""Bummer""- to quote one of my colleagues. I just watched this film and I had to post my comment on the IMDB. This film is amazing. I particularly liked the music, it was full of feeling-two thumbs up for Clint Mansel. (Spoiler so watch out and skip this paragraph if you don't like them) Now from the start of the film you see three teenagers/young adults who are junkies and you could tell from the start that this isn't going to have a happy ending. As you keep on watching you understand every character more clearly as Director Darren Aronofsky clearly brings images of clear memory or hallucinations of each member of the circle. The idea of Harry's mother (Ellen Burstyn -beautifully played by the way)getting addicted to amphetamines is also a mark of a good-tailored screenplay and novel, proving that not all junkies are kids and that reasons aren't important for drug-addiction. What took my attention was the way the director portrayed the feeling of being on drugs and an addict without them. It was masterful, I liked this film a lot and I think that Anyone who has a soft spot for tragic movies should try this one. (I give this film a 9 out of 10)"

","This movie was the most powerful film I have ever seen -- and I didn't even see the beginning. DirecTV gave it this description, and this is the only reason I watched ""it:  4 people try to better their lives"".  Absurd! So I kept waiting for their lives to get better and needless to say they got worse and worse until it was too depressing to stand. I kept turning it off but then would turn it back on.  Anyway, I'm glad I saw it because it made me have more compassion. The next time I see a ""wacko"" on the subway, I will think of that marvelousacting by Ellen  Burstyn, and realize that the ""wacko"" is someone's mother.  Also, it was heart-breaking to see the young people with so much potential and beauty spiral down into utter hopelessness and sqaulor.  I guess I'm glad DirecTV blew the description of the movie because I would never have watched it.  The filming was marvelous."

","If there ever were an anti-drug movie that would scare the living crap out of you from trying the stuff, this movie would be it.  Darren Aronofsky's camerawork is so dizzying and manic that you feel like you really are viewing what the characters are going through.  To make this even more effective, the score to the film, with those haunting strings, is so damn creepy, they alone would give me nightmares!  My only complaint about the direction and the story is that some scenes do go a little overboard, such as the scene where the room transcends into a game show.  But I guess scenes like that give you an idea of the craziness that goes on from an addict's point of view.<br/><br/>As for the performances, they are nothing less than stellar.  Witnessing the descent of these characters is so powerful; you can't turn away for a second.  Ellen Burstyn gives a much-deserved Oscar-nominated performance as an elderly woman who spirals into drug addiction simply because she wants to look her best.  This can happen to anyone.  It's almost chilling to think of one of my loved ones doing this.  Marlon Wayans gives a very surprising and strong performance, while Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly epitomize the carefree, loving couple that gets in way too deep.  To see what happens to all these characters at the end of the movie is just disheartening.<br/><br/>After watching this movie, you can't help but be blown away.  You want to talk about it and think about it for quite some time.  Just like drugs, this film will never really leave you.<br/><br/>My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A (Outstanding)"

I don't think i've ever felt quite so drained and harrowed after watching a film, and yes the events are ""depressing"", but they are also the result of drugs, prescribed and recreational. This not so much depressed, but more seemed to warn and illustate to the viewer what can happen when you become addicted to drugs. The truth about what can happen may well be shocking and upsetting, and so it was good to see that the director decided to make the film shocking and upsetting, rather than gloss over it all. All four lead roles are superbly acted, and the camera work is classy and modern. As with most great films, the music really adds to it, the main theme being particularly intense.<br/><br/>I enjoy films which leave me thinking about what happened, and i couldn't stop thinking about what happened in this movie - it was definitely one for stirring the emotions."

Now, I have to admit to this day I still sorta shiver when I think about this movie.  Harry's mother is a preticularly difficult image for me to cope with.  I saw this movie when I was twelve for the first time, perhaps a little bit young, so I thought maybe this is why I was so shocked. Well now that i have watched it at an older age I see that it was not me. This movie was made to shock. I recommend this movie to a friend of mine and he said he couldn't get through it.  He's a happy guy, likes cartoons and comedy, but he's also into movies like Pi, being John Malkavich (sry for spelling) and Donnie Darko, so I thought he might like it.  Well he described his experience with the film and disgusted, sometimes people just can't handle the reality of it, I am not sure if this is a bad or good thing. In all, this is a great movie, that I can't say I enjoyed but was impressed with and bettered as a person because of it.

"tributarystu","9","0","1","1 November 2003"," Requiem for a Dream
","It hasn't been easy, watching this Requiem. Aronofsky's second major film is, perhaps, one of the most gruesome stories about solitude and addiction, a shattering first-time experience which may well leave you stranded.<br/><br/>Watching it several times has somewhat shifted my original point of view, mainly because there are only so many times you can feel surprised by the brute force of the film. There is no need to put this in unclear terms, Requiem for a Dream is mainly a visual and sensory experience. It's extremely immersive and while some of Aronofsky's techniques may feel gimmicky after a while, the amazing soundtrack by Clint Mansell will keep you at dazzling heights all along. To be frank, I never understood how the exhilarating score just got overlooked by big award ceremonies; its value cannot be disputed now, as many bits of it have been overused of late by so many clips trying to come off as dramatic and intense - which they generally do, because the music is vibrant.<br/><br/>For a while, I believed Requiem to be one of the best films ever made. I have since refined this opinion a bit, because such things are bound to happen after a number of viewings if the film is as blunt as this. Yet this is not to be taken in as a negative aspect, but more of a necessary evil. Requiem delivers its messages on several levels, the most obvious one being related to addiction issues. It's worth emphasizing that it doesn't boil down to a matter of drugs, because of the oh-so-many faces of addiction, physical and emotional, to narcotics and emotions. I do feel more affected though by the mesmerizingly sad story of solitude, with Ellen Burstyn leading the way most elegantly. To my mind, Requiem manages to convey this loneliness better than any other work of film I've seen, and its impressions are lasting.<br/><br/>For anyone watching the movie for the first time, just be prepared for a rough ride which may well prove to be extremely rewarding. But I wouldn't necessarily go in a second time for the sheer pleasure of it; Requiem just isn't that kind of film, which however does not diminish its merits as it remains one of the best movies of the year - and not only."

Ellen Burstyn's performance is the highlight of her career, as her portrayal of Sara Goldfarb is nothing short of brilliant.  Through haunting visuals, combining the surrealistic dreamworld of the addict with the horrifying nightmare that lies between highs, Aronosofsky moves beyond the enigmatic pretenses of his first work PI, and into a bold new world.  Nothing anyone said prepared me for this movie, with its utterly honest and terrifying depiction of addiction, it is so much more intriguing than anything else I have ever seen on the subject (the closest would be 'Trainspotting' and that is distant).

","I seem to be on a drug movie binge tonight. I just posted some comments about ""Spun,"" which has some obvious similarities with this movie. I think this movie has more universal appeal, though, and for good reasons. To me, this is simply a fantastic film, and I'd recommend it to anyone.<br/><br/>The four main characters are each likable, or at least very sympathetic, and we become very drawn in to their situations. And so, when things start to go horribly, horribly wrong, it does become painful to watch. Yet, one can't turn away, and I don't think it's just the ""auto-wreck you gotta look at"" effect. <br/><br/>Here's my theory: I have a good friend whose life has been, for several years, tragedy after tragedy, stupid mistake after stupid mistake, and unbelievably (literally!) bad luck after unbelievably bad luck. I keep thinking (as does he) that things can't get any worse. And then, they get worse. And I keep waiting for that point where his life finally turns around and good things start happening, but they don't. I can't turn my back on him, because he is in fact a good friend, has been there for me when I needed him, and I care for him very much. That's exactly the feeling I have for the characters in this movie. I want so badly for things to turn around for them, but things don't turn around, but I can't give up on them because I've become attached. And things do get truly awful for them.<br/><br/>A lot has been said for the style and, in particular, the fast-edits and the symbolic shorthand sequences indicating that a character is taking his/her particular drug. Some think they are gimmicky; I on the other hand feel that they are integral to the story, and are a pretty good way of describing the immediate effects of the drug and the emotional undercurrents (as distinct from the drug effects) that one feels when one is taking a drug (been there, done that, ruined my life thank you very much).<br/><br/>I give this movie 10/10. Admittedly I have an agenda here, but I really want all the kids in my life to see this movie before they encounter drugs for real. I don't know if it would stop them, but at least I'd feel like they knew what the worst-case scenarios were, and that they were making semi-informed decisions."

And Ellen Burstyn's performance was absolutely stellar, not to mention how she put herself so out there, so vulnerable; again, one of the best I've ever seen.  And all of the actors were fantastic.<br/><br/>Ultimately to me the movie fails, especially as it frenetically descends into the final whirlpool of misery.  I hadn't realized until I watched the special features that the film is based on a Hubert Selby novel.  I have the same criticism for this film that I did for an adaptation of Selby's ""Last Exit to Brooklyn;"" that the story's unflinching look at the most tormented human misery has absolutely no dramatic tension whatsoever.  You watch it for the same reasons that people stop at car accidents; a voyeuristic fascination with other people's misery and death.  I remember thinking as I watched Selby's interview on the DVD that suffering without heroism tells us nothing, and there is nothing remotely heroic about any of Selby's characters, ever.  Not that there should have been any sugar-coated happy ending, but the sort of nihilistic meaninglessness that you're left with leaves no empathy for the characters, and ultimately no connection to the film.<br/><br/>Watch it for the visuals, the music, the performances...Aranofsky is a genius.  I just wish he'd chose more interesting source material."

","Requiem for a Dream is the best movie I have seen in a long time and one of the best ever.  Part of the reason is how beautifully it flows together. The cinematography, the music, the dialogue, they all come together to create a wonderful experience.  Even if that experience is not particularly pleasant, it has an effect on your soul unlike most other films.<br/><br/>One big mistake I've read is that this film is about drug use.  It is not. The drugs are simply a metaphor for addiction of any kind, and in a broader sense, the things in our lives that control us that we have a very hard time controlling.  Instead of drug use, the characters could have been in abusive relationships, dead-end jobs, or any other controlling factor.  Requiem describes how these things can change and tear apart your life.  It's not about drugs in particular.<br/><br/>In fact, an important element of Requiem is if you notice, you never actually see anybody take drugs.  Drug use is simply an addiction that most people can understand.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is an utterly astounding piece of work.  What it says about addiction, relationships, poverty, sexuality, morality, and humanity is poignant and provoking.  The content of the script is complemented by incredible work by the four main actors who each may have given the performance of their careers in Requiem.  <br/><br/>As I said, the camera work and score are brilliant and highlight the despair of the film.  The people who made this film refused to yield to the MPAA and accepted the NC-17 rating instead of making edits.  That artistic integrity is evident in every aspect of this incredible work.<br/><br/>Love it or hate it, Requiem for a Dream will move you."

","It wasn't till a saw it on IMDb 250 list that I found out about ""Requiem for a Dream.""

Which again doesn't mean that it was a great movie. With the exception of the sound and camera editing, it felt like documentary. <br/><br/>One of the major flaws of the movie with the exception of Ellen Burstyn was that it wasn't given a clear explanation as to why the people in the movie got hooked on drugs in the first place. It would've been so much better. Again with the exception of the Burstyn's character it wasn't clear what our people dreamt about. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, it was an experience and a memorable one, which is what movies are all about.

Usually, the term edge of your seat, is saved for thrillers, but we were, all three of us at the edge of our seats. No talking allowed, no whispers, we all formed these self preserved bubbles around us, and we watched, amazingly and totally spell bound.<br/><br/>Movies like Requiem, are special, because they remind you of the power of film. They are what all films should be, and what few films rarely achieve. I remember clearly the conversation after the movie ended.  It was amazing, we were on a high.

","Alot of drug movies make you want to do drugs. Most of the time it's because they glorify them. Some of the time it's because they're cheesy, and it's fun to flaunt there cheesiness with drugs. But this one makes you want to do drugs just to numb the crippling depression that sets in by the finale! My god this was a sad movie! That's no criticism mind you, after all, it takes real genius and hard work to make you care about the characters enough to get that sad about their fates. This was simply a perfectly executed movie.<br/><br/>I will say that there are some minor elements that are a bit unrealistic, and that each of the principle characters would meet the ends that they do - and at approximately the same time - is guilding the lilly a bit (statistically speaking I doubt that out of a given four junkies ALL that stuff would happen), but then this is a work of fiction, and deserves to be judged as fiction. Probably a more realistic vision of junky life is to be found in Drugstore Cowboy. nevertheless, the tone is authentic, as are the motivations and character interactions. There is no central villain, as would be found in most anti-drug movies, instead the protagonists are their own antagonists (which is refreshing, since most anti-drug movies place all the blame on some sinister dealer).<br/><br/>The direction is lush and innovative. The acting is spot on in all cases. Now we all know by now that Jared Leto can play anything (and I since he looks so different in every movie, it actually took me awhile to figure out it was him in this, cause he looked pretty much like himself), so I won't waste time saying what everybody already knows. Instead, I'd like to say how impressed I was with Marlon Wayans. Like all the Wayans brothers, he's a competent comedic actor, but whereas most of the dramatic turns his brothers have taken over the years have been in over-budgeted action throwaways, he had the stones to take on a REAL acting challenge. And he succeeded magnificently. he could have easily gone over-the-top with his character (and I think even some of the best in the biz would not have been able to avoid the temptation to do that), instead he hit all his characters high notes without making him at all annoying or cartoonish. The simple fact that he could act alongside Jared Leto and hold his own proves that he is in the top teir of actors today. Now the only question is whether or not he will pursue that branch of his career. I hope he does.<br/><br/>At any rate, I'm getting tired, so I'll just finish off by giving this my highest recommendation."

","This is the most powerful film I have ever seen.  Although just an ""arthouse drama"" it won a British award for best horror film.  OMG where shall I start...<br/><br/>If you want to study ""pacing"" of a movie study this one.  A comment after showing this to some friends was ""the repetitive pictures of the eyeballs, etc. was annoying.""  Well that's where the 2000+ cuts of the movie came from!  lol<br/><br/>I believe that those repetitive cuts form a ""reference point"" in the movie. Throughout the movie we see that reference point. Between that reference point we see four lives spiralling into hell.  Repeatedly when consequences of the character's own actions seem to have bottomed out, they get worse. Each consequential situation more horrific, both emotionally and graphically at the same time.  <br/><br/>This film is a study of character development because every decision and action of each is never surprising.  Never does anyone do anything out of character that surprises. What surprises are the consequences of each happening graphicaly and in parallel on the screen. <br/><br/>Sara Goldfarb is another reference point in the film. Sarah was portrayed by Ellen Burstyn, the mom in ""The Exorcist"", nominated for ""Best Actress in a Leading Role"" Oscar for this movie].

"FlorisV","Null","0","1","25 June 2003"," Uncomfortably hypnotic
","Wow there's a lot of comments on this film. It seems like everyone was somehow impressed and needed to write down what the movie meant for them. This movie is not a masterpiece but it's still great, and very emotionally draining, unlike most movies.<br/><br/>Although all the characters are addicts (Burstyn becoming an addict of diet pills...are these legal??) they are all sympathetic and they make you care about them and their dreams. <br/><br/>The movie starts out depicting the relationship between the characters. As the movie progresses all the characters tumble more and more into a maelstrom of misery, ending in a very uncompromising and strong ending that will shock the viewer.<br/><br/>That ending is a bit exaggerated (getting thrown in jail just for having heroin injection wounds, electroshock therapy without sedation or consulting first, even amputation!) but it will blow you away, leaving you with a feeling like you just got hit with a sledge hammer. The exaggeration is a typical American aspect for films and I can't really say it's always bad but as a European I have more respect for subtlety and I liked the way the topic was handled more lightly in Trainspotting.<br/><br/>IMHO, the message delivered here is, however, not simply ""don't do drugs"". It's not even a movie that focuses on drugs as a problem (like Traffic, another good movie), it focuses on more universal problems: abuse, lack of attention to old people, lack of love and care. This is done in a convincing way and the acting is superb. <br/><br/>Besides the exaggeration my negatives are it's repetitivity (the same music and the same montage with the close-up on the eyes with every fix are repeated over and over again to try to hypnotize the viewer, however, to me it came across as semi-hip. The great Trainspotting is a lot funnier and more hip. But Requiem for a dream is still a seriously great film for it's acting, sensitivity and effective camera-work.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"
"unbreakablepabs","10","0","1","19 June 2003"," A brilliant, harrowing and hypnotic film!
","Requiem for a Dream is a film of unquestionable power, a one of a kind, challenging movie made by a genius director. When I saw it for the first time ever, it had such an immense impact on me that it nearly made me cry. I turned off the TV feeling rather shaken and surprisingly fascinated because of the honesty of the movie. It tells us: this is how some people live now.<br/><br/>The film, directed by Pi director Darren Aronofsky deals with the intertwined lives of four people living in Brooklyn on their quest for satisfaction in life. They are Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), a lonely, TV obsessed widow, and her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and his drug dealer friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). After learning that she will make an appearance on a TV game show, Sara tries to lose weight so that she can fit into her prized red dress, and becomes hooked on diet pills. Meanwhile, Harry and his friends are taking heroin and cocaine. We then witness the disastrous consequences and the downward spiral their lives take as a result of their addictions.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is amazingly effective; not only does it portray drug addiction in a horrifyingly sincere way, but it also makes us reflect and think. The film is a sheer tour-de-force, a piece of filmmaking that is impossible to forget, a film that rapidly grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. As we're thrown into the lives of these four addicts we learn that they have been doing this for quite some time because the film doesn't really have a beginning; it's as though we had always been there. It is evident that Aronofsky's greatest weapon in his armoury is his highly innovative and unique visual style as he makes excellent use of extreme close-ups of dilating pupils, split-screen and sped-up footage. Sometimes he even straps cameras onto his actors to give a spectacular effect. The fast editing, which for some reason or other have caused some a problem, worked perfectly fine with me, giving us adrenaline-pumping images to convey the effects of drug addiction.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch and very convincing but Ellen Burstyn is definitely the one who steals the show with her strong and amazingly honest performance. I was surprised to see Marlon Wayans in a non-comedy role, and even more surprised to discover that Burstyn did not win an Academy Award. Special mention must go to Clint Mansell's mournful, cold and beautiful score which gives the film a bigger and altogether more profound human side.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is a master of creating emotions so that we, the audience, are able to sense them. When someone's alone, we feel their loneliness, when someone's sad, we feel their sadness. Undoubtedly, the characters are all well-developed and gradually we begin to care for them, we begin to identify with them and share their feelings, which, in my opinion, is a very good thing because this is precisely what lacks in most modern films nowadays.<br/><br/>
The film is certainly a very compelling piece of work; it's disturbing, terrifying and most important of all, honest. Very often and because of this, it is sometimes impossible to set your eyes on the screen or to look away at the same time. The film becomes so involving that when we contemplate the characters' descent into hell at the harrowing ending we cannot help but inevitably feel both sadness and terror because of what they've become.<br/><br/>Overall, Requiem for a Dream is without a doubt a brilliant, hypnotic, bona fide masterpiece. Aronofsky has given us a well-acted, shocking, brutal and virtuous must-see film that both impresses and disturbs.<br/><br/>
Requiem for a Dream is unlike anything I have ever seen before, a truly memorable film, a work of art that rightly deserves its position amongst one of the best films of the past 30 years.<br/><br/>*****/*****"

","Requiem for a Dream is an utterly amazing film achievement. Darren Aronofsky has created a vibrant, pulsating, repugnant masterpiece.  The director's visual flair and Scorsese-esque use of music creates an immediacy and sense of elation and dread that accurately capture the world of drug use.

Pounding people with the ham-fisted ""drugs are bad"" approach seriously undermines the credibility of the messenger--anyone who has dabbled knows that they can be a lot of fun with seemingly very few negative consequences.

The performances are breath taking. Everybody sinks their teeth into the role they play, to the point where it feels more like a home movie than a scripted effort. Ellen Burstyn is incredible. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are also superb as the teen junkies, but the biggest surprise for me was Marlon Wayans (he can actually act!).<br/><br/>The movie is dived into three acts: Summer, Fall and Winter. Summer is morbidly depressing, so you can probably guess that Fall and Winter are positively gut-wrenching. Suffice to say that this is not a feel good movie by any means. I wouldn't suggest it unless you are in the mood for something very (and I mean VERY) dark.<br/><br/>Great follow up for Darren.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

It's definitely not a happy movie, and those who don't like dark subject matter or unhappy endings may be squeemish.  But for the rest of us this is a true journey.

","Darren Aronofsky's movie is considered by many as a masterpiece, equal or even better to 'Clockwork Orange'. I am cautious to join this chorus.<br/><br/>This is a good film indeed. Four characters in the American suburb that became the background of some of the best movies in the last few years start spiraling down in an accelerated manner due to drug problems. Mother and son, different generations, are both victims of drug addiction, each in the specific manner belonging to their age. Their dream are artificial ones, Sparking American dreams from outside, rotten inside. One of the many good scenes brings them into what may look like their happier moment, but you soon realize that they already have started the free fall. More social comments are being made, including a tough view of the American TV sub-culture. <br/><br/>Acting is remarkable. Best are the two lead feminine roles - Jenmifer Connelly and especially Ellen Burstyn, with an Oscar-level performance. This director knows to get the best from his actors.<br/><br/>So, what's wrong? In my view the film is too obvious, too didactic. Drugs are a problem, and this film makes a strong case against drugs. As tough and hard to watch as it is, seeing this film should be mandatory in schools in US and other parts of the Western world touched by the drugs plague. But the didactic tone lowers the artistic quality. All what happens with the characters, as shocking and disturbing as it might be, is predictable after the first ten minutes of the film. Some ambiguity would have helped, and I hope that the director will avoid the manifesto style in his coming movies. He is really one big talent to watch. The film gets 8/10 on my personal scale."

"Lil' Oz","Null","0","1","8 February 2003"," A bit of ""Leaving Las Vegas: with a ""Schindler's List"" chaser, all in a ""Changing Lanes"" atmosphere
","Good Lord, man! This movie is like ""Leaving Las Vegas"" with a ""Schindler's List"" chaser in an atmosphere of ""Changing Lanes""!<br/><br/>Let me explain. First of all, there is no denying that it IS an amazing movie. Darren Aronofsky is a brilliant director. Visually, the movie is unbelievable! Was it nominated for any awards for its directing? It should have been.<br/><br/>The cast was simply amazing. Jennifer Connely was a guilty pleasure as always. Jared Leto keeps impressing me more and more each time I see him. Ellen Burstyn blew my mind. And Marlon Wayans?! Who'd a thunk a Wayans could actually ACT?!<br/><br/>The film should have also won an award for best make up for Ellen Burstyn's character. The difference between her appearance as she envisioned herself on tv and the state that she found herself in at the end of the movie is beyond amazing. I was just as impressed with her range of appearance as I was with King Theoden's pre/post ""exorcism"" in The Two Towers!<br/><br/>Now, let me explain my comment at the beginning of this post where I compared ""Requiem"" with ""Vegas,"" ""Schindler,"" and ""Lanes."" It is like Changing Lanes in that none of the characters are really likeable. Maybe that adds to the reality of it all the more, but it is hard (at least, for me) to watch a movie where you genuinely don't like any of the characters. The aspect which raised it above ""Lanes,"" however, and brought it up to the level of ""Vegas"" was that while the characters are not likeable in the least, you do genuinely care for them. The scenes where ""Maid Marion"" goes to the apartment of the guy she has the phone number for are truly heartbreaking. Especially her second visit. Seeing Sarah getting worse and worse on her medication is pitiable in its reality. And Harry's arm and the agony it causes him is too realistic and I found myself longing for the point where he finally has it ""treated"" at the end of the film.<br/><br/>This all brings me to the final comparison with another film. Requiem is like ""Schindler's List"" in that it is both very realistic (I would say that both Schindler"" and ""Requiem"" are films that every person should see) AND very depressing. Luckily I also rented ""Beneath Loch Ness,"" a B-grade movie that will hopefully bring me back to a state of emotional equilibrium.<br/><br/>All in all, I 'm glad that I saw it, but I refuse to say that it was a movie that I ""enjoyed."" Like ""Schindler's List,"" I have seen it once ... and that, to tell the truth, is enough."

I'm sure the teens love it.<br/><br/>*spoilers*<br/><br/>I found the mother to be the only interesting character of the entire film. Her dreams of fame and fortune seem unreachable, she's a widow, and thinks her prescribed drugs are harmless. She's misinformed and alone. It is just a very sad situation. In the meantime, the 3 brainless kids play wilfully with fire (and get burnt), fully informed of the danger, just trying to be smartasses. Too bad, they lose. Expectable. Good riddance.

It's already getting old.<br/><br/>If you feel the need to watch disturbing movies with content, I'd rather recommend ""Seul Contre Tous (I Stand Alone)"" and ""Irreversible"" by Gaspar Noe, ""Repulsion"" and ""The Tenant"" by Roman Polanski, ""Possession"" by Andrzej Zulawski, ""Sombre"" by Philippe Grandrieux, ""Les Amants Criminels"" by Francois Ozon, ""Last House On The Left"" by Wes Craven, ""Tetsuo (The Ironman)"" by Shinya Tsukamoto...<br/><br/>Good luck sitting through these !"

Darren Arnofsky(sp) is a brilliant director that doesn't pull a punch and won't let any members of his cast do so either.  Addiction has never been captured on film like this before, and even though many will try to, i doubt that it will be again. I Put this movie in the same catogory as Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. This is the type of film that you can't let sink into the backround, you can't talk with your friends while you watch this movie.

","The very first time I heard or experienced this film, was one night on the movie channel. I had missed most of it and got to see the final 15-20 mins of it, but was intrigued by the unique filmimg style (mainly burstyn walking down the street, which I thought was VERY neatly filmed). I had only watched a little bit of the movie, and it had me thinking and I was impressed...<br/><br/> Skip ahead about 2 months, and one day shopping for dvd's I stumbled upon it. It triggered something in my head and I remembered being impressed with what I saw, so for $17 I picked it up...Till this day I still think about it sometimes and can say that it has been one of the more notable masterpieces made...<br/><br/> The film is almost a documentary, a look at addiction and drugs, in the same sense you become attached to the characters that it's almost a biographical story of their lives. The characters almost become a part of you, in so many ways you feel for them, and realize that in each of their own there just trying to find success and their own definition of happiness.<br/><br/>The movie starts off maybe a bit slow, but once it engages, it changes from a movie to almost an experience. For the record the first time I actually watched the WHOLE film, I almost just sat there, staring at my TV screen, both thinking and shocked of what I had witnessed.<br/><br/> Aronofsky, who first made this major debut with Pi, does just about everything right in this film. Is there flaws? Of course, but they almost take away nothing to the film. In fact some of the flaws and mistakes are used to the films advantage at just pounding the point into your head more. The filming style, the script, cinematography, the music and sound etc... just about everything works and flows brilliantly.<br/><br/>From an acting standpoint, everyone excels in this film. Even Wayans who has shown very little besides comedic roles, proves himself. The characters show true emotion, feeling, and it's almost as if there not acting, but actually being themselves. Burstyn stands out just a little bit more, just because her performance was just outstanding, an academy award most definatly should have been considered, but of course was overlooked...<br/><br/> RFaD to sum it up, was well worth the purchase, and hell would have been worth the admission if I had have gotten the oppurtunity to see it in theatres. Filmmaking like this should be considered a privlage and respected (aimed at those who think it's dumb, and that it doesn't  excel at what it tries to show), especially with all the crap being released these days.

","What upsets me about 6th grade Science classes and 10th grade Health classes is that they're to PG when showing movies dealing with drugs. I believe if you want to make an impression on someone on the effects of drugs then you need to make a scrupulous presentation. Sure they may show you people who have suffered from the excessive use of Cigarettes or marijuana but they only show you one side of the story. While there's nothing wrong with that many people aren't convinced by learning one side of the story. And while Health class tends to take a more PG-13 route, the 6th grade class maintains PG and the next thing you know you have a bunch of 6th graders either smoking or doing drugs. <br/><br/>So I believe if you want to stop people from using drugs then get a bunch of 6th graders together and show them this brilliant movie by Darren Aronofsky which is truly a scrupulous presentation. This MASTERPIECE shows possibly all sides of what may happen if you use drugs and it doesn't show it to us PG but NC-17!!!! I'm sure anyone who sees this film will not dare to do any drugs. I must admit that Aronofsky did his homework in this film cause this was really an IMPRESSIVE picture. <br/><br/>You'll never see nothing on film more shocking then the last 30 minutes of this movie.

So what exactly makes Requiem For A Dream so different? I'll tell you. Requiem For A Dream is not exactly a morality tale about the dangers of drug addiction , it's not a warning , and it isn't preaching. It's a descent into the darkest pits of hell. It is an excrusiating emotional torture lesson in the death of hope , and the death of a future. Requiem plays like a sonic assault on your emotions , fears , and sympathys. It doesnt hold anything back , and leaves you feeling sick and emotionally drained and disgusted as the very last note on the soundtrack plays.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS* It tells two storys interwoven together. Sara Goldfarb played by Ellen Burnstyn  , a sweet sweet Coney Island woman who is oblivious to her son Harry's habits and behavior played by Jared Leto and her obsession to be on television and lose weight to fit into her red dress. She seeks the treatment of diet pills and soon becomes addicted to them leaving her in a downward spiral of self destruction..what makes her demise the hardest is her character comes off as this sweet nice old lady and the viewer is felt disgusted by what happens to her. Harry and his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayanes) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) are drugged out losers from the begining so the viewer doesn't really feel sympathy for them but towards the end their sickness and destruction of hope is felt very hard by the viewer. Requiem's power is in it's editing , acting , and score. We don't actually see any graphic drug use like you would in Trainspotting or other films , it's not that type of movie. It's a movie bent on hurting your emotions , making you feel what the characters are feeling and it does a very good job. Definitly not for the faint of heart or emotionally unstable."

","Watching Requiem for a Dream for the first time was like no other helpless feeling of deprivation I have ever felt before. This is not a movie, but a film. Stunningly filmed and breathtakingly acted, director Darren Aronofsky deserves a kudos for this instant and timeless classic.<br/><br/>At first note on the film, one is drawn deeply into the life of four very close people with their own personal addictions. Most importantly is the love affair between Harry (Jared Leto) and Marion (Jennifer Connelly). Jared Leto's striking performance and Jennifer Connelly's best work to date consume you into a mix of passion and fury which comes at you hard and very personally. At first glance the film seems to be a well drawn ""drug film"" that glamorizes use, but in fact raises your spirits then drops them like a meteorite. The impact is a mix of emotions to great to express.<br/><br/>Of course to balance the act is Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) who gives an Oscar winning performance as Harry's television obsessed mother. Sara Goldfarb is someone we can all relate to in these schedulized, self-improved times in which popularity is everyone's addiction.<br/><br/>As a note to all who watch, Requiem for a dream is a shockingly realistic film that takes character and consumption to a worst cased scenario. Please watch with open mind and remember that as horribly shocking as it may be, this does not classify it as a poor quality film.

(even though that damned Julia Roberts took what rightly belonged to Ellen Burstyn on Oscar night. grrrr) The film is graphic, very much so, but it in no way glamorizes any of the events in the film.  The drug use is not go to a party and have some fun. Its addiction. And thats what this film is really about.  Addiction, not specifically drug-related, and the effects it can have on the human spirit.  Aronofsky, with this and Pi, has proven himself to be one of the true artists of recent times (and isn't the type to go  around shouting about that like some jackass Signs director).  I look forward to whatever he may have in store for us next."

","This film is brilliant, but very dark cinema.  It is also highly stylized, as is Aronofsky's other film I have seen, the terrific Pi.  It is not for everyone's taste, and due to the gruesomeness of its imagery and unsavoriness of the consequences of drug addiction depicted, it is very difficult to watch.  Nevertheless, the depressing, but realistic message--that reality has an unfortunate habit of killing our dreams--is one which is seldom tackled to this effect in the Hollywood land of fairy tale endings.<br/><br/>The cast is terrific.  Ellen Burstyn is wonderful and haunting in her Oscar-nominated role as Sara Goldfarb, the pathetic, lonely Brooklyn widow who just wants to be liked and needed by others.  Her dream is to be a contestant on a television game show.  This will enable her friends and the rest of America to see her in her best red dress--that fit her 50 pounds ago-- and to like her.  Burstyn perfectly captures the naivety inherent in Sara's dream, and the desperation she later experiences in her realization of its elusiveness and ultimate loss after she loses her grip on sanity from taking too many diet pills.<br/><br/>Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans turn in excellent, gut-wrenching performances as heroin addicts.  Their stories also depict dreams which turn into nightmares, as the unforeseen consequences of addiction (or obsession, to the exclusion of a well-balanced and more sober approach to life--take your pick) snatch attainment of their dreams from their grasps.  Sean Gullette, who portrayed the protagonist in Pi, reappears as a low-life shrink.  Keith David, perhaps best known as Mary's stepdad in There's Something About Mary (""Son, is it the frank or the beans?""), does a great job with his small role as Big Tim, and Christopher McDonald, usually a great movie foil, is spot-on as Tappy, the Tony Robbinsesque smarmy TV host.  Louise Lasser and Dylan Baker also appear briefly.<br/><br/>
Several of the reviews here have expressed that this movie is about the horrors of drug abuse and addiction.  Well, perhaps on the surface this is true, but not really.  The broader message, and one which is much more depressing, is that real life has a way of killing our dreams, whatever they may be.  Few of us actually attain everything we hope and dream of.  Few of us live as the idealized versions of ourselves that we aspire to be.  The reality under the surface is often fraught with ugly habits, dirty little secrets, scandals, disappointments, failures, and just plain old banalities. Hence, the title--Requiem for a Dream.<br/><br/>The running gag of the film--the Tappy Tibbons infomercial game show Sara watches incessantly and dreams of appearing on--is the analog of the promise of the dream life.  Here is everything you want and can have.  Just send $39.95 to the P.O. Box and cut out red meat, refined sugar, and whatever #3 was.  What actually happens to each of the four principal characters--that they spiral into their own individual tragedies--however, is analogous to real life.  It's not pretty.  Each of us lives with disappointment and despair from time to time.  Each of us is going to die.<br/><br/>This is very heavy stuff.  Not recommended as a date movie or for anyone with a terminally sunny disposition and simple approach to life.<br/><br/>9.5 out of 10."

It's not a movie for those who expect wonderfully happy endings, as Hollywood so endlessly gives us; it in fact, is one of the best portrayals of drug usage I have ever seen.  Requiem is one of those movies that you only really understand, if you have been through it yourself.

This is one depressing movie even in the middle of the film I was crying. Enough of that though.  Let's talk about why this movie was so sad. First off, you have your average four city citizens.  Your average mom, very nice and challenged with raising her son without a father and when some show calls and says she's won the right to be on TV, she takes pills to help her diet. her son who has a beutiful girlfriend he loves very much.  His girlfriend who, in order to get money, has to dress up, with makeup and clothes ect., and er, hem persuade them (what happens in her story near the end is insanely sad in fact, it's the saddest part of the film).  Then his friend who is black.  His friend, Tyrone, gets deep in the drug selling market.  He's getting deeper and deeper into it to the point where the only way out is to go to jail.

","I saw this movie late at night on one of the movie channels that my cable company provides. I was intrigued by the cast, especially since I had just seen Jennifer Connelly's Academy Award winning performance in A Beautiful Mind a few weeks previous. I found the characters to be flawed but sympathetic, and the downward spiral that each of them takes into the world of drug addiction is seamlessly and believably portrayed. In fact, I found myself wishing at the end of the movie that I had not come to feel anything for any of them, because the climax of the film is so powerfully disturbing, I actually felt sick. I could not seem to look away from the horror of each of them unflinchingly viewed at the lowest point to which they individually may have sunk, in a directorial and editing extreme that goes beyond any other film I have seen in my life.<br/><br/>Brace yourself and view it alone, for the grave despair this film will leave you with will cause you to be unfit company for hours, if not days.

I sat through all the credits before I could actually stand up. I've seen it again since on DVD, and the power of the film was still there. Sure, it's a bit much in the end, with the scenes getting more and more gruesome, with the dramatic (brilliant!) music getting faster and faster. But it worked for me, Aronofsky, as you will, 'got away with it'. Great acting as well, Burstyn definately deserved a Academy Award (Julia Roberts... yuck!). And oh do I love split screens! So, basicly, my number 8 film: 10/10"
"taikman","7","0","1","8 September 2002"," A powerful but overwrought drama that would have been better for more subtlety and less camera tricks.
","'Requiem' is one of the most overrated movies here on IMDB. To be sure it is an intense, often gripping and very well acted film. Ellyn Burstyn was unlucky not to get best actress for her harrowing role. However the film is badly directed: there are far too many camera tricks used and it feels like an exhibition of 'things I film school'. If it was just when the characters are tripping out on drugs, then the distorted camera views and use of fast-forward, slo-mo and fast editing of images would be effective. But when such things are overused, as they are here, they distance the viewer from the reality that the movie is trying to portray. They come across as showy rather than brilliant and break your suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Another thing that is rather hard to swallow is the casting of the young drug addicts: they are just a bit too good looking. Jennifer Connelly in particular is so angelically beautiful it is hard to imagine her as a drug user. She is a talented actress but, as in 'A Beautiful Mind' I think they should have cast someone who looked a little more average, who showed more of the wear and tear of life on her face. <br/><br/>The movie also thinks that it is smarter than it is - but it lacks the wit or gritty realism of 'Trainspotting' and basically all it has to say is that drugs are bad. It does do a powerful job of showing just how badly they can screw up your life, but really anyone with a brain knows that already.<br/><br/>
'Requiem for a Dream' is very good, but it seems a little simplistic and loud when compared to truly great (and, significantly, non-American) films like 'Once Were Warriors' or 'Trainspotting' that also deal with drugs and domestic hells.<br/><br/>7/10"

","An amazing film that follows four souls into the horrible depths of addiction and it's consequences. Darren Aranofsky has done a wonderful job of transferring Hubert Selby Jr's amazing novel to the screen (if you like this movie do yourself a favor and read the book.) Aranofsky beautifully transfers Selby's characters and makes the viewer sympathize and feel even for characters who have no redeeming qualities.<br/><br/> All of the performances are absolutely first rate. Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans are completely convincing as out of control addicts. Ellen Burstyn is simply amazing as the lonely mother who trades one addiction (food and TV) for one much more terrible, her performance is mesmerizing and haunting.<br/><br/>This film is hard to watch; it's painful, it's gutwrenching, it's horrible and it is also beautifully perfect in every way.

","If you want to see a happy vision of heroine addiction watch something else, hell even the glum trainspotting pails in comparison to this movie.  Requiem for a Dream is about hope going away for four people due to drug addiction. The amazing thing about this film is that it shows the charecters highs as well as their lows.  You see the Euphoria and then you see the horror.  The performances are top rate especially Ellen Burstyn as the doomed Sarah GoldFarve.  Burstyn is fantastic and should have won the Oscar. I have not seen a more sad or haunting performance in years.  Jared Leto is terrific as Burstyn's never do well Heroine addict son Harry.  He gives the charecter a nuisance and a guiniune desire to do good though his life has gone bad. Marlon Wayans is shockingly good as Tai, he shocks us with the depth of what is an unheralded and overlooked performance. Jennifer Connolly is great too, she is the one that is placed in the most degrading and embarrassing situations of the four junkies and her performance is a revelation.  Requiem for a Dream is a spectacular nightmare of addiction, it is a horror show and it is a great one. This is the best movie I have seen in the last 5 years, this one is a mind blower.  The hardiest men will be tears by the end of this one. At the end of this movie your stomach will be in knots your heart will be broken, and you will want to watch this movie over again cause it affected you so deeply.

It's become obvious that few, if any great stories will ever make it past studio executives, famous for siding with the likes of Jon Peters, and John McTiernan(' Carter of Vagina"" anyone?) against truly creative souls. Thus we lovers of film must count ourselves lucky that such a stirring piece should be made available for our consumption. I won't try to dispassionately pick it apart for the benefit of readers.

","What this movie has to say about drug addiction may not be original, but it more than makes up for that with the sheer vividness and emotional force with which it delivers its message. <br/><br/>Among other achievements, Aronofsky does a great job of reimagining daytime TV as hell (though admittedly it's not much of a stretch) and fictional TV personality Tappy Tibbons as the prince of darkness. He is aided and abetted in the realization of his vision by cinematographer Matthew Libatique. The soundtrack by Clint Mansell is also extraordinary.<br/><br/>The key to the film's impact is that it gets you to care about its characters before it puts them through hell. Ellen Burstyn totally disappears into her role; she was robbed of an Oscar for her fearlessly real performance, the best one by any actor in 2000. Just watch her do her speech to her son mid-way through about the things that give meaning to her life, and try to prevent your heart from breaking. A wrenching and haunting nightmare."

","Harry Knowles from ""Ain't it cool news"" describes this movie perfectly...<br/><br/>REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is filmmaking at its height.<br/><br/>I can say I loved it.  I can say I liked it.  And I can say it was powerfully dramatic and assuredly brilliant.  I am also of the firm belief that if I see a better film this year I will be ecstatic beyond all belief, because as of right now.... I'm shakingly jubilant at having woke up at the ass-crack of dawn to see a movie in a theater with STEREO and postage stamp screens.<br/><br/>This film should be REQUIRED VIEWING by every friggin High School kid in the country.  It should be unleashed upon them.  Will it disturb them?  Will it shake their fragile little minds?  Will it possibly make a lifestyle change for them? Oh God YES. YES YES YES.<br/><br/>This movie is brutal... brutal in the most aggressively harsh reality moments we have in society.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has made a film that makes use of everything that Tarantino, Paul Thomas Anderson, Danny Boyle, Stephen Soderbergh, David Fincher and Tom Tykwer have used to redefine 'cool' cinema... Every pulse skip.... split screen.... frame shake.... tracking perspectives....fisheye worldviews... trippy music... grand dialogue... And he's gone and made a hardcore John Schlesinger MIDNIGHT COWBOY meets Martin Scorsese TAXI DRIVER world.  This is cool meeting HARSH REALITY.<br/><br/>The movie lulls you into thinking... ""Oh yeah baby... light me up one of them... prep the needle hon... hand me the blue one... yeeeaaaaaahhhhh"" And well, I don't want to get specific, but... yeah, it gets rough.<br/><br/>Are you happy with where the characters are at the end... NO.... should it be different... NO.<br/><br/>This film has an absolute moral center.  And I know for a fact that I'll see this film at least 10 times before the end of the year... I'll see it repeatedly because it is just BRILLIANT filmmaking.  This is that painting in that museum that you look into and wonder how and why the artist decided to use those brush strokes and that shade and you marvel that you get to look at it.  This is there for you to examine and take with you.<br/><br/>IT is powerful POWERFUL filmmaking.<br/><br/>Now, what is it?<br/><br/>The film is centered around 4 characters played by Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn.<br/><br/>I'll start with Ellen Burstyn.  BEST ACTRESS GOES TO... Ellen Burstyn... I can not imagine a better performance.  I say this because quite honestly...Ellen Burstyn's Sara Goldfarb in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is one of the GREAT acting performances in history.  This is right there with Bette Davis' Baby Jane Hudson from WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE.... Elizabeth Taylor's Martha from WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF... In other words this isn't just an award winning performance.... but the type of performance by which others forever judge performances.<br/><br/>Her character begins as your grandmother.... your mother... Your father or grandfather has died.  And she is, for all intents and purposes... ALONE in this world.  She has her little knitting circle and she has her game shows. But she isn't special to anyone, she isn't particularly bright... She has a big heart and no one to share it with.... the heart is cracked, and her life is ending a bit each day in the coma of retirement.<br/><br/>She gets a call one day.  They want her to be on tv.  They want her to be on the show.  She's all excited.  Thrilled.  Something is happening to her. She goes to her closet and pulls out her red dress... the one she wore at (Jared Leto) Harry's graduation.  She doesn't see him much, only when he drops by to steal her tv to pawn for smack.  She puts the dress on, but it won't zip up.  She's too fat for it.  Some friends recommend various diets... She settles on the pills...<br/><br/>Now... that takes you about 30 minutes into the film with this character... My God.. the changes.  Physical, emotional, mental... When her teeth begin to gnash and grind the chatter... when the refrigerator... well... when you see her on speed, dragging back down, speeding back up... the popping popping popping... It's brutal.  The delusion, the manic hysteria... ""I'm gonna be on tv in my red dress..."" shivers..<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn.... consider yourself hugged.  My god, BRAVO.  Standing ovation.  Tears out of the corners of my eyes and I whistle and clap till my hands hurt.  My lady, you are a national treasure.  Bless you.<br/><br/>This role and this performance will live in your memory.<br/><br/>Next, I'll talk about Jared Let's Harry Goldfarb.  This isn't the Sam Jackson junkie son from JUNGLE FEVER... this is the white boy delusional soho junkie.  Harry is basically a good person.  He was your basic All-American goodlooking kid.  Somewhere along the way, it went bad.  He has the beautiful girlfriend, Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), and the best friend, Tyrone C Love (Marlon Wayans).  He's supposed to be our 'Rent-Boy' or our 'Drugstore Cowboy', but Aronofsky applies a keen sense of Sir Isaac Newton's That which goes up, must come down... to his character... and he never ever glamorizes down.  It's brutal...<br/><br/>Marlon Wayan's Tyrone C Love... he's our cool connection man... the pal with the line to the s***.  He's playing the best friend with drug connections. His character has the least screentime of the 4 I've detailed, but ya know what... he's real good.  He doesn't ham it up, he plays it right on.  A strong supporting role.<br/><br/>And then, Jennifer Connelly's Marion Silver... The most beautiful woman in film... just... oh man it's rough... After watching her in this film... I tell ya.  There's just no way you can call a hooker or a stripper or go to a club that has those.  I mean, physically you'll be able to, but when you look at the girls... you'll think of this story... of Jennifer Connelly. I really really hope that she pulls out a supporting nom for this character. She's our Jodie Foster/TAXI DRIVER character except... she's our friend... and she's let down.<br/><br/>By the time you get all the way through this film... you'll be out of breath.<br/><br/>It is a towering film.  A masterwork.  Significant.  Entertaining. Enthralling.  Poignant.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has just officially become a great filmmaker.<br/><br/>Harry Knowles, ""Ain't it cool news"""

","As a connisseur of heroin literature and film, I found Requiem to be an explosive telling of a story oft repeated: addiction & loss. From Drugstore Cowboy, Rush, Trainspotting, Naked Lunch & Junkie, the story is generally the same - vulnerable folks get pulled in by the most addictive drug known to man: heroin. But Requiem does more, goes further, and drives the viewer into the depths of the spiral unlike any film before. I found the last ten minutes of the film to be gut-wrenchingly painful as each character reached the nadir of their existence. Aronofsky's achievement with his filmmaking and the actors' achievement with their performances is truly amazing."

I loved the fridge scene when Ellen Burstyn gets psychotic and has hallucinations. The only problem I had was the depiction of ECT (electroconvulsive therapy)= brain shock at the end of the movie that was done with the patient fully awake and alert.

This is NOT a film for everyone to watch or even understand. I know guys who used to smoke a bowl when this movie was on. I know guys who swore off drugs forever after seeing this movie, but SPOILERS AHEAD im going to describe why - love it or hate it (and you must choose one) - I love the film for it's visual eccentricities, plot intricacies that others have pointed out as flaws or holes, and a cast that delivers the best performance to be robbed of an Oscar since they FORGOT to hand Denzel Washington his statuete for Malcolm X (yo D, the one for Training Day is that cool? Cause a BAD cop must be harder to play than a great civil rights leader, right?) THe film uses a visual style the director refers to as ""Visual Hip Hop"" in some interviews, during each characters asencion in the belly of the beast of addiction. Each character succumbs to his disease and each character is more a type than a character YES but it's important that it it this way as to show the hand on the moralistic end of things - or shown by the fact that Marlon Wayans (TYRONNE) calls Harry (Jared Leto) JIM through out the ENTIRE FRICKIN Movie! His best friend calls him Jim? Is this a gaffee? Or course not, Tyronne represents ""african american males in society"" and Harry represents ""caucasians"" and this is supposed to show that black male, white male, rich white girl (Jennifer Connolly), or elderly widow (Ellen Burstyn), we're all succeptable to the disease of anything that allows us to create a constant escape for ourselves from our lives. Ellen Burstyn plays Harry's Mom, a widower who is obsessed with the television game shows. Upon hearing she's going to be a contestant, she tries to put on a dress that she wore during Harry's graduation from High School, before her husband died. Well, look at her now - the dress doesn't fit, and her son takes her TV set to buy smack for himself and Tyronne (Marlon wayans, who proves when he ditches his brothers, he'll be able to truly make a name for himself as a dramatic actor in hollywood), and when she finds she can't escape the fridge (her comfort for all of her pain and loneliness) she seeks diet pills and becomes a full blown addict. THe spiral is amazing. THis woman is holding on to the fact that her friends worship her now and she will one day be on tv (not knowing it's a scam), but she makes you understand why she is where she is. Part of it is her son, Jared Leto, Harry and his born rich but cast off aspiring art designer girlfriend (every teenage girl with a dream and unsupportive parents - abused to be an artist) are selling lots of drugs to finance her studio and have dragged their friend Tyronne into it. THings take an even greater turn for the worse when the streets become dry following a turf war, they can't buy or sell anymore, and Marion (Connelly) must all but prostitute herself for their fixes. Then, following an orange filled homage to the Godfather, Tyronne and Harry head down South to cop weight, but Marion sleeps with a Pimp daddy (Keith David) who also sends her to a party for more of her fix. If you sit through this scene, you will never be able to step foot in a strip club again without wanting to run up to the girl, cover her up and give her a huge hug! I know, this movie is CRAZY right. Well, it's incredibly moving. The characters are played with such convinction but there's enough there to let you believe this could actually be you in a similar or not so similiar situation if you let things control your opinion of yourself, and you let outside things run your life (as anyone who is an addict or knows anything about addiction knows that thats what an addiciton does).              This film is brutal. It's honest and raw filmmaking at its best. The sex is exploitative like Larry Clark did with Bully or Kids (both films where the exploitative sex was necessary but still two steps shy of an R Kelly video), but it's completely brutal and necessary to the film. Marion vomits after sleeping with a man - the shrink she's been chucked off to see by her wealthy non-existent parents who's been molesting her for years - and yet returns to sleep with other men and engage in one of the most humilating scenes caught on film - the last twenty minutes are spellboundingly gutwrenchingly difficult to stomach, but amazing filmmaking - FOR THE FIX. FOR THE FIX. FOR THE FIX. THey captured it all. And while I LOVE Julia ROberts, wearing a push up bra in no way comes close to what Ellen Burstyn a former hollywood ""LADY"" went through for this film - she deserved that OSCAR HANDS Down. (JULIA SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN HERS FOR PRETTY WOMAN!! -ah OScar politics, dont get me started). So I implore you to take the time and show Hollywood we want more filmmaking with something behind it, a reason, a story, a deeper level and less movies starring PAUL WALKER and any sort of imported souped-up ASIAN SEDAN that drives real fast. Okay?<br/><br/>anyways, 10/10"

","Few movies in my life have I watched and then sat and just thought about it. Not just wheather or not I liked it, but thought about what i have just seen. I don't think this that kind of movie you can say you liked or didn't. There was nothing in it too like. Though it was an amazing film. I thought it might be another glorified movie about the drug world. I myself live in the world of heroin and weed. I watched it with my friends who have exsperienced drugs, and was astonished by each of their reactions. This film is more than for entertainment, and it's not even a anti drug film. It's just so out there, it forces it's self on you with its haunting music and very intresting camera work to feel so...overwhelmed. I like that though. There is never a point when I think ok, this is where everyone should laugh or cry, or turn away. It really let everyone take it thier own way, I cherish when I film can do that. The film literly brought me and the boys around me to tears. My one friend said it was the scarriest movie he had ever seen, and it is scary. I actually have seen many of times, and can say, everytime I watch it it still haunts me. Maybe bacause I have seen people's lives fall apart becaue of drug abuse, loneliness, and just nieve stupidity. I was very intrested by the fact it portrayed addiction in pill form. Few movies really get into how easily and intense pill popping can be. An Ellen was fabulous. She looked like s**t. The fat pack was kind of obvious, but a very well done performance. You really feel for her, and her  stupidity. You want her to be on tv, but scream at her  for being so nieve. Lonliness will bring people to their ends. As seen, Lonnliness is defintly more than an emotion, it is a chemical embalence that will cause you to do things you would never do. Im glad it ended, not with a dramtic death to all the characters but more a much more realist ending. In life the truth is few die, but most never recover. This is defintly something you should see. Not to see a movie to brag about, or to sit and discuse with freinds. But just to see. I can promise weather you like it or not, you will never forget the images, or the wonderful score. As with each film Darren makes, I am left with questions, that I like not being answered."
"nmp381","9","0","1","1 July 2002"," Severe and meaningful
","Requiem for a Dream revolves around four New Yorkers, who each get trapped in despair and horrifying drug addictions. Each have their own twisted logic behind their addictions, and must be seen to believed. The plot in itself is simple, but what makes this film so brilliant is the superb/realistic character depth, strong script, innovative score, impressive camera angles, and direction. Burstyn is amazing, and takes her character from shy/lonely person to speed addict obsessed with a TV show to new heights. Looking back she definitely deserved the Oscar for that year. The rest of the cast is solid-excellent. Each character wants to live some type of decent life, but the drugs keep pulling them back. The last 15 minutes of the movie, showing the demise of each character accompanied with the haunting soundtrack could be an example of some of the best film making ever.<br/><br/>9/10. Graphic drug use, violence, strong sexual situations, nudity, strong language."
"hernan_amado","Null","0","1","29 June 2002"," The most impressive and painfully realistic movie I've ever seen!
","""Requiem for a dream"" has certainly been the most unexpected and impressive movie I've seen. It left me speechless; I never thought there would be such a movie like this one related to drugs and stuff like that. Probably many movies tell about drugs and their hazardousness; however this movie doesn't only tell about them, it also shows them in a way that I really can't describe because the shots were quick and breathtaking; nevertheless, I consider the quick shots quite unnecessary since it only disturbs the viewer and make the viewer think they're subliminal messages. Those shots also seem to hypnotize the viewers and make them intrigued how the characters will end. <br/><br/>The portrayal of Sarah by Ellen Burstyn is completely believable that you would think it's actually happening, her facial expressions and the way she convulsed were impressive. <br/><br/>I'm glad my sister and I learned that those pills that are supposedly good and make people thin and stronger are extremely evil and can drive you insane as we saw in this flick. I'm sure it's the most challenging and amazing performance that Ellen Burstyn has given. It was even better than the one she gave in 1973's the exorcist (The second impressive movie I've seen). <br/><br/>I didn't find Jared Leto's and Jeniffer Conelly's performances that convincing because it seemed to me they overacted. It really looked like they were both led by the director to scare the viewers instead of making them know how hazardous drugs are. <br/><br/>This movie has really impressed me enormously, something that many movies don't do to me often. It shows sadly what many drug addicts go through. It was a very realistic movie; sometimes we don't know anything about drug addicts and live in a fairy tale without realizing that there are horrible and painful times for others who do drugs. That was the message that the ending left me, which my sister and I considered necessary for our life.<br/><br/>
This movie must be a tool to be closer to God and thank him for all the things we have and also to protect people from drugs. 7/10"
"tripper0","9","0","1","29 June 2002"," brutal....
","I know no other way to describe this film than brutal.  That doesn't mean that its bad.  In fact it is an excellent film.  It is not for the casual viewer though, and it certainly isn't Friday night popcorn fair. If thats what you want or expect, then leave it.  But if you can take it, its a very worth while watch.<br/><br/>The film does start rather slowly.  It put me to sleep the first time I watched it.  But in the spirit of always finishing what I watch, I gave it a second chance.  Good thing.  Early in the movie, about the first half or so, there is some excellent editing.  It was excellent, but at the same time it was over used, and thankfully was almost completely left alone in the second half of the movie.  The image of the dilated pupil is a very common and strong one in the film.  I do feel, however, that some of the camera work did take away from the humanity a bit.  At times it was brilliant in that it disoriented the viewer and put us in the characters place, but at certain times I feel it was a little out of place.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent, and extremely brave.  Burstyn, as mentioned many times before, is great.  The big surprise is Marlon Wayans.  Yes, he plays a drug addict again, but for once it wasn't in a spoof, and it wasn't for laughs.  It was nice to see the change from him.  Connelly is always good, so there's really nothing you need to say about her performance that wasn't expected anyway.<br/><br/>The one thing I usually don't mention in a film is the score.  I'm usually indifferent to it.  In this film, however, the score was not only brilliant, but it was used to perfection and captured the tone of the movie.  It was necessary, and really heightened the downward spiral of all the characters.<br/><br/>Speaking of the downward spiral, I feel this film captured that really well. The beginning is slow, but with the characters lives beginning to spiral out of control, the pace gets quicker, much quicker.  The second half of the film is very fast and dark, and you can't take your eyes off of it.  I'm not sure if the pacing was deliberate, but if it was then it was executed to perfection.<br/><br/>To sum up, this film isn't an easy watch, but its a good one.  The direction and editing are good, the acting is top notch, and the story isn't at all forgiving.  I'm thankful that it never took the easy way out, and thats what makes it memorable.  9 out of 10."
"whiteadi","10","0","1","26 June 2002"," what a title
","It has been a while since I have seen such a beautiful movie. I know that maybe I can not comment it like a professional but I can say couple thinks. What impressed me was, as I usually think is the case for great films, the truth of the ideas shown and the great manner in witch was presented. When you see such a movie you say: when we going to learn to ... and here you can put a lot of stuff: simple to live life and not to be greedy or not to desire too much. Some tragic situation that if you think about it you can discover around you that happens to many people on and on. In this movie I think you can see that this is it, maybe this is the human nature, bad luck .. What can be done? Who knows?<br/><br/>The characters are very strong and by that I mean you cannot simple not to care about them, not to have a strong opinion about everybody, even about that god dam doctor. I will not give any opinion about every actor; you will find that for sure in other comments.<br/><br/>Anyway, I strongly recommend the movie, even only for what Greeks said that can be he effect of a tragedy: catharsis."
"Decinian","9","0","1","23 June 2002"," A wonderful masterpeice that'll shock you...
","This is one of the best movies ive ever seen and my personal favorite. Afronsky does a terrific job transforming the book into this classic movie. Afronsky's directing style is probally one of the things which makes this movie interesting and great. The acting is superb by everyone especially Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burnstyn. And i must say i was completley shocked by Marlon Wayans performance ( i didnt think he could act for beans , kind of like my spelling .) From the moment this movie begins to the very end you will be enticed and shocked by it. If you wish to see this movie i strongly recomend the directors cut, the edited version just doesnt show how horrible the scenes are and the extremities people will go to to acheive thier dream (thus the title). Now if your one of those people who think that this is one of those antidrugs movies only put out by the Gov. to try and convince you not to smoke drugs you are wrong. This movie really is a study of raw human emotion and compassion, though the drugs are the downfall of the people the intwined message is not ""say no to drugs"". This movie is simple a story of the people who try so hard to reach thier dream and fail. However i do not recomend this movie to children or conservative people. This movie contains violence, drug content, nudity, strong sexual content, adult lanuage, adult content ( basically everything ). I would also like to urge many people to watch this movie itll make you really think and reflect about you life. It made me cry the first time i saw it and think about everything i had done (no i didnt used to be a drugdealer, im only 15 , bet you didnt expect that). A great combination of writing, directing, and acting makes this a movie which will remain classic and my favorite for many years to come.<br/><br/>""Mary!?""

"iskander28","10","0","1","18 June 2002"," The Best film of 2000
","This film made me violently uncomfortable.  In that I am in agreement with nearly every other review of this film on imdb.<br/><br/>I was not uncomfortable though with what I saw.  I was uncomfortable with what I felt.  I left the theatre asking myself why I was so shaken.<br/><br/>Any film can make you feel.  It's in the nature of film to make you feel - sympathy for a character, afraid for a character, afraid of a character...<br/><br/>This film forced me not only to feel, but also to confront why I was feeling sympathy, fear, discomfort...<br/><br/>I left the theater questioning the nature of addiction, the nature of the media in the lives of everyday people, the fragile way that we relate to other people, and the difference between the dirty addiction of street drugs and the clean addiction that has swept our country - the use of drugs with psychotropic side-effects prescribed by doctors with no psychological background.<br/><br/>Please do not be absurd and say that every 15 year old child should see this film.  It is like saying that every mother with an infant should see 'A Cry in the Dark' so that their baby does not get eaten by dingoes.<br/><br/>
The director daringly use of several techniques (e.g. the much derided split screen) is effective and well utilized in the film and along with excellent performances by the actors and an utterly masterful use of music make this the most remarkable film of 2000."
"davidrams","10","0","1","15 June 2002"," Unbelievable
","Wow! I think this is the best word to describe this movie. This movie was amazing. I mean I've seen a lot movies before but this was the best. The acting was unbelievable Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly and last but not least Marlon Wayans (who surprised me most of them) deserve all the Academy Award. The script was great, also the superb directing. The cinematography was awesome and perhaps the best I've seen in years. Also the hunting score is one of the best I've ever heard. But attention: This movie is not for everyone. It's really sad and depressing. After I watched this movie I was sitting in front of my TV couldn't say a word and felt really, really bad. I thought I have to cry but I couldn't. Hours later I was still thinking about this masterpiece of film making. One of the best movies of all time 10/10"
"Hanover","Null","0","1","16 June 2002"," Hallucinatory and Unforgettable
","My partner and I had watched this knowing it was going to be depressing. However, I didn't realize just how much of a ""trip"" that the director was going to put us through as well as the characters who were taking the drugs.<br/><br/>This is a film I loved because it stuck with me for days afterwards.  The people who don't find any sympathy for the characters don't really understand what this film is about.  Each of these characters had dreams, just like us.  They really thought they had the way to achieve those dreams. Sadly, they had no one in their lives to tell them otherwise except those who were being hypocritical.<br/><br/>The heart-wrenching conversation where the son learns that his mother is on uppers and tries to convince her to quit is so sad.  The junkie learning that his mother is on the same road and powerless to do anything about it.<br/><br/>I think the parts that really stuck in my mind are when the director seems to be accurately letting you feel what a drug trip feels like.  Like when the mother suddenly sees her entire livingroom as a TV Show and the entire cast, crew and audience starts laughing at her.  It was a hallucination that felt real..the kind you might have if you had a high fever. <br/><br/>
In the end, I felt mom was a victim of the media..this idea that we all must be slim as a pretzel stick to be beautiful.<br/><br/>Just like the son and his friends fell victim of how you need to have money to be successful. <br/><br/>But when it all comes down to it, all these characters really needed was the love they had for each other.  It's a movie of people who run at each other with open arms and constantly miss with disasterous results.<br/><br/>As much as I liked this film, it's definitely on my ""watch once, never again"" list with such films as Happiness and In the Bedroom."
"djrein","9","0","1","15 June 2002"," Truly Great Art
","Everyone watches movies for different reasons. Some are simply looking to be entertained, which usually means their idea of a good movie is a movie that only contains enough of the bad part of life in order for the characters to overcome in the end. Many good films have been made that deal with a character overcoming problems to triumph in the end. For us that want something deeper, this is a great movie. I have read reviews of this film that claim it is overrated because it is simply a story about weak people or losers reaping what they sowed. That is not the point. What makes this movie great, one of many things, is that it describes very effectively how people go down the wrong path. This movie is maybe the best film i have ever seen in terms of portraying real human beings. It is pure hell, and that is exactly what the characters were experiencing. I can understand why many did not enjoy the movie, but it is a shame how many people, according to their commments, did not have sympathy for the characters. This is not one of my favorite movies, but i recognize great art when i see it. It not only is a four-star film, but one of the truly groundbreaking movies of its kind. I only wish everyone understood it. Why then is it not one of my favorite movies? Because all of my favorite films make me feel happy, joyful, and inspired. However, this movie touched me in a different way, but touched me in a way that is equally positive, in that we should never underestimate our vulnerability. That is something no one wants to truly face. This movie is not for those who, as Jack Nicholson said, ""can't handle the truth!! """

","A visually stunning film, and at times, I caught myself holding my breath without even realizing it.<br/><br/>Following the destruction of four people, Harry (Jared Leto), his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connolly), and his best friend Ty (Marlon Wayans), ""Requiem"" conveys the downward spirals through the mise-en-scene, the scored soundtrack, fast-paced editing, and storyline parallels.<br/><br/>You don't have to take any drugs to find this movie amazing.  Actually, if you do take anything, the movie will make you want to stop.  I can't think of another film that shows the downfalls of drug addictions so frankly and honestly as ""Requiem.""<br/><br/>The third act climax is a non-stop, rushing ride, that comes to a crashing halt, and I found myself crying and gasping for air.  All four of the main actors are amazing, most of all Burstyn, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her role.<br/><br/>See it.  And if you've already seen it, see it again.  It gets better every time..."
"Blacknredd","7","0","1","9 June 2002"," I really hate these kinds of movies
","I have to say, I really hate movies like Requiem For A Dream.<br/><br/> From a technical standpoint, Requiem is an excellent movie.  Based off the Selby novel from the late 70's, Requiem follows the lives of four drug addicted New Yorkers.<br/><br/> Ellen Burstyn plays Sarah Goldfarb, a lonely widow who spends most of her time watching infomercials and longing for her deceased husband.  After she receives a phone call notifying her that she is in the running to appear on T.V., Sarah becomes ecstatic.  She gets her hair done, and pulls out her favorite red dress to wear to the show.  Sarah finds however, that she can no longer fit in her dress.  After a failed diet, a quack doctor prescribes her ""uppers"" which, though effective for weight-loss, ultimately drive her insane.  Her son, played by Jared Leto is a heroine addict who also deals with his buddy, played by Marlon Waynes.  Leto's girlfriend Mary, played by Jennifer Connelly is also addicted, and dreams to one day open a clothing store.<br/><br/>As  I said, technically this film is excellent.  The cinematography, along with the soundtrack and acting all complement each other.  It's just the horribly depressing plot which keeps this movie from being one of my favorites.  There is no comic relief, and the characters keep falling deeper and deeper.<br/><br/> Watch it once, and see.  Maybe you can handle it better than I.<br/><br/> (7/10)"

Sorry I can't sympathize with them as their lives go down the crapper. I know the artsy fartsy community loves these kind of dramatic message flicks,but that doesn't make them good or even entertaining for that matter. If you really feel the need to watch this movie keep the drugs and sharp objects away from you. Most of all don't watch this in a bad or depressed mood becuase you're likely to kill yourself.

","""Requiem for a Dream (2000)"" is, in my opinion, the best movie made in the last several years. Someone said that you don't watch the movie - you experience it. I totally agree. It's a difficult movie to take. It deals with drugs and puts it in your face without any mercy (somebody described it as being smacked on the head for 100 minutes). It follows the stories of 4 different people, each escaping reality and getting deteriorated by his own addictions: To drugs, to pills, to alcohol, to TV, to his dreams of a better life. I haven't seen in years such an amazing and effective combination of acting, photography, editing, lighting, music, writing, makeup and costume design. This movie is ""perfect"" in each of these fields. The entire cast is fantastic, but Ellen Burstyn is extraordinary, giving the performance of her life. It's unbelievable that Julia Roberts got the Oscar instead, that year. <br/><br/>This movie, made for $4.5m, is only Darren Aronofsky's second  feature (after the fantastic Pi). He handles it like its his 20th on a budget of $45m. It didn't take him long to become one of my favorite directors, and I can't wait for his next movie.  <br/><br/>Don't forget to check out the fantastic official site for a taste of the movie.

Darren Aronofsky said himself that this movie is not really about drugs, but ""about love. More importantly, what happens when love goes wrong."" You can plainly see that the characters truly love one another; it's pretty much all they have. Their various addictions - mostly substance addictions - are chronicled not merely as a sign of weakness, but a comparison to their hopes and dreams. And I'm quite certain that's the way Hubert Selby, Jr., intended it to be when he wrote the book nearly 24 years ago.<br/><br/>Sara dreams about being on television; her addiction to diet pills and obsession over the red dress emphasizes that.<br/><br/>Harry, Marion, and Tyrone all dream about being successful; their addiction to cocaine, herion, etc, all reflect on that, and how they let their dreams overtake their conscience.<br/><br/>The film itself is excellent. Definately one of the most amazing movies I've seen in quite some time. The cinematography is also great, and the performances by Burstyn, Leto, Connelly, and Wayans are all first-rate. But, my favorite part of the movie is its score. The soundtrack during the film is almost haunting.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this movie is definately worth watching. If it leaves you speechless by the end of it...then Aronofsky has done his job. And if it leaves you with questions unanswered, here's one simple answer:<br/><br/>""Because we choose to live the dream instead of living the life.""<br/><br/>****/****(four out of four stars)"

","Usually, having seen a great film will leave me shaking. It's funny I know, but this is the case. I shook after I saw Traffic, Cast Away, and Memento, just to name a few recent films. I don't know why exactly I shake, it's an uncontrollable reaction to something so moving that it can't be expressed through words. Well, it's not always as deep as that, but with Requiem for a Dream, my shaking turned to complete abandonment. This film is relentlessly unforgiving, letting what you see before you on screen feed on every last emotion you have within, and allows you to feel what the characters feel. This is the most powerful film ever made about the affects of drug addiction. The film is based on a book by the same name, in which four characters, whom for there own reasons, become addicted to drugs. There's the old Jewish woman, played all to real by Ellen Burstyn, her son (Leto), his girlfriend (Connely), and his best friend (Wayans).<br/><br/>It starts harmless enough, these are all everyday characters we have seen before in some way or another, the old lonely mother watching t.v. and gossiping with neighbors. The young couple in love, and the best buddies trying to score some dope. But I can promise you, never have you seen the consequences these characters face at the end. I know a few friends that have seen the movie, and they all, one way or the other, felt the loss of something inside. That may sound a little exaggerated, but then again you haven't seen the film. You will come out of that theater affected. This does not have a happy ending, be well warned. I have heard people speak about Requiem for a Dream, having hated it. The reason for this is exactly the reason why you should see it. They hate it because it stays with them long after the credits have passed. If you consider that a bad thing then this is probably a film you won't want to see. These are probably also the same people that loved the forgettable film, BLOW (see review). I hated how I felt once the film was over. I hated what those characters went through, and believe me, you wish through out the whole movie that they would make different choices. This is a great film, it's important, it's real, and it's probably the best work no ones seen."

","I found the artistic elements of this film impressive.  The acting was terrific--two elements that are often underdeveloped.  My complaint is simple, and I expect I am in the minority: I want art to inspire; in the classical sense, I want art to put a spirit into me.  I want to experience a Muse whom I do not know.  Inspiration can, and often does, deal with horrific and troubling subject matter.  Having seen the The Basketball Diaries; Train Spotting; Traffic, etc.  Requiem for a Dream offers me very little beyond the appreciated art direction and acting already mentioned. 5 being a film that pleases, I give RFAD a 6/10."

","tastes differ, that's one thing that is quite sure.  but, once in a while, there is a movie which stands up and should be appreciated by ANY taste, nonetheless which this taste is.  Requiem for a dream is such a movie.<br/><br/>although the plot might not be very advanced (the movie handles the lives of 4 people who are affected by addictions and loneliness and are eventually totally bereft of their humanity), the rest of this movie is quite superb above many other movies.  First, the music.  Almost every 5 min, a scene is accompanied by a piece of music (by Clint Mansell and the Cronos Quartet) and NEVER is the music unappropiate.  In fact, the music is even that good, that it is actually worhtwhile to buy the soundtrack.  Second, the acting is genuine, never forced, always convincing.  Ellen Burstyn's acting scene, when she confesses to her son how lonely she is, is so touching, really unbelievable.  The direction, with beautiful, sliding shots, split screens and hallucinating takes of the downward spiral of the 4 main characters, gives you enough information on how shitty their lives are and simultaniously keeps you glued to the screen.  Shocked and intriged, not much films succeed in this.<br/><br/>As a reaction to a reviewer which stated that Trainspotting is better than this movie because T. shows the good signs and bad signs of drug use, you are completely wrong!!! T. is a buddy movie, where the subject of drugs is taken as a side story development (first, i really liked T. , but the purpose of this movie, unlike R., is not to shock its audience, but to amuse and along the way show what drugs can do). In R., the downward spiral after the addictions in general have kicked in.  Therefore, R. is most of the times a shocking film, but with also many beautiful scenes where the main characters try to keep their humanity, before totally collapsing (the scene where Jennifer Connely and Jared Leto at the end of the movie are talking to each other over the phone is truly moving!).<br/><br/>I think this is one of those movies which have to be seen. NO words can describe the true power of this motion picture.  For me, everything is perfect.  Even when i don't know, i think the coffee for the actors and filming crew was perfect.  as my title reads, i think this is the best movie of the 10 last years (yes, i have seen The Usual Suspects, American Beauty, Existenz,......).  Never has a movie succeeded in gripping me, changing me and fascinating me for many days after i have seen it.<br/><br/>Therefore : watch Aronofsky's further projects, this man is the future of ""Quality American Cinema""!!!"

I do, however, want to encourage everyone to see this film and judge it for yourself.  Most of the users criticizing the film in some manner seem to have a knack for grumbling about movies from time to time (just click on their username and read some of their reviews).  I can sympathize with many of the points made by harsh critics of the film, but argue that the movie doesn't match up with their personality, mood, or desires.  It has happened to me with many films.<br/><br/>This is a great movie, it will be compared for years to come.  Obviously, much of the movie is unoriginal by comparison to all of the raving over its originality.  Movies have been made for almost a hundred years!  Almost nothing is original anymore!

","Aside from Ellen Burstyn's brave performance, I found nothing original or striking about Aronofsky's drug epic.<br/><br/>  For months, I've read about how this movie will grab you by the throat, punch you in the gut, and pummel you with its depiction of drug hell.  I was all set for the ultimate visceral, heavy metal, hardcore, ultra NC-17 experience.<br/><br/>  Boy, what a letdown.  What is actually there isn't very groundbreaking. Nothing in Darren's movie hasn't been already shown vividly in movies like ""LESS THAN ZERO""  and the much, much, better film, ""TRAINSPOTTING.""<br/><br/>  Aronofsky does have some clever camera moves, and his rapid fire closeup images of getting high, accompanied by weird sound fx, are OK.....for about 5 minutes.  But then Darren's bag of cinematic tricks wears out its welcome, and things get repetitive..... very repetitive -<br/><br/> Yeah, I know, they're addicts and that's all they do, but the thing is, the piled-on images ultimately have an opposite effect.  Instead of immersing me deeper into the hell of addiction.....it actually distanced me - left me thinking how much this movie plays like an MTV video. So ""nightmarish"" scenes of attacking refrigerators, infected arms, electro shock therapy, and TV diet gurus have no impact or payoff.<br/><br/>   Finally, why was this movie rated NC-17???  Alot of R-rated movies are far more graphic."

What I'm trying to say is: ""Why does a movie like this constitute a good movie?""  I just don't get it.  In all honesty, it's not a very interesting story and rather boring.  It's sad to think that a story about people ruining their lives is what is needed to be a good movie.  It also truly saddens me that a movie like this would make it into the top 250 on this site.  This movie would be lucky to make into my top 1000 favorite movies.  I definitely wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see this movie unless you're dying to see it, or have nothing better to do.  Why do the actors in this film get such high praises about their acting?  I didn't see anything terribly great in their performances. Anyway, I'm not really sure how to review this film, I didn't think it was terrible, just boring and uninteresting.  Just because it's filmed in an odd way, doesn't make it an interesting movie.

","My roommate walked into the room as the end credits were rolling on 'Requiem for a dream' and asked ""was that movie good?"" .. I didn't know how to reply. It certainly was an entertaining technical film but I felt emotionally numb...as if someone had just died.  I wiped a single tear from my eye and quietly said ""yes.""<br/><br/>It is not a nice, pleasant or 'enjoyable' film...instead it's mean, depressing and outright disturbing. It's a brutally honest portrayal of addiction and the confusing realm in which addicts live. It's emotional spectrum starts at 'slightly sad but kind of amusing' and ends with 'oh my god! what have they done!', hitting every note in between. It's final impact is similar to being slapped in the face.<br/><br/>Watching the downward spiral of each lead character is like watching a car wreck in slow motion.. you are powerless to stop it yet are mesmerized at the same time. Each has the ability to change their fate, yet in an effort to capture their individual dreams, stay on the downward track.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have compared this movie to Trainspotting. I have to disagree. Call me crazy, but I think trainspotting GLORIFIED heroin use...after watching that movie, my friends joked about going and getting some smack.. ""hey that looks fun!  HA HA!""  I highly doubt there would be similar jokes after viewing this movie..

","OK, so its pretty good. Anything based on a book by Selby would have to be worth watching on pedigree alone. But despite what you've read, it's certainly not the best movie ever made. I think that if you watch tons and tons of movies, as most IMDB users undoubtedly do, then of course ""Requiem"" stands out from the usual, mindless dreck. But it's not all that. The performances are good, especially from Burstyn and Connolly, but I've seen this kind of thing done better, especially in ""Last Exit To Brooklyn"", another movie based on a Hubert Selby Jr. novel. You want to talk riveting, check out Jennifer Jason Leigh in that film. Editing's good here, as it was in ""Pi"". Is it just me or is Aronofsky making his reputation more on images rather than content? Pretty to look at, this film. My friend has severe ADD/OCD and she was even able to sit through it. All in all, ""Requiem"" is worth a look or two. Not a masterpiece, but I give it an 8."

Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly also turned in Oscar caliber performances, if only the Academy wasn't so cowardly about NC-17 rated movies.  The DVD is also excellent.

","This is a 'must-see-movie"". It's a sad story from start to end, and it might get you feeling a little bit sick at moments. The story is about dreams and reality, in this case in a way where the dreams and consequences are the result of drug addiction. The story has been told before but here is originalty in both telling the story and illustrate emotions and what heavy drugs might do to you with the photo and clipping. Any 90 minute standard TV-movie of the same subject will in comparison be shouting out its bad quality. It's not a matter of telling a hollywood-like story about some family fighting against drug abuse, and it most certainly doesn't end up with a happy come-together Thanksgiving turkey or somewhat. For those demanding that kind of false and happy ending, this story will probably be a pain. But perhaps a pain that is motivated if you cannot bear or handle some reality in movies.<br/><br/>The pace is fast and the journey from expectations to disaster runs from the beginning to the end. A tragic lonely woman, living in her own bad-tv-show-reality and her son, trying to get kicks and easy money. Beside the sons girl friend, and in some extent his mate, there are no more main characters. The mother gets an invitation to a tv-show, or more correctly a notation of her being chosed to be in a show in the future. From there she is obsessed with this future performance. It is her life from that on. Living as a poor retired white-trash lady she is determined to be a sucessful and beatuful performer when the time comes. Trying diet will not result in the change shes after fast enough and by a chance she is connected to a doctor that can deliver pills that do the trick. Her nightmare are so close to the viewer it make you sick yourself.<br/><br/>The son and girlfriend on the other hand get their kicks of heavy drugs. At first just for fun, then dreams of making good money in dealing. As it use to in reality things doesn't turn out as espected and they get in trouble and deeper and deeper in heavy addiction.<br/><br/>The different stories of the main characters life are presented parallell to each other. Faster and faster as their lifes become more and more unreal and sad. To conclude I guess that the intentions of what the movie wants to say are very well expressed and convincing. The way the characters kicks and state are illustrated in sequences even so convincing that I expect it whats happening in the brain and body of a person addicted to hard stuff.<br/><br/>I'll give it 8 of 10."

","There is no denying that on the evidence of both this and ""Pi"", Darren Aronofsky is a hugely talented young director. What he is NOT, at least by judging him on this film alone, is the saviour of cinema. Cinema is doing okay anyway right now, and the arrival of ""Requiem for a Dream"", however daring its attempt to show the viewer a bleak worldview of people who are devoid of real hope, is not going to change that for better or worse.<br/><br/>Its theme of isolation and a despair so great that there is nothing you can (or wouldn't) do to relieve yourself of it, is nothing really new; neither is its causal relationship with drugs. Admittedly, one of the things the film IS to be praised for doing is showing that this kind of dependency isn't EXCLUSIVELY formed with narcotics. There are scenes of substance abuse in the movie, but arguably more powerful are the scenes where the 'drug' in question instead seems to be something that superficially is thought less harmful, i.e. TV, or social acceptance, or... you get the idea.<br/><br/>These themes and the way they are dealt with and explored are what makes ""Requiem for a Dream"" interesting to watch. However, so many people are effusive when they use adjectives such as 'devastating' to communicate the impact that the film had on them, that I have to wonder if I am becoming so desensitised that things no longer shock me. I'm sure this can't be the case, but I've really felt much more unsettled after films than the experience I had with this one. Sure, ""Requiem... "" had an effect on me, but I feel confident that I could watch it again several times without feeling unable to cope anymore. There are plenty of films that I consider more disturbing than this, and funnily enough, most of them are British! Heck, even the ending of ""Chinatown"" got to me more than anything in ""Requiem"", and no one advises caution to anyone preparing to watch that, do they? <br/><br/>The film indeed does have some interesting things to say, but its a shame that after reading several comments on here, people who consider themselves hardened movie watchers might approach this film with their arms folded and an attitude of: ""Shock me"" Far better instead to seek it out for its dazzling cinematic treatment of a quite familiar theme. Make no mistake, this film is definitely CINEMATIC, and Aronofsky pulls out every stylistic trick in the book to emphasise the movie's most important points.<br/><br/>He is helped by the efforts of a uniformly excellent cast. Burstyn in particular is heartbreaking. For all the attention grabbing techniques used, it is the human suffering that will stay with you after you eject the tape. In fact, I think that may be WHY it wasn't nearly as disconcerting as I was perhaps expecting, because once or twice Aronofsky's tricks come dangerously close to over-egging the pudding, when he might have been better letting the performances speak for themselves.<br/><br/>""Requiem..."" was one of the better - and certainly one of the most INNOVATIVE - films I saw last year, but I still feel that perhaps some people desperate for a 'cinema revelation', have adorned the wrong movie as having provided it."

","When I rented Requiem for a Dream, I'll have to say that I did not know what it was about. I am not the type of person that is easily disturbed or frightened. However, this movie was powerful enough to make me have a nightmare. It's about a Sarah, a lonely widow, her son Harry, his girlfriend Marion, and Harry's friend Tyrone. Ellen Burstyn was amazing as the widow who goes on diet pills to fit into a red dress to go on a television show. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans were wonderful. Jennifer Connelly was also good, although I think she should have won best supporting actress for this rather than A Beautiful Mind. This movie dug into my deepest fears and left me shaking and crying on my bed. It was almost like a nightmare, because it had similar effects of a nightmare. This movie is brilliant, but never since the Green Mile (where the guy was on fire,) have I seen something so disturbing. Extraordinary."
"esewtereic","Null","0","1","31 March 2002"," An excellent *tragedy*
","(If you haven't yet seen this film but plan to and prefer to be completely surprised, my comments may tell you more than you'd want to know.  I don't give away the ending here, but I tell you what to expect.)<br/><br/>""Requiem"" is a Tragedy.  It's meant to absorb the viewer into the sufferings of the characters, to tug at the human heart.  If you're familiar with ""tragedy"" as a style (my only experiences with tragedies were in high school English/Literature classes), then you know that they can't be judged by the same criteria you'd use to judge a typical drama.  You'll probably guess how things will turn out in the end pretty early on.  You won't expect some surprise-ending with a last-minute miracle to make things right again.  You don't expect an *original* progression of events... you know that the character's lives will go from good to bad to worse.  If you're the type of person who empathizes with characters, you'll know you're going to be saddened by the end.  You'll wish the characters' lives could again be like they were at the beginning of the film -- you're going to feel for them and it's going to hurt.<br/><br/>As far as tragedies go, I think Requiem is excellent.  I'd recommend it to anyone who is empathic by nature.  If you liked the darkness of Fight Club... if you could appreciate the disturbing nature of Trainspotting... if you liked the directional style of Snatch (the closest thing I've seen)... basically, if you like some of the weirder ones, this movie is for you. (BE SURE to get the DVD and watch the bonus interview with the author, titled ""Memories, Dreams, and Addictions."")<br/><br/>If you don't like the weirder ones, see it anyway.  It gets progressively more dark and disturbing with each development in the storyline... it's not like everything else that comes out of Hollywood.  Tragedy is a powerful style that is guaranteed to produce a reaction deep within you.<br/><br/>Just don't judge it like a typical drama."

","Another user by the name of rupcousens made this comment about the last 10 minutes of the movie ""Would Ellen Burstyn's character really have been treated that way, and with such lack of compassion?"" Now this movie is a little more than straight drugs are baaad mmmkay, this movie is about human life about love, about friendship, about deceit, addiction, mayhem, lies, and the streets. Something you have to get through your head right now is that the streets are not the sheltered home that most of society breathes in. The streets ARE rough and dangerous. The streets place no value or morally fit rules on any single individual regardless of race or sex. So I dare to say that the characters were portrayed at the end as perhaps just? Maybe it was meaning injustice because of their gentle hearts? Who knows? The brilliance of all elements regarding direction, editing, producing, acting, casting etc were awesome and the movie stands ground a message higher than its message, this movie stands as one of the greatest.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 10/10 and i really dont have to say anything else do I?"

It's one of those movies that make you think afterwards. Its incredibly complex and absolutely brilliant. I have been involved into drugs and I've known people who were involved in it too. For God sakes, my best friend died of heroin-cocaine overdose. I don't blame him , but I can see why he did it. I believe that people don't take drugs because of a pure pressure, but because they choose too. No one can tell us what to do. People can only tell us their ideas and we can either accept it or not. Thats what the movie tells us. We choose the way we would like to live our lives and no one can tell us different. 4 people who had incredibly good intentions but end up being trapped in their addictions, fears, dreams, and most of all hopes for a better life. I wish people could watch this movie and understand that. To really, really think about it and get it to the greatest extend. I hope you got it as well."

I don't think I have been affected by a movie quite so much in a long time, I don't want to go out and tell all my friends they must see this movie (and why) because I don't want to hype it up out of all proportion, but I know that if I don't they may never see it- I know I picked it up and put it down about 4 different times in the rental shop, and I am glad that I finally took it home and watched it. The editing and direction are incredibly fresh and innovative, and the acting is of a superb standard, you REALLY care for the characters, you feel their sorrow, you feel their emptiness, and most of all you KNOW where they are all heading from the get go, and you know there is no stopping them. Burstyn turns in one of the most incredible performances I have ever seen- The scene where she is visited by Leto is indeed tragic. For me the movie isn't *about* drugs, although they are heavily depicted in various forms. For me the movie was about human weakness, human desire, human emotion and the never ending quest to fulfil our dreams regardless of the consequences and ignoring the fact that upon realising our dreams, we would have nothin left to aim for. Having read back through this ""review"", I realise I have told you very little about the movie itself, but I feel its going to be more enjoyable for you to discover it yourself. All I knew about this movie before I saw it was what I had read on the sleeve in the store, and a recommendation from a movie reviewer on the radio, and I'm glad thats all I knew.

","I was going to refrain from posting my comments on this movie, as nothing I could say would ever do it justice, but since such a large number of you seem to have missed the point entirely, I guess I have no choice.<br/><br/>Requiem for a Dream is not an ""anti-drug movie"" as so many people seem to believe.  Requiem transcends this and its message is FAR more complex then the simple (and redundant) ""drugs are bad.""  This movie is about life and about addiction (and not just drug addiction, as other forms of addiction, such as food, television, popularity, etc., are also dealt with, and are all treated the same way as the standard drug addiction...you'll see it when you watch the movie, through clever camera work, the director draws a fairly obvious parallel between drug addiction and food addiction).<br/><br/>But enough about what the movie is not...Requiem for a Dream is a powerful and moving piece which examines human life and chronicles how addiction (in any form) tends to walk hand in hand with self-destruction...but instead of trying to make the case that ""addiction is bad,"" Requiem instead pushes the idea that addiction is an inevitable part of life (hence the inclusion of the seasons ""Summer,"" ""Fall,"" and ""Winter,"" which are metaphors for various stages of life...if you want to treat Requiem as a simple anti-drug movie, then you have to totally ignore this fact...), and thus so is self-destruction, and this is what helps to make the movie so powerful, the realization that from day one, the characters were doomed no matter what they had done.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone who values gaining insight into their own lives, and I feel that this is one of those few movies that EVERYONE should see, it's just that good.  There's no way to describe how I felt after witnessing the movie's stunning conclusion other than...well...stunned.  Requiem for a Dream is FAR more than a simple anti-drug piece, and a definate must-see for anyone..."

","I just got done watching this film for the first time and all I can say is wow.  This is a movie that will hit you hard.  It was incredibly shocking and disturbing at times but it presents some great themes and isn't to be labelled as simply another anti-drug movie or a film that's only purpose is to make you feel miserable.  Before I talk about the movie's themes though I just want to quickly praise some of the other brilliant features of the film. First, the cinematography is amazing.  This is probably one of the best shot movies that I can think of.  The director does an amazing job here and I think that this is what has some people passing the movie off as just some artsy film with no real message.  Not true however. The acting in the film is top notch as well.  All actors deliver amazing performances, surprisingly, including Marlon Wayans.  He should really consider moving on to more dramatic performances.  Jared Leto is excellent and the woman that played his mother should have won an oscar.  You'll have to watch this movie to get the full idea of this as words alone cannot express how good she was.  Jennifer Connelly also gives an amazing performance. Now, onto the themes of this movie.  This movie is by no means simply an anti-drug movie. The director is smart enough to realize that there is enough anti-drug films out there.  He wouldn't have made this movie if his sole intent was just to dissuade people from taking drugs.  To put it simply, this movie is anti-that which gives us false hope.  There is a reason that the mother in the film loves watching TV and dreams about getting on that show.  Whether it be drugs, the media, or anything else, the director is pointing out that these things, which brainwash us, are wrong. While they may give us a temporary sense of hope, in the end, they only crush our dreams and our lives.  Look at the title of the movie: Requiem For A Dream."

"Filmfan-31","10","0","1","19 March 2002"," The best movie you've never seen, just make sure you're ready.
","This movie, without a doubt, is the greatest masterpiece ever created. Everything is perfection from the cinematography to the acting, and even the camera stylings of Darren Aronofsky.  The greatness of this movie, however, comes at a price that involves images and situations some people just can't handle (which I personally think is the cause for the majority of the bad reviews).  The visuals used in this movie to depict each character and their fate are each revolting in their respective manner, but are also necessary for the film to feel real.  There is nothing fake about this movie, it doesn't glamorize life and show how great everything is and how wonderful life is, this movie does the opposite and drags you down into the gutters and forces you to look into the faces of the weak, of the homeless, and of the hopeless.      That being said, Requiem For a Dream revolves around the lives of four Coney Island individuals, each one unique in their own way, and each one with their own demons to face.  Tyrone, who is driven by images of himself pledging to his mother he won't be a failure.  Marion, who is estranged from her parents after the flood her with money but no emotional value.  Harry, who resorts to repeatedly stealing his mothers television in order to buy his next fix.  And finally, Sara, who is plagued by lonliness and sees her chance to escape by losing weight for her spot on a famous television show. Their lives are woven together tightly enough so that when one starts to fall, the rest tumble along at an amazing speed.      This movie, simply put, is perfect.  But as I stated before, that perfection comes at the price of a lot of people not being able to stomach what is happening onscreen.  That is really sad though, because this is one of the greatest movies ever made, and nobody I know has even heard of it. Check this movie out, examine all of the symbolism and make a judgement for yourself.  Just make sure you're ready for some of the things you're going to see."

","I'll give it this much; it wasn't boring. But.. This movie told me absolutely nothing that I didn't already know. If you get addicted to dangerous drugs, you will end up in a bad way.  Thanks for the tip, McGruff. It is a grim, gross depressing film about a pack of losers WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN LOSERS EVEN IF THEY HAD NEVER DONE DRUGS. You might have made it more appetizing if drugs had ruined the lives of some people who had a single good quality in the first place. The directing is really artsy and conceited and my brethren, I saw all this avant-garde cinemo-crap in the late 60's, when many a good movie was ruined by the hippie wannabe directors using multiple screens, slow-mo audio, fuzzy hallucination sequences, rapid fire splicing, weird angles, keystone cops speed-ups and many, many other tricks. But since this film is geared to a young audience (the young characters are H-addicts who are also supposed to be somewhat hip and cool, but the old one addicted to diet pills is a total pathetic mundane ditz in the first place, and the other older characters are patently despicable) the public thinks its seeing directing innovations. The TV ad for the film called it `the most controversial film of the year?' Controversial? Like someone is out there arguing that heroin addiction is a good thing and it never ruined anyone's life.<br/><br/>I'm sad to dislike this because some people I really respect recommended it so highly. They insisted that I had to see it, that it was the best. REQUIEM is just another downer, a cold front blown in from Canada. My wife asked me at the end of it, `So what did you think?' `What did you think,' I countered. `Well it was kind of arty.' `Yeah, I said, `That was the whole point, not the story itself.

","First off, this is not a perfect film. It's flawed, it's manipulative, the quick-cut editing and garish visuals are kind of a way of dressing up an oft told tale, it often exploits its subject matter and is never quite the breakthrough that Aronofsky's ""Pi"" was. However, that said, it does exactly what it sets out to do--horrify audiences with scary and nightmarish visions of a culture mostly dependent on addiction in one form or another. If ever there was an anti-drug film or a film preaching against substance abuse, this is it, but it doesn't really limit iself to just one type of addiction is you pay attention. I agree that it should be mandatory viewing for teenagers, but the MPAA stupidly slapped an NC-17 rating on Aronofsky's vision...so much for a ""message"" movie breaking through to the people it would most likely help.<br/><br/>The Academy Awards should be downright embarrassed for awarding Julia Roberts the Best Actress award for ""Erin Brockovich."" Roberts slaps on a push-up bra, shows her cleavage and pouts a lot and that's the extent of her performance (the woman just has little acting range). Burstyn blows her out of the water, supporting nearly the entire emotional weight of this film on her shoulders, but how can she compete with ""America's sweetheart"" finally doing a film with the slightest hint of substance? I don't get why Roberts won and neither does any other competent human being, but my hunch is that she was being rewarded for her beauty, charm and the fact she brings in so much money for film studios. So what, right? The award is for the best performance and you simply will not see a better performance than Burstyn's here. <br/><br/>They also skipped out on nominating Jennifer Connelly, who's just excellent in support as lead Jared Leto's girlfriend reduced to turning tricks for a high. She's much more naturally beautiful than Roberts, but has thus far in her career, pretty much refused to sell out to Hollywood and has taken some pretty risky roles. That's really admirable and I look forward to seeing her in other things. And I should also note that Marlon Wayans proves he deserves to act in better movies than SCARY MOVIE."

","There are certain things that are so cruel, touching, honest or all of these at the same time that you almost cannot bear to watch it.<br/><br/>This movie is one of these things. The movie follows the problems and fall of 4 characters. It does not offer any flashy messages like ""do not take drugs"", ""don't sell your body for dope"", or ""don't take diet pills because the fridge might eat you"". These are for you to figure out. Like Pi, another movie by the same director it almost has a documentary feel to it.<br/><br/>This one though, unlike Pi that is shot in black and white with washed out imagery, is so sharp and crisp it feels even more real.<br/><br/>This way it even hits you harder. A truly awesome movie that made me believe in filmmaking again.<br/><br/>In times where Steven Spielberg carries the olympic flag at the winter games opening ceremony as the ""pillar of creativity and culture"" these are the movies that show there are still filmmakers that believe in brilliant, truthful storytelling."

"dee.reid","10","0","1","16 February 2002"," This film is brutal
","In my opinion, very few movies whose subject matter surrounds drugs, are actually able to paint an accurate look at the people who live them. Don't watch ""Requiem for a Dream"" thinking that everybody will live happily ever after.  No.  ""Requiem for a Dream"" shows us when there is no hope or a chance to start over.  Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans all give superb performances.  Ellen Burstyn's character, Sara Goldfarb, goes by just about everyday of her life watching Tabby Tibbons(Christopher McDonald) on her favorite television show and imagining herself as a contestant.  She sees that the only way she can do it by taking these dietary pills just so she can fit into her red dress.  It isn't long before the diet pills and television start to consume her life and she soon enough takes a hike down the road to addiction.  She has a slowly fading relationship with her son Harry Goldfarb(Jared Leto).  It seems to me that the only time they talk is when she is trying to convince him to not pawn the television so he can get drug money.  Harry's drug-induced fantasies on the boardwalk are some of the more disturbing parts of the film.  Harry's best friend Tyrone(Marlon Wayans), is trying to expand into the drug trade. This is probably the most disturbing part of the film for me because I have never seen Marlon Wayans(nor any of his brothers for that matter) in a really serious film role.  He plays Tyrone so convincingly, that you can pretty much forget about ""Scary Movie"".  The ending scene with Tyrone is probably one of the best parts about this movie.  Jennifer Connelly however, who plays Harry's girlfriend, Marion, is probably the shining light of this movie.  Her Golden Globe for best supporting actress and her Oscar-nomination for the same category in the much recent ""A Beautiful Mind"" prove she is a very good actress.  I will not forget the scene where she is at the party.<br/><br/>To sum it up, ""Requiem for a Dream"" scores a 10 in my book and is now one of my favorite movies.  I am looking to buy the Director's Cut DVD so I can experience this movie to its fullest."
"ToiletDuk","Null","0","1","13 February 2002"," An incredibly visceral piece of work by a visionary filmmaker.
","Over the years I have had the pleasure of watching a handful of great films which confront the viewer with brutal human drama, eliminating all the fluff and Hollywood glitz that satisfy the seething masses who crave another ""hilarious"" Tim Allen movie or a tear-jerking cuddly love story. Requiem for a Dream is the latest movie I can safely add to my list of incredible, glitz-free masterpieces alongside such films as Happiness, Buffalo 66, CUBE, and others.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has shaped this story into a feverish onslaught of reality, depicting a group of people whose greed and desperation simultaneously drove all of them to their own hellish demise in all but the mortal sense. The depiction of addiction in this movie is absolutely breathtaking, especially in the mind-blowing performance by Ellen Burstyn. Her transformation from a stereotypical Jewish mother into a drug-addled walking corpse is outstanding, both due to her acting and the excellent make-up effects. Staring at her strapped to the gurney I was convinced I was looking at a person completely devoid of life or sanity.<br/><br/>Cinematically, Requiem bombards the viewer with a unique style that blends incredibly well with Clint Mansell's excellent score. As fabulous as the visuals are in this movie, one of its only flaws is that some of the camera tricks were plucked straight out of Pi. In particular, the shots where Marlon Wayans is running through the alley, and where Jennifer Connelly is exiting the building to vomit use the same technique employed in Pi to give the sense of the character being severely detached from their surroundings. It's a very effective trick, but watching it used in Requiem made me think too much of Pi's cinematography (maybe not such a bad thing considering the two movies share the same director and DP).<br/><br/>Requiem delivers a vivid message about addiction through a stellar cast, driving music, and innovative visual style. Possibly one of the greatest films of all time, definitely one of the most effective anti-drug movies. Seeing Requiem for a Dream could change your life, change your habits, change your point of view, or even just change your opinion of Jared Leto. Regardless, anyone not expecting to see another Wedding Singer should walk away from Requiem changed somehow.<br/><br/>And that's a good thing."

My brother recommended this movie to me about a month ago.  To tell the truth I didn't remember this movie being advertised or any thing, thats quite a over sight on my part since I am a big movie buff.  This movie drew me in immediately with the camera shots- close ups and the camera movement- I was clinching my heart and teeth once the ride started.

","This movie is definitely one of the strongest, breathtaking, amazing films I've ever seen. I believe that a great movie can be decided by the time it takes you to get over it , and go on with your normal daily life. In this case ""Requiem"" is not letting my mind settle down for month's now...<br/><br/>This movie involves a lot of great filmmaking elements. The narrative is wonderful, the plot is very fascinating and the story is being built during the film with the right rhythm. The acting is absolutely perfect and all the characters are well put together and described by director Aronofsky. One of the things i liked most in this film is that the situations which characters are caught into can be taken from reality. Sara Glodfarb's Addiction (acted wonderfully by Allan Burstyn) can be real. We live in a world where good looks and being famous are things to look up to by each and everyone of us .It is normal of her wanting to look good and loose weight. I really liked Tyrone's scenes with his mother. It is a beautiful scene when he is having sex and than right afterwards we are able to see him looking at his mother's picture with great pain of a child that misses his dead mom. The movie features great editing. The drug use scenes are fast and very strong, editor used short shots and inter-cuts of the eyes, the hand and the needle.<br/><br/>We can also be noted to another real life fact, when things are going well, love between Harry(Gared Leto) and Marion(Connely) really flourish . But than when things are being mess up problems and fights are starting to appear. The soundtrack is wonderful. I remember a friend of mine watching the film in another room and I couldn't help not listening to the terrible sounds that ""flashback"" me into strong memories. But what I liked most is the deterioration of all main characters during the film. Coming to an outstanding scene near the end when all for characters - Sara, Harry, Marion & tyrone are lying down in a baby-like figure, each in his own terrible physical, emotional and mental state. Sara - all crazy and ill. Harry - lost his hand and maybe his girlfriend. Marion - had sold her body for money and drugs. and Tyrone - with great pain for not having his mother close to him when needed.<br/><br/>""A Requiem For A Dream"" is a powerful movie. I had friends that just couldn't finish watching it because it is so electrifying and strong. Some Cried hard. But most important - You cannot go straight back to normal life after this one. It just hammer an unforgettable trademark in your heart that makes you think. Think and admire this piece of art, and of course - watch it time and time again, enjoying and suffering every moment...<br/><br/>Wrote: Ofer Kadar (Gitita's brother)- Maoz Haim, ISRAEL."

","Darren Aronofsky's brilliant adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel (unread) is definitely punishing but there's a wealth of innovation and analysis to reward the serious viewer. Aronofsky and his cinematographer and editor (Matthew Libatique and Jay Rabinowitz, respectively) employ a series of cinematic tricks (split-screen, different aspects of motion and lighting) but somehow they don't seem gimmicky at all--everything is employed to tell a complex story about the plight of addiction in the most efficient way possible. The film centers on a bright, likable Coney Island junkie, Harry (Jared Leto) and his widowed mother (Ellen Burstyn, in a role she isn't quite able to pull off until midway through but who devastates thereafter) who becomes hooked on speed believing she will be on television. Also figuring prominently are two other junkies, Harry's girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly in a very brave performance) and best friend (Marlon Wayans, also very fine). Each character delves deeper and deeper into a shared hell and it's to the writers' credit (both novelist and director wrote the screenplay) that none are able to escape into death's forgiveness. Yet Aronofsky and Selby are not interested in providing a moralistic after-school special; there's a clear identification with each character and you come to understand the motivations even if the choices seem woeful. Despite its relentless grimness, the film leaves you satisfied: there's a lot of pleasure in Aronofsky's technique and a very real sense of being impressed as well as shaken."

","This is not an anti-drug propaganda. This is not ""another"" movie. This is not a movie for everyone to understand. This is not for everyone to see.

I think that the only guilt or sin or mistake of the characters is not the drug-addiction, but the selfishness. They wanted ""more"", which is understandable...but they forgot the real purpose...they imagined love so deep, but they forgot to share it, they forgot the only thing that could keep them alive. This is a love dusted drama in my opinion, filled with sorrow and regrets. The fact that they somehow understand their mistakes is the only punishment they deserve, but unfortunately not the only one they get...You may do whatever you have to do in order to be happy, but when you put yourself alone on the throne, here comes the dark fallen angel of solitude.<br/><br/>There is no escape from yourself...somehow you realize that you were not meant only for yourself, and that is when the real hell begins...and if you're not too old, too dirty, too late or too weak, as our four characters...you still have a chance...if not , here comes paranoia.

Each character in the movie was drawn very well and in great detail, where they seem as if it could be someone we know or even ourselves. The power and churning up to the end of the movie sends out so many emotions you feel very overpowered far after the movie is over.

","Viewed seperately, each of the intertwining plot lines in this movie represent the same old drug-movie theme, that is: Person discovers drugs -- has lots of fun; time passes; person gets addicted; person finds out drugs aren't so good.<br/><br/> However, when viewed as whole they paint a vivid picture of the monster that is addiction, and the havoc it can cause on it's victims and their loved ones. This film isn't really about how bad drugs are at all, what it really explores is the danger of addiction and the many forms it can take.<br/><br/> I think this film would benefit both the older(40+) and younger(15-18) age groups more then they might think. Although, since this film is rated R, school children, who are in one of the highest risk categories for addiction, probably won't get to see it.<br/><br/> All in all it was a rather harrowing and disconcerting experience, however, it was masterfully put together piece of work (the drug scenes were especially well done, since no sane person would want to see drawn out footage of intravenous drug use). I definately came away from this movie feeling as though it was worth the time.<br/><br/> This film could do more to eliminate the use of drugs amongst teenagers than the entire coordinated efforts of America's war on drugs since it's inception.

","Every now and then a moviegoer needs to be throttled and jolted into the realm of 'something different', where old preconceptions of what makes a piece of cinema great are shaken and new ideas form. For me, Requiem was just such a movie.  This is not a happy, heroic, inspiring movie.  It's gritty, nauseating, and visceral. And that's what it should be. This movie, to me, is about void.  Complete apathy mixed with despair, and occasionally glimpsed moments of hope. On a less pedantic note, I simply think the cinematography, direction, editing, and most of all the performances in Requiem are just great.  Here, in particular, we see Marlon Wayans escape the confines of just being a 'funnyman', we see Jennifer Connelly prove without question that she's a strong talent (just now being really recognized by the industry, prior to this she had some real token-female roles), we see Jared Leto prove he's not a pretty-boy...and then there's Ellen Burstyn, a remarkable actor inexplicably kept from Academy Award glory (for what it's worth). This is probably my favorite movie. I have voted another movie or two higher (I voted this movie at an 8), but that is because with those I could repeatedly view them...Requiem gets to me, under my skin, enough that I can only watch it every now and then.

It's the most powerful anti-drug message I've ever seen. The end of the film leaves you feeling so sad. These are characters that you know.

The emotion and the acting swept me away and I fell for each of these characters. Then the ending hit me so hard.

Nothing special so far. But there are so many sub-plots that make the difference. And foremost the acting is simply breathtaking. Ellen Burstyn - well in mind for her role as a desperate mother in ""The Exorcist"" - gives one of the best performances I've ever seen, with the other actors just close behind. And as if that wouldn't be more one can expect these days, the visual translation of the subject is excellent - never before special effects seemed to make so much sense.

"phenomenal cat","Null","0","1","4 January 2002"," A bad trip (minor spoilers)
","In a way, ""Requiem"" is a typical junkie film. Like all junkie films, it portrays the junkie's life as a long, bad trip--the initial high, the encroaching freakiness, and the crash.<br/><br/>But ""Requiem"" goes further. It isn't just ABOUT a bad trip, it IS a bad trip. A really, really bad one. Don't get stoned before you watch this one, there's no need. The camera is stoned. Every shot is overloaded with meaning. Aronofsky uses fast motion, slow motion, stop motion, trippy colors, relentlessly tense string music, and strange sounds. He uses maverick technique, not dialog, to make his points. An example: An old woman gets strung out on diet pills and goes to see her sleazy doctor. But she can't seem to communicate with him--she moves and speaks in incoherent slow motion, and he flits through the room like a hummingbird.<br/><br/>But what you'll remember most about the film is the crash portion, the part where the trip goes off the rails. It's a relentless, excruciating descent into madness, depravity, and violence. You think Aronofsky has dragged his characters to a new on-screen low, but it gets worse. And then, stunningly, worse again. A character is subjected to agonizing, endlessly repetitive shock therapy. Another suffers the total debasement of performing sex acts in front of a crowd of young drunken suits for crack. Another has his arm amputated. It's so extreme, it's almost comic. You don't know whether to giggle or vomit.<br/><br/>So what's the point of all this? Mostly, it seems, that drugs are bad. Aronofsky throws in some obvious parallels between addiction to drugs and addiction to other things like coffee, chocolate, high-fat foods, and television. But this is hardly revolutionary stuff. The story isn't profound, but the way Aronofsky tells it is--profoundly unsettling, anyway. You never forget bad trips, although sometimes you wish you could."

","Normally I don't like to be slapped in the face, however on that rare occasion a slap in the face is needed to awaken your senses from a stupor for which only Hollywood manufactured films can lull you into. Indeed, by the end of the film you, as I did, will feel like your soul has been dragged through the gutter. However, it is not until you truly return to your senses that you finally realise that what you have just experienced is a deliberate act by a talented director (Darren Aronofsky) who is fulfilling his boundless potential.<br/><br/>The story is deceptively complex but neatly symmetrical: four New Yorkers find solace in drugs but inevitably fall short of what they hope to achieve. First, Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and best-friend (Marlon Wayanes) are twenty-something junkies who seek to get rich quick from selling their chosen drug. Second, Harry's mother becomes addicted to the dream of appearing on television and diet pills. Although each find what they dream of in the short-term their addictions engulf and replace reality to point where their lives are utterly destroyed.<br/><br/>The prominent theme and script is beautifully backed up by a brilliant cast. Despite the pretty boy looks Jared Leto as Harry is exceptional. Jennifer Connelly has had an odd career (Labrynth, Rocketeer and Dark City), her rare beauty could have placed her at the top of the Hollywood name of names, yet she has chosen a challenging movie that highlights not her looks but her talent as an actress.  Marlon Wayans is an under-rated actor who I hope will continue to take on serious roles rather than brainless cliche roles like his performance in Scary Movie. Lastly, the outstanding performance of the movie is Ellyn Burstyn as the ill-fated lonely mother. I watched the re-released version of the Excorcist and wondered what happened to that type of actress and amazingly I find it again in the same actress some twenty years later. She should have been showered in awards.<br/><br/>The most pleasing factor to come out of this film is the coming of age for the director Darren Aronofsky. His previous film Pie was a daring debut but Requiem has cemented his place as a director for the future. His style is modern: fast paced editing with the use of experimental camera-work. Yet his greatest attribute is his perception and intellect. This is demonstrated with his clear understanding and commitment to a theme that is expressed in simple but imaginative ways.<br/><br/>A final footnote to this film is the music. It seems as though John Williams has created a monopoly in Hollywood. Admittedly Williams is good but Clint Mansell has delivered a score that rivals any of Williams blockbuster soundtracks<br/><br/>All in all an almost perfect movie."

Though, the movie does not tell why these people take drugs, if it is to flee from the repetitiveness of everyday life or just ordinary teen-depression could be nice to know.<br/><br/>The mother is clearly my favorite character, representing the emptiness that could be found in a lonely life. Her reason to keep on breathing is to be on a nationwide TV-show and to be respected and loved by the audience, a goal which she more or less achieves by taking drugs..<br/><br/>Although this is a great picture, I felt at moments that time was stretched in order to fill a whole film, filling it with pointless scenes of trance states instead of more in-depth explaining why life sucks without drugs to the point where I have to become an addict.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","To say that Requiem for a Dream is a superb piece of work would not be an overstatement indeed. Darren Aronofsky adds his great deal of uniqueness to what would just be another drug movie. This is why Requiem for a Dream could be called a modern classic. I have never seen any of Aronofsky's previous productions but this is just brilliant. While watching this film you really can be brought in by the main characters, you truly feel for them. This movie is so real, apart from Trainspotting this movie tells addiction, as it would be like. <br/><br/>The cast is fine, strong and unforgettable especially by Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn. This is their finest work to date I would go as far to imply. Not one to be watched if you feel these controversial movies should not be made of course. Most average film viewers would not particularly enjoy watching Jared Leto's characters Harry Goldfrabb's left arm rot off. Yep, it's definitely raw, in your face. And yes, it's definitely good, solid cinema at it's best here. No doubt about it!"

Once I found the Director's cut, I couldn't wait to watch it!  There were just a few differences towards the end of the film, but it was pretty much the same as the edited version. Never have I been so obsessed about a movie that I had to watch it over and over.  I must admit, it's not an uplifter, yet a significant reminder of how my life is much better than I had ever thought it could be!<br/><br/>The actors were so convincing as addicts.  Ellen Burstyn's performance was EXCELLENT!  As the widowed compulsive-eater-turned-diet-pill-addict, Burstyn was incredible and believable.

This said, let me add that it is not for everybody. Drug addiction has never been depicted in such a cruel, raw and yet sincere way: as we see Sara, Harry, Marion and Tyrone slowly embrace  self-destruction we cannot help but identify with them, and this is what really hurts inside. They're ordinary people like you and me who try to make their dreams come true and ultimately be happy; they're naive and helpless, they take the wrong paths and end up destroying themselves and everything that surrounds them. That's what the movie's about: our dreams, hopes, desires, and how badly we strive after them, often losing our balance and ignoring what really matters.<br/><br/>The performances are magnificent, and Ellen Burstyn is so brave and true that by the end of the movie it's impossible to look Sara in the eyes without being hit right in the face by her pain and agony.<br/><br/> 10/10.

","What is a great movie? Old movies direction and blocking were the theater's with minor variations. Not too many movies really throw away that convention. Like ""Pi"" director Darren Aronofsky is the star of this movie by not being bound too much by a concept of a movie. Some dislike it when the direction over takes the performance or the story. For those who love color, sound and sight; for those who love a some great edits that creates a montage unlike anything produced before will find a treat here. The subject is dark and story (which is out in front) and performances (Burstyn and Leto in particular) are first rate, but the real star is Darren Aronofsky.<br/><br/>Not sure this makes a great movie, if you think of ""High Noon"" or ""Citizen Kane"" (great movies to be sure) as the only style that a ""movie"" can be. Aronofsky's style does limit the ability to develop characters, but this style also ties two stories together in subtle and not so subtle ways that a character driven movie is unable to do. The story of addiction in many forms, shown side by side is striking. Most movies are about the characters, but ""Requiem"" is, for good and bad, is not bound by that concept. It is about what the characters are going through. This gives Aronofsky great freedom which he uses with great ability. This is a great series of moving images with sound. It is nearly impossible to resist. It is at least a very good piece of art, but I am not sure if it is a great movie."

This man is passionate about film making, and it shows in his work.<br/><br/>I especially enjoy the way Aronofsky links the commonality of each major character by creatively juxtaposing moments of their tales. This technique not only acts as a bonding agent to keep the characters unified, but it also helps to emphasize their own unique experiences. Aronofsky ends the film by utilizing this technique in such an overwhelming manner that truly brings the audience to suffer with the characters.<br/><br/>The DVD is quite amazing because it actually adds to the whole movie experience.

Why in the world do we have to see Ellen Burstyn's character mercilessly destroyed? My perception is that the younger characters were drug addicts by choice but Burstyn was a victim, cruelly mishandled.  My esteem of Aronofsky has slipped since he teamed up with Selby.

"carly250","10","0","1","5 December 2001"," Honest, Brutal, Confronting, Heartbreaking
","A warning to all who have not yet seen this film - this is not a feel good movie. If you like walking away from films feeling good about yourself and that all is right with the world, I'd advise you to give this movie a miss. But for everyone who appreciates a more honest and real approach in film making, I can't emphasise enough how much you should see this film!!!!!<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's four lead characters are played brilliantly by Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans. Aronofsky and the actors have captured their individual spiral into self destruction perfectly. As the movie progresses, we gain insight into their hopes and dreams, their weaknesses and flaws, and their insecurities. It is an astonishing moment when you realise that you understand Burstyn's Sarah. Her mentality is so familiar that you can understand her reasoning for increasing the amount of pills she takes. The harsh reality of unattainable dreams is also displayed in her hallucinations of the television show she so desires to be on.<br/><br/>The lives of each of these characters were depicted as so empty that they each had a dream that would, in their mind, make them a better person and offer them fulfillment. But it was their journey to these unattainable dreams that caused their inevitable downfalls. Aronofsky's brutal and at times unforgiving imagery was used not as a shock tactic, but more as an honest depiction of the reality of drugs and human frailty. Each of the confronting images featured in the film (those who have seen it will know which ones I mean) are used as a vehicle to reveal the vulnerability and weaknesses of each character, resulting in us being able to see our own vulnerabilities and insecurities in one or all of the characters.<br/><br/>On face value, this is a movie about drugs and addiction, and yes, Aronofsky does a great job of portraying the horror and brutality of drug use. But this is a deeper film, one that illustrates the depths that humans are willing to sink to in order to live out their dreams. Unfortunately, the honest reality of the situation is that the distant hope that you are holding onto usually will not result in making you a better person or your life more meaningful.<br/><br/>An excellent movie with brilliant performances from the leads and unique and insightful direction and cinematography. It will not make you smile, but the sheer forcefulness of the film and the confronting sense of reality it depicts will definitely evoke some sort of emotional response. Definetely a 9 out of 10 movie."

That she was denied the Oscar is a travesty.<br/><br/>Sure the film is thematically a ""Just say no"" cautionary fable, but the editing and pacing fill this film with a life and vitality that belies the simplicity of the narrative.  The performances are brilliant, particularly Leto and Burstyn (The mother/ son dynamic between them is just heartwrenching) and Marlon Wayans proves that he has dramatic range as an actor.  This is not a film for the squeamish or the generic ""Scary Movie"" crowd, but if you're prepared t be challenged and engaged by the films you watch, this is one of the finest films in recent years"

","If anyone deserved an Academy Award last year it was Ellen Burstyn for her portrayal of a lonely old woman who longs for yesteryear.  Her obsession to relive that life that she once had leads her down a degenerative spiral of (pharmaceutical) drug-addiction.  However, Burstyn was not the only player to put in award-worthy performance.  Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and, surprisingly, Marlon Wayans each contribute spot-on portrayals of people down-on-their-luck, whose struggle to overcome their hardships eventually turns them into hopeless, pathetic life-forms on the dark path to death; they are the anti-thesis of the American dream.  Darren Aronofsky deftly blends the characters with a yearning for the innocence of childhood and a desire to be appreciated that is at once omnipresent and smooth, but secondary.  The film never lags as all four main characters each have strong character arcs.  I have heard many people say this is a depressing film, but I think it is this only for viewers whose real-life mirrors that of the characters.  As for the normal, ""clean-cut"" audience segment, shouldn't the fact that you do not act as the film characters do make you glad that you do not?  While I was surprised that there was not a twist at the end, the ending is still extremely sound the way it is (the final shot of Ellen Burstyn is chilling to the point that it puts Tom Hank's emaciated body in the second half of ""Cast Away"" to shame).  This is an extremely powerful film, even if this is not the first time we have been warned about the evils of drug addiction.  Final Grade: A"

This would frighten even the most hardcore herion-addicts, never mind a pimple-covered pubescent.<br/><br/>Seriously though, Requiem for a dream is not just another anti-drug movie. If thats all you see then you're missing the big picture.  It illustrates the similarities between heroin addiciton and weight-loss, coke and sexual desire.  That's why the movie is so disturbing, because it shows that these problems are one in the same.

","""Requiem for a Dream"" is so powerful, so shocking and so... so good that it's pretty much impossible to summarize. It examines people, their addictions and their dreams and has been brought to life with an aura of pure surreal reality (you'll understand if you see it) by ""Pi"" director Darren Aronofsky from Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry (Jared Leto), Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and Harry's best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans)and how they separately and simultaneously spiral down the pit of drug addiction. Good performances all around, but Burstyn is a virtuoso as always.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much of the plot, that might take away from the impact. The movie follows the characters in their inevitable descent and each character shows us a major way addiction can destroy you; whether it be in a physical, mental, personal or social sense.<br/><br/>Some people have criticised Aronofsky's use of ""showy"" techniques. This is just plain stupid and the wide range of visual effects used in ""Requiem"" is one of the most important parts of the movie. They bring us right in with the story, the action and, most importantly, the characters. When Sara is hallucinating and freaking out, so are we. The visuals also sort of numb the audience, the same way the characters are numb to what's happening around them. In short: the viewer becomes one with Sara, Harry, Marion and Tyrone.<br/><br/>I can't tell you how much I love this movie. I've seen it so many times and since the first time I saw it, it's been that movie that I'm forcing everyone to watch. Say what you want about ""Requiem,"" this is theatrical genius that we rarely see in a movie jungle of blockbusters. Aronofsky has managed to show us the human soul as honestly and as raw as anybody ever could. I look forward to what comes from Aronofsky in the future and to seeing ""Requiem for a Dream"" again with great anticipation."

It didn't even make the medical industry look good.  The visual effects and cinematography were pretty good.  I look at those as a bonus, but this by far does not carry the film.  I walked away thinking of this one, in fact the movie is still left an imprint.  It was along the lines of Traffic on how it followed the different characters along.  Traffic is by far worse then this film.  I have not seen a movie of this caliber for awhile.  One thing I must saw, the ones who wrote this film have got some wierd things floating around in there brain.  The more the movie went on the more predictable it became.  The use of forshadowing was basic.  You know how it's going to happen, just not in the way it did.  I think if your looking for crazy drug/reality film then Trainspotting is the way to go."

","I finally saw this movie on Sundance and I was mesmerized.  There must be a million movies out there about drug addictions but this one just grabbed and pulled you into the world of these four people as they struggle with their addictions.  The 3 twenty-somethings - Jared Leto, Jennifer Connolly and Marlon Wayans all struggle with their addiction to Herion.  However, the most incredible role was Ellen Burstyn, the mother of Jared Leto and suffering through her own addiction to diet pills (speed).<br/><br/>
Up until this point I though Julia Roberts did a good job with Erin Brockovict and winning the Oscar.  But I realize now that the best actress award should have went to Ellen Burstyn from 'Requiem of a Dream'.  Maybe the Academy felt that they had to give to a mainstream actress after indie actress Hillary Swank won last year, but I think that Ellen was robbed. She was incredible."

","This movie was awful. And it was outstanding. It's outstanding because it does not omit parts that don't make us feel warm and fuzzy. Every negative review of this movie I've read has claimed Requiem is a bad movie because it just pointlessly pummels four likeable characters into the ground. People don't like this movie because most people go to a movie to feel good, and Requiem does not do that. They, perhaps understandably, feel betrayed. How dare they include truths that aren't pretty! Does it have to be THAT graphic?<br/><br/>Yes. A sugercoated truth is a lie. And the graphic self-destruction does have a point.  Another reviewer felt the movie never mentioned WHY the characters destroy themselves like that.  Might I suggest you missed the point? The four characters in the movie all did what they did because they wanted to be somebody.  Sara feels useless and empty because her husband is dead and her son is gone. (""I do the dishes, but what's the point?"" [I don't know the answer to that myself. Really.]) The idea of being on TV with her red dress makes her feel like she's got something to live for (""it's a reason to get up in the morning, a reason to lose weight""). And she stops at nothing fit into that red dress (symbolism anyone?). Marion doesn't like what she  sees in the mirror until she's rocked on coke.  She also tells Harry more than once that ""you make me feel like a person"" (incidentally it's when they're both high. Harry and Tyrone keep dreaming of being high-level dealers (""so those chumps can work the streets for US"".)<br/><br/>
They all want to feel like they're worth something, and that's why. It isn't just the bitter sadism of some disturbed director. If it looks pointless, you're probably missing something."

Whilst at points uncomfortable, in others dull, Requiem succeeds in intimating us with its central characters, allowing us to empathise with their every disappointment, to weep for their irreversible mistakes.

"film student","Null","0","1","31 August 2001"," Pretentious tripe.
","I keep hearing what an honest and brutal film this is, so here's my refutation. Requiem for a Dream was not a great film, it certainly isn't deserving of it's place, or any other place, on the imdb top 250.<br/><br/>I'll admit, the hyper-edited portrayal of the actually process of injecting heroin was pretty impressive the first time i saw it. When repeated ad nauseum, however, it's just grating. It was like Aronofsky had one clever idea and, deciding he probably wouldn't have another clever idea, decided to reuse it as many times as possible.<br/><br/>Some of the editing and cinematography was interesting, but better suited to a 3 minute long music video than a feature length film. I guess that was just an attempt to keep the audience from realizing that the film lacked a plot or actual characters.<br/><br/>Speaking of the plot, what little plot there was wasn't interesting enough to sustain an entire film. The first hour of the movie is just the same actions repeated over and over again, and the second half is just junkies lives being ruined by their habits. Perhaps it would be more moving or poignant if any of the characters were a little more than paper-thin caricatures without detailed personalities.<br/><br/>I don't recall which term they used on the back of the box, but in describing the ""climax,"" they either used the term ""gut wrenching"" or ""heart wrenching."" Again, it may have been so if i actually cared about any of the characters, or believed what was happening on the screen. The screenwriter obviously didn't know anything about the legal process of the united states: you can be arrested for possession of heroin, but not for addiction to it. And the representation of electroconvulsive therapy wasn't just stupid, it was irresponsible. Again, the screenwriter must have just watched One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and assumed that they still did things that way. Not true.<br/><br/>And finally, i have my gripes with the soundtrack: four bars of music repeated over and over, does not make a soundtrack. Some variety might've been good, or perhaps choosing something more appropriate than dramatic violin chords...<br/><br/>In conclusion, a film, in order to be effective, doesn't necessarily need a plot, but if it lacks a plot, it must have characters. This film did not have characters or a plot. Furthermore, to be effective, a film needs some semblance of truth to it. A film which at first presents itself as a realist film, should at least stick to that, rather than resorting to silly horror movie shock tactics to elicit a response.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky is not the next Stanley Kubrick. He's not even the next Ed Wood."

Well I might have been impacted by that message if I knew what was going on half the time. I managed to put the whole mess together by the end of the picture (unfortunately) and the result was a headache. Why do people believe that if a film has a tremendously high amount of cuts that it's good editing? I don't know, probably because they think that it was difficult to do or something. No. Good editing is not seeing how many cuts you can fit into one picture (watch any Oliver Stone film after the 1980's). Good editing makes a film an interesting experience, a unique format, it does not necessarily have to flow well, but if you want good editing, see a movie like ""Barry Lyndon"", which probably has a quarter of the amount of cuts than this film, despite being double the length. If this is the future of film making, I don't want to be there to see it."

This is great because he explores the entire world of drugs and the effects of them.<br/><br/>Arnofsky, Kubrick, and Burton are some of the best directors of all time, they are the true artists at work.  I think by the time Arnofsky is done, you'll compare him to that of Orson Wells.  (at least he doesn't copy images and scenes like every other movie director).  I enjoyed it, great movie.

","I must be desensitized, because it did nothing for me.  And whatever residue was left over - it was from the story, not the direction.<br/><br/>
Requiem was actually incredibly romanticized.  Idealistic.  People with their heads in the clouds, carefree and terrified to take on responsibilities.  Everybody was a victim.  Passive.  Sucking pity from their bad luck cows for all it was worth.  Pouty kids afraid of the real world.  Afraid of work. ""It's a b---- out there"" I believe were the exact words.  Hey, it took you this long to figure that out?  This is new to you? You think the world owes you something?  Wake up and smell the system.<br/><br/>
By the end, each character is impaled with cold, hard reality.  A metaphor for life always slapping the daydreaming escapist in the face.  And the movie ends and we are forced to mourn.  But grieve for what -- the four fools?  Babies in a world of wolves resistant in converting to maturity.<br/><br/>
What did Aronofsky add to Requiem?  Just another MTV music video for the doper.  An organically motivated skip-fest interested in everything from the mundane to the outrageous.  But there is compassion - in all the mistakes and humiliation, a subtle glow of empathy haunts the film like a possessive ghost.  Requiem could have been creepy.  Perverted, disturbing and hard to watch.  But instead it had a relatively main-stream focus.  Pulling out before we couldn't handle it.  Leaving all the bad stuff to be insinuated. Moments of talent, but no limits were pushed.  But I suppose that is the practical approach, since all movies are so commercialized today that once a director finally breaks into the business, (s)he is terrified to gamble that safety for the sake of true cinematic exhilaration. <br/><br/>And what exactly was so original?  The editing tricks?  That clichÃ© dock hallucination?  That Smashing Pumpkins video rip-off effect?  Pupils dilating?  That cult of geriatrics?  Intimate human drama impresses me. Flying pastries do not."

The most outstanding thing about Requiem for a Dream is not the plot or characters. What is exceptional is the cinematography. Aronofsky does an excellent job of producing the feeling of simulacrum. You almost feel as though you as a viewer are doing the drugs and living the dream.The sheer intensity of this film caused myself and coharts to spiral into heart palpatations. I found myself so unsettled that I could hardly sit still.<br/><br/>Ellen Burstyn phenomenal acting left me with a lasting impression of true feministic crisis of Talmudic proportion (i.e. Eve and the cynic apple).<br/><br/>disappointment...<br/><br/>Though I understand stories and movies alike only have so many motifs in which to work with, I am truly bored with movies diverging into the drug world. <br/><br/>Four dreams seem to be highlighted to me...television star/the beauty incarnate of the American woman(i.e. low fat)...the marriage crisis of nuclear families...the need for sedation to be a coplacent citizen...and the necessity of wealth. All of these dreams seem to be bent on stereotypical necessities. These necessities of course being strictly or seemingly created by American ideology.<br/><br/>So I am fascinated that the idea that narcotics are a key (although obviously presented as the wrong key) to the satiation of the American dream. Rather droll to me...I wonder did Aronofsky work with DEA on the production of this film. Some balance would be encouraging to me (although one could argue that the girlfriend who was satiated at the sacrifice of her body could be interpreted as positive...perhaps a pan sexual entity such as Walt Whitman might view it as so romantic). <br/><br/>conclusion...<br/><br/>All in all I though this movie was a masterpiece. I simply have questions about the validity of the overall impression that the movie leaves you with. I am not blind however and understand that this opinion is subjective."

If you've seen ""Pi"" and like that style of film, see it.  If you're looking for something that will make you laugh or cry or angry or awestruck, or something that has a story to tell, or something with characters you can relate to or empathize with, do yourself a favor and pass on ""Requiem for a Dream."""

The film made an attempt to reach the inner core of the novel but in doing so it lacked focus, characterization, emotional content,acting choices and a general sense of the confusion the novel suggested.  Visually the film lacked the subtlety needed to suggest a drowning in the maelstrom the character fell into.  Special eefects were admirable but detracted from any sense of story-telling.  even though the novel is written through a stream-of consciousness flavor that I enjoyed, the film fell flat in suggesting the increasing horror the characters face. The only redeeming scene with any flavor of the book was the altercation between Harry and Sara about her addiction.

The visuals were shocking and provocative. A husband and wife sitting behind us left when they showed the arm. But they wouldn't have left if they had cared what happened. I understand that Aronofsky is showing the inevitable emptiness that results from long term drug addiction, but why make a movie that's only purpose is to show that drugs are bad? The first half of the film was much more playful, with the charcters imaginings, with Sara's hope of making it on TV, but as soon as I knew there was no hope, that nothing new and creative was going to happen, I lost interest. It creates martyrs out of its characters, which coupled with Jared Leto, Marlon Wayons, and Jennifer Connelly's aesthetic beauty - sensationalizes drug use.
