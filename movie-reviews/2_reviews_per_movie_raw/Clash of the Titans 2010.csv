"MR_Heraclius","6","37","40","23 February 2020"," Not as good as the classic Clash of the Titans
","The Clash of the Titans remade is more like a brute version of it. It's fun but its a mess. It's more of a spectacle rather than telling a story bout the whole mythology epic with its characters though I'm seeing a lot of CGI extravaganza with over the top results which my eyes are bleeding like hell . This is one of those films where there are a lot of super good casts in a bad production."
"Apemangalore","4","330","462","2 April 2010"," Occasionally entertaining, yet ultimately hollow
","Ah, the pre-summer action movie. Admittedly, due to word of mouth from those who had attended earlier screenings of the film, my expectations for Clash of the Titans were fairly low. On top of that, many of the initial casting choices appeared to be somewhat suspect. So, what's my verdict? Well, I didn't hate it <br/><br/>The plot of Titans is extremely straightforward – practically to a fault. Often, the film acts as though it's in a hurry, attempting to get from one action sequence to the next as quickly as possible. The scenes that occur in between each of these battles ultimately amount to nothing more than brief segments of exposition delivered by Perseus' ""guardian angel"" of sorts, Io (Gemma Arterton). So, while the film never really drags, it feels very soulless.<br/><br/>And while we're on the subject of these action sequences, none of them end up being particularly memorable. About half of them are so frenetic to the point where they're almost disorienting - honestly, I'm glad that the 3D screenings were sold out this time 'round. On top of that, there's virtually no character development outside of Worthington's character (and even he isn't all that likable), so I never really cared about the outcome of these action sequences either. Also, as I mentioned earlier, my biggest fear with Titans was in regards to the acting, and thankfully, most of the cast do what's expected of them. Neeson's Zeus aside, none of the performances truly stand out, but they're nothing cringe-worthy either.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Clash of the Titans ends up being a forgettable piece of entertainment with a couple of gaping plot holes, hit-or-miss action sequences, and performances that fail to leave much of an impression. It's not horrible – just hollow."
"bryanchristopher11","2","271","399","2 April 2010"," Garbage from beginning to end
","There are SPOILERS here, so beware....<br/><br/>I remember years ago, a friend and I discussing how awesome a remake of Clash of the Titans would be. 10 years later this comes along. The remake deviates way too much from the original. I get the attempt to make a stand alone movie, but this remake is pointless. In the original, the whole journey is for one reason only: Love. Perseus is attempting to save Andromeda from the wrath of the Gods. The remake makes it a journey based only on revenge. Perseus in the original was a young, naive boy who discovers his inner hero. The remake shows Perseus as a defiant muscle-bound idiot who automatically has the kind of skill the warriors he travels with have devoted their lives to attaining. in the original, Perseus had to tame and gain the trust of Pegasus. Not here.... he just shows up. Convenient. Bubo, the golden owl (as cheesy as he was) is nothing more than a sight gag in the remake. Calibos poses no threat here. He was such an integral part of the original. The addition of the character Io is just annoying. Her presence is completely unnecessary. The Medusa training/seduction scene...ridiculous. The Medusa scene was easily the best part of the original... here it is anti-climatic. The Kraken? Besides the creature being way too big, the whole movie hinges on what a threat this monster is. Yeah, it looks cool (I'll give it that)... but for being such a threatening monster, he sure is dispatched easily. Perseus spends more time chasing a blurry harpy around than actually dealing with the Kraken. Perseus's relationship to Andromeda is nothing more than casual, the 3-D and slow motion are pointless and there is no giant vulture. Sam Worthington should not be allowed to work again until he can do so without his accent. The director, Louis Leterrier is just the wrong person for this job. Transporter 2...sure. This? No. Liam Neeson, Pete Postlethwait and Ralph Fiennes are truly slumming it on this one. I'm sure no matter what is said, people are going to line up for this one. I'm aware of how I sound here. But this movie truly is a let down on every level. While they had the chance to make a fun popcorn movie in the vein of Jurassic Park, Iron Man or even Star Trek (2009), they really missed the mark here. The film is terribly cast, acted and directed. A true waste of the title... but, hey... it sure looks pretty, doesn't it?"
"blackmambamark","6","218","324","2 April 2010"," Just your basic, run of the mill, average action movie........at best.
","Is it wrong to remake a movie just so you can update its special effects? Hollywood doesn't seem to think so. The classic claymation and stop motion sequences of old are some of the first things we think about when bringing up the subject of mythology movies. But one still cannot help but think how totally awesome it would look if it were updated.<br/><br/>Anyone who has ever read mythology knows that every single tale is of epic preportions. And by epic, i don't just mean the battle sequences......im looking more towards the actual time line. Each individual book always tells a story of one mans struggle against countless odds that stretch over a long period of time. So normally about halfway through, you begin to say to yourself ""How much more can this guy take?"". And in saying that, i think that is where this movie failed. I didn't feel hatred towards these gods. I didn't feel the need to have my thirst for revenge quenched. I didn't feel sorry for the main character Perseus.......because i didn't feel any depth to his character or the plot. This movie focused way to much on the action scenes, as opposed to the story.........which is suppose to be epic, right? But yes, the action sequences are really great, and the scenes with Medusa and the Kraken are awesome. But thats all i can really give to this film. It just felt empty.<br/><br/>The transitions between each action scene were really poor. You can tell that the director was trying his hardest to make you feel for these characters by adding one or two lines of pathetic dialogue. And since we are on the subject of dialogue......man it was bad. There was no emotionality, all the little tid bits of humor fell flat at every turn. It was like Michael Bay wrote the dialogue.<br/><br/>Bottom Line, this is just your basic, run of the mill, average action movie........at best. This is certainly not one of those movies that you will be telling your friends about the next day. Its action is really good, its story is bland, its dialogue is weak........all things that i really wouldn't consider epic. Also, and this is important for you people who are tight on money. This is the first time i have ever said this, but please, do not see this movie in 3-D. It is a giant waste of money. You will get the same satisfaction seeing it in regular 2-D........trust me. There really was no point in making this movie in 3-D at all, other than to squeeze every dollar they can out of a average action flick."
"fwomp","1","86","125","11 April 2010"," Release The Crappen!
","And once again Hollywood proves it has run out of original ideas. Why else would they remake this movie? Back in 1981, when special effects were beginning to take serious root in films, we had the original CLASH OF THE TITANS. It had some cheesy claymation mixed with some less cheesy special effects. But it did have a story. A damn good one. Sure there were action sequences, especially when Perseus (Harry Hamlin) met up with Medusa. But these action scenes were barely a few minutes long. The story of the gods, how they felt about humanity (and how humanity felt about them) dominated the storyline. Yes, there was an ACTUAL story.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 2010 and you get this ...this ...this mess-of-a-remake that relies almost solely on CGI and, well, basically nothing else.<br/><br/>The brief understanding of the god/human relationship is thrust aside in favor of action scenes galore which have squat to do with the story. There are so many throwaway characters as to be laughable. And 3-D? For marketing purposes only. Save yourself some cash and see it in 2-D ...if at all.<br/><br/>My son went with me to see it (he's as much of a movie junky as I am) and we both nearly fell asleep for lack of anything approaching a viable understanding of who was carrying the storyline. We still ask each other, ""What was the point, again?"" Sam Worthington seems to be a hot commodity in today's movie market. TERMINATOR SALVATION and AVATAR are two of his more recent accomplishment. And although I found those two to be lukewarm in terms of story, they at least kept me engaged enough not to yawn. And Liam Neeson has also been splattered all over film posters (from TAKEN to KINGDOM OF HEAVEN). But a god? And Zeus for that matter? Not the best casting choice. He just didn't have the presence I was expecting. Perhaps the story (or lack thereof) stifled his performance. Probably.<br/><br/>I also MUST caution women against seeing this if they enjoyed the strong roles in the 1981 original. You'll find no such comparisons here. There's really no good female character to be found. The closest was Alexa Davalos (DEFIANCE) as Perseus' love interest, Andromeda. But her role is so laughably short and misunderstood that you won't care what happens to her (and things do happen).<br/><br/>My final word of caution comes to those of us (all of us) struggling in today's economy. We need our escapism, and sometimes (occasionally) Hollywood allows us to have it. But not here. You might as well sit on the toilet and release the crappen!"
"limgauci","1","46","64","21 April 2010"," One of the worst directions I ever witnessed
","Yesterday I watched Clash of the Titans at a local theatre and I have to be sincere, the direction of the movie was so bad that I was speechless for a few minutes for all the wrong reasons. I'm still trying to understand how someone could leave such a rich tale so undeveloped on every front with 106 mins of running time at his disposal. <br/><br/>It's one of those movies which offer you over 1.5 hours of nothingness. The introduction is insanely rushed as you see the main character go through different stages in his life within 3-4 minutes giving you just enough of each for the director to squeeze in a couple of supposedly memorable quotes regarding the character's destiny (which you forget in about a minute).<br/><br/>Now I have to mention this because my friends seemed to notice this issue too: Worthington stood out like a sore thumb in this movie. He just looked too modern. We agreed that it was due to his look being too 'clean'. His head is shaved (the same exact look he's had in both Terminator Salvation and Avatar, which is just lazy) and his look never changes during his supposedly long (epic?) voyage. No scars, barely a hint of a beard after days of travelling and the occasional fight. I like the actor and I don't think he was miscast but he was not used well imo.<br/><br/>The characters in general were left TOTALLY undeveloped. People walked in, walked out and died throughout the story and you never care about any of them. Important characters go from looking invincible to dying all of a sudden. I'm serious. WHAM! They're dead. Some 'important' characters die so quickly that you're not even sure you understood how they were actually killed.<br/><br/>As I said before, this movie lacked all direction. Some supposedly comic situations begged to be re-shot. The delivery was terrible and the director simply seemed in a rush to wrap things up. Not even the accepted clichés worked well in this movie. One ends up looking at the people sitting next to him to see whether he was supposed to laugh or whether they were sharing his same agony as this mess unfolded. The cuts from one character to another also seemed very odd. You cut from a character,then to another and then back to the first one and each time the character is looking in a completely different direction! It was so surreal, like a low budget 70s movie.<br/><br/>Anyways, this movie has so many problems I can't relate all of them or this review would end up being more epic than the movie itself. I won't even go into how cheap and useless most of the dialogue was or the shocking LACK of action meaning that the first battle, which is supposed to be against minor enemies, ends up being the most noteworthy 'CLASH' in the whole movie!<br/><br/>Bottom line: this movie was a complete mess. The direction was terrible and the story was incredibly boring, leaving some moviegoers asleep as the end credits rolled."
"Maciste_Brother","3","14","17","3 November 2010"," The uneven original is remade into an abysmal, joyless adventure
","Remakes these days are almost always terrible and having seen production photos of COTT before its release, photos that didn't inspire much confidence, I decided not to see the remake on the big screen, opting to wait for it on DVD or download. I always had a love/hate approach to the original which I saw at the cinemas when I was a young teen. So take this as someone who's not a fanatic of the original and was going to hate any remake from the get go. With that said the new film is thoroughly awful in almost every way possible. Except for the beginning (which is OK, not great), the action packed but not suspenseful Medusa scene and the clearly OTT ending, there's nothing much else to see. The entire cast of characters is uniformly unpleasant. Not one likable character in the whole thing, including a growling Perseus (played by one-note Aussie actor Sam Worthington). This is difference with the original. I basically liked almost every characters, no matter how cardboard they were.<br/><br/>Here's a breakdown of the film:<br/><br/><ul><li>the changes to the story (humans vs gods) doesn't make any sense.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Adding the religious/cult storyline with the crazy leader was awful. It added nothing and the character was annoying as hell.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It doesn't really look Greek at all but more Pompeiish than anything else. The design of Argos, though spectacular during the climax, has absolutely nothing to do with Greek design/architecture.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the look and design of Mount Olympus is tacky. Looks like a cheesy sci-fi movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Like the original, the other Gods do not have much to do.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In the original, Perseus had to tame Pegasus which made sense, for a Heroic journey. In the remake, Pegasus, who's black, appears to him and, well, that's it. Totally dull. The original was much better in this regard. And the reason they made Pegasus black because the CGI is more forgiving than if it was white. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the scene with the scorpions doesn't make any sense whatsoever. In the original, the Medusa's blood mutates the scorpions into big monsters but in the remake, Calibos' blood (after his hand was cut off) drips on some sand and the scorpions appear from the ground, killing most of the men from Argos but then Perseus and his men team up with the mysterious beings that use the big scorpions as transportation like nothing had happened! Huh?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the set for the Medusa scene is pretty good and the Medusa is OK as a superfast slithery creature but the scene is more action than suspense. And Sam wears flesh-colored tights during many shots, which makes it look very silly.</li></ul><br/><br/>The ending is so over-the-top that it's almost a thing of beauty. Here's a breakdown:<br/><br/><ul><li>It takes the Kraken 15 minutes to surface. There's slow and slow, but man, that beast is constipated.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Kraken looks like a turtle/octopus/that monster from Return of the Jedi thingy</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The climax occurs during an eclipse. Why?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ending or confrontation between the Kraken and Perseus is ridiculously drawn out, extended by having those winged demons snatch the bag with the head of the Medusa (how did they know what was in the bag?)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the action is often so confusing that the characters have to tell us what's going on such as when the winged demons snatch the bag, Perseus yells that they stole it because we clearly couldn't see what was going on.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Andromeda, which is not the love interest in this version, hangs from the sacrificial altar hundreds of feet above the sea, strung up by her arms, which she never seems to find painful. Unlike other Sword &amp; Sandal films where people were in extreme pain when hanging from their arms, Andromeda is remarkably calm and nonchalant about it all.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When the Kraken becomes a statue, the whole thing is beyond silly. It looks like the monster has a sudden rash. It crumbles from its own weight and Andromeda falls in the ocean and yet Perseus is able to find her underwater amidst the whole chaos. He must have a heat seeking device on him.</li></ul><br/><br/>- Sam Worthington's Aussie accent can be heard throughout the movie. Plus the fact that his hair is not in style with the times, the less time Sam is on screen, the better it is.<br/><br/>The score is totally forgettable, unlike the Laurence Rosenthal score for the original, which is beautiful and soaring.<br/><br/>All in all, this remake is at times so bad that in its own way becomes a thing of beauty. I mean, how can a film get it so wrong on so many levels? Even the brief cameo of Bubo, which was a sight for soar eyes, was mishandled. The film was a huge success and even though the Kraken is dead and the Medusa is headless, Warner has already greenlighted a sequel!<br/><br/>Because of this remake, I have to re-evaluate the original, which, after watching this suddenly comes out as brilliant on almost every level, including the fact that its more in tune with Greek mythology than this unpleasant version. Well, I still find the original uneven at best but it's also more enjoyable, memorable and far sexier too."
"dimitris-tripakis","3","449","720","6 April 2010"," It made me sad watching this ...
","The myth of Perseus is based on deep philosophy and tragic elements, which have been popular throughout the centuries. You may want to Google it and read the original. You might discover a few things that didn't know, for example that there is no Cracken, no scorpions, and that Medusa's head ended up decorating goddess Athena's shield, just as real shields had often Medusa painted, to scare the opponents.<br/><br/>The Cracken and the scorpions were ""invented"" by Ray Harryhausen in 1981, because this was his job: to display fantastic creatures on the screen. In doing so, he based the stories on existing myths, respecting the characters and plots as best as he could. Great work.<br/><br/>Now, why in 2010 they had to copy the copier, and not the original, it is a mystery for me. Scorpions AGAIN ? Cracken AGAIN ? I mean if you're going to deviate from the myth, why not deviate in an ORIGINAL manner ?<br/><br/>Mythology is the legacy of the centuries gone by. Film makers should respect it and learn from it. It's funny how they think they can do better :)"
"Chalice_Of_Evil","7","214","344","31 March 2010"," Mishmash of the Titans...
","I've never seen the 1981 original version of Clash of the Titans. I wasn't originally planning on seeing this new updated version either. Going by the previews, this looked like nothing more than a CGI-fest...which is what it pretty much ended up being. To quote Sam Worthington from various interviews, it's basically him ""in a skirt with a rubber sword, killing monsters"". If you're expecting anything more than that, then yes, you will probably be disappointed.<br/><br/>Some of the cast manage to make the most of what they're given to work with. Having not seen Sam Worthington in anything prior to this film (except Terminator Salvation), I don't really have anything to compare his acting to. He was good in Terminator Salvation and he's good in this as well (despite the occasional slip-up of his accent). He serves his purpose as Perseus, playing the action hero well enough. His interaction with the humans who accompany him on his journey is probably the most entertaining part of the film. Mads Mikkelsen, who was a memorable villain in Casino Royale, actually gets to play a fairly decent good guy in this film (Draco). Sure, it's the role of the typical grumpy guy (who's reluctant to follow the ""saviour"" and is a bit of a bully) teaching the hero how to fight and who eventually comes around to respecting the hero and ending up on good terms with him...but Mads manages to make his role a bit more than a cardboard cutout, thankfully. The other men who accompany Perseus aren't too bad either (they do provide a bit of humour), but they're not given much character development at all. Actually, there's very little development for any of the characters.<br/><br/>As far as the gods are concerned, they're basically just a bunch of folk who stand around in Cloud City (I mean Olympus) and talk. Liam Neeson isn't given a whole lot to work with as Zeus (shining in his silver armour as brightly as Marlon Brando did in the original Superman movie wearing his tinfoil costume). Ralph Fiennes, while good, is kind of irritating with his raspy voice as Hades (though, thankfully, that goes away by the end). The rest of the gods have jack squat to do or say. <br/><br/>I really didn't like Jason Flemyng's satyr character. Alexa Davalos pretty much just plays the damsel in distress in the movie and leaves very little impression as Andromeda. Gemma Arterton (as Io), however, proves to be the most successful female character in the movie. As a sort of angel on Perseus's shoulder, she guides him, teaches him and actually proves *useful*. Her and Worthington work well together/have good chemistry and I enjoyed watching the two of them share scenes. I was happy with how they ended up in the film.<br/><br/>As for the FX, the previews basically give it all away (Clash of the CGI might have been more befitting a title for the film). Perseus fights giant scorpions, Perseus fights the Kraken and Perseus fights Medusa. As large-scale as the Kraken was, I personally enjoyed Medusa more. The fight with her proved to be the most interesting of the many fights in the film. I liked the 'look'/design for her and I also really enjoyed Pegasus, the flying horse. <br/><br/>I'll just come right out and say it: the movie has many a flaw. The story isn't great, the pace is off, the writing is slapdash and most of the dialogue is sketchy at best. While the movie does try to get across a message, it comes through in a somewhat haphazard sort of way. Having said that, if you go into this film not expecting much more than a Monster Mash of the Titans...then hopefully it should prove to be entertaining enough. <br/><br/>Crap of the Titans? Not quite. But at the same time, it's kind of forgettable. As Worthington describes it, it's a ""popcorn flick"". Take from that what you will."
"jlcdrama","2","66","102","2 April 2010"," Clash of the Plot Holes!!!
","I would like to start off by apologizing to all of the people who I assumed were giving this movie poor reviews out of loyalty for the original. Honestly, they weren't harsh enough.<br/><br/>This movie was awful, I couldn't believe how terrible it was. This has nothing to do with the fact that the movie was not at all faithful to the actual myth of Perseus. As you will recall, the original Clash of the Titans resembled very little of the myth. However, the original movie had deeply involved characters, an interesting plot that was well written and some decent action and special effects.<br/><br/>What did this remake have? I'll tell you. It had plot holes big enough for a barge to fit through, worthless characters who did nothing to help what little plot was there and a rather disappointing ending.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with baby Perseus being found by a fisherman after he and his mother Danae were thrown into the sea. Danae died, but Perseus survived. The fisherman raised Perseus with his wife and later his daughter. When Perseus is grown, Hades attacks his family (for no real reason than just because he could) while at the same time the kingdom of Argos is declaring war on the gods (once again for no real reason than because they could). Perseus is saved and is told by Hades that Zeus is his father. (Why Hades would do that, I have no idea.) Up on Olympus, Zeus is apparently finding out for himself that he has a demigod son which makes no sense because Zeus is the creator of Men, he would HAVE to be aware that he has a son.<br/><br/>Because of Argos's sudden desire to attack Zeus, Hades declares that he will release the Kraken on them in ten days. They will only be spared by letting Andromeda be sacrificed to the Kraken. Again, this didn't make sense. If Hades was mad at Argos, he wouldn't give them a way out, he would just destroy the kingdom. In the original story the sacrifice of Andromeda was brought on because of Cassiopeia's vanity and the insult it delivered Thetis. Here, it was just like Hades thought it would be fun to see Andromeda chained to rock. <br/><br/>Perseus agrees to help Argos not because of love for Andromeda, but because he wants revenge against the gods. At this point, Io shows up and talks a lot. That is pretty much all Io does throughout the movie is talk. My guess is that the writers wanted to introduce a strong woman to the plot, instead what they introduced was a wasted character who actually had no business being in the myth.<br/><br/>Hades meets up with Calibos and reveals his master plot to take over Olympus. Huh, where have I seen this before? Oh yeah, that's right in Hercules. It's a sad day when an action movie has to steal the plot of a Disney movie because they can't come up with anything on their own.<br/><br/>What follows is a lot of action scenes which aren't half bad, but are pretty worthless because they slow down the story. To be fair, there isn't much of a story to slow down. They kill off several characters who mattered to nothing during the fight with Medusa. After Medusa is killed, Calibos kills Io. I know that her death was supposed to be meaningful to Perseus, but it just seemed odd. Their interactions before were not very intimate, in fact there was only one scene that could be construed as some what romantic. <br/><br/>Pegasus appears from no where and takes Perseus to Argos where the Kraken is being released. The battle between the Kraken and Perseus consists of the Kraken ripping down some buildings for about two minutes then Perseus turns him into stone with the head of Medusa. Then he sends Hades back to the Underworld, my what marvelous revenge. You did a bad thing Hades, now you go home. Yawn. <br/><br/>Perseus saves Andromeda and then leaves her on a beach to go to some worthless rock in the ocean. Unlike in the original, Perseus does not fall in love with Andromeda. It wasn't a shock since Andromeda did basically nothing useful except for give bread to children and dangle a hundred feet over the ocean. <br/><br/>Perseus then meets Zeus who suddenly seems pleased with his son though Mankind still hates the gods. He then brings Io back to life so she and Perseus can be worthless forever.<br/><br/>I gave this movie two stars because there were only two things good about it: the CGI and the music. I'll stick to the original movie because while the graphics aren't as good as the remake, at least I actually care for the characters and the storyline makes sense."
"nkaronis1","3","273","467","2 April 2010"," 3D ripoff
","This film would have been in line with Louis Leterrier's previous work: highly enjoyable high octane action movies that even adults can appreciate. Then somewhere along the lines, the greedy and short sighted producers decided to cash-in a meager few extra bucks by ""converting"" into 3D a movie shot in 2D. The result is fake at best with fuzzy, dark and double edged images. For most of the movie you'll feel the urge to remove your glasses. Too bad for the decent cast (special kudos to Mads Mikkelsen as usual), nice photography and music by a promising newcomer Ramin Djawadi.

"ailexq","8","19","26","4 April 2010"," It's what it promised to be.
","People who went in to this movie expecting an accurate depiction of Greek mythology and/or an accurate remake of the original Clash should have paid more attention to the previews. First off, the original movie wasn't even correct with regards to the mythology. Yes, it was much closer than this rendition, but given that the whole story of Perseus and Medusa were never really quite ""on"" in either case, I don't see how deviation from the original Greek myths is a fair argument against this movie.<br/><br/>Clash 2010 promised to be an action/adventure set in the world of the Greek myths - and it delivered. It was fun, fresh, and to be honest, I thought Sam Worthington did just fine as Perseus. Let's face it - the guy (Perseus) was never a ""deep"" character to begin with, and Worthington did a hell of a lot more with his character than Hamlin ever did.<br/><br/>The ""new"" stories they created with these characters, while not to be taken seriously or as a replacement of their correct myths, were still enjoyable. In fact, I really rather liked it - some differences were so far off that they don't even count as ""inconsistencies,"" but rather complete rewrites. And given that, the rewrites were okay - I preferred the love interest in this scenario over the first movie, even though correct Greek mythology says ""WHAT?"" to it. Kind of a big obvious sign that one should not be taking this movie as a serious depiction. Anyway, it was fun to squint and be like, ""that's... not.... okay, I'm hitting Wikipedia when I get home."" Because then I got to refresh my memory on why I loved Greek mythology so much as a child in the first place.<br/><br/>I didn't feel the 3D experience was really necessary, although I'd have to see it in 2D to tell for certain if it added much. The effect itself wasn't huge, but maybe it added to the overall visual crispness of the movie. But really you could probably get away with seeing it in 2D and not miss much, whereas Avatar and Alice In Wonderland really made lovely use of the medium and ""should be"" seen in 3D.<br/><br/>Overall, while I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, as a big fan of the original movie I wasn't at all offended or disappointed, mainly because I wasn't expecting a perfect remake. Sure, when the trailers first came out I was hopeful, but after seeing enough previews it became clear it was going to be a bit different. Oh well, now we have two fun Clash of the Titans movies.<br/><br/>All in all, ""It didn't suck,"" and it should be seen on the big screen."

","Is worst than I expected. I walked into the theater ready to see a bad remake of one of my favorite movies of all times, but this movie was a lot worse than I could even imagine. It wasn't half the movie and my wife wanted to leave the theater, and how can you blame her? Since you heard the narration at the beginning of the movie you got that feeling: ""there is something wrong here"". And that feeling just grow every single minute while you watch the movie. The whole plot of the movie is based on the hate and resentment of the human against the Gods? In the original movie, Perseus grows to be a hero because of love and because this was his destiny. In this movie Perseus is just a guy with bad attitude who suddenly changes from a fisher man to a one man army with a huge ego.<br/><br/>It turns out that everyone knows but Zeus knows that Perseus was his son, it doesn't make any sense to me. The only thing they respected from the original version was the name of the characters, and they added a lot of unnecessary ones: Io? The Hunters? The Genies? The crazy preacher at Argos? <br/><br/>This was just an awful movie; they destroyed one of my favorite movies with this remake. What was the deal with the joke about Bubo? I feel it like an insult to the original movie.

So...I walk into the theater with my 3-D glasses on my head, holding my $5 popcorn and get ready to watch my favorite childhood movie and...and...and...oh no. Oh no. This is awful. I sat through the movie wondering why I don't care about any of these characters. On top of that, I'm wondering why I spent the extra money to see it in 3-D. The best 3-D effects came during the opening credits. Other than that, I could have thrown the glasses away. Now I know why James Cameron is not a big fan of making films 3-D after the fact. To make a long story short, I was incredibly disappointed. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Go see the original ""Clash of the Titans"" if you want to lose yourself in a good movie. After seeing this one all I could think of was ""oh how the mighty titans have fallen."""

","3D is not perfect. Avatar may have shown its full potential whilst Alice in Wonderland and How to Train Your Dragon have continued to prove it can be utilised successful, but if not given the time and effort it requires, the third dimension on screen can actually detract from the movie. Unfortunately this is the case here. The last-minute decision by the filmmakers to add the extra dimension feels tacky and lazy. The objects in the foreground don't seamlessly meld with those in the background and a lot of the action is blurry and unfocused. The desert-brown palate is dimmed even more by the glasses – something the aforementioned movies could cope with due to their vibrant colours – and all of the wide shots are blotchy at best.<br/><br/>It's a shame really as some of the action scenes are quite impressive and boast fairly decent special effects. The various creatures we encounter aren't quite always photo-real, although the sheer size of them – especially the tentacular Kraken – are impressive enough to wash away any glaring flaws. However seeing as this blockbuster lives and dies by its amped up, large-scaled sequences – the screenplay is utter tripe and doesn't even bother to try to make the links between the action interesting or reasonable – it regrettably falls on its own sword, thanks once again to the indolent 3D. Take that away and you might actually be able to enjoy the CGI and the ridiculously big set-pieces with the picture clarity they deserve.<br/><br/>New Aussie on the block, Worthington, takes a misstep in his recently flourishing career; his acting is wooden and unconvincing. It doesn't help that Perseus is a massively underwritten role and only requires Worthington to look good and occasionally mutter something heroic. Neeson and Fiennes come across as cheesy in their roles of Zeus and Hades respectively, their experienced acting chops can't save them from atrocious wigs and laughable costumes. Standing out – which isn't overly hard to be honest – is Arterton and Mikkelsen, they give decent performances as the heavenly Io and the disgruntled Draco.<br/><br/>If you must see this on the big screen then do yourself a favour and see it in normal 2D. Or, even better, just wait to rent it on Blu-Ray.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

","By remaking The Clash Of The Titans the director, actors/actresses and all those involved are opening up opportunity for comparison to the original. There's no denying that, so that's the angle I view it from.<br/><br/>The Original is dated now, in so far as the effects department is concerned, which is hardly surprising given year of release. That aside though, the nineteen eighty one version is a classic, memorable slice of mythological nostalgia, something the remake will not be in twenty nine years time.<br/><br/>For me its flaws are many, but the most notable are the scene choices of the director and the lazy reliance on CGI.<br/><br/>Where are the elements that made the original story so compelling? The riddles of Calibos, delivered to the dreaming Andromeda, Perseus falling in love with her (the REASON for his quest in the first instance), the politics of the gods and their chess-piece-like manipulation of the mortals who worship them.<br/><br/>Instead we have an inaccurate tale, rushed through in small, stuttering scenes, and lacking in any creativity of its own.<br/><br/>The actors/actresses assembled make a fine cast-reading, but are universally wasted in their chosen roles. None of the gravitas of the original is conveyed by any character in this version.<br/><br/>The CGI further reduces the movie's impact. The mythological beasts look cartoonish, and hardly befitting an epic tale of such importance. Look to the original yet again to see how, even stop-motion triumphs over CGI. In particular the scene in Medusa's lair is tense in the nineteen eighty one showing, contrasting greatly with the routine, ridiculous remake.<br/><br/>That's not to say that CGI cannot work. Jurrasic Park is a rare example of effects being used well.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington, quickly becoming a name to avoid movies by, has a character arc that is almost non-existent, such is the hurry to transform him from fisherman to warrior. Notice the fact also that he requires no training to wield a sword skillfully! All things considered, the original will remain a classic for some time, despite the ropey effects, while the remake will be quickly forgotten by a fickle audience looking for the next CGI bonanza.<br/><br/>Just as Avatar before it, Clash Of The Titans 2010 is a simple money-making machine, not concerned for a moment with anything close to an imagination or REAL characters. Or for that matter, with any heart.<br/><br/>It will gross vast sums of money nonetheless, which further proves that the public don't really want creative or intelligent movies (Moon, Pans Labyrinth, Amelie) but are content to settle for 'plastic' and patronising movies that dis-encourage thinking."
"Ajax1609","1","38","60","5 April 2010"," Pretty Terrible (and not Terribly Pretty either)
","Whilst waiting for this film to come out I must admit that I nursed a growing sense of expectancy: the cast seemed strong; the original film has achieved cult status; the storyline is a classic dating back to Ancient Greece and from the trailers it looked aesthetically pleasing. In my naivety I couldn't see where Hollywood could go wrong, after all it's never let us down in the past! Right?! <br/><br/>With this being said, I was therefore completely taken aback when the final credits rolled on this dismal, dithering train-wreck of a film. Before I critique this film though I must warn you that there are possible spoilers below, so if you are definitely going to watch this film don't read on! <br/><br/>I find it difficult to know where to start with this film, I think I'll first outline the few positives: The CGI (especially of the Kraken) is very impressive, Gemma Arterton is a stone cold fox, it has a beginning, a middle and an end. There, that's just about it.<br/><br/>Now for the negatives: The dialogue is corny, unlovable, embarrassing to watch at times and so contrived that it actually makes you uncomfortable, the exact same can be said of Sam Worthington and pretty much every other character in this tripe. The plot seems to make no sense as the Director spends next to no time on the background to the story, things just seem to happen randomly and for no reason that you particularly care about. The action scenes are as boring and predictable as you could possibly imagine, the giant scorpions in particular had me yawning. I'm not even exaggerating.<br/><br/>On top of that I found myself not caring at all if the island gets destroyed at the end by the Kraken, as both Perseus and Andromeda are so bland and shallow as characters that I felt no connection with them whatsoever. The 3D is also below-par, with everything appearing blurry and unfocused, and it just seems like an unnecessary gimmick that was added on as an afterthought. The finale is also abysmal to the point of incredulity, I point to the fact that Perseus spends more time chasing down one of those Hades-bird-creatures than actually trying to kill the massive titan currently hell-bent on destroying a civilisation. I also point to the cringe-inducing ""comic relief"" of the scorpion, ridden by two instantly forgettable characters, helping out Perseus by killing one of the Hades-monster things. <br/><br/>My last point is focused at the anti-climactic defeat of the Kraken, I mean just showing it the head? Is that really all it takes? A titan which was powerful enough for Gods to fear it, being killed by a frightful stare? I know that was consistent with the original storyline but it was very disappointing all the same and you're left thinking... was that it? <br/><br/>This film is another black mark on the copybook that is Hollywood high budget rubbish. Clash of the Titans would fit in nicely alongside The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor and Transformers 2 as an example of how a big budget can totally ruin, instead of enhancing a cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Go see the formidable and wonderful How to Train Your Dragon instead of this sleazy, rambling, thoughtless, shallow, pedantic embarrassment of a film."

","I saw Clash of the Titans in an early screening, and I didn't expect the film to be good. I thought it was just another ripoff. But at the end of the film I was really liked it. The creatures looked great, the acting was good. And I thought it would be corny, but the majority of it wasn't at all. I am actually really glad that I saw this film. I really think Sam Worthington did an okay job as an actor, it was certainly believable. If he keeps doing films like Avatar and Clash of the Titans, he could have a long career in his life.<br/><br/>The special effects and the CGI was okay. However there was some disappointments, the Kraken scene felt very rushed and it wasn't as epic as I wanted it to. There should've been more fighting scenes to make up for the poor story.<br/><br/>An overall fun, good CGI film that is recommended. 7/10"
"DICK STEEL","5","143","258","1 April 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Clash of the Titans
","Clash of the Titans is one of the earliest films I can remember having watched it as a kid in a big theatre, not the multiplexes we have today, and I liked it so much, it probably ranks up there as one film that I've watched the most times, on television reruns, or off a recorded video tape. The story's fairly simple, but to a kid it had plenty of charm, and a basic 101 guide to Greek mythology, of which the promiscuity of the Greek gods struck me as quite odd, save for the need to produce plenty of demi-god heroes from which stories are spun of.<br/><br/>Percy Jackson probably drew first blood in saturating the market about the new adventures of a fresh teenage demi-god, having him battle creatures similar to those found in this mythology. In fact, Clash of the Titans would find it difficult to beat the fun factor of the original film, and the modernized spin that Percy Jackson had to offer. There's little story here, and everything that happened was a sad excuse to get the story quickly moving onto the next big set action sequence. Lead character motivations had been changed significantly, especially with Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) being nothing more than a flower vase, and having her romantic subplot with our hero Perseus (Sam Worthington) being totally removed. I felt that was the first sign of narrative trouble.<br/><br/>Then it became more generic approaches in how to string the action scenes one after another. Each battle will last a significant amount of time, then a little more posturing, before going onto the next. It can easily be split into this sequence of scorpions-medusa- kraken, and each creature design was a shadow to predecessors like Scorpionok's attack in Transformers, Uma Thurman's rendition of Medusa, and Hollywood's Godzilla flop, coming complete with that foam on water approach to the mainland.<br/><br/>If anyone wants to make a film about a hybrid character, then look no further than Sam Worthington, who has been half man half machine in Terminator: Salvation, half man half Na'vi in Avatar, and now, half-man half-god who's tasked to save Andromeda of Argos from being monster sacrifice, should he be able to defeat Hades' Kraken, the source of his power and threat to mankind. Worthington seems pigeon-holed into these kinds of role, and because of Hollywood's current dearth of worthy action heroes, Worthington becomes the latest It boy with his physique and perpetual scowl, being suited perfectly well into this scarcity of actors who can act with their fists, without the compelling need to launch into lengthy dialogue as a professional and career development.<br/><br/>Otherwise the other star studded cast don't do much but pose and prance about in their costumes, with Liam Neeson looking constricted by his Zeus armour, Ralph Fiennes playing Voldermort all over again with his rendition of Hades, and Mads Mikkelsen as Drago the Argos general who has the nicest smirk caught on screen. Gemma Arterton is a surprise inclusion in the film as Io the immortal, which is a new character and given a lot more significance in the mythos now, and is in part one of the major changes in Perseus philosophy, tutoring and motivation, so much so that if I were to use a modern term, the word ""cougar"" would suit their relationship just fine.<br/><br/>And it is these kinds of little artistic license taken, that will likely leave the purist in you perturbed. Bobo the Golden Owl has a quick cameo to appease fans, but like the gods who are never satisfied with the pittance of worship obtained from the humans, we too think that it's not enough, since Pegasus too went through a none too subtle change in skin colour. Sorry, but to me, Pegasus the winged horse, will forever remain white. There are a few conversational pieces in the film that brilliantly introduces us to the world of the jealous Greek gods and they work wonderfully, such as their innate differences and why the brothers Zeus and Hades hate each other so much, but some were rather cringeworthy, especially when modern curses somehow found their place in a swords and sandals film as this.<br/><br/>I suppose you'll know by now that the film was never shot using 3D technology, and that it was only during post production, thanks to the mega box office success of Avatar, when it was decided to have a 3D version made for this film as well. The result? Millions spent enhancing nothing. Sure there's depth of field, but nothing to wow a jaded audience familiar with what a 3D film is expected to bring to the table. In fact, this film would be better off seen in a digital 2D format, since none of the action sequence even had a whiff of a suggestion of being in your face, since after all, it was conceptualized for a flat presentation.<br/><br/>Bottom line, it's extremely sterile and devoid of soul, whereas the original film had plenty of heart, and charming stop motion special effects to alleviate it to cult status. This one will likely be forgotten since it's nothing more than mediocre drama and ordinary set action pieces, though I will not deny that its marketing would ensure that it will garner some decent cash from the Easter holiday market segment. The original is so much better since this is all generic action and little charm."
"bob the moo","Null","8","10","18 November 2010"," Plenty of CGI and noise fills the time left by an absence of anything else
","The original film is a nostalgic mix of mechanical owls, Division One footballer haircuts and lumbering beasts in my head – no more than that. I'm sure if you put me on the spot to comment on it I would have fond things to say but perhaps this is only due to the passage of time. Perhaps the original Clash of the Titans was nothing more than a rather wooden effects movie like this remake is – but yet for some reason the 1981 film is given praise for it and this remake was battered for doing just that. Well, I don't have enough memory to be able to compare and contrast so I will just focus on what I watched last night.<br/><br/>It is just what it suggests it will be by producing endless CGI beasts and effects in one serviceable action sequence after another. I only saw it in 2D (3D still not really attracting me) but I have to admit that the size of the creatures and so on was impressive even if only in terms of being to see all that money up there on the screen. Of course this is not the same as saying as the film is particularly good – because it isn't really - it is only ""OK"". Part of the problem is that it is a very hollow movie; everything looks pretty good on the surface of it technically, but there is nothing below this. I'm not suggesting that the film must be some worthy epic with layering and character depth, but to be honest I would have settled for a bit of fun or a bit of actual excitement rather than just lots of things to look at. As it is though the film is all about the effects and nothing else is really forthcoming.<br/><br/>You can see this in the cast – not so much their names (because there are some big names in here) but more in their performances. Worthington is a solid actor and good looking guy – that is what he brings to the table and in this film he probably does enough with that. Neeson and Fiennes have nothing to do – Fiennes in particular looks awkward and uneasy with his character and it is clear this film is a ""job"" to him rather than a project. Flemyng is OK under all that makeup while Atherton is pretty but pointless. None of this is a surprise though, it is not a film for actors but rather for effects.<br/><br/>Clash of the Titans is a shrug of a film. If you are looking for undemanding noise that will not tax you one bit mentally but will provide big creatures and spectacle to stare at then this will do the job. It won't do the job particularly well, but it will do it and then move on – you'll have forgotten it within a week though as generally it doesn't have much special or of interest about it."
"linktowhat","1","15","22","5 April 2010"," Rantings From My Inner Nerd
","Hollywood got it all wrong. The story is so distorted in this new version, it makes the movie awful. The 3D was awful, and I found myself squinting at times just to see (3D glasses make the screen darker). Here are some things that I found perplexing in this film: <br/><br/>Why was it necessary to kill Perseus's mother in the beginning? Her predicament was the reason Perseus set out on his adventure.<br/><br/>Why would Hades begin a spree like that of a serial killer? The three brothers, Poseidon, Zeus, and Hades, decided amongst themselves who would rule what--there was no trickery involved.<br/><br/>Why was the Kracken (sea monster) a ""child"" of Hades? It came from the sea, so should it not have been Poseidon's ""child?"" It was Andromeda's parents who angered Poseidon, and caused the Gods to send the sea monster to destroy their city.<br/><br/>Why was it necessary to add the ""cougar-like"" character Io? It was Athena who coached Perseus on where to find the necessary equipment to defeat Medusa.<br/><br/>Why were additional new characters added--the black magic beings in the desert? They look like something stolen from Star Wars (Tusken Raiders, perhaps).<br/><br/>Why was a task from the myth of Psyche and Eros stolen and used in this film? What am I talking about you ask? Perseus never bribed the ferryman, Charon, to get to the underworld. Psyche bribed Charon to complete an impossible task given to her by Aphrodite. Does Hollywood think no one reads anymore or that no one will notice the stealing of material from another myth? (This really angered me) Why the team of men to defeat Medusa? It would have been much more interesting to see Perseus using the winged sandals, mirrored shield, sword, and helmet of invisibility that were given to him. If Hollywood wanted to add-lib, why not add in Medusa's sisters after her decapitation? Pegasus was born of the blood of Medusa and Poseidon. The winged sandals made Perseus's get-away easy, not Pegasus. Why the color change for Pegasus? Why was Zeus wrapped in a glowing tin foil looking war suit? Andromeda became Perseus's mate, not the ""cougar"" Io. Why was it necessary to change that? Why, why, why? There are many other distortions of the story in this new movie that irk me; I will just stop here. I should have known better... to expect more of Hollywood was foolish of me."

","Think of the worst film you have ever seen. Now double it. That film is Citizen Kane compared to this utter dross. This film is so bad I almost don't know where to begin. Firstly the 3D is the worst I have yet seen in a movie. It's blurry, dark, the 3D effect makes things just behind the forefront - like people's ears and the back portion of their heads look really huge and fake. The special effects are pretty bad, with poor CGI. The gods look like rejects from a kids TV version of King Arthur, stomping around in glowing gold armour that is 1500 years too late for the period when the film is supposed to be set (yes I know it's a fantasy, but it's still set in Ancient Greece). Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson are incredibly hammy and unbelievable, especially Fiennes who comes across like a villain from a Kid's TV show.<br/><br/>The script is wooden, the editing is poor, with some serious plot holes. The casting is dreadful, with the heroes mostly spindly with puny arms and legs, that don't look at all believable. Jason Flemyng is sooo bad as Calibos, who was a very menacing figure in the original, despite being made of modelling clay (and much more scary than Flemyng in the remake). The acting is also very poor, but the worst problem of all is the atrocious Sam ""the woodsman"" Worthington.<br/><br/>His Aussie accent sounds totally absurd in Anciert Greece, he looks flabby and untoned as a demigod. His delivery is so bad as to make his screen presence almost totally absent...<br/><br/>Please don't just don't go and see this film. The 1981 original is far better (and that's no masterpiece)."

","Badness and worthlessness of this movie leaves me speechless.<br/><br/>Usually, there are certain aspects of a movie you like or dislike. One could agree or disagree certain take that director chose to do, certain changes, something that was below par, something that could have been better, that one could talk about. However, in this case, the task of reviewing this movie is difficult as from the very first scene to the last scene this movie is one unbearable, soul-less, boring, ugly and horrible disaster.<br/><br/>The original is a classic! It has heart, romance, soul, humor, sweetness, feel of an epic, beauty, nobility, overall feeling of an adventure, a quest, and yes it also had certain spooky quality, and deviousness.<br/><br/>This remake has NONE of those qualities. As if lacking anything interesting or worth liking was not enough, this movie tortures you with horrible darkness and senselessness. A fisherman comes up with empty catch, so declares war on Gods. Really? Why even be a fisherman then? Just sit at home and demand food and other necessities be delivered to you, and if that doesn't happen, just declare war on Gods.<br/><br/>From Andromedae to Zeus, the characters are either evil or robotic. Its a world of mindless creatures. There is no way to get emotionally involved, even though you go to the theater with every intention to like it, and enjoy and give it every break possible.<br/><br/>The girl playing Andromedae doesn't even appear to be a leading lady and appears to be sick and weak. The Princess is a meaningless entity in this movie. She was his love in the original. Even the monster, Cracken is boring. Medusa left a permanent scar in the original, but here it just might be a giant mindless snake. However, the soldiers trying to kill her are even more determined to be killed by her gaze. One of them could have simply avoided that fate, but the writers probably ran out of script for him, so he had no choice but to gaze straight in Medusa's eyes.<br/><br/>Just a bad movie. Avoid it at all cost. I am disgusted the time and money I wasted on this one. There is absolutely nothing, not one thing in this movie that is worth cherishing."

I definitely like the owl too. I never forgot the film.<br/><br/>Too bad I can't give that kind of praise to this re-make. A better term is a de-construction. I'll give two stars to the movie for it's action but only because ,really, that's what this version is all about.<br/><br/>It's about the fighting,the special effects and even more so....an excuse to trash-talk the original on screen.<br/><br/>Hey guys , sorry that in 1981 the special effects weren't like they are today. There's a great difference between special effects for Star Wars and for that movie. They had what they had then , anything better was over 12 years away.<br/><br/>The joke about ""leaving the owl there"" was amusing,only because I knew they wouldn't use it in the modern version. After that though,there seemed to be too much focus on tongue in cheek or wise guy humor.<br/><br/>It's almost like saying,""Hey audience,don't let yourself get emotionally involved in this....heck,we're not!""

Few young people know about the 1981 version and most never will.<br/><br/>I do know there are young people out there who ""do"" want a good story,who ""do"" care about the Greek writings that inspired this and movies like it in the first place. Aw, but what the heck....""Them young people don't care about learnin' anything!"" The movie also has no real emotion,no real characters that you can sympathise with,cheer for or for that matter try to understand. Since they're all thinly written.<br/><br/>Andromeda comes the closest in that category and in fact,hers is the only really good acting in the movie.<br/><br/>Literally,It's no wonder this all wraps up in just over 90 minutes,there's no good amount of acting,dialouge or story enough here to make it worth one's time or money (or brain exertion).<br/><br/>When is Hollywood going to stop depending on the special effects to carry a movie? To stop relying on the action for the same reason? <br/><br/>That's why I'm glad I waited for the cheap theatre. When I first heard about it,I knew this wouldn't be anything like 1981's movie but at the very least I expected them to take it to a higher level of entertainment and maybe even make another ""Lord Of The Rings"" , in terms of story and writing.<br/><br/>...........not lower it down into the depths of Hades.

"UnoriginalJess","1","7","9","16 April 2010"," 'Clash of the Titans'? More like a tantrum of toddlers
","The best I can say about this film is that it unintentionally amused me. From the very first voice-over, where the Kraken is intermingled with the Greek gods, to the moment where I realised that there were no eponymous titans that would feature in this 2 hour roar of testosterone, this movie provided scarce moments of accidental humour.<br/><br/>As for a film itself, though, it is a shocker. There is hardly anything redemptive about it. The changes to the original myth add nothing to the storyline- Io, the Goddess of Backstory, for example, is provided with a very flimsy explanation for being. The acting is dreadful- Worthington might have that rough-hewn look of a suffering hero, but his acting is as emotive as a plank of wood. He and Arterton share such a lack of chemistry that when her character tells him, ""Calm your storm"", the audience is left with little option but to laugh at the terrible dialogue. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the pounding, 'epic' music adds nothing to the supposed scale of the film. It is instead dizzying and uninspiring, mirroring the contrived nature of the plot. Finally, and this is perhaps the most potent of the film's weaknesses: none of the characters invite sympathy. <br/><br/>The gods are simply pathetic- the constant references to Zeus' ""mercy"" are blunt barbs at the Christian and Islam gods. Liam Neeson, who usually brings such gravitas to his roles, is left unusually bland and for once, he fails to fill the screen. The usually deliciously evil Ralph Fiennes is left looking somewhat foolish as he swooshes about in black clouds. As for the protagonists, Worthington's Perseus is a man who sulks and suffers one of the worst cases of self denial I have yet encountered. What's more, I still have no idea why Io refused to go away. And as for the soldiers of Argos- well, if they were the best the city had to offer, I can understand why the gods would have wanted to destroy the wretched place.<br/><br/>After watching 'Clash of the Titans', the only things clashing were my eardrums, and the only impression it left me with was a pounding headache."

It's just a random collection of scenes picked from the 1981 version sewn together with a dull and heavy needle, interconnected by a few embarrassing ""comic"" inlays and CG effects which, strangely, though the original is almost 30 years older, are not more awe-inspiring than the original ones. Practically the only construct that was added in this version is the inner conflict of the protagonist between his two natures, but even that was half-cooked and the writer forgot about it in the process of writing.

","It's a shame to review this movie so terribly, because there are things about the film that were done quite nice: the artistic direction, from the costume, the animated creatures, the digital mattes. All quite superb. But, the script is so bad that none of that can be overlooked while trying to enjoy the picture. The original 1981 film didn't have a fabulous script either, but it was head and shoulders above this. And the effects in that film, even by Ray Harryhousen's standards, were a bit rough. But it made for a much more enjoyable evening. I don't think the actors can be judged, because the lines they were given no one could deliver. It does all come down to the script. Or some over zealous producer demanding scenes and plots get added. If anyone has ever seen Kevin Smith's story about working on a script for Superman and the producer kept saying, ""yeah, cool. But, can we add a giant spider in there somehow?"". That's what I was reminded of the whole time watching this. Terrible."

I think the people who wrote this film should find a new job. Also, the acting was very poor. The actors look like they are standing in front of a greenscreen and saying their lines in a ""cool"" accent. The costuming is either plasticy or obviously CGI.

"Jonathon_Natsis","4","3","3","1 February 2011"," Zeus would not be impressed
","This year's allotted position of 'Easter blockbuster' is covered by the simplistic visual grandeur that is Clash of the Titans, a modern-day remake of the 1981 film of the same name. Perseus, the demi-god and bastard son of Zeus embarks on a journey to thwart the Gods of Olympus and save the population of Ancient Greece from utter destruction at the hands (and tentacles) of Hades and his pet Kraken. Unlike the original, which was founded on Perseus' love for Andromeda, this version is far heavier on action and effects, inarguably sacrificing any sense of a decent script and character development in the process.<br/><br/>Let it be known that I will drastically limit, from this point onwards, any comparisons between the original and the remake. Rather, I would prefer to look at this as a stand-alone film. Just as irrelevant is the fact that this film isn't exactly a history lesson when it comes to the ins- and-outs of Greek mythology. For starters, I wasn't expecting utter adherence to the stories of my childhood anyway, but this has to be critiqued as if it were the first story of its kind so as to focus wholly upon the viewing experience only.<br/><br/>Prior expectations always form a significant part of any review, and I expected nothing more or less than exactly that which was presented to me. Excluding a decent opening scene that gives a neat synopsis of Perseus, the Gods, and their respective roles in the context of the plot, further insight into the motives and nature of any character is non-existent. <br/><br/>A cheesy script containing all the elements of an appeal-to-the-masses-cash-cow undertaking compounds this negative effect. Lines such as 'This is just the beginning', 'Someone's got to make a stand' and 'Only you can save them' form just a small part of the generic script, which seems to have been taken from most other blockbusters of the last five years and loosely tailored to suit Titans, failing to fool, convince or impress the rest of us.<br/><br/>These throwaway phrases are used to fill the gaps between one action scene and another, and the film feels needlessly rushed in this respect. Furthermore, it is proof that Titans makes no effort to inspire any feelings of audience sympathy, interest or hatred of any character, simply because they all play stock roles at a most basic level. Of course, the trade-off is that the on- screen monsters look genuinely threatening instead of the now-laughable plastic toys that 'terrorised' Argos some thirty years earlier. Having said that, there is no reason why Leterrier couldn't have implemented both a satisfactory script and boggling visuals to appease those of us in the critical community. <br/><br/>Pacing becomes an even greater issue during the final battle between Perseus and the Kraken. It ends in both a predictable and abrupt manner, and the closing scene wraps everything up in what can only be described as a cliché ending that can unfortunately be found in most films of this nature today. <br/><br/>Aside from the aforementioned problems that can be located using some sort of academic process, Titans suffers from continuity issues and anachronisms that are evident to even to most infrequent viewer. Perseus' mother transitions from having brown to blonde hair in two different instances, and I'm pretty sure lipstick didn't exist in Ancient Greece either. Most disappointing is the issue that Perseus, simply, does not sound Greek. Worthington makes no effort to lose his recognisably Australian accent, while Zeus and Apollo sound more like Braveheart extras than Gods. Master director and walking film guide Quentin Tarantino once said: 'the best directors don't adapt. They steal.' QT's statement does not ring true for Titans, which blatantly exploits plot and basic character models found in Avatar, Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings. <br/><br/>In closing, one shouldn't expect much more from this film than a brain-dead, popcorn- actioner. Despite this, I refuse to apply the term 'switch-off-your-brain-entertainment.' I feel the statement, by its very nature, is a cop-out used by critics to justify senseless action and overall lack of detail or effort taken in the production process. The CGI is, as always, to be praised and marvelled at, but this tale of mythology is no masterpiece.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

","If you want an indication of what this movie's like, just look at the cover. Yes, that is Medusa's head he's roaring at.<br/><br/>With a sand-scorpion scene like the one in Transformers, a Kraken like Pirates of the Caribbean's and lines like ""It is death who should be afraid of us."", it's easy to see that Clash of the Titans is gonna be fun for the action and little else. And it is. While trying to deal with his half-man, half-god heritage in a way that no-one really seems to care about, Perseus kicks mythical butt. Nevermind that the rest of the party of so-called elite warriors are either eye-liner wearing flute- players or grey-haired men who look like washed up 60s rockers. At least it's a refreshing change from the 300-esque beefed up gladiators. Another thing that just works for some reason is the movie's out-of- place, modern humour such as Perseus' pep talk's ending: ""Trust your senses and don't look this ***** in the eye."" Who cares if that expletive wasn't invented until about 1150 AD? Couple this with a very pretty, mythological-looking world and you've got at least some entertainment.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this movie is Perseus. Whatever possessed them to cast Sam Worthington as the lead should be exorcised immediately. The man is basically re-using his character for Terminator Salvation, and that does not work. His accent detracts and his manner speaks more of a 20th century criminal than a 4th century hero. Everyone else has long hair, Perseus sports a crew-cut. Everyone else speaks theatrically, if not poetically, Perseus never uses monosyllabic words and swears. Oh, and I'm not even going to go into the plot. It's the standard but-he- must-have-a-weakness! quest, with a bit of Jeremy Springer family drama thrown in. Not quite as epic a combination as I would have hoped.<br/><br/>The action looks and sounds great, the backdrop is pretty and, on occasion, the humour makes you laugh with instead of at them, but with such poor characters and an unoriginal plot, it's only getting a 4.

As for the movie, it is more action set than having a deeper mythical story, and many remembered scenes from the 1981 version has been shorted and removed leaving it with less depth than the predecessor. I can not help remember a scene from the 1981 version, where 'Perseus' visits the witches and a human hand is seen reaching out of the cauldron, also a scene where 'Calibos' sends a giant vulture to the Princess 'Andromeda' to bring her to him, many that was not shown in the modern version. The actor 'Liam Neeson' is a good actor but was not powerful in voice for the 'Zeus' character, in my opinion, 'Brian Blessed' would have been a far improvement. All in all, a average movie."

","I don't mind a remake and try to be open-minded, however, what this remake does is take all the action scenes from the 1981 original, add some more (presumably to squeeze in some 3D effects), and instead drop most of the storyline! What you are left with is a thin contrived plot where the actions of the characters make little sense.<br/><br/>The action scenes and CGI are good, but basically the kind you find in any average blockbuster movie today. There is no innovation, the creatures' looks seem contrived - the riders on the scorpions remind me of the Haradrim of LOTR, and the Kraken's face looks remarkably like a cave troll.<br/><br/>Without spoiling it, the original has intrigues amongst the gods and provides reasons for the actions of the characters (gods, humans and inbetween) - all missing from this remake, which rather concentrates only on the action sequences.<br/><br/>The reasoning of the protagonist makes no sense, as he changes his mind about accepting the gods' gifts when things get tough.

","I learnt the myth of Perseus and Andromeda as a boy when I started looking at the night sky and the constellations: Perseus, Andromeda, Cassopeia, Cepheus, Pegasus and Cetus.<br/><br/>I guess most of us know this story about how the beautiful princess is punished by Poseidon after her mother Queen Cassopeia boasts that her daughter is more beautiful than the Nereids. Andromeda is chained naked to a rock as a sacrifice to the cetus (a sea monster, but not a kraken). In the myth Perseus saves and weds his princess, though there is a spot of bother at the wedding and 'yes', Pegasus and Medusa Gorgon do come into it.<br/><br/>The 1981 film did not stray too far from the story and in addition we had Judy Bowker and Ursula Andress to look at, along with Ray Harryhausen special effects and a pretty decent cast. All in all I was quite satisfied.<br/><br/>I have a soft spot for this story, so I was looking forward to this film. Unfortunately the director and screen writers saw things differently and seem to have gone out of their way to ensure that I would be completely and utterly disappointed and have left me asking these questions:<br/><br/><ul><li>Why was there no character development?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Wouldn't it have been nice to allow the actors and actresses a chance to act?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The myth provides a rip-roaring yarn, why not use it?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Also I have to question why was Pegasus black?

","This movie may be the worst movie I have seen in a long time. It was at about 15 seconds in when I thought about going and trying to get my money back the first time. <br/><br/>The movie starts with a backdrop of space and a ""myth"" of the Kraken. This segment is so far from the Greek myth of Zeus overthrowing the Titans, my head nearly exploded on the spot. It was then I decided to look at the movie as if Greek myth was not the setting. I know the original was nowhere near the Greek myth, but it was still a good movie so I made the effort. <br/><br/>So I started to look at it as a remake. The original was a coming of age story of a young Hero, Perseus, trying to save his love, Andromeda, from the Kraken by journeying to find the head of the Medusa to kill the Kraken. In this movie the character of Andromeda seems tacked on. Perseus' love interest in this movie is Io. OK, whatever. Sure, Why not? These were the phrases I uttered constantly throughout the movie. From Perseus' complete disregard for human life while he cries he is not a god but a man, to the magic, scorpion riding, tree people. Not only did Perseus cry that he wants to beat the Kraken as a man, which is pointed out to him that a man can not do it, but he is automatically a bad ass. Even when the leader of the soldiers with him tries to take him to train, because he had never wielded a sword before, it end with Perseus winning and disarming the man who had quite probably spent his entire life using a sword. He is then given a magic sword and shuns it because it is a gift from the gods. He later uses it. He needs to get back to Argos quickly, so the Pegasus just shows up. He doesn't have to train it or try to earn its trust. It just shows up. This movie tries to tell you how man is better than the gods by the constant reminders. ""Make sure you tell them, a man did this."" is a quote as a man uselessly dies when he could have just closed his eyes. That said, I consider myself an atheist but never thought a movie of Greek myth would be so blatantly atheist. Then the story of how Medusa was raped in the temple and cursed for it, pretty much saying that her being raped was her fault. Nice message guys. So the story was bad, and quite possibly one of the worst plots in recent years. So how was it's effects and action sequences?<br/><br/>Terrible. That is the only word to describe it. There were scenes where the fights just dragged on and on.Way overdone, and predictable action. He ends up chasing a harpy though Argos on the Pegasus for twice as long as you actually see the Kraken on the screen. The effects are a really bad 3-D. There were a lot of times I just ended up taking off the glasses because it was so blurry. There was a lot of scenes that just seemed to be shot for the ""jump factor"" but did not surprise or shock. <br/><br/>So in closing, Do not see this movie. For the love of anything you consider dear, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. The wooden acting and the cheap effects and the bad plot, are too much. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE."

","The producers of Clash of the Titans brought the story of Perseus to a place it has never been to, then told it to get out of the car and walk home. It was definitely no more brutal than being hit in the face with a bag of bronze statues; moreover, it was more interesting than the instructions that come with a hair brush.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the story doesn't diverge from the original myth until a good sixty seconds in. Perseus and his mother are found in a box set to the mercy of the sea. So, what motivates Perseus to go on his famous quest to behead the Medusa and kill the sea monster? Why, revenge o' course! The gods killed his family with some sort of ship seeking death ray made out of dirt. Specifically, Hades, the evil death god, killed Perseus' family.<br/><br/>Forget that Hades was no more evil than any other Olympian god. The producers of Clash of the Titans felt that its target audience, retarded chimpanzees waiting out a rain storm, would be confused. Also, the original motive for Perseus adventure would've actually required over fifteen seconds to relate; too much time for today's busy, rain-fearing simian. Perseus swims away from his dead family with a hatred for all the gods, effectively silencing any fundamentalists who caught wind of the production...<br/><br/>Did I mention Liam Neeson plays Zeus? I'm pretty sure I didn't. He looks pretty embarrassed to be a part of the movie; it almost looks as if there is a professional negotiator, just off camera, in case the actor loses his nerve. Fortunately for Liam, after a barrage of giant scorpions, aliens(?), black Pegasus and a Perseus who looks more like a United States Marine than an ancient Greek, Zeus is pretty much forgotten.<br/><br/>And, the effects! A Medusa that seems to have stepped right out of Sim Life; an incongruous sea monster that belongs in a Freaky's cereal commercial (Note: Please bring Freaky's back); and, CGI death and stoning that could've definitely been produced on my son's Macintosh.<br/><br/>Ray Harryhausen's silly version of this movie looks like a masterpiece in comparison..."

Clash of The Titans had very mixed reviews from audiences (though most critics hated this) but I liked the look of the trailer and the film had an excellent cast. How wrong was I? This was a load of crap. A trashy Hollywood film that was desperate to make money. A sham! The story was predictable, the acting was awful, like Sam Worthington (whose was so wooden I felt like I had splinters), which is sad as I liked him in Terminator Salvation and he was very good as the lead in Avatar, Ralph Fiennes got on my nerves as he sounded like he had a parched sore throat and Gemma Atterton though pretty spoke like a posh girl shopping for shoes! The acting was theatrical. I felt like I watching this on stage. And because of the superficial acting there's no depth to there characters and I didn't care about any of them particularly when Sam Worthington kept flying through the air like a demented monkey screaming like Tarzan. (He would be good in the circus trade).<br/><br/>The 3D and special effects though okay in parts was mostly tacky and the whole thing took itself so seriously it was pathetically lame. I just laughed at it and the action sequences were boring and lacked excitement not to mention the camera swung so fast for some of it I couldn't see what was happening (Michael Bay, grrr!). The last action sequence was a very anti-climax and lasted about two minutes. Some of the scenery was nice though and I thought Liam Neeson who played the god Zeus, his acting was good but it wasn't enough. The director Louis Leterrier should be ashamed of himself.

This generic big-screen embarrassment misses on every attempt. The plot is dull, things occur without understanding, and the special effects are mostly ho-hum.<br/><br/>The story of Perseus is a marvelous tale because he was an Everyman (aside from his being a son of Zeus) that was moved by love into a journey that would live and inspire for countless generations. However, this tale of Perseus is for guys with ""daddy issues"" and anger management problems.<br/><br/>Our hero manages to let nearly everyone die until he finds it convenient to use the gifts from the gods. Then he swoops in at the end to save a girl he barely gave two thought about throughout the movie. Saving the girl, by the way, was meant to stop the destruction of the city of Argos, which occurred anyway. All-in-all, not really a good showing for the people's savior.<br/><br/>Acting is minimal. Effects are only occasionally eye-catching at best. And the plot is non-existent.<br/><br/>So why did I see it? I guess I wanted to see if the gods of Hollywood deserved any praise. They do not... RENT THE ORIGINAL MOVIE and save the inflated-admission price for another blockbuster."

","This movie should have been called ""Clash of the Boring Idiots."" I am a huge fan of the original 1981 classic film, and I was excited to see a remake. I thought it looked like it was going to be amazing judging by the trailers that I watched. Wow, was I ever disappointed! This movie was terrible! The trailer was awesome, and it fooled me. I was hearing a lot of bad reviews before I went to see the movie, and I did not believe any of them. Again, the trailer looked so cool, I figured that reports of the actual film had to be erroneous. But the film just sucked.<br/><br/>The special effects were great, but the story was just terrible! You would think the original story was so great, it would be hard to mess it up! But they did. There was no character development, and I found myself not caring at all about any of the characters. Characters seemed to just appear for no reason with no back story, and then disappear as quickly and easily as they had arrived with no wrap up or resolution. The story telling really felt rushed and underdeveloped. It was very boring.<br/><br/>And officially, I am DONE with 3-D. I was not impressed. In fact, I was annoyed more than anything and I finally took my 3-D glasses off and tried to watch the movie in 2-D.<br/><br/>The Boo Bo cameo fell absolutely flat. It did not make me laugh. I thought it was just pathetic.<br/><br/>My recommendation: Go re-watch the original. Andromeda was way hotter, anyway (she is SUPER fine in the 1981 original, not to take away anything from Alexa Davalos). And even despite the old stop-motion special effects, aside from being a bit old fashioned, I think it holds up great and is a lot of fun to watch. Don't bother with this remake, it is a stinker."

","What can I say... I was not impressed with the remake of clash of the Titans. Although the special effects were good...The writers messed up the story line. I don't know what they were thinking but they really screwed the pooch on this one. There is no Bubo no helmet just a sword. The whole story about calibos in the swamp and the Cassiopia riddle is gone. The only things that are the same are the blind witches, The Kraken, Medusa, and Pegesus(which is now black instead of white) Don't ask me why. I'm glad I didn't waste the extra money on the 3D version. I heard it was made 3D by an after-market company. After seeing it.... I can tell you that there is nothing that will stand out in 3D, don't waste your money. It was a real let down."

","It seems I've had a stream of bad luck of late with films such as 'Percy and the lightening thief' claiming to be the American 'Harry Potter' and turning out to be just another iteration of the 'Scary/Epic/Hero Movie' genre. However films like these at least stayed true to themselves once you got into them and played on the strengths of the teen comedy/spoof genre's.<br/><br/>'Clash of the Titans' doesn't seem to know what it is.<br/><br/>I'll first start by saying that there is NO WAY this film was made for 3D. The trailers before the film were far more impressive and interesting. Depth perception rapidly changed from scene to scene (painful on the eyes) as if each shot was not planned with 3D in mind. Other shots only had 3D elements or none at all, evident by 0 distortion when removing the 3D glasses; this was also straining on the eyes and far less vivid than a true 3D experience. The best existing example I can think of is the old 'Doom 3D' game where the levels were 3D but the monsters were just 2D sprites floating around in them. Clearly most 3D was done in post editing.<br/><br/>The story was rushed and given poor delivery, though given the quality of the content you may consider this a blessing. The film attempted to mix serious moments with comedy spontaneously transforming itself into a big lump of cheese. Actual CG was top notch but sparsely used until the last ten minutes, by which time you may have already left the room. Acting was generally on the mark but again let down by cheese oozing from the mouths of the Actors and Actresses.<br/><br/>The Director clearly had access to some great CG artists and some fairly decent Actors but his script and screen play would have worked just as well if he'd picked hobos up off the street and placed them in front of a green screen (though credit to him that he avoided the green screen wherever possible).<br/><br/>In short, this movie is terrible, it's mostly slow passed, boring and delivered poorly. Do not go to watch this in 3D, you will have higher expectations and will be sorely disappointed. I give it a 1/10, as I had the urge to leave consistently from the first 10 minutes, which I've never felt so strongly before; if you go to watch it in 2D, maybe you'll want to give it a 2 or a 3, but I seriously wish that you better spend your time on some of the other great movies currently showing."

","The ancient Greeks will be turning in their graves. This is the most inaccurate story, despite the fact that the original tale of Perseus was fantastic and dynamic in its own right. However, let's accept the story-line. OK, it's Hollywood and that's what they do. The 3-D as others have already pointed out was a total rip-off. There wasn't even the decency to throw in one ""good"" 3-D moment. It was an insult to the viewer. The actors were generic and static. No depth to any of the characters. The ancient Greeks were portrayed as barbarians, but in reality, we all know what they have contributed to our modern world. The dialogue was geared towards 13 year old teenage boys, who I advise you were the only ones laughing at the ""jokes."" I was tempted about an hour in to walk out of the theater, but instead (and unfortunately) I decided to give the movie the benefit of the doubt. and for that, I paid the price (2 less brain cells).<br/><br/>DO ME A FAVOR : The money you would spend to see this movie, spend it on a couple of drinks at the bar instead."

","The original movie was so much better. You have to forgive it's 1980s special effects, but the acting was better and character development led you to care what happens to the characters. The new movie was only made for the special effects and nothing else. The acting is horrible, the lines are cheesy, and the story is HIGHLY altered from the original movie. There are new characters added that had no point, and parts of the movie were drastically altered for no purpose other than it might be cool for little kids to watch and draw more people who only care about high-end special effects. For anybody who liked the original movie a lot you will be VERY VERY VERY disappointed. I nearly walked out of the movie, but I was with friends and that was the only thing that kept me. They also thought it was horrible and they hadn't even seen the first movie.

","This film was nothing more than a glorified video game. I don't know about you, but my brain disengages when all that Computer Generated Imagery is used. This film relied on it. Also, the 3-D effects were pitiful. Liam Neeson's face seemed to project outward from his head. Persius was updated so he can be ""cool"" circa 2011. In a world full of guys with long hair and beards, our hero walked around in a buzz-cut and a gangsta attitude.. Why not just throw in the saggy pants and tattoos while you're at it? The dialogue was extremely bad. Everything was some kind of reverent, lofty quote; as if everyone was a Shakespeare. The giant scorpions and flying harpies were CGI nightmares....more fake than the old stop-action creatures. Medussa was just a CGI joke - shrouded in shadowy, jerky-action. The Cracken was scary looking and huge, but ultimately not that menacing. It seemed like a monster with a disability of some kind. All the action sequences were of the confusing CGI fast- paced, nonsensical variety - people rubbing up on each other, falling 60 feet, getting up like nothing happened, etc. And the whole thing was filmed in a kind of amber hue that sucked out any color. Don't see this mess if you can help it."

It may be a little dated, and some of the effects are certainly old-fashioned by today's standards, but it has something the remake doesn't even come close to achieving: - Class!<br/><br/>If you are brain-dead, have a limited attention span, are totally ignorant of (and have no interest in) ancient Greek mythology, and basically just want lots of standard quality CGI, one-dimensional characters, and a plot dumbed-down to the point that there is no longer anything there, then watch the remake; a mindless, soulless, travesty that insults the intelligence of the viewer, and does everything it can to destroy all that was good about the original.<br/><br/>The director has publicly claimed to be a fan of the original, but this seems very unlikely based on his so-called homage featuring the mechanical owl from the 1981 film. His treatment of that classic prop/character could not have been more dismissive and insulting.

","Fortunately I had heard all the bad reviews prior and didn't waste my money watching this train wreck at the cinema. But I stayed at a hotel last night and there was nothing else on so i watched it on a ""what the heck"" kind of motivation and out of curiosity to see if I agreed with the critics. All I could say when it was over was ""ugh"".<br/><br/>So what was bad about this movie?<br/><br/>1. The characters. There was not one likable character in this whole movie. They were all just bland boring vacant wooden actors and most weren't in the movie long enough to even know or care what they were all about. <br/><br/>2. Perseus. He didn't look remotely like a Greek hero at all. He looked more like a young marine who just got out of boot camp. At least black curly haired Harry Hamlin wore a tunic but in this one, he's a shaved headed muscle head wearing a green sleeveless T Shirt. If this was a modern day war movie in the desert somewhere, he'd fit right in but not in a Greek mythological.<br/><br/>3. The action. This was the worst part of the movie. The action scenes were so fast paced and everything was a close up that zipped across the screen and the scenes changed every half second that you couldn't see what was going on. It not only plays with your eyes and gives you a headache but also makes you want to shout ""Hold the damned camera still"" at the TV. <br/><br/>4. Calibos. In the first movie, he was the main villain who played an integral part. In this one, he's reduced to almost a cameo. No story behind him, he's just an ugly troll who is sent by Hades to kill Perseus and is killed too fast. <br/><br/>5. The special effects. Way too much eye candy and CGI. The monsters looked like polished cartoons and not scary or mysterious at all. To me, visual effects are like salt. The right amount can add spice and flavor to a meal and make it more tasty. But too much can ruin it. Hollywood these days prefers the latter. <br/><br/>6. The story line. OK I get it. The director wanted to do a remake without following the original script by script but this one strays way too far. In the first one, Perseus' main concern is saving Andromeda from being devoured by the Kracken at the will of an angry Goddess. In this one, Perseus is out for revenge against Hades for killing his foster family. In other words, a whole different ball park. <br/><br/>So what you're left with is ""action scene.. talking... action scene... talking... action scene... talking.""<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was boring and lifeless and just your average run of the mill CGI saturated action film that is no different from any other one we've seen in the past 10 years. The fight scenes are all the same and you always have to have at least 3 ""slow motion"" scenes in every fight... you know the drill. <br/><br/>The only thing missing was the ""walking away unaffected by the huge explosion behind you"" cliché."

","Clash of the Titans is a remake of the original movie from the eighties, when you're reading this review, take in mind that I haven't seen the original movie. Almost everything about this movie was boring. The story was quite bad as I found myself drifting in and out of the movie, unable to pay much attention to it. The acting wasn't very good as half of the cast looked like they didn't want to be there and just tried their best to hide that fact. The characters were quite boring and you didn't care for any of them at all. The direction wasn't bad but I can't say the same for the script, as that was terribly boring. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is the battles, which were quite entertaining and were executed quite well. The CGI was okay as well, it wasn't terrible but it weren't all that great.<br/><br/>Hollywood has done it yet again by making another pointless remake. Clash of the Titans will please some but not others. If you like CGI battles and don't care about anything else, then I think this will be the movie for you. However, if you like a good story and good acting, then you might not like this. I normally like both, I love a story to grip me and I also like great action or CGI scenes but unfortunately for this movie, one outweighs the other. The story bored me so much as did the characters, it felt like the actors was bored doing their roles sometimes. However, the CGI was pretty good and the action scenes were executed well but they weren't enough to cover the fact it had a tedious and terrible story. It's a movie with a bad story and terrible characters, which are covered up with CGI battle scenes. If the original is anything like this, I don't think I'd like to watch it.<br/><br/>Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com"

","Seriously, what is the point of even having remakes at all? IF the film was okay the first time out, there is no need to make it again...<br/><br/>I think somewhere, there is a mentality in Hollywood that if you can't see a film with modern special effects, kids won't appreciate it on its own merits.<br/><br/>We have all our old friends from the 1981 version, although the mechanical owl is thankfully only on screen for a second as a in joke. ""Take everything!"" ""What about this?"" ""Leave it!"" The rest of it is paint by number script-writing, complete with the unwilling hero learning to be heroic on a hero's journey. Some of it was silly, such as the stuff with giant scorpions (much too long a sequence).<br/><br/>Also, there were some bizarre religious issues going on here. For some reason, the mortals were attacking the Gods because the Gods weren't holding up their end of the deal, or something, but Hades is plotting to overthrow Zeus, not realizing he's Liam Freakin' Neesom. I think the writers were going for some criticism of religion in general, but it got bleached out in the rewrites...<br/><br/>Oh, yes, you also have a hottie named ""Io"" who is ageless and provides all sorts of exposition so the audience...oops, I mean the heroes don't get confused. Well, hey, the other guy got Burgess Meredith! Meanwhile the love story with Andromeda is overshadowed because that was the actual romance. This guy has a thing for the babe whose been looking over him since he was a baby! Hey, maybe this should have been about Oedipus... More seriously, what's the point of ""saving the princess"" if you don't give a flip if the monster eats her or not? <br/><br/>But the real problem is that the human actors are overshadowed by the curse of 21st century film making, CGI."

","And if an action movie is boring, it simply is a failure. Where to begin? This movie is a mass of sloppy clichés: the righteous hero; the quest for revenge; the disposable secondary characters who happily die helping him; the stereotyped evil, infamous and power thirsty nemesis; the happily ever after finale; and so forth. The fact that half of the actors speak British English and the other half American English didn't help much in making their Greek mythological characters particularly credible (to my ears at least). Furthermore, those characters are simply too plain and shabby: no depth, no attitude, bare and completely forgettable (every single one of them). The action scenes are ill conceived and even worse executed. The direction wasn't able to give a sense of continuity and seamless and gradual flowing to the story: it feels almost like a series of separate episodes (badly) glued together (which is also reflected by the cinematography: bleak and dark settings, then sunny and idyllic ones...). The CG is there and is not so bad in itself, but it doesn't help at all: almost feels like out of place and unnecessary.<br/><br/>I was actually falling asleep while watching this... <br/><br/>One of the worst movies I've watched in the last few months: don't bother with it. 4.5/10"

","This is the first review I've written on the IMDb but after just watching Clash Of The Titans 3D in my local cinema, i felt i just had to let the movie going public know how bad it was.<br/><br/>As a boy of 12 years of age when the original Clash of the Titans first came out in 1981, i like everyone else in the movie theatre sat spellbound throughout the entire movie. Not just because of the special affects - which were another fine example of Ray Harryhausens work, but because the story and the character development made you care about what happened to Perseus, Andromeda and all those who had helped Perseus in his quest.<br/><br/>Move forward almost 30 years and i still find it hard to believe how badly this film has been remade. Its not really the actors fault, as the fine cast assembled should have been able to produce what we all hoped would be another classic.<br/><br/>What happened! i'l tell you - a terribly written story and cheesy dialogue which bares hardly any resemblance to the original film at all. What you have is a series of blurry, difficult to watch 3d action sequences which don't tie up with one another, and characters that you simply don't care about. The only exception to this is Mads Mikkelsen who manages to look and sound great in a movie that no-one else does. Even The great Liam Neeson and promising new leading man Sam Worthington are completely wasted here and appear wooden, like they simply don't believe in the script themselves. What a wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>Why did they omit the wonderful and creepily suspenseful scenes in the marsh, when Calibos set his impossible riddles for Andromedas suitors. Why did Andromedas character play no real importance in this film apart from being food for a hungry C.G.I squid! (Suposedly the Kraken) No love story, no interest as far as i was concerned.<br/><br/>Without going on and on about the mistakes in this movie ( i could though) i just need to mention the mythical creatures in the movie. Calibos - i like Jason Flemyng but he wasn't right for this part, just not scary at all. The kraken - way to large, the C.G.I looked very cartoonish and boy was it easy to kill. The scorpions - pretty good actually until they were suddenly tamed, a saddle and harness put on them and ridden like docile cows! Whats that all about! Finally though the scene with the Medusa - in the original it was scary, suspenseful and very exciting. In this it was rushed, the C.G.I was poor,(Bring back to the good old days of stop motion clay model effects if this is the best C.G.I has to offer) and overall, what was always the best action scene in my opinion in the original film was completely ruined in this remake.<br/><br/>Supposedly, the director was a big fan of the original film. By watching this you would be forgiven for thinking he actually hated it and wanted to make this film as far removed from the original as possible. In that one aspect he truly succeeded. <br/><br/>Special mention to the most irritating aspect of the film, every time that awful skinny prophet of doom appeared on screen wailing and crying out those silly noises. Why didn't the kings guards simply kill him the minute he opened his mouth. <br/><br/>To sum up, i really didn't care by the end whether or not Perseus, Andromeda and the whole city of Argos was destroyed. In fact, it would have been the one change to the original film, that would have signalled a welcome end to what was truly an awfully disappointing movie experience.<br/><br/>If this is what we have to look forward to from now on from the Hollywood - cash in on every great movie memory we have crowd. I feel very sad. Surely we as the paying viewing public, who pay the wages of all those in the movie industry deserve better. I hope so, or my days of going to the cinema to watch the latest summer blockbuster are numbered."

The actors do their best with what they are given but the dialog is rife with bad one liners and is down right cringe inducing. The storyline is non existent. The ""love"" part of the movie felt shoehorned in.Perseus's issues with his dad were so badly written that I just didn't care. I watched How to Train Your Dragon which is a kid's movie yet they made me care about the father/son problems. Sad when a movie for kids is better written than one made for adults. (if you have kids, you should be even more insulted, Hollywood thinks your children are smarter than you!)I am not religious but there were strong atheist tones saying man is better than God. It annoys me that they're slapping the audience in the face to us ""LOOK! LOOK! Look at that dumb zealot trying to get people to worship the gods! Isn't he an idiot? Religious people are stupid fanatics!"" I don't go to church, but I went to see this movie for a STORY, not for the writers to shove their beliefs at me. I didn't get the feeling I was watching a movie set in ancient Greece at all. Speaking of Greece, if you have any knowledge of Greek mythology, some of the stuff might bug you, such as Io being all knowing and not a cow, she was an annoying know it all character. Also, the ""comic relief"" characters that come out of nowhere to join the heroes. So predictable, haw haw, they're funny but what a surprise, they can kick ass.There other attempts at humor that fell flat.The effects were sometimes passable and sometimes lazy CGI. The monsters were not very good either, their faces looked too alike. And the action...well..it was OK... 13 year old boys and people who care not about plot will love the movie for it, I wasn't impressed, it wasn't as epic as I would have liked. Since the story was so lacking a tad more blood would have been nice... <br/><br/>OLD ONE TO NEW ONE Yes, I did like the original. I went into the theater with the mind that these are two different movies so not to judge this one based on the original. I was hoping it to be good story. The old one is far superior. The old effects are campy but were so impressive FOR THE TIME that the movie became a classic. The new effects are not that good by today's standards and no good story to make up for it. Judging STORYWISE and not OMGSPESHULEFFCTS the old one's FAR superior with less plot holes, better acting, and likable characters. I didn't like Calibus's origin in the new one, it sucked. I also didn't like the portrayal of the gods. Humans were their playthings and they used them like chesspieces but in new one Zeus is oddly loving towards them. Wasn't Perseus in love with Andromeda not that cow Io? I knew they'd stray from the story but they'd have been better off if they didn't. Guess they didn't want to make it about love because that's not ""badass"" enough so instead they changed it into a vengeance thing. And wtf, they made Medusa's face pretty? I thought she was supposed to be hideous! I wasn't impressed with the Medusa battle, the old one actually had more tension and was actually creepier in a way. They added these things called djini which are from middle eastern stories, NOT Greece! It annoyed me that they underestimate audience's intelligence. The old movie did a MUCH better job at portraying the way Greeks viewed their gods and just gave out more of a Greek feel. The new one gives a Christian feel to the Gods Zeus= God, Hades= Satan, Perseus= Jesus. It's a story about ancient Greek gods so make it SEEM like a movie about ancient Greece! They were trying so hard to make it seem cool and modernly kick ass/rebellious they couldn't write the characters to fit into that ancient world. Let's face it, the old one wanted to tell us an interesting story with interesting characters and use effects that BACK THEN made people wonder.The new one simply wanted to make bank by taking an awesome, epic story and stripping it of its soul and replacing it with with empty bravado and run of the mill cgi."

This review is different. While I have read some of these criticisms about this movie, I personally do not think that any of them apply.<br/><br/>This movie is, above all things, great fun.<br/><br/>Anyone who watched the Harry Hamlin version of this story back in 1981 and wants to compare it with this one would do well to remember the differences in cast and production capabilities. The special effects for this new trip with Perseus are excellent. The creativeness and production values are way up there on the scale. And, while the dialog may occasionally slip into the region of corn and cheesiness, the story flows in an entertaining manner and doesn't leave the viewer wanting for much.<br/><br/>Probably the only real criticism I had was regarding the Kraken. Yes, it was fearsome, ginormous, loud and, in general, everything you expect a mythical monster of mass destruction to be. But you never get to see a complete picture of it. OK. I'm picky.

About fifteen minutes into the movie we looked at each other and shook our heads in disbelief. Character development is practically non existent. I mean i really didn't care who lived or died. They were all basically cannon fodder. I know this is firmly set in the fantasy/mythology realm but a little artistic license in the wrong hands can be a very dangerous thing. I will give an example that occurs in the first quarter of the movie. While camping in some woods the lead character just goes for a stroll... while out for a walk he happens upon the haft of a sword( while in the cinema we both jokingly mimicked light-sabers, then burst out laughing when the sword basically turned out to be exactly that!). During this same sequence while still just out walking, he meets another demigod who appeared to just happen to be out for a walk too... next he stumbles upon a clearing full of the mythical flying horses, the Pegasus, and i'm not even talking one, this is a full heard. While talking to the demigod lady, his disgruntled stepfather just turns up to cause a bit of a mess and stomp about in a rubber suit.. Thus ensues an epic cgi fest that continues for another hour. Please don't spend money on this movie. The CGI is OK. I mean if CGI still floats your boat then you might like this but its rubbish mindless tripe."
"Diego2001","1","8","12","5 April 2010"," Fake 3 D
","My gripe with this movie is that this so called 3D movie is more like 2 & 1/4 D. It was not truly filmed with a 3 D camera but converted in the post production process and as a result it looks awful. I have read that in the past with the introduction of sound and color to movies that the studios would only have color or sound in certain parts of the movie, but they did not charge extra for it. However the greedy management of Warner Brothers is charging extra for 3 D that is not really 3 D. As I watched the movie,the 3 D effect comes and goes and when I took off the 3 D glasses most of the film was very watchable as opposed to real 3 D when it all looks a bit fuzzy until you put on the glasses. The new process for 3 D is quite good, with AVATAR being the shining example of the process and this dud of a movie being a great example of corporate greed ripping off the audience. Shame on Warner Brothers'. Oh I forgot there are no Brothers Warner involved in the company any more,just a bunch of marketing pin heads that seem to think we the audience are all really stupid."

","Man I love movies. Out of thousands of films I've seen in my lifetime, I can honestly count on one hand the number I walked out of. This film needs to be stopped from being shown in 3-D. Not only is this a haphazard remake/revision, it contains some of the worst 2-D to 3- D conversion to date. The company that ripped Warner off was Prim Focus - charging something like $104K PER MINUTE for the conversion. But that's what happens when you shoot a movie in 2-D and then at the last minute decide to up convert it to 3-D, but only give the converters ten weeks to do it! Anybody out there wanna take a guess at why Alice in Wonderland's release date was pushed back three times? Yep, it takes a long time to convert to 3-D because the technology really isn't fully there. Try finding technical articles on how its achieved and you'll finish reading with more questions than answers. Anybody see G- Force? Love the film, but in 3-D it is painfully obvious (on repeated viewings) during the live action sequences that it was a 2-D film switched over for 3-D midway through its shoot. At least the converters did a decent enough job to where you really have to pay attention to catch that's not real 3-D. But in Clash it looks like a pop up book and thats putting it kindly. I have the advantage of knowing several theater mangers in my area and I asked one if they could screen the film for after hours with brightness turned up. This helped out with the darker sections in the film, but it made the 3-D even worse - or rather it showed how bad of a rushed job this really was. Warner Bros is gearing up to unleash the new Harry Potter in 3-D Using the same converting studio - to say I'm wary is an understatement. If you want to see good 3-D from Warner Brothers try finding a 3-D film festival (most large cities host one a year or so) and see their early 1950 efforts like House of Wax, Hondo, Phantom of the Rue Morgue. and Dial M for Murder."

","First of all, I got to say that I was hugely excited going in to the theater. I had actually been waiting for the movie to hit the theaters for a couple of weeks. Having previewed the plot this movie had all the right ingredients to be an instant classic, an epic tale, great mayhem between a man and a god.<br/><br/>After all this hype and anxiety I finally got to see the film, and boy, was it disappointing?! I mean, the story was flat, it was not just predictable and boring but it was simply a BAD story. I didn't expect it to be a new Shawshank Redemption, no, but anyone could write a better script with the ingredients given for this film.<br/><br/>I also made the mistake to see the movie as a 3D version. Only thing that I got out of it, was a headache and an additional 2,50 euros gone from my wallet. All the action sequences, where they tried to do something with 3d effects were blurry and just horrible.<br/><br/>I suggest not to go see this movie, do not rent this movie, ever.

I even got an upgrade on my seat, middle row center seat.<br/><br/>But the best seat in the cinema couldn't change the disaster on the screen. I wasn't expecting a high class movie with great storytelling or great acting. but this was ridiculous. I like big movies with great action and I enjoy a good anti hero but this was nothing at all The gods looked more misplaced in there medieval armor than frightening or superior. the performance of Neeson and Finnes was nothing I would ever expect from one of the two. no emotion, no style, no gods. Worthington was as disappointing as Perseus as Arnie would be as Hamlet. it was flat. I mean really flat. 2dimensional. all characters were just black and white figures with no intentions or depths.

","I am a fan of the original film and was expecting good things in this re-make with the advancement in technology since 1981 and with Sam Worthington as the main character. However I was wrong. It basically was a weak movie: weak storyline filled with very weak characters and weak movie making. Didn't care if any of the characters died or lived, won or lost. At least Avatar the movie had amazing effects to dazzle people. Alas this movie had nothing but my hard earned money and a whole bunch of people grumbling as the walked out of the theatre of how a re-make once again failed to live up to its past heritage, much less surpass it."

","Did you hear that? That was me sighing, the trailer certainly gave the impression this was going to be something special and that they had nailed the fantasy action target. Unfortunately they haven't.. It's a film that isn't as good as the sum of its parts, no wait a minute, that's wrong, even the parts aren't that good. A series of loose encounters that seem under played and under worked leaving you with a feeling that it's all style and no substance. From the moment the rating was unveiled it was clear that they were going to pull all their punches to allow as wider audience as possible to see this mess. A tighter, leaner more adult approach would have benefited this film no end, instead we get superfluous, ridiculous looking characters that come and go without any real purpose. Where is the suspense? Where is the tension? Where are the darker elements the story aspires to? You don't get any of these elements. As an example, they have to kill the infamous mythological creature Medusa and there is no sense of fear or tension. And that counts for practically all the enemies in the film accept, perhaps, the giant scorpions. Anyway, enough is enough, a disappointment, a missed opportunity and not a very good film. If you've got a taste for mythology try the original 1981 film instead."
"goverthana","1","4","5","7 October 2010"," Clash of The TiTans
","I may say only this, I saw the Original adaptation of it from 1981, it is much more better than this 3 reasons why: <br/><br/>1. The original 1981 adaptation stocked more towards the storyline and a wide cast of characters from the Mythology being portrayed well - although some the characters were unreal but the adaptation was very new and good at that time and still it is if you will have a chance to see it, compared to this none of the above exists.<br/><br/>2. This is just a stripped off version from the Original 1981 movie with the help of CGI's and inaccurately following the actual Mythology of Persius and that for the pleasure of watching can be very pleasing at certain points but it has so many potholes that even a toddler will raise some questions at the end.<br/><br/>3. There's no sense of seriousness or real adventure portrayed in a calming maneuver like all other good stories like Avathar, which was long and therefore should be but in Clash of the Titans everything looks so rushy and everybody just wants to get this movie ended as soon as possible, there should be a catch phrase to the next scene making the movie watcher glued to their seats but here there is none to be worth to tell - therefore to portray the story more properly they should have elaborated more on the character in a calmer and longer way so that it will give an essence to the film's credibility, that's lacking of confidence to any movie goers.<br/><br/>Nevertheless its watchable, but just for the CGI's and passing of time for the real adventure you MUST at all means stick to the Original Version."
"barnabyrudge","3","4","5","2 October 2010"," Shallow retelling of the Perseus & Andromeda myth, all special effects and no soul.
","This new version of Clash Of The Titans is a special effects movie – the problem is that beyond the special effects it has nothing to offer. No characterisation, no interaction, no sense of wonder and – worst of all – no evident narrative. The whole thing plays out like a series of random action sequences, with the deeper story that should link these sequences together completely left out. The 1981 version may have been childish and rather wooden, but at least it had characters worth caring about and unfolded in a way that was involving for the audience. That's what is lacking here – a sense of involvement. The incredible effects dazzle the eye but fail to engage the brain. Nor does it help that the Greek myth of Perseus and Andromeda has been altered so dramatically – why do contemporary film-makers insist on arrogantly rewriting things that have stood the test of time for centuries?<br/><br/>Rescued as a baby from a floating coffin, Perseus (Sam Worthington) grows up believing he is a fisherman. Only later does he learn that he is, in fact, the son of Zeus. Following the death of his family Perseus arrives in the sinful city of Argus, just as the citizens are being encouraged by their monarchy to denounce the Gods. Angry Zeus (Liam Neeson) sends down his black-hearted brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) to restore order Hades promptly threatens to unleash the Kraken upon the city, unless the citizens sacrifice their princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). A small group of hardy soldiers set off on a quest, reluctantly joined by Perseus, to find a way of saving themselves and their princess.<br/><br/>There's really not much to add to what I've already said about this would-be epic. The performances barely matter when the emphasis is so obviously on the visual effects – beyond running, jumping, falling and fighting the lead actors have precious little to do. Worthington's accent wobbles between stiff English and Aussie brogue, but most of the time he just has to indulge in heroic posturing. It's quite galling to see the more distinguished talents of Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Pete Postlethwaite wasted in glorified cameo appearances. The cleverest touch in the whole film is when Perseus picks up a metallic owl and asks ""What is this?"". ""Just leave it"" replies a soldier with a rueful shake of the head. Those who remember the 1981 version will recognise the owl as one of Ray Harryhausen's many creatures that assist Perseus in his quest. A rare moment of wit in a largely shallow, forgettable and uninspired special effects farrago."
"Quebec_Dragon","4","4","5","13 September 2010"," The problem with Clash of the Titans
","I finally saw it in glorious 2d on my high-definition TV set. The ingredients could have been there for a wonderful heroic movie but it was a miss for me. The special effects were certainly professional, especially the creatures, but I felt disconnected and even bored more than once. The heroics you would expect were not exciting or elating like they should have been (see ""300"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" for that). The deaths were practically all lame and anticlimactic. In fiction, I expect deaths to shock, amaze and/or move me. None of that here. Worst of all, sometimes I didn't even know if a named character had just just died! Not for suspense reasons but because it was badly filmed. In an epic fantasy movie, I expect to feel some awe and wonder. Those feelings were not really there for me. The flight on a winged steed didn't thrill me at all as it did in ""Avatar"" or ""How to Train your Dragon"".<br/><br/>The characters were mostly cardboard, uninteresting and didn't have much presence except for Io, the only female companion, who had an otherwordly yet classical beauty quality to her, and Hades the God of the Underworld. The little seen Greek Gods were underwhelming and the more present Zeus (Liam Neeson)'s armor was not only too shiny (perhaps to hide the low-quality craftmanship) but his beard was ugly and distracting. It bugged me that Perseus the hero became a master swordfighter in one battle (heredity can only explain so much) and that no one bothered to close their eyes or cover them while fighting the Medusa. To people who say there's no story, I would say instead that there's a simple one. The problem is that it's not that engrossing or memorable. You can easily be distracted by the successions of fights especially when the few character moments (supposed to build up sympathy for the characters) are lacking.<br/><br/>The story also relies too often on surprise allies or cheap gimmicks to get the heroes out of trouble. For the last adversary who should be near impossible to defeat, it felt as if the director just badly needed to wrap things up quickly. It doesn't excuse how short, illogical and disappointing that ""battle"" was. Oh and lest we forget, there is no clash between ""Titans"" per say. It's more clashes between humans and mythological creatures. This remake is certainly watchable, would make an acceptable rental for fantasy fans, but it lacks in heart and talent what it certainly does not lack in budget.<br/><br/>Rating : 4 out of 10 (Poor)"
"lewiskendell","3","4","5","26 August 2010"," A soulless remake with little to offer beyond loads of special effects.
","""I can't become like them. If I do this, I do it as a man.""<br/><br/>No one can say that this remake of Clash of the Titans is just a retread, that's for sure. Some of the people and events remain the same, but most of this new version is a completely different movie altogether. Different, but not very good.<br/><br/>CG is used liberally. Everywhere you turn there's a CG monster or a special effect. But that doesn't change the fact that Clash of the Titans feels like nothing more than an empty action movie flavored with the story of Perseus and a conflict between men and the Greek gods. We're moved from one unimpressive action scene to another without any reason to care about what happens to the protagonists, and all the giant scorpions in the world didn't keep this from feeling boring and ultimately pointless.<br/><br/>I thought that Sam Worthington was decent in Avatar, but here he's bland and dull as Perseus. Liam Neeson (who seems to be in every other movie these days) has very little to do, and is basically wasted. The same goes for Ralph Fiennes. Gemma Arterton just looks pretty and serves as the generic knowledgeable guide that these kinds of movies seem obligated to have. The surprisingly decent cast was basically thwarted at every turn by a poor script that put little effort into presenting interesting characters.<br/><br/>Big action movies can be a lot of fun, but not when they're this uninspired. Clash of the Titans is an inferior effort. Not just in comparison to the original movie, but to the entire genre, in general. See it if you must, but I doubt you'll be eager to view it a second time."

Do I need to add that he acting was over the top, the costumes absurd, the scenery ridiculous and the storyline thin? American BHollywood has a tendency to produce cheap nonsense movies with a lot of tricks and digital enhancements and apparently this is another one in that chapter. When you ask Liam in a few years i am sure he will be ashamed he ever participated in this movie. I was so disappointed about the quality of this movie that i thought that i must share that here....

"pascaloetterli","7","4","5","18 April 2010"," When the original is better the critics get harsh - but it could be worse
","Yes, we all loved the original movie and it is interesting that it is still so intriguing. This film as a remake has failed, but standing alone it is worth seeing it.<br/><br/>It is better not to argue about the original Greek mythology, when it comes to that, even the old clash would be a disappointment. No, modern movies are defiant of what is classical Greek, but every era has it's own version of the ancient beliefs. A new Clash of the Titans had to be somewhat faster, more cruel and have more action to get any crowd in the theatre. Times change and so does the audience. And hey, what do we have here? A fine cast consisting of two of the best actors in the business: Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. Harry Hamlin was the better Perseus than Sam Worthington, because he reflected the naïveté, fear and male beauty better. Without having seen Hamlin, Worthington is also fine enough as main cast. <br/><br/>The original had the mechanical owl Bubo, the remake has beautiful Gemma Arterton as newbie helper. Bubo brought a bit of humour in the old story, while semi goddess Io is too important up to the point that the characters of Andromeda, Cassiopeia and the Olympian goddesses get forgotten. The attraction between Perseus and Io should have been better embedded in the story or -at best- not be there at all. Also the ""Djinn"" race has too much of a ""Alien""/""Autobots"" style and doesn't belong here neither. On the good side we have a much better view on the accompanying soldiers - one must love Mads Mikkelson, doesn't? <br/><br/>The action is fine, the images were great, especially landscapes the Underworld and the city of Argo. Yes the new techniques can work wonders, and if you despise digital imagery don't go watch a movie like this. The old filmmakers would have loved the possibility to create worlds like that. <br/><br/>You will get entertained if you don't insist on the remake being a real remake or being a better version of the original. You have to go there and enjoy the newest version of a Greek classic with a fine cast, appropriate portions of action and state of the art imagery. If you are a lover of deep emotions, intriguing plots and dialogues you can pass on this Clash."

Having said that let's go back to Clash of the Titans.<br/><br/>I don't want to start comparing this remake with the original one because I think that every decade has it's advantages and disadvantages and a comparison does no good. But let me tell you this. CGI is not everything in a movie and Hollywood has to comprehend this finally. This movie has awful dialogs and the story is super porous. I mean come on a guy who was fisher all his life fights like a superhero. OK you might say he's the son of Zeus and a demigod but then again, why couldn't he save his family from drowning in the beginning. Sam Worthington surely is the Shooting-Star after having appeared in blockbusters like Terminator and Avatar but if he isn't careful in his role choices he'll end up where all these wanna be action stars from the 80's have been categorized. <br/><br/>You know I don't even want to list all the leak of this film but after 20 minutes I was bored to death and regretted badly I spent my money on this waste of time. <br/><br/>Clahs of the titans is the worst movie I've seen this year so far.

Perseus doesn't want this war but is motivated by the death of his adoptive family by a god, Poseidon.<br/><br/>So there it is, the reluctant protagonist motivated by the death of his adoptive family to seek vengeance against his biological father aided by an eclectic group of allies makes for the typical fantasy-action movie.<br/><br/>This movie clearly tried to ride on the excitement of the action sequences and effects of the CGI and at times that was possible. The scorpion fight scene was particularly well done. But later in the movie as the plot begins to weaken more and more those scenes loose their impact.<br/><br/>The movie relies on its special effects a lot. Not quite to the extent that Avatar did but still the effects are a big crutch for the movie to lean on and they are done well. The gigantic scorpions are frightening and the glowing hall of the gods was particularly stunning.<br/><br/>Neeson plays Zeus well, the authority can be heard on his voice. Ralph Fiennes, who always seems to play the villain, is Hades. He is great as the ruler of the underworld, a master manipulator. Worthington as Perseus is dull, he plays the protagonist with little emotion and makes the character bland. He also appears to the only person with a razor at this point in history. While everyone around him has biblically long beards he manages to maintain that constant tough guy stubble.<br/><br/>Clash of the Titans tries to mask a predictable story with over the top fight scenes and a pair of good actors but can't quite pull through and leaves viewers in disappointment."

The 3D was a huge disappointment (after watching avatar) and if anything made it harder to follow the fast action movements on screen. Aspects of the film were poorly explained, for example one quick shot of an owl, which didn't appear to have any relevance to anything else. Despite the star cast they just couldn't pull it off! The set of the gods and the hazy glow around Zeus, brought back a Flash Gordon-like image to my mind. I went with 3 friends and none of us would recommend paying money to see this film.

"ironhorse_iv","6","5","7","21 May 2013"," Trash of the Titans did release the Crap end! I meant the Kraken!
","Don't get me wrong, I like the whole movie start to finish, but it's so disappointing. It's not like the original 1983 Clash of the Titans was any better. I'm usually fairly easy going when it comes to popcorn flicks that serve no real purpose except to exist as silly fun. Still, there is a little bit of drawbacks in this film. If you follow real Greek mythology, you will be disappointed. If you follow the original movie, then you will be disappointed, too. This film takes this myth to a new direction, while keeping the basis close to mind. The movie by director Louis Leterrier was still interesting. Surprising a movie that has a title ""Clash of the Titans"" and titans are only once briefly mentioned, that if you say a word, you lose it. Who the hell made the decision of placing an monster named Kraken in the Ancient Greece? Isn't that Norse mythology? Then you got Djinns in this? Isn't that Arabic mythology? The biggest change from the original 1983 movie and this was the love story between the hero Perseus (Sam Worthington) and the princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). They change it, to love between the hero and the immortal nymph Io (Gemma Arterton). It was rather a better love story than the original in my opinion, but still the princess made more sense since it's in the Greek mythology, and Io wasn't in this story. Anyways, Perseus is a demi-God who must rescue the princess from a sea monster sent by the Gods. By doing this, he has to kill the Gorgon monster known as Medusa who can turn any onlookers into stone and use her head as a weapon. All in all, this movie was just another visual CGI feast. The CGI is breath taking, but the way they conversion the film 2D to 3D made the movie look horrible. There are blurry scenes, and examples of with people's hair flowing beyond their heads without anything holding it. The hero is hardly likable as he doesn't talk much, the two hunters really served no role and kind of left the group before they did anything useful, the Medusa battle killed nearly everyone within minutes, including all the soldiers I actually cared about. The only actual scene I enjoyed was the Medusa fight, the combination of stealth, fighting an enemy you can't see, and arrows was pretty cool. But what on Earth were they trying to make Medusa look beautiful? The original 1983's Medusa was scary. This one makes her look like a super model with snakes on her. With all the hype behind the Kraken, you'd think it would be an epic battle but it only in screen time for a short period of time. Way disappointing. I got confused, I thought it was the Cloverfield monster or a Rancor from Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. I have to say the flute scene was a bit funny. Who knew bitch was a word in ancient time as well. About the acting. It was mediocre. Sam Worthington plays the exact same character he played in every other film he has been in. Gemma Arterton's performance was boring and emotionless as usual and even though Liam Neeson tried his best to fit in with the role as Zeus, his talent was utterly wasted. Ralphs Fiennes does his Voldemort voice for Hades which was kinda annoying. Overall: Effects looked pretty but the story was half assed and character development was non-existent. It's just mindless eye candy. Probably good for a rental or a free watch on television one day."

","Okay, the original ""Clash of the Titans"" was cheesy and by today standards, it might look silly and dated. However, this remake manages to be sillies and cheesier, mostly because it takes itself so seriously that it ends being ridiculous and stupid.<br/><br/>Sure: The special effects and CGI were good, and plot tries too hard to be edgier and more intense than the original movie, adding more violence, drama and angst and all that stuff, but after all, it ends being just another ""Lord of the Rings"" wannabe that fails and is quickly forgotten. Just like ""Eragon"". Or ""SpiderWick"". Or ""Percy Jackson"". Or ""The Scorpion King"". Or ""The Golden Compass"". Or ""300"". Or ""Beowulf"".

I know this will be more individual than most film opinions, and my demographic and sexual history may be different than most, but these women lit up the screen whenever they appeared.<br/><br/>As the queen whose heretical indiscretions are behind the curse of Argos, we have Polly Walker. She, who in the past has leveraged proud, liquid beauty, (especially in ""8 ½ Women"") has earned her way in our memory. We can easily believe she would taunt the gods just for the hell of it. (Heh.) And believe she deserves to.<br/><br/>The princess is who we initially expect is going to be the love interest. That she proves not to be is the only narrative surprise in this drudge. She is not the busty, snarling fish filmmakers often put in these films. She is an ordinary girl, who looks ordinary, like she was picked out while waitressing. Yes, I know she is a model, but her appeal is that she does not seem so.<br/><br/>There is even care in minor women: Elizabeth McGovern as the adoptive mother. Tine Stapelfeldt as the mother of Perseus by rape tells volumes in the seconds we see her dead. That's acting. You even have Jane March in the background of Olympus!<br/><br/>But the female anchor of this thing is a remarkable presence. We saw her in her natural redheaded state in the last James Bond Adventure. She dies of course. She impressed, and was able to keep the first part of that film alive in spite of itself. Here she has a balance between innocent devotion and willing adventuress. Made up more than the other women, they've artificially made her luminous, like Zeus. In the actual myth, she has an extraordinary role not shown here, as mistress to Zeus. <br/><br/>Gemma Arterton, worth the light she uses.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","3/10 is where I'll start with this. It may be generous, but it isn't all terrible. Over time it may creep up to a 3 or 4 out of 10, if it gets edited.<br/><br/>It's loosely the story of Perseus, no more or less digressed than most films. A Greek hero kills monsters and rescues a damsel in distress.<br/><br/>What is done with the film is pretty annoying. The script is cliché, but we can live with that. Lots of characters look like carry overs from other action films. There's a few twists that may make it a little less bland.<br/><br/>The actors do their job. I have no problem with them. They deal with a very mundane script and poor editing. The little people involved in make up and other jobs obviously made a serious effort.<br/><br/>The director seems to be on drugs, however. We have no logical pattern. We aren't really introduced to most of the characters, and the action is just a dork's video game, a complete blur, ridiculous and impossible to follow. There is no logical sequence of events in the action presented, or in the characters. Again, not the fault of the actors, but of horrid directing. To call it splotchy is an understatement.<br/><br/>It tries to make some points, and for the effort people made, I generously give this a 3/10.

","I totally agree with JoeB131 that wrote in the title of the previous review: ""There should be a rule against remakes"". ""Clash of Titans"" (2010) has great special effects, but without the charm of the original movie of 1981, one of my favorite fantasy films ever. The plot of this remake is very weak; uses a black Pegasus; forgets the delightful mechanical golden owl Bubo that makes a cameo only; and creates a diversion to the viewers with gorgeous actresses and stunning special effects. The awesome ""Total Recall"" seems to be the next victim of these brainless greedy people of Hollywood. My vote is five.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Fúria de Titãs"" (""Fury of Titans"")"

Firstly, I was confused the whole time as to why the movie was so dark and blurry. I felt it was probably the cinema I went to, maybe something was wrong with the screen as all the previous 3D films I'd seen were almost flawless. I was thinking of even complaining about it later on but thank God I didn't or else I would have made a big fool out of myself. I took my 3D glasses off so many times during the movie, especially during the action scenes because I felt I was going to go blind, my eyes started watering up and my sockets hurt. It was an awful 3D experience. Secondly, I was looking for some depth in the storyline and the characters but there wasn't any. After every scene, I felt there was something missing, may be the excitement in the story. Supposedly an epic tale, but clash of the titans surely didn't portray it the way it was supposed to be. It was disappointing over all, and I really wanted to see 'how to train your dragon' instead but I ended up watching this one, to my utter disgust and disappointment. Oh well...you might still enjoy it in 2D, you will be able to see clearer without having headaches."

","I went to see this movie with an absolute high hope thinking it gonna be big!! It gonna be Hugh!! An Epic!! Somewhat like The Lords of the Ring. After all, the name itself already implies that –it is Clash of the Titans. But for crying out loud – this is nothing more than just a mediocre old age movie with really bad script and probably worst editing I've seen this year.<br/><br/>It doesn't take me long at all for me to realize that this is not going to be the movie I hope for (about 5mins into the film). The script was plain flat, no character development no nothing – heavily rely on how the action sequences and how going to turn out. The worst part was it very chopped up and everything seems like a race. One minute you were watching this, next minute is totally different situation – it was so fast I don't even have time to absorb anything. (For Pete sake! How cans anyone put an epic into 90 min movie?) Plus this film got really weak dialogue and completely uninspiring lines.<br/><br/>I'm really sorry but it doesn't really stop there. The casting was just awful (solely because of bad script) – I like Sam, but this movie make me realize –he doesn't have much personality or character at all, it is like he play the same character for every movie. The others are – you don't really care about them at all, much of their story and background have been omitted and so I don't really feel the connection or care how they're going to be.<br/><br/>I can't really point out the good part of the movie at all – but maybe a couple of decent CGI of the monsters and some fast pace action sequences that remind me of Transformers 2. The wardrobe was out of place, out of the blue there is couple of white dude wearing something like an Indian holy man, and the army suit was weird (though I do like Zeus suit).<br/><br/>Overall I'm quite disappointed with the whole movie and its story. But I guess the pre-teen boys might enjoy this with all the monsters killing, slaying the Medusa, and the quest to save the life of the princess he doesn't even know. No wonder it was release now rather than in the summer.<br/><br/>Reason To Watch: If You're Looking For the Action and Nothing Else Then This Might Be the Movie For You.<br/><br/>Reason Not To: Please Read the Above.<br/><br/>Rating: 5/10 (Grade: D )"

","I honestly don't think I could put in to words how excited I was to see this movie. And now, I honestly don't think I could put in to many words how much I hated this movie. I almost feel it would be appropriate to just copy and paste the word ""GARBAGE"" over and over again, it would probably be an accurate review. About half way through the movie, I realized nothing was even in 3D anymore, so, I just removed my glasses and held back the urge to leave the theater. The only reason I didn't leave, it because I was with a group of people, and I drove everyone. If that hadn't been the circumstance, I wouldn't have seen the ending of this movie.<br/><br/>The action was awful, and almost non-existent. The characters were boring. The Dialogue felt like it was written by a 12 year old. And the plot didn't make much sense at all. And my main complaint about this movie. After about an hour, we have about 7 ""developed"" characters. They go to fight Medusa and on their way, pretty much say ""How are we going to get back after this?"". They ""fight"" Medusa for about 5 minutes, and everyone, literally every character, dies. Except Perseus, of course. Then, he just magically appears back on Earth, with no explanation of how he got out of Hades, just to watch his immortal girl friend die. But, fret not, she is magically resurrected at the end of the film, even though she was supposedly cursed by the gods."
"Simon_Says_Movies","7","7","11","16 April 2010"," Little to take away; good or bad
","Clash of the Titans reminds me much of my feelings towards last year's blockbuster Wolverine; satisfied, but far from enamoured. During the running time we are roused by the numerous action sequences, the special effects are well done and the plethora of A-list stars keep the story grounded (at least to some effect). Yet after the screen last grown dark there is little to remember; bad or good. You know you had a fun time no more, no less.<br/><br/>You will not find me clamouring for the DVD upon the films home release date but I would not be above having another look if I came across it on TV. Mostly, I am torn (As you can surmise by this pseudo- recommendation). I went in expecting dumb fun and hammy acting and I got just that but to that same effect, Clash is nothing to write home about so to what standard should this film be held? Pondering aside, I will move forth and let you make your own final ruling.<br/><br/>The 1981 original of the same name (which I admit I have not yet seen) has those devout followers in equal part to those who find it a dated clunker. With 2010's Clash I can by no means foresee this following any trajectory other than that of a by-the-numbers blockbuster; cult status is not in this movie's stars. But as I alluded to it is entertaining popcorn fluff, bogged down however by an overabundance of mish-mashed lore and mythology. Clash does not play by any sort of rules but seems to make them up as it goes along. Whenever our heroes find themselves in peril a character or creature pops up with a unique skill to save the day. There is never a sense of tension or danger as you can tell that a hidden gift or plot contrivance will appear to vanquish all foes along with narrative coherence.<br/><br/>Clash of the Titans is at its best during the action set pieces and I suppose that is the only real reason to venture out anyways. Whether it be giant scorpions, the monstrous Kraken, the cackling Medusa or the gods themselves the battles are first rate. Amidst these, dare I say clashes, our half man half god Perseus (Sam Worthington, who was proved himself to be a charismatic leading man) sets out on a quest spurred by the deaths of his mortal parents. Prophecy has foretold he will be the one to defeat the mammoth see creature called the Kraken and weaken its master Hades for good (or something like that). Despite the aforementioned oodles of mythology, plot takes a back seat and truthfully would you expect anything more?<br/><br/>As the immortal brothers we have Ralph Fiennes as Hades and Liam Neeson as Zeus and both are the real stars of the movie in my opinion. Neeson brings the appropriate level of pomposity and empathy to the character while never playing it too straight; he knows what movie he's in. Nobody can play evil like Fiennes and his Hades apart from being realized skilfully in a visual sense, is very menacing portrayed in a forced whisper. Kudos should also be given to Mads Mikkelsen as Draco (a gritty companion or Perseus) who strikes a delightful balance between humour and badassery.<br/><br/>It often annoys me when people affirm that people should take a movie 'for what it is', especially for outwardly awful cinematic blunders. Clash of the Titans is neither one of these blunders (at least not entirely) and frankly in this case, it is what it is.<br/><br/>6.5 / 10.0<br/><br/>Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

Awful plot - if there was any, distorted depiction of mythological characters, inclusion of characters that weren't even supposed to be in it (djinns in a Greek myth?), bad acting, even worse dialogue and costumes - Zeus looked like an overaged glam-rock star and Hades the older brother of Voldermort.

"cadillac20","5","15","29","2 April 2010"," An entertaining fare for the weekend
","When I first saw the previews for Clash, I wasn't terribly thrilled. I never saw the original, and don't have much interest in seeing it. Neither have I been too big into Greek mythology. While I always found it kind of fun and exciting, it's nothing I rush out to see. So, Clash seemed like the kind of film I would see if nothing better to do. Suffice to say, the trailers didn't exhibit a whole lot of excitement. But, fueled by a recent play of God of War III and some 300-style excitement thanks to Sparticus: Blood and Sand, my interest was more so peaked. And sure enough, Clash delivers about what you'd expect: a fairly entertaining affair that probably won't be remember far beyond the theater.<br/><br/>The film doesn't waste much time with mythology lessons. It explains, very briefly, that the children of the Titans, the Greek gods headed by Zeus, used a powerful creature, The Kraken, to kill their parents. But much of the film is a tale about half man, half god Perseus who sets off to defeat the mighty beast, whom Hades is trying to use to bring down Zeus and steal his thrown. And, pretty much the entire film is driven by it's action scenes, with some fairly epic battles, most notably against giant scorpions and Medusa (the Medusa battle was particularly fun).<br/><br/>Most actors do a wonderful job in their respective roles, with Liam Neeson playing Zeus, Ralph Fiennes mimicking his Voldemort role as Hades, and favorite new action hero Sam Worthington as Perseus. The lovely Gemma Arterton, an up and coming actress who can next be seen in Prince of Persia, also does a fine job as aid to Perseus, Io, although her role seems a bit wooden. The three aforementioned actors though are the most entertaining, with Fiennes' Hades and Neeson's Zeus demonstrating a good bit of their acing finesse. Worthington proves once again that he is an excellent action hero, with him being the new reluctant hero for our time. Unfortunately, I can't help but feel as if his typecasting might wear thin. Having to watch Sam do another role like this might be it for me. But for this film, it's suitable.<br/><br/>The action is the primary reason to see this, and it is quite exciting. It's nothing that makes you go wow, but it is quite entertaining. There's enough interesting Greek mythology here for a good time at the theater and it's certainly not a waste of time. Unfortunately, that missing wow factor hinders the film. I doubt that this will be remembered much outside the theater. The special effects never really present anything we haven't seen. Even the epic Kraken, which is given quite possibly the most epic introduction ever, isn't all you think it would be cracked up to be (no pun intended....on second thought....). Nothing really pops here, and that's a real shame. With all sorts of great Greek mythology to pull from, it could have even been possible to pull off something as epic as was played in God of War III. Or perhaps that's asking to much. <br/><br/>All in all, I can't complain too much. The film doesn't try to be much more than what it is. It also doesn't go much beyond one action scene after another. So, for what it was, I suppose I got what I expected. Which is nothing I can complain about at all. Better than being disappointed. Hopefully you enjoy the film as much, or even more, than I did."

","Clash of the Titans is a bad fantasy, adventure film. I have not seen the 1981 film of the same name, but I might be interested in checking it out in the future. I could not believe my eyes when I saw that this movie cost 125 million $ and that it grossed almost 500 million $. It makes me sad that such movies earn so much money.<br/><br/>First of all, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I didn't understand anything from the action scenes of this film. I found it weird that some people could not understand the action in Transformers and its sequels when I had no problem figuring out what was going on. This being stated, the action scenes in this film are very confusing, especially a scene involving giant scorpions. At first there was one scorpion and minutes later, there were about 5 more and I couldn't figure out where the hell did they come from. I blame this on Louis Leterrier, the director of this film. Definitely, the worst part of this film is the directing and I can almost say that it is one of the most poorly-directed films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Second of all, the script is full of stupid lines and a lot of scenes in the film feel cheesy and worthless. The characters suffered because of this and not once was I actually rooting for Perseus to defeat Hades. And when some characters stood out and I actually got interested in them, they immediately did something which put me off.<br/><br/>The acting of the film is most likely the only good aspect, but not a stand-out. The actors who did a great job were Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades. They were awesome, although after thinking of it, Hades' voice was too similar to that of Lord Voldemort, but no biggie. Definitely the two of them worked great when they were on screen together and they possibly represent the only good aspect of this film. Another character I liked, but was barely in the film, is that of Spyros, foster father to Perseus, portrayed by Pete Postlethwaite. Maybe Gemma Arterton as Io and Mads Mikkelsen as Draco are also worth mentioning. Now I don't know if his acting was the worst in the film but it definitely annoyed me the most. I'm talking about Sam Worthington. Can he be more hollow than this?! He is the same character in every film and I can't understand how he gets so many important roles.<br/><br/>Overall this film is a 6. I was wondering if I should go higher but after further thinking about this film, it's definitely the correct rating. I suggest you avoid this film unless you are very bored and are in the mood for some mythological-related action."

","Based on the 1981 film of the same name, Clash of the Titans is a big budget CGI-fest that aims to dazzle the senses with it's busy action sequences and sprawling scopes. With a heavyweight cast and a dizzying $125m budget, director Louis Letterier has created what is essentially a rushed looking collection of overblown set pieces assembled around chunks of dull exposition. This is the story of demigod Perseus, played by Sam Worthington, and his quest to fight as a man, for man against the vengeful Gods of Olympus who are royally 'cheesed off' because some soldiers took it upon themselves to knock down a big statue of Zeus – Liam Neeson no less. So, fresh from the 'underworld', up pops big bad God Hades (Ralph Fiennes), embracing his inner Voldermort, to teach mankind a lesson. Frankly, why Zeus would ever set a God with blatant mental health issues loose on a species he claims to love is never fleshed out, but then again, this isn't a film that invests much time fleshing much of anything out. Instead, it's far more concerned with getting some of that $125m budget and shoving it in your face. And so it does. Along the ahem, 'epic' quest (presented via a series of sweeping CG exteriors), we encounter all manner of CG behemoths, none of which are animated with any convincing real world heft. The Medusa part of the story, the chapter i always found to be the most riveting and frightening as a child, sacrifices any genuine creepiness by being a noisy and action heavy overload of computer generated disappointment, which all but sums up the film. Sam Worthington fails to inject any personality into Perseus, Gemma Arterton looks pale faced and pretty while Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes most likely pick up a decent payday in exchange for a bit of hammy overdoing it. When the inevitable conclusion finally comes, it's a welcome relief. With it's swordplay and excitable action, the film may function satisfactorily for an early teen audience, but for most it's sorely lacking in many areas, most crucially character and script. Despite much derision aimed at it's eleventh hour retro-fitted 3D release, the film turned over an almighty $493.2m in global box office although if you've seen the spoiler heavy trailer first, you've pretty much seen the whole thing. Cash of the Titans might have been a more appropriate title."

","CLASH OF THE TITANS was perhaps more entertaining as a 3D movie in theaters than it is on the small screen of the home television where the CGI effects are less impressive and at times downright silly. Louis Leterrier directed this remake of the 1981 Olivier/Hamlin epic based on Beverley Cross's take on the struggle for power between the Greek Gods and mankind: this time around the myth is manipulated by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay, and Matt Manfredi who have managed to create dialogue that must have been embarrassing for the actors to speak. The gods are either surrounded by blinding light or smog-on-a-bad-day smoke and the presence of the creatures of the very mixed up version of the myth range form beautiful Pegasus (flying horses) to a voluptuous Medusa to the bigger than life scorpions and devilish gods to the Kraken who probably wins the contest for most disgusting beastie - though the competition is tough! <br/><br/>The story is basically an attempt of Zeus and the gods on Olympus to restore their tainted reputation as being adored and worshiped through the wiles of Perseus who is thwarted by a long standing sibling rivalry victim Hades in Perseus' travels to kill the Medusa and the supposedly indestructible Kraken. It is a tale of men versus kings versus gods versus good and evil. The very odd aspect of this dark film is the fact that of many of the cast are among the finest actors on the screen. Some are minor actors (Sam Worthington plays Sam Worthington who is placed complete with burr cut in the role of Perseus), but others include Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Hans Matheson, Danny Huston, Nicholas Hoult, the departed Pete Postlethwaite, Mads Mikkelsen (the strongest in the cast), a very chubby Polly Walker, Elizabeth McGovern, Gemma Arterton - the list goes on and on. <br/><br/>Having never seen the original 1981 Clash of the Titans makes comparison impossible, but if the purpose for making this over the edge movie was to test contemporary 3D techniques it probably succeeds. As for the acting and the script - this film is merely a chuckle. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

No negatives here.<br/><br/>What the movie lacks severely in comparison to LotR is story development and character development.<br/><br/>To see the flaws, it's enough to watch the first few minutes of the film.

Perseus' father expresses his admiration of it, but a few seconds later it turns out soldiers are actually cutting its feet off. ""WHAT ARE THEY DOING???"" ""They have declared war, war upon the gods!!"" This should be enough to illustrate how the viewer is thrown from scene to scene without any build up. Whereas a sentence such as ""they have declared...war upon the gods"" would have carried weight if there had been a deeper context, it is just hollow words in this movie.<br/><br/>Then, some nice special effects happen, and (here is a spoiler, but it doesn't matter), Perseus' father gets drowned due to supernatural causes. Do we as viewers feel much about this? Not really. Again, we don't know the character who dies, except by the sum of one minute of generic rambling about father-son bonds and anger of gods that we saw earlier.<br/><br/>Returning to the overall picture, I feel that this movie was created with the premise ""Hey, this movie hasn't been remade yet, we can make money here!"" It is easy to see how much more of a solid foundation a project like the LotR movies is built on."
"xandar27","5","2","2","5 August 2010"," Fair, but could have been so much better.
","Having read a good number of the reviews here, I feel the film is being panned too much by some. However it does need criticism. As a general action fantasy to watch without any preconceptions, it fills the bill as a film that is worth seeing without being a stand-out.<br/><br/>Where it does go wrong is in two spheres. Firstly there has been a failure to produce rounded or likable characters, Perseus is less sympathetic and his motivation is changed from love to revenge. Andromeda's role, like that of mid-level villain, Calibos, has been cut to shreds. Ammon disappears entirely, while the other members of the questing party are just flat, stock characters, seemingly there solely as cannon-fodder, to be taken out one by one by the CGI monsters.<br/><br/>This brings us to the second failure of the film, which is pacing. The time between battles has simply not been used to fill out the main characters or deepen our interest in them and the situation they face. Instead, as many have commented, there seems to have been a fear of taking more than two minutes between each set-piece battle. The fights themselves have a rushed, confused feel, which fails to produce the tension and involvement of the original. Too much reliance seems to have been placed on CGI, and its supposed ability to create a ""wow"" factor on its own. Indeed, the transition between location filming and staged sets was often too evident. From the deleted scenes disk, I note that the interplay between gods other than Zeus and Hades was cut almost completely. Those scenes didn't seem to be working however, so perhaps that was a good decision.<br/><br/>On the whole, if you threw out your memories of the first film, this was quite enjoyable escapism. Some of the special effects were excellent, and I did not wholly dislike the introduction of Hades to the mix. This could have been so much better though with more attention to the human element, but I still hope to watch the proposed sequel."
"Remy_Azhary","1","14","27","2 April 2010"," Bomb of a nuclear proportion
","Never have I had the urge to leave a theater before a movie ends so much till this piece of junk was rolled in front of me. That was exactly how I feel during the running of the latest remake of CLASH OF THE TITANS. If it were not for my friend whose eyes were zealously piercing through those 3D glasses onto the screen, I would have been long gone even before 30 minutes into the movie. Yeah, it was THAT BAD. Throughout the entire movie one quote kept on running in my mind:<br/><br/>""WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP!!!!""<br/><br/>I am usually skeptical about watching remakes especially after the numerous spawning of such mediocre productions over the past decade or so. Yet when I read news that there would be an update version to the 1981 CLASH OF THE TITANS, I was conflicted with both enthusiasm and skepticism. For one thing, I have such reverence for the original version in terms of its faithful storyline in accordance to the legends and its authentic Greek feel. On the other hand, I felt that there was also a need to update the effects via new technologies; which I initially admit that the Ray Harryhausen's stop-animation masterpieces were pretty tacky and cheesy.<br/><br/>I was hoping for too much.<br/><br/>The result is a total waste of time for the audience and waste of talents in the lights of the actors, even for the gifted director, Louis Leterrier (who previously directed THE INCREDIBLE HULK which was good).<br/><br/>The 2010 version of CLASH does not live up to its predecessor on so many levels. In fact, personally, I feel that it's really a bomb of a nuclear proportion.<br/><br/>For a start, it felt too rushed as if trying to feed the audience with too many food from the buffet table all at one go so much so that as an audience I felt lost for most of the time. There were also too many unnecessary characters that not only disrupt the plot but were extremely annoying as well. Another point was that, some of these characters had almost no background stories at all. It's as if the writers felt compelled to showcase their existence in the film just so they could tie in to the mythology without having any need to have a proper introduction. For instance, Pegasus suddenly appeared all of a sudden without informing the audience where this creature came from leaving some of those (ahem...ignoramus who have no idea about Greek mythologies) audience clueless.<br/><br/>The appearance of cameos were equally wasted on their roles that came on screen only for a few minutes. Screen veterans such as Pete Postlethwaite, Polly Walker, Jane March and Danny Houston were on screen for a mere several minutes with some of them only uttering a single line. Mind you, these are good Hollywood actors whose time were much deserved on better film projects.<br/><br/>And just because the buzz word in films these days is 3D, that does not necessarily translate as making this ""supposedly blockbuster"" crap into one as well. Plus, it's tiring to have those glasses clutching onto your head throughout the entire movie especially when the only prominent 3D effect that was visible on screen was the subtitles.<br/><br/>Now, having seen the new CLASH, I somehow have grown an immense respect for the 1981 version. I felt that those tacky and cheesy effects in the original 1981 version were but minute and trivial altogether in comparison to its bigger picture of the movie itself. I somehow feel humbled by the learned writings of Beverley Cross who designed the story almost accurately to the real legend and the gifted Desmond Davis' vision of the original for their masterpiece deserves all the respect of movie audiences who heard about CLASH OF THE TITANS both old and new. Last but not least, to the ""tacky and cheesy"" stop-animations of Ray Harryhausen who does deserve a considerable amount of credit for his effort in bringing the legend of Perseus to life."

"geeze74","1","15","30","1 April 2010"," Not good
","Just got back from a screening of this. The attached Shrek 3 trailer was genuine 3D, this mess certainly wasn't. As a fan of the original, I had high hopes of something along similar lines but with use of the technical advances available today. Not so, the film is just a poor rip-off of a far superior original. Sure the cgi is there but its nothing special, the original Medusa was far more effective and the Kraken in this version was hardly worth the wait. In '3D' the creatures are not improved at all, actually nothing is improved and I would advise anyone who really needs to see this film to watch it in 2D. The '3D' on show here is not 3D as we would expect these days and nothing at all comes flying out from the screen, except for maybe the end credits.<br/><br/>As far as the acting, well this is not why you would watch a film like this but Sam Worthington sounds like Crocodile Dundee throughout all of this, very off putting and completely wooden. Ralph Fiennes, not too bad with what he is given, Liam Neeson, thought it was Qui Gon Jinn up there in glowing armour, nothing new to offer at all.<br/><br/>I can't come up with any positives about this movie and it is a shadow of the previous version. The whole thing seems rushed, any comedic relief falls flatter than a pancake and did I mention the '3D'...........all in all, buy the blu-ray of the original and let Ray Harryhausen show us how it should be done."
"sonikbaby2000","9","12","23","4 April 2010"," Clash of the TItans: Everything I expected and it was great!
","I don't know what all the critics are smoking, but Clash of the Titans is a great fantasy movie! Now some of the mythology was changed and it doesn't have some deep life changing plot, no, but that isn't what I came to the movie to see. I am a huge fantasy fan and this movie delivered exactly what I wanted: epic weapons, great fight scenes, amazing monsters, gods, creatures and beautiful women.<br/><br/>Overall I was satisfied with the acting and dialog. Sam Worthington is a good actor and really made his character engaging and fun to watch and I felt he really fit the role well. The dialog was also on par. None of it was cringe inducing which is very common in most Hollywood block busters. Even Avatar, which is also a great fantasy, had some pretty cringe inducing lines in it.<br/><br/>The plot was straight to the point. I was a little disappointed that they didn't use the original plot twist of Perseus being prophesied about killing his mothers father, the king, and the king killing both daughter and son to try to prevent the prophecy, inadvertently making the prophecy come true. But I suppose they changed it to streamline the plot for a two hour action movie. What they replaced it with was sufficient, I didn't feel too 'cheated'.<br/><br/>Now the monsters and creatures are what I came to the movie to see and they did not let down! Zeus is amazing looking in his sparkling armor :), Pegasus was beautiful and I can only wish I could ride it, Olympus is magical and I will dream about hanging out there with the rest of the gods and the Kraken is ungodly HUGE and just awesome. I only wish the fight scene was a bit longer with him cause he was just soo imposing I'd like to see more. My favorite creatures has to be the charred wood un-human desert Gin people. They were just cool looking and I would like to meet one :) (that was fantasy is all about right? to fantasize?) <br/><br/>I saw the movie in 3d and overall I didn't think it added that much to the movie. It actually would of been better in 2d as I could see the detail of the CGI better. But, I'll rent this movie on DVD to catch more of that later. So save yourself the $5 and watch it in 2d.<br/><br/>If you are a fantasy fan this movie is a definite see. I went with a group of friends and they all agreed the movie was great too. So I wouldn't listen to the stupid critics. Go watch it!"
"changmoh","5","43","103","28 March 2010"," A Mythical Monster Show
","Sitting through this movie, I get the feeling that the main reason for Louis Leterrier and company to do this remake of the 1981 ""Clash Of The Titans"" is just to flex its special effects muscle for 3D fans. It's a sort of Mythical Monsters Show. There is no attempt to improve the stories of the Olympian gods, or its characters.<br/><br/>And yes, they paid tribute to stop-motion wizard Ray Harryhausen by inserting his mechanical owl in a scene when Perseus and his warriors are preparing to set out to do battle with the monsters. The 1981effort was Harryhausen's last movie.<br/><br/>The film is basically the story of demi-god Perseus (played by Avatar's Sam Worthington), the bastard son of Zeus (Liam Neeson). It is Perseus' destiny to rescue the city of Argos from the vengeful wrath of Hades (Ralph Fiennes), god of the underworld, and his monster Kraken.<br/><br/>Teaming up with a small squad lead by Draco (Mads Mikkelsen), Perseus must giant scorpions, a hideous king turned slayer (Jason Flemyng as Acrisius), the snake-haired Medusa and finally the dreadful Kraken. Also on his side are his guardian angel Io (Gemma Aterthon) and the flying horse Pegasus.<br/><br/>As far as remakes go, this one seems content to just lay out the plot which is familiar to those who know the legend. The action on the screen may be in 3D (in selected cinemas) but the characters are mostly two-dimensional.<br/><br/>This is especially so of the council of Olympian gods which turned out looking like folks dressed in Halloween costumes mouthing lame lines. Even Neeson looks and sounds fake as the king of the gods.<br/><br/>The human warriors fare a little better - with the main theme being Perseus' insistence on being a man rather than the son of Zeus. The Mythical Monster Show, however, has its moments of grandeur and photorealism - and it recalls actions from films like ""Avatar"" ""Star Wars"" and ""One Million Years BC"". I remember feeling more involved in battle scenes from Harryhausen's ""Jason And The Argonauts"" than in this one. This Clash looks like it's going to be a Flash in the Box-Office Pan. - By LIM CHANG MOH (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)"

Now, as to the movie, I really don't understand what all these armchair critics were expecting, it is easy to become jaded and cynical in a world of CGI, but having seen more films that I care to admit I will gently point out this film is technically perfect, maintains pace, is well-acted and generally delivers well on its promise of a near-spectacle, the likes of which we have not seen since the 1950s. If you were expecting Star Wars XXV or another Matrix, tough. This film will be entertaining your grandchildren long after your criticisms have, like the Kraken, turned to dust."

"paxtondanny","1","8","14","2 April 2010"," TERRIBLE MOVIE whether seen in 3D or 2D
","First off, I love the original movie, so I was very excited to see this remake, especially since I enjoy a lot of action movies. I saw this new ""Clash of the Titans"" with a friend in 3D, and it was a horrible experience. The 3D is complete crap, and you can tell it was added just to make more money off people. Unlike the awesome and natural 3D of Avatar, this 3D was hurting my eyes and gave me a headache. But I thought it might be better in 2D, so I went with my dad and brother (who also love the original) and saw it again in 2D. I still thought it was a really bad movie. I love action movies, but this is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Quite honestly, I don't think ANYONE above the age of 12 or 13 will enjoy this movie. The acting is atrocious. Really bad cinematography. Horrible writing. And the worst directing. As we were leaving the theater, some guy said to his buddies, ""Well, that was a waste of money. The trailer is the whole movie."" And he was absolutely right, because the best sequences were already shown in the trailer. Also, when you see the creatures, its so obvious that its all CGI, and that the actors are just looking at a green screen. Don't waste your hard earned money on this crap. Honestly, I would have rather paid to see Avatar again than watch this God-awful remake of ""Clash of the Titans."""
"craig1138","2","17","36","31 March 2010"," Greek tragedy, Epic fail, the only myth here is why it was green lit.
","I loved the 1981 original. I remember watching it as a kid; we had that and Jason and the Argonauts taped from the TV. I've seen it since as an adult, and know that it isn't a masterpiece, but I'd still recommend it over this new thoughtless, boring action by numbers remake.<br/><br/>The plot's dealt with and put aside in the first 20 minutes or so, with minimal time spent on characters or motives etc. We're offered some flimsy sudo-existential man v religion rubbish embodied by Perseus and his almost homophobic fear of not being a MAN! (GRRRR!) Which practically becomes his catchphrase. Almost every time he opens his mouth the words ""I'm just a man"" or ""I'll do this as a man"". OK; we get, you've got some father issues. Stop scowling, and show us some personality... <br/><br/>Even a ridiculously impromptu romance with the monotone Io (A heavily sedated Gemma Arteton) fails to bring another dimension out of Worthington.<br/><br/>This goes for all the characters in the movie. None of them are at all fleshed out or developed. With Mads Mikkelsen's Draco particularly underwritten. The result is a cast of stock-fodder that you know's going to die, and you don't really care how, who, or when it happens. And then there's the damn tree man and his people?! Or Chew-bark-a as I like to call him >dies<, Leterrier's Tesco value Wookies. They were rubbish, totally pointless; looked awful, and unintentionally hilarious every time they ""spoke"".<br/><br/>Much has been said about Liam Neeson as Zeus too, but he looked uncomfortable and a bit embarrassed in a lot of scenes to me. Ralph Fiennes hams things up as the Lord of the Underworld Hades but doesn't resemble a true antagonist until the final act.<br/><br/>Once established the film moves at break neck pace from set piece to set piece, aided by the incessant music that comes to life any time anything happens on screen. And I do mean anything! A horribly forced ""teach you how to sword fight"" scene is made to feel like the final showdown. Sounding like some kind of orchestral-metal; it's that typical Hans Zimmer-esquire ""chugging"" sound that accompanies 90% of all Hollywood action scenes, and is quintessentially douche! What happened to action scenes without music? They're always so much more gripping and atmospheric.<br/><br/>The Medusa scene sums up the whole film for me. In the original it was a dark tense sequence; tension slowly built up with subtle use of sound and shadow. It genuinely freaked me out as a child. Leterrier's vision wastes no time getting into things. Her lair is bigger, louder and more perilous and looses any sense of atmosphere as a result.<br/><br/>The special effects are indeed impressive (although the 3D is an underwhelming after thought), but covering a piece of rancid steak in a gourmet sauce isn't going to make any more palatable. But given that you don't care about any of the characters, the action scenes end up being impressive but ultimately devoid of any real tension.<br/><br/>To it's credit it doesn't get bogged down in cheesy quips, or comic relief like many summer blockbusters feel the need to, but on the whole it's pretty dismal.<br/><br/>If you enjoy mindless (if uninspiring) action or burley men with big swords; this is for you."

","I was expecting this to be horrible after reading the flogging this film got in the reviews, actually it was done very well. Director Louis Leterrier did as well as he could for 2008's The Incredible Hulk and of course the original Transporter film, I do not know if this film puts him in the same league as Peter Jackson and James Cameron. He did however do a good job.<br/><br/>The whole look of this film is very good - The landscapes are believable and the characters are as good as any of the gods from the Xena/Hercules franchise (Which I loved, by the way, especially Ares). The CGI blends in with the practical elements very well, and I think my favourite image is the Djinn and his little blue flame. Leterrier clearly steals some of Guillermo del Toro's disturbing imagery with his Stygian Witches - And a few other Del Toro-isms appear, placed in perfect places.<br/><br/>Of course I watched this due to Sam Worthington, who is the new Orlando Bloom of the 2010's - Just as Orlando Bloom was the action star of the 2000's. These guys give the film industry great new blood, I love these guys. Basically, James Cameron made this guy a superstar, but he is just a great stock actor- I love his little slips into Australian Accent now and then.<br/><br/>This film is a feast of great actors, a lot of them just doing cameos - Mads Mikkelsen leads the support cast along with Pete Postelhwaite (Perseus' Fosterfather), Lliam Neeson (Zeus), and Ray Fiennes (Lord Voldemort of Harry Potter) as Hades and that a great casting job. In the background we see Danny Houston and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine's Dr. Bashir, Siddig Al-Fadeel (as Alexander Siddig). Alexa Davalos is Andromeda and probably the most beautiful actress to date, Gemma Arterton as Io.<br/><br/>This film is basically the story of Perseus lopping off the head of Medusa, a story that has been told and retold in books and films since forever, so that cannot be a spoiler as we all know the story - but unlike Harry Hamlin - Worthington shuns the help of Zeus at every turn.<br/><br/>The Kraken in this film is probably my favourite creature of the film,not a but like the great Ray Harrihousen depicted it, and not like the beast from Pirates of the Caribbean, almost a cross between the two.<br/><br/>I also like the Punk Rock look of Medusa, she can turn me into stone any day, I think the idea of making love to a woman with a snake-hairdo was probably sexy to the men who originally thought up the Medusa story, this treatment of Medusa is very sexy, the upper half at least. And casting Natalia Vodianova was a stroke, she was not monstrous unless she was looking at someone.<br/><br/>The standout performance of this film of course is Jason Flemyng as Calibos, I did not recognise Flemyng at all underneath all that hair and stuff.<br/><br/>I've watched this about seven times so far, and I've enjoyed it each time. It is done rather well, but probably not as a 3-D film, it was made and released very rapidly when Avatar was released, so it was not really filmed to be a 3-D film was Avatar was filmed specifically on 3-D cameras. It does well however on a regular flat screen, that's how it should have been released- It is probably more effective in 2-D anyway - But as I have never seen this in 3D, I don't know.<br/><br/>I always like to enjoy movies for what they are, not for what the shameless publicity hype said they were."

The plotting is brisk and action-packed, eye-roll dialogue is kept minimal, and, it's good, stupid fun watching Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes partake in the time-honored tradition of great British actors slumming it for blockbusters.

","Perhaps the worst thing any of us movie lovers can surrender to is blind trust in film critics. I have always wondered from what dark tank in hell do these (mostly men, for some bizarre reason) so called critics emerge? Very few that I have read appear to have ever set foot on a set much less partaken of one shoot in the production process, for they often irresponsibly toss off extraordinary efforts and artistic triumphs with great expense in blood, sweat, tears and resources as one would pick out an overdone piece of popcorn and toss it.<br/><br/>Thus, having read several critics on the new milling of Clash of the Titans and remembering quite well the awful Second Avenue-second hand budget of the 1981 rendition with its stop motion animated puppets, I dragged myself to the theaterwith it in mind that I would once again have to hear Liam Neeson shout, ""Release the Kraken,"" after wincing from a dozen or so trailers that followed my favorite news programs on TV.<br/><br/>What I experienced was stunning production values crowned by brilliant Homeric design and art work even to the minutest detail in both sets and costume. There was so much detail that even some of the men's hairstyles were impressive (Sam Worthington – Perseus' - ""do"" notwithstanding). In this marvelous production was one instance where I expected nothing and got everything. The very fine cast is icing on the cake.<br/><br/>As an old fan of Greek mythology I found myself highly rewarded. However, while the script simply nods at the original tales of Perseus and Andromeda there is so much good action here in a strong plot, and done so stylishly that one quickly leaves the original mythology in the vest pocket, perhaps where it really belongs."
"PeterGriffinLives","9","9","17","4 April 2010"," Contains Some Significant Changes, But Overall a Respectful Retelling
","I watched the original Harryhausen film when I was quite young, and it remains one of my favorite movies. As a result, I had mixed feelings before the remake's release: anticipation mixed with worry about what might go wrong. As luck would have it, my fears were mostly unfounded.<br/><br/>Now you must understand that at their hearts, both the old and the new Clash of the Titans films are visual showpieces; the story of the film, while not insignificant, is mainly there to facilitate the action scenes, and there's nothing wrong with that. Both films also play fast and loose with Greek mythology, adding in new creatures, for instance (the Kraken has never had anything to do with Greek mythology). So long as you understand and accept this, the films are very enjoyable rides.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington takes the role of Perseus, son of Zeus and a mortal queen, rescued from the sea after his mother's husband, King Acrisius, tried to drown him (some people just can't handle their wife bearing a demigod). When Perseus is a young man, he suffers the loss of his adopted family during a fight between some soldiers from the city-state of Argos and the god Hades. Picked up by the surviving Argosians, he ends up in the city-state proper, where Hades shows up to deliver an ultimatum: as punishment for Argos's rebellion against the gods, the princess Andromeda must be sacrificed, or the ancient, terrible Kraken will be unleashed to destroy the city. Perseus wants vengeance on Hades for what happened to his family, and as such joins the mission to save Argos, hoping that it will bring him closer to his own goal.<br/><br/>Your mileage may vary on Worthington, but I thought he did well, at least as well as Harry Hamlin in the original. Liam Neeson steps into Laurence Olivier's shoes as Zeus, and while he doesn't quite get across the divine wisdom Olivier did, Neeson does an impressive job of portraying both the majesty and the power of the king of the gods. While he seeks to punish mankind for their rebellion, he has a soft spot for his son, and subtly aids Perseus on his quest, perhaps even hoping that he won't have to destroy Argos. Jason Flemyng plays Acrisius, Perseus's mortal father, cursed by Zeus for trying to kill his son and transformed into the monstrous Calibos. The character is bitter and resentful of what has happened to him, but Flemyng manages to make him a little sympathetic as well, though still clearly a bad guy. Credit should also go to the actors playing the Argosian soldiers who accompany Perseus on his quest; though I sadly can't name these performers, they do well at bringing some lightness and humor to the journey.<br/><br/>The action scenes, the movie's main draw, are very, very fun. Director Louis Leterrier takes full advantage of the capabilities of CGI, staging elaborately choreographed battles with the film's monsters, including the giant scorpions, Medusa and the Kraken itself. I doubt you can top Harryhausen, but I think the remake does right by the original. I saw this in 2D, so I'm not sure what difference 3D would make. That said, if you can't see it in 3D, don't worry about it, as I felt the movie worked just fine even when ""flat"".<br/><br/>Now the film isn't perfect, and feels a bit too grim and serious during the first act. Luckily, by the time the quest to see the Stygian Witches begins, Leterrier finds his footing and gets comfortable with the story he's telling us, and the movie becomes WAY more fun.<br/><br/>There are changes made to the story, including Hades being the villain instead of Thetis (a bit sad to see him get stuck as the bad guy once again, but at least he makes an impressive villain here). Also, Perseus is not paired up with Andromeda as per the myth (and the original film), and instead ends up with another mythological character, Io. It's a major change, but it's understandable given that Perseus and Andromeda have all of one scene together in the remake, so pairing them up would feel rather odd within the context of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, while Clash of the Titans has some flaws, it nonetheless remains what the original was: an impressive visual spectacle, with the story acting as a framework for the creatures, exotic landscapes and battles. If you know this going in, it should make for a fun day at the movies."

","Clash of the Titans is one of the few remakes (especially of movies out of the 80's) which is better than the original, in my opinion. It succeeds in taking the story and do something different with it.<br/><br/>All the changes made are interesting, never forced and form a coherent film. (for example the characters of Calibos and Acrisius are now the same person, which helps the story to feel more focused)<br/><br/>The cinematography is great, beautiful landscapes and even dark, or intimate scenes look very good, and the color palette is very earthy, which fits the dusty environment. <br/><br/>If you know Louis Letteier, you know that the action's always very well done, it has all the trademarks you don't wanna have in a modern action film (many close-ups, fast editing, etc.) but Letterier is one of the few directors who know what they are doing and how to use these techniques effectively.<br/><br/>The special effects have aged fairly well, and were pretty good at the time this movie came to the cinema. One complain, from fans of the original, was that the creatures are now made with CGI, even though the original movie had the great effect wizardry of Ray Harryhausen, which is sad, but i always felt like it was very much hommaged in the animation of this movie. Harryhausen's stop-motion-creatures where great because they felt alive, (for example in The Valley of Gwangi is a great shot, where the monster scratches it's nose when it first comes into frame...), this movie does similar things, the creatures feel very alive and have much character.<br/><br/>The actors also do a great job, Sam Worthington is believable as leading man, and his character arc makes him a much more interesting character, than the shining hero we would expect. Liam Neeson as Zeus is a (literal) match made in heaven, and Ralph Fiennes shows, once again, why he is good in playing fantasy villains. <br/><br/>One aspect of this movie which i very much liked since i first saw it, is that even the background soldiers have distinct characters and are very likable, so that you feel for them when thy get killed, in many films, you don't even wink when one of the side characters die. Especially Mads Mikkelsen as the leader of the group is great.<br/><br/>Not to mention the incredible soundtrack from Ramin Djawadi, that hits all the right notes, it's amazing.<br/><br/>I think Clash of the Titans is one of the best straight-forward fantasy adventure films apart from the gigantic Lord of the Rings-Trilogy..."

","Disney has a much more accurate movie than these people. There is so much wrong with this movie: 1. The opening credits dictate that the Kraken killed the Titans....really?....a water creature from Norse mythology, not Greek, why they bothered with it at all....destroyed the Titans of Earth, Water, Fire and Air.....how does that work? These people obviously never read Greek mythology. 2. Hades is the villain: wow, what a big surprise, and let's get Ralph Fienes to not act, let's have him talk like he smoked 80,000 cigarettes. 3. The original had a more convincing villain and a surprising villain, watch it. 4. The original was a love story, this one is just a dumb revenge tail, because certainly people don't want human characters, they want mindless action and characters who have no plot or purpose. 5. The people in the desert are called gyn, Arabic for genie. Why is Arabic mythology in here now? Perseus should have wished to get out of the movie. 6. Why does the Kraken take the whole movie to appear when in the original, he appeared in less than 5 minutes...twice...? 7. Why is Medusa played by a supermodel in this, when in Greek mythology, remember that?, she was cursed with ugliness? 8. Did anyone else notice that the middle eastern guy blew himself up? Think about it, won't you? 9. Sam Worthington can't act. 10. No one in this film can act. 11. There is an alternate ending where Perseus destroys all the statues on Mt. Olympus. Wow, our main character just killed every living person in the world, because that's what heroes do, right? What a dick. 12. What purpose does Andromeda have in the story at all, and frankly why is she in the sequel? 13. Worst possible 3D ever invented. Let's waste money like hacks like George Lucas and James Cameron. I had a science fair project back in high school that had more convincing 3D. 14. The original is still 10 times better than this thing that dares call itself a motion picture. 15. They said that the Kraken is a piece of Hades....how does Hades the ruler of darkness and the underworld create a water monster with his skin? 16. According to real mythology, why does Hades always hate being in the underworld? He's got all the word's riches, Persephone, and all the souls he wants....why does he always hate his job?<br/><br/>Ray Harryhousen does better special effects than most people do nowadays. That's how far our technology has gone, we have actually downgraded technology to the point where a flying Mary Poppins is more convincing than a giant Godzilla monster reject."

","If Clash Of The Titans has to be summed up in just one word, that would be WEAK. WEAK acting and fake RP is something that one could probably forgive to a film coming out of the US where everybody makes movies, and it's only important that the film is ""popcornable"" and doesn't require a lot of thinking and understanding. WEAK storyline can be forgiven as well, provided that the Greek mythology has already been overused in film. But when those come combined, forgiveness is something not quite easy to give.<br/><br/>This film has WEAKness that I just can't but forgive. It's obviously made by people that have no clue of Greek mythology whatsoever and all those little factual mistakes make it rather cheesy and too shallow for a serious film experience. It wouldn't have hurt if they actually made a brief research on Greece and the world of Antiquity before jumping into making a film about it. Antiquity seems so Americanized, that every person with intelligence over the average would feel insulted if expected to trust this joke of a storytelling. Everything is just as ridiculous as soldiers wearing Roman helmets in a time when they weren't even invented yet, or as fake-tanned actors that supposedly look more Mediterranean because of the fake tan... You can see those in the film.<br/><br/>The film does not impress with a good story. The dialogue screams FAKE, the acting is amateur, so are the effects. The biggest disappointment is Ralph Fiennes, whose acting has never been so unimpressive, but it's probably due to the horrible script he had to work with.<br/><br/>I wouldn't advice paying to see this, it's just not worth it."

The main thing I noticed, is the role of Calibos seems to have diminished somewhat, together with the whole riddle & burn thing. This in itself did not detract too much but its just one thing in a long list.<br/><br/>The Medusa sequence, the ""prize fight"" if you will, has become a bit of a Tom & Jerry slapstick moment. Medusa nips around like a hamster in a cage, playing peek-a-boo, failing to bring any sense of dread with her.<br/><br/>The Kraken, which had every chance to thrill, given CGI's advantage over stop-motion, was pretty run of the mill. We've seen all this before over the past decade - nothing new brought to the table here.<br/><br/>However, it's the woefully stale performances, character development and screenplay which, for me, drag the film down above all else. Perseus is regularly upstaged by all those around him, making each rushed scene a bit of a free-for-all.<br/><br/>Having recently seen the original after many years away, I was disappointed that it hadn't aged better but after seeing the remake, that's not such a big deal."

","Given that the film is based on Greek myth which have been passed through time for centuries and that the groundwork had already been laid with the epic original 1981 version – how can you go wrong if you throw in some big name actors and give it a polish with the latest CGI? <br/><br/>Apparently you can...!<br/><br/>Given that the story and plot have already been set this version is a burp to its predecessor and an insult to its heritage.<br/><br/>The movie from start to finish is one action scene slapped to the next as if it is in some kind of hurry to reach the (anticlimatic) ending. The sparse 'bits' in between often used for story / character development are wasted with fruitless dialogue and poor acting – Perseus the Greek Demigod – apparently was a low rent Australian!<br/><br/>In addition, the 1981 version wasn't up to speed so this version chooses to 'freshen up' by introducing random characters, ideas and sub-plots which add no value to the story (lets make Pegasus black – or rather than kill Hades demons, lets domestic them and make them our donkeys instead!!)<br/><br/>I appreciate that an action movie requires 'action' to work but the urgency of this movie to cram as much action into the ninety minutes as possible creates a frenetic mess leaving its audience disorientated as to what has happened or care as to what is happening, which mixed in with the revised plot and poor acting leaves you with an empty soulless shell of a movie.<br/><br/>Apart from the awesome effects used to create Pegasus which deserve credit I don't think Harry Hamlin has anything to worry about!<br/><br/>P.S – why is it that all 'monsters' created for the big screen now look the same?

A conversation was held about this, should the remake stick line for line and frame for frame with the original? Should the remake contain the core elements only from the original while taking out massive parts and replacing them with the ""fast /furious"" school of thought material? Making moments in a movie like Clash 2010 seem like a modern feel to it.I'm still confused , but decided that I liked Clash 2010. Even though they eliminated the main purpose for Persus' involvement completely. In the original he had to kill the Kraken, and therefor had to kill Medusa as well in order to save the girl. There is no romantic reason in the remake, it just changed to a revenge story.Like I said, sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't."

","New sandals, old hat, Clash of the Titans is an enjoyable remake, but the original only made in 1981 doesn't seem that long ago. <br/><br/>The 2010 version strength is that you don't see sandals, Gods and monster adventure films much these days(unless they are made for TV). However, you cant help but think why remake Clash of the Titans when Jason and the Argonauts would have been more advantageous. <br/><br/>Sadly the score is pretty forgettable but the effects are great, minus a disappointing CGI Medusa. The old world feel is captured perfectly credit to director of photography Peter Menzies Jr. the locations are breathtaking, Sam Worthington is a reliable as the an action hero but his character is underdeveloped. There are some great performances by Mads Mikkelsen and heavy weights Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. The rest are a mixed bag, yet Gemma Arterton is startling first-class as to is the almost unrecognisable Jason Flemyng as Calibos. However, if you've seen the original, Calibos like Perseus lacks characterisation. <br/><br/>Apart from a few tweaks, director Louis Leterrier's version retreads the first. While it exceeds it predecessor in some parts, thankfully there's no owl, it includes the Sheikh Sulieman; Lo; scorpions; Pegaus and flying monsters; in places it fall short of the original -The Medusa scene;the training of Perseus and Calibos role.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's a fun adventure film and I'd happily watch an inevitable sequel."

In fact, I couldn't make it all the way without fast forwarding through some of the duller sections. It has the dubious distinction of being the only one star movie that I actually took the time to review here.<br/><br/>How is this a failure? Let me count the ways. For starters, it was totally miscast. Greek demigod Perseus looks and talks like an Aussie rugby player with a 2010 haircut? Zeus wearing northern European knight's armor from the Middle Ages? Who approved these decisions??!!! There wasn't a single memorable character. The original had Harry Hamlin who looked to be the very personification of Perseus, and the great Burgess Meredith to lend weight to the movie and a generally excellent cast.<br/><br/>Then you have several key scenes out of sequence, or cut altogether such as the awesome early appearance of the Kraken from the original! Since this film HAS nothing else, they should have had the Kraken on-screen as often as possible. I give honorable mention for the creepiness of the Medusa scene, but it is cheapened by Medusa groaning like a frustrated cheerleader when she misses a shot with her bow and general bad editing. Wow. The Kraken itself was impressive enough and provided the most exciting moment in the film when he was seen rapidly swimming toward Argos, then surfacing like an emerging volcano. But you have to wait (or fast forward) through this entire dog to see that scene. So much wasted potential. Just think what could be done with this story in the right hands using CGI tech....<br/><br/>I've said it many times to the point of sounding like a broken record, but CGI more often than not ruins modern movies in my opinion, especially remakes of old classics.

The action sequences jumped from one to the other with no real storyline to support them, and to my true disappointment, the makers of this movie seemed to feel that they knew how to tell a story better then the Ancient Greeks. After all what do the Greeks know really? So what is Warner Brother's solution? Take the time honored myths, rewrite them but keep the same characters, add a few more for flare and voilà! a masterpiece of inaccuracies and inconsistency. On the plus side, they threw in some hi-tech graphics to make up for the fact that their version of classical myth and an 80's cult, is really lacking and then managed to fall short on great graphics. The best part of this movie can be seen in the previews, no need to waist time and money to see the rest. I am deeply saddened for anyone who sees this movie with no knowledge of Greek Mythology, for you are going to be shown a story that strays so far from that path, that those of us who do know the stories are just about sickened by this film.

","""Clash of the Titans"" is an unusual film to remake for a modern audience. I mean, how familiar is Joe Moviegoer with the 1981 original or Greek mythology on the whole? The answer is 'Not very,' and the producers know it. They've taken broad steps to protect poor Joe from the alienating Grecian polytheism and comfort him with an immediately recognizable protagonist. To the layman, and in effect, for the layman, they've dumbed it down.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington is Perseus, which I guess is a big deal now that he's the star of the highest-grossing film of all time. And when you hire Sam Worthington, you get Sam Worthington. The '81 Perseus is aloof, oddly lackadaisical, with shoulder-length hair and a caring, inquisitive disposition. Worthington's Perseus is a buzzcut graduate of the Christian Bale/Batman school of acting. His dialogue is gruff, brief, and introverted, because coolness now is apparently inversely proportional to vocabulary and elocution. It speaks to a certain extent about the types of characters we hold up as heroes in our current social climate, but more so, it's a simple example of commercial viability over storytelling practicality. Worthington as Perseus is a carefully calculated business move, and the streamlining of his character is indicative of director Louis Leterrier's greater neutering of the myth for 13-year- old boys. After all, if there's one thing less cool than masculine eloquence, it's ancient culture.<br/><br/>Damn the gods indeed. 2010's ""Titans"" retells Perseus' story through a decidedly Christian lens. Mount Olympus has been downsized, and Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Hades (Ralph Fiennes) essentially become surrogates for God and the devil. Most of the roles fulfilled by other gods in the original film have been reassigned to these two to keep things simple, which would be fine if they were interesting characters. Instead, a hunchbacked Fiennes rasps ominously at his brother, and Neeson sucks all ambiguity out of the king of the gods. It's worth noting that the original is far from a masterpiece, but the insecurities and petty vengeances of Zeus and his kin are among the more entertaining ideas it puts forth. The remake drops most of these characters and fits Zeus with a stoic (re: boring) gravitas, and a ridiculous set of digitally glistening armor.<br/><br/>And I can complain until I'm blue in the face about the intellectual inadequacies of ""Clash of the Titans,"" but it's surface level mistakes like bad costumes and poor action choreography that really kills the film. The '81 version is defined by its special effects and set-pieces, and the best we can do in 2010 is CG monsters and post-production 3D? The remake is everything an effects-heavy film shouldn't be: sweeping and grandiose at the expense of intimacy. I don't care how many scorpions you render or how big you've made the Kraken when I don't even understand the decisions your protagonist is making.<br/><br/>But it's not like the remake ruins a classic or anything. The original has its share of problems, and one of the things the 2010 film does right is to kick the pacing in the pants where it needs to, leaving fewer sedentary dry spells than its predecessor. Regardless, I still hold the '81 version in higher regard because of its faithfulness in depicting the pantheon of the Grecian gods, and the charm and personality of its effects. The mythology is all ""Clash of the Titans"" circa 2010 has to distinguish itself by, and it downplays that difference instead of embracing it. Splash bland action and unimpressive effects on that cinematic identity crisis, and even Joe Moviegoer will agree you've failed."

This is a new imagination of the timeless mythology of the world of gods, monsters and men. No stop-action animation and obvious miniatures this time. <br/><br/>Perseus begins his life simply enough as the son of a fisherman. But life soon takes a cruel turn when the only family he knows is taken from him by the gods they serve. Soon he is presented with an opportunity to get justice by a chance of birth, his own. He is told he is the son of Zeus. But Perseus takes no pleasure in this information, he spurns it. He even turns down an offer from Zeus himself to be given sanctuary and end his quest of revenge. Ultimately he embraces being a demi-god to strike a blow at the gods that no mortal man ever could. <br/><br/>In this adaptation Perseus is not motivated to battle medusa or the kraken to save the damsel in distress, Andromeda. No, he is on a mission of revenge. This is what I liked most that gives this contemporary Perseus an edgier demeanor. He is of the mindset that if Andromeda or anyone else happens to benefits from his conquests cool, but that is not his goal. He is a man with a single focus and determination, destroy Hades.<br/><br/>Continually catching my attention in this movie were the locations. There were views from mountain tops overlooking a sea of clouds, barren inactive volcanoes to jutting cliff sides, visually stunning. <br/><br/>The story line is predictable, so what is there to like? The fight scenes! He and his companions battle witches, gigantic scorpions, a deformed king, medusa and finally the kraken. With the new digital technology you believed they were fighting those scorpions.

You fall in love with the princess, you feel sorry for the beast and then hate him, you get involved in the quest and actually see the character evolution.<br/><br/>In this movie you see lot's of things that make no sense at all, you can't feel evolved in the storyline, there is absolutely no emotion in any of the characters.<br/><br/>The story feels like cuts from the original glued together with better FX. Don't espected 1/10 of the original because you wont get it. When you watch the original you see bad FX, but such a envolving story that you will believe in the magic of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't have magic at all. It's boring and i fall asleep in the middle of the final battle, had to see the rest of the movie in the morning....<br/><br/>The movie should be released with other name than the original."
"carvercape","1","4","6","9 July 2010"," Epic disaster
","This movie is disaster of epic proportions, right from beginning all the way to the end. Acting is awful, screenplay is horrid, editing and directing is as director wanted to make 5 minute movie but was forced to extend them to 1hr and plus. Maybe if it lasted only 5min it would be better. So many scenes seem out of place. Soundtrack is dull and uninspired. CGI effects even those seem cheap in comparison to 1981 version. Such a great story with such a potential for great blockbuster and wasted for no good reason. If Zeus was for real he would fry entire movie crew with lightning.<br/><br/>How movie got even 6 stars is beyond me.<br/><br/>Compared to original from 1981, well the old one is far better movie.<br/><br/>I just saw they are planing another failure for 2012 Clash of Titans 2. Please do not film yet another disaster."
"Japixie7","2","4","6","9 April 2010"," where are all the good mythology stories?
","first of all, Perseus never went on all his epic quests for revenge. it was to please a king. secondly, there's only one Pegasus and he's white. and Perseus had to work to train and use Pegasus. thirdly, Perseus wasn't the bastard son of a king, but a king's daughter. fourthly, there was no Io in the story of Perseus. fifthly, Perseus stays with Andromeda because he fell in love with her and that was his prize for saving her. plus, why was it that only a small group of god's had talking parts. in the story of Perseus, he had the help of several gods and goddess in completing his quests..he wasn't alone and he didn't curse the fact he was a demi-god. i mean come on..get over it..stop being a stubborn jerk, accept it, and stop letting your friends die because your too stupid."
"julian_dax","1","4","6","5 April 2010"," Cash in of the Hollywood moguls
","As I sat watching ""Clash of the Titans"" and felt my jaw dropping alarmingly, even after the first few minutes, these were some of the questions that crossed my mind: Was there a script when they started filming? Did it really take several people to write these stupid dialogs? Did the cutter suffer from ADHS,as you can barely recognize who is doing what to whom in the tiring action sequences? Was it really necessary to transform the film into a shoddy looking 3D version? Are the likes of Liam Neeson and Joseph Fiennes really so desperate for roles? Why is Sam Worthington hailed as the new action hero, when he spends this whole sorry mess of a film showing exactly one facial expression, something between grimly annoyed and seriously angry? I think, one of the critics got it perfectly right when he wrote in his review: ""Those whom the gods wish to punish, they force to watch this movie."" I couldn't agree more!"
"snoogins_75","1","4","6","5 April 2010"," One of the worst films I have ever seen!
","I grew up watching the original Clash of the Titans (1981), and although the SFX were not that great (fine for the time the movie came out, but not by today's standards) and the story gets a little slow towards the middle, I always enjoyed watching it and still do. When I heard they were making a remake I was excited because I was looking forward to somebody improving on the SFX and the story, but this remake is no improvement. It is an hour and 46 minutes worth of horrible dialogue, sparse character development and giant scorpions. In fact, to call it a remake requires one to have never seen the original since the only thing the two have in common are the names of the characters and the locations. <br/><br/>In this version of the film Perseus hates the gods since a god killed his family, and his only reason for saving Argos (actually, defeating the Kraken, he could care less about saving the city) is revenge. In the original Perseus falls in love with Andromeda and vows to save her and the city of Joppa (Argos was destroyed at the beginning of the film, and is the city Perseus and his mother are sent from). This newer version credits King Acrisius (never mentions what city he is king of) as the creature Calibos, but the original shows us that Calibos was an actual person who was to marry Andromeda, and is deformed by Zeus for killing all but one of his flying horses, and so that Andromeda would fall in love with his son Perseus.<br/><br/>Granted, both films take liberties with the actual Greek myth of Perseus and Andromeda, but how hard is it to watch the original a few times if you are going to make a ""remake"". If the director planned on changing the entire story and character development of the original he should have called this version an ""adaptation"", at least then people might not be upset when when they walk out from seeing the latest adaptation of a film from the '80s."

","Terrible, Terrible, Terrible...The first Clash of the Titans was Cheesy but Wow..this was a mockery! I wasted 2+ hours of my existence! Waste of acting talent. Wait for DVD if you must watch. There is Zero flow to this movie. If you are expecting a movie similar to 1981 release, do not go. If you never saw the original and must see this bring a seat cushion. Possibly bring some earplugs as the theater we saw it in had the volume cranked to the highest possible level. The regular version of the movie did not have impressive special effects. Possibly the 3D version will captivate the audience? There was not one person in our Theatre that was impressed with this movie. Everyone questioned why it was so different from the original and what was the point of the movie."
"darkmax","7","7","13","1 April 2010"," Should this be compared to the original?
","I am fortunate to have survived to see both movies on their launch day. Given that I was still a young lad when the original premiered.<br/><br/>I vaguely remember being awe-struck by the myriad of creatures and monsters in the movie. I was even covering my eyes when Medusa made her monstrous appearance in the original. This was the movie that led me on my life-long ""quests"" to discover European and Middle-eastern mythologies.<br/><br/>The cast, acting and sets were state of the art then (so was the stop motion capturing of various creatures). It was a blockbuster then and was much talked about in its time.<br/><br/>Forward to April 1st, 2010.<br/><br/>This movie struck me as a run-of-the-mill, CG-laden movie based on the original. This new one has a good cast, although most of the other Greek gods have little or no dialogue at all. they were just images that stand or sat there, like holograms. they have almost no interaction with each other or the mortals.<br/><br/>CG in movies have reached an extent where it is no longer a novelty, but a must-have. Even so-called rom-com usually comes with various CGI touch-ups that we never really pay attention to. The creatures and environments created by CG, are pretty standard, even though they are well-designed.<br/><br/>Acting is good all-round. The only person I detest in the movie was that doomsayer who coax people into giving in to Hades. I found the character to be over-acted and frankly, quite very annoying.<br/><br/>However, the action sequences are well-choreographed and nicely edited. they were exciting enough to keep me from getting too comfortable with the back of my seat.<br/><br/>However, I found the final fight to be some what disappointing. I was expecting sword-fighting sequences, but most of the time was dedicated to an aerial chase and the grand entrance of the Kraken.<br/><br/>Overall, if you are looking for a Troy or Lord of the Ring, look elsewhere. This one is purely an adventure set in the Greek mythos with thin plot and story."
"MannyCastro","Null","27","69","30 March 2010"," Another Bad Remake
","You know a movie based on Greek mythology is bad when Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief is a masterpiece by comparison.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington (Avatar, Terminator Salvation) stars as Perseus, a demi-God who must defeat the kraken before it and its owner, Hades (Ralph Fiennes), God of the Underworld, takes over human civilization. And. . .that's pretty much it. Director Louis Leterrier (The Transporter, The Incredible Hulk) wasn't interested in story and character development. He just wanted to get to the next action scene. What Leterrier fails to understand is that action scenes don't work when the audience doesn't care. Perseus fights demons, beasts, and Gods in spectacular actions scenes but there's nothing to get excited about since interest is absent. And to make matters worse there's the 3D. Unlike Avatar, Alice in Wonderland, and How to Train Your Dragon, this film was converted to the format at the last minute to cash in on the fad - and it shows. It has the worst 3D in recent memory. It's sad when Journey to the Center of the Earth with Brendan Fraser was a better 3D experience.<br/><br/>So, if you haven't, just watch How to Train Your Dragon instead or just rent the original 1981 version with Harry Hamlin. With the recent increase in 3D prices there's no reason to waste your money on this garbage."
"rkjar","6","6","11","4 April 2010"," Just Say No to Crrrrahhken
","Ah, another great movie opening yesterday: ""The Clash of the Titans"". What I mean by that is not that it was a great movie, but a great opening; I mean, what's not to like? It's a summer movie in the spring. Grab your popcorn, kick your feet up on the seat in front of you, and enjoy. Almost any movie can hold up under these favorable conditions.<br/><br/>Well, ""The Clash"" does hold up okay. Now, I'm not one to expect Oscar-worthy performances from a movie like this; but it was a bit disappointing to see Liam Neesan, Ralph Fiennes and that other guy who was recently blue in Avatar just PHONE IT IN. Liam Neesan plays Zeus. What a great role. It's like saying, ""Liam Neesan is a Jedi."" We expect great things. Or Ralph Fiennes as Hades. Hades!!! Wouldn't you expect some bluster, emotion, EVIL??? He looks bored as he hovers around in a black cloud. ""I'm Hades...(yawn)...RULER OF THE UNDERWORLD...(zzzz)."" Okay, but what's worth the popcorn? The Cracken, or as we say it with a bit of Ahhhhrish (you have to roll the ""r"" in the back of your throat - that's it) - the Crrrahhken. This is a great creature from the deep. I think it's the same Cracken that was in Pirates of the Caribbean, but it's been working out. ""Release the Crrrahhken,"" says Zeus, now a little upset that the movie took this long for him to get to his line. You can almost picture Liam Neesan saying, ""Release the Crrrahhken so I can get out of this really hot armor,"" or ""Release the Crrrahhken because Ralph Fiennes is SOOOOO boring."" Don't take this as a negative review. I mean the Stygion witches and the giant scorpion pack animals are really quite nice, and the CG version of Medusa is okay too (actually, I thought the Umma Thurman Medusa in Lightning Thief was better). And there's this dude with blue eyes who looks kind of like a mix between a tree trunk and a Transformer, with very halogen-blue eyes. This reminds me of two Hollywood producers sitting around talking about the plot, and one says, ""Hey, my cousin has this really cool alien costume that he never used in 'Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull' so how about we put that in the movie for all the kids. They love aliens, and this movie doesn't have ANY aliens! GIVE ME ALIENS!"" You'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>For those who remember the original movie, with Burgess Meredith as Perseus's ""trainer"" and the robotic owl (it actually makes a brief appearance in this remake), this movie is prettier, but just as campy as the first one. For you youngsters out there, ""campy"" means you'd rather GO camping than try to explain the plot. The plot is so dismal...ugh! But here it is in one sentence: Demigod Perseus has to show the decapitated Medusa to petrify - literally - the Crrrahhken before the princess - yes, she's very pretty, but who really cares if she dies - becomes Crrrahhken fodder.<br/><br/>Regardless of what you may think about this show, it's great summer movie stuff. So go kick your feet up and enjoy your extra butter popcorn."
"mollidew","10","7","14","10 April 2010"," Action, Adventure and mythology
","I saw the 1981 version of Clash of the Titans and really liked it. It followed the mythology closer. It was much more campy than the 2010 rendition. <br/><br/>The actors are not to blame for the script. All of the movies are adaptations whether it be from a novel or folklore. Greek mythology is a mixture of all types of creatures and gods sneaking into human's chambers to mate with them. Therefore, there are numerous children such as Perseus who may or may not know their birthright. I don't know why they decided to change the mythology and have Danae die or add Io who has nothing to do with Perseus as well as add in Hades instead of Poseidon to release the Kraken. One has to take it on its own merits and not compare the two stories. This version was done more seriously. I have seen many movies made on mythological topics and this moved and had the flavor of most all of them. It is always a character/s trying to thwart the activity of the gods and come out victoriously. Usually during this attempt there is a quest and fighting. Most stories are somewhat violent. I didn't see anything wrong with this movie on any level. It was entertaining and since I do not have a drama degree I won't judge the acting which seemed fine to me. I really like Sam Worthington and liked him in this movie as well. I did miss Bibo ( Robotic owl sent by Athena to help Perseus) but at least there was a cameo. He wouldn't have fit well into this remake so they were wise to leave him out. Besides after awhile, it got aggravating that you couldn't understand what it was saying in my opinion which was the only downside to the character.<br/><br/>One thing that was added that I thought made the movie more real was the fact he wanted to fight like a man and not be given help with things sent for him to use by Zeus. He was a little stubborn about it but it only set the mood about how he felt concerning the gods. The people had gotten very tired of them meddling in their lives. It had the same feel as the first one but I guess the writers wanted to make it slightly different to make their own mark on telling this tale. I don't see why everyone is putting down this movie. It was a typical mythological piece with an ultimate happy ending. I really liked it and the fact they tried to do something fresh instead of create a redo exactly like the first version but with fancier special effects."
"MikaHaeli8","1","5","9","4 April 2010"," How was it awful? Let me count the ways.
","Saw this today with my family, and most of us (except for my 12-year old brother, who loved it) agreed that it was...bloody awful.<br/><br/>As my title says, where do I even begin? Pushing it back to accommodate for the addition of 3D was a bad idea - it just corresponded horribly with the film. Awful acting, especially from Sam Worthington, fresh from his equally wooden turn in ""Avatar"". The plot was present, sure, but it seemed more of a sideline than the centric event. The action was also there, but not overly engaging, especially the ""Kraken vs. Perseus"" showdown at the end - not as tight as it should have been. In fact, many, many things were awful about this shoddy waste of a remake, and I'm itching to see the original to see if it's even twice as better as this. $125m? One could help Haiti a LOT with that money.<br/><br/>Worst film of 2010 so far? It wins that award."
"deepakjaiswal","1","6","12","3 April 2010"," Waste of money and time
","I went to see the 1st show on its 1st day and its really an awful movie. The trailers are really misleading as there is very little action and that too of mediocre quality. There was very little to act for good actors like Liam Neeson or Ralph Fiennes leaving too much to do for Sam Warthington. Sam seems to be good actor but in almost all his movies the CGI effects overshadowed him.<br/><br/>The movie does have good CGI effects but the story does not hold any interest. After 30 minutes or so in the movie, it felt like a B movie. The directors should put more substance than lifeless CGI. Without solid script, CGIs don't mean anything."

","I was so excited to see this movie. I'm a big fan of the original, and really wanted to see what they'd do with it, but I haven't been this disappointed in a movie since I walked out after suffering through the first half of ""Alone in the Dark"" (Tara Reid as the ""brainy"" scientist - need I say more?) I was ready to walk out of this movie after the first 30 minutes, but I stayed because I wanted to see what they'd done with the creatures. Big mistake. The fights were predictable, Medusa looked cartoonish and phony, and the story was completely butchered. ""There is no Acrisius, only Calibos?!"" Since when? Is that anything like ""There is no Dana, only Zuul?"" And what happened to the riddles, and the curse on Andromeda? Wasn't Perseus supposed to be fighting for love? And his mother didn't die - she raised him! Don't even get me started on Pegasus.<br/><br/>Look, save yourself some money, and rent the 1981 version of this movie (or buy it, it should be cheap). The story isn't perfect, but it's still truer to the legend, has more heart, and I actually dig the cheesy stop-motion animation a heck of a lot more than the overly slick CGI on this soulless piece of crud."

And it looks really, really bad (none of the 3D shapes are natural, some are just flat layers).<br/><br/>AVATAR was filmed with two cameras, and everything was rendered in two separate images to create the final, high-quality effect.

If you do stray from the storyyou better do it damn well (such as 300)or fail miserably (such as The Scarlet Letter – Demi Moore version).<br/><br/>There have been a handful of versions for the trials of Perseus, but nothing this off target. The only parts of the story that retained are the Graeae and Perseus killing Medusa. The movie came in below 2 hours with big chunks being the freshly made up stuff. So it is quite lean on storyline.<br/><br/>The action scenes are OK, but not really impressive. On top of thatthe CGI did not impress me. I found myself missing the Ray Harryhousen stop motion work in 80s version of Clash of the Titans.<br/><br/>The acting was OK, but nothing memorable or worth remembering.

"Dragonsouls","9","11","27","1 April 2010"," Intellectual, Inspiring, and passionate film-making !
","I want to review this film by comparing it to the original and as a film on it's own. As a kid, I watched the original on HBO over and over because it was the most mesmerizing thing on TV at the time. Even Star Wars didn't immerse me into the mythological world like Clash of the Titans. After seeing this re-make last night, I could honestly say that this film is going to stand the test of time and eventually become a cult classic like the original.<br/><br/>I left the theater with goosebumps and still have them as I write this review and think about the film. Now I'm not the type of casual movie fan that enjoys everything with great CGI and pretty actors like Pirates of the Caribbean, the Mummy 3, or other mindless swash-buckling adventures.<br/><br/>Clash of the Titans is not that kind of movie. I'll even go as far as saying it is superior to the original. The reason is that the producers of this film were very passionate about it and put lots of love into the making of this film. Being a lover of old mythology myself, I was really inspired by this film and was surprised to see such a smart, metaphorical, religious and inspiring movie. It never gets boring like Lord of the Rings did at times. There is always something happening to keep you on the Edge. The choreographed fight scenes were pretty good, and there was lots of wire work which was pleasing to see. At times, the movie felt like a God of War video game with a boss fight at the end of every scene! The main character really grows with each minute and you care about him in the end.<br/><br/>Now as for the acting, well, top-notch all around. What do you expect with such talent on the screen by the leads and supporting actors. Sam Worthington is no joke, he's going to be a bigger star than he already is, and on a side note; I find it odd he always plays a character that is half human. Lliam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are imposing as the Mighty brothers Zeus and Hades and look very similar in appearance. I think they really are a match made in heaven; (No pun intended) I wish they had more screen time, better yet, I wish the film was longer in general! Now the directing; excellent! Paced very well. Louis Leterrier has a new fan. He really has the promise to be the next Ridley Scott! Too bad this was a big budget B movie, and if he had more funding, this film could have been as Epic as Lord of the Rings or even the Ten Commandments and Ben Hur. It really reminded me of all those films, it reaped quality.<br/><br/>The sets were epic! A true old fashioned film in every sense. Fans of the original might find a surprise in this film in the shape of a stop-motion, metallic bird! That's all I'm going to say! Finally, the soundtrack impressed as well and featured such beautiful music! I can't remember the last time I purchased a soundtrack not made by Hans Zimmer or Danny Elfman. I am buying the soundtrack for sure.<br/><br/>Summary: 9/10 A film with great acting, directing, music, sets, CGI, plot and characters. Oh and I didn't mention the Pegasus! Wow !"
"eli-ass","2","5","10","11 April 2010"," The trailer is all you need to see ...
","After I had seen the trailer for this movie I already assumed it would not be a good one and after reading some other reviews my expectations were really low. Still ""Clash of the titans"" was disappointing on every level. I was really surprised how bad this movie was.<br/><br/>The story and how it builds up is truly a joke. Messy as hell. The ""Introduction"" is like 2 minutes long and the movie really doesn't want to take any time for story explanations or character development, no details, no depth. Many scenes seem unfinished and really raw. The dialog is lame as hell as there are lots of standard / cliché phrases thrown at your head. Sometimes it gets really cheesy as well.<br/><br/>Now even the various action scenes that are poorly put together can't create a bit of entertainment and that is where the movie finally fails. (As I mentioned I did not expect too much of a story though it was executed even worse than i thought before)But also the fight scenes are terribly boring especially the ""final battle"". The gods do not seem to participate at all. <br/><br/>Watch the trailer because as I was expecting it spoiled EVERY ""highlight"" from the movie. There is nothing more to it that you could miss and the trailer also got a cool soundtrack thats not in the actual film (at least from what i remember?). <br/><br/>If you wanna see a trashy B-movie then you might enjoy it a little bit ... otherwise skip this!

"yongtheodore","4","5","10","3 April 2010"," I felt ripped off too
","While Hollywood pours millions into dazzling special effects, why it so often fails at a more rudimentary level -- of telling stories that elicit more than juvenile emotional responses -- is beyond me. Clash of the Titans 2010 is not unlike other monstrosities pooped out of the cinematic mill in that it joins producers' and consumers' hands in two dirty hours of collective impoverishment of feeling, of imagination, and no amount of computer-generated wizardry can conceal its basic vapidity. Come on, the scorpions were idiotic! -- and so are you, Warner Brothers!<br/><br/>When you buy something you know is a sham, you might liken the seller to a thief. The commercial dishonesty that this production stinks of nudges it closer to the side of thievery: all those 3D glasses did was dim the screen to a dusky obscurity and hurt my ears.<br/><br/>The original 1981 film seemed to relish in the netherworldly grotesquery of its images. Full disclosure: I grew up on that film and remember being endlessly fascinated, and horror-stricken, by the Medusa, by all the demons of that (claymation) world, and the powerful contrast they drew with its self-consciously 'beautiful' 'beauties.'<br/><br/>Speaking of which, father Zeus's supernatural gift to Perseus of an earlier brutalized, fully revived Io as sexual reward (notwithstanding Andromeda's relegation, vis-a-vis the story arch of the 1981 version, to mere means to Perseus's vindictive ends) called feminist film critic Laura Mulvey to mind, and her essay ""Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema"" opens a whole different critique of Louis Leterrier's epic sausage fest."

"MichaelBeardsley","3","5","10","2 April 2010"," The screwed this one up big time!
","This movie it terrible! Yes, the effects are better then those in the original film, but that is the ONLY thing that is better. And I thought some of the effects were still pretty bad (particularly some of the stuff with the scorpions). The original story, the one in the original movie I mean, was very good it was dated but rather then just updating it, they changed almost everything. Sam Worthington really didn't seem right as Perseus he seemed more like a Marine who somehow wound up in ancient times. And I hated that Perseus knew he was the son of Zeus all along like he was the freakin' chosen one or something. And enough with the reluctant whinny hero. I liked it better when he was just a common guy (as far as he knew) who had to become extraordinary to save the woman he loved. The Gods are boring, and their shinny armor looks cheesy. I thought the Medusa part was actually pretty cool, but that was about all I liked. I didn't like that they took Calibos who, in the original film was the son of a lesser god who felt wronged by Perseus because he was once Andromeda's suitor, and they made him a two dimensional creature that just wants vengeance. And what is the deal with Hades giving him powers? Lame. Perhaps the lamest addition were the glowing blue-eyed desert dwellers. Io was a stupid character. I did like the cameo by Bubo, the owl. Don't be fooled by the preview, which makes it look pretty good... don't wast your money on this one."

","The director and screenwriters completely butchered this remake. Bubo the owl was an intricate character from the original. Cutting him out is like leaving R2-D2 out of Star Wars. I don't know what these guys were smoking when they made this movie, but they need to find a new dealer. Perseus is given a sword and shield by Zeus and Athena. He wasn't supposed to ""find"" a sword in the middle of a forest, or make a shield out of scorpion hide. I'm still trying to figure out the djinn came about. The Greeks didn't believe in genies. And why didn't they touch on the Perseus and Andromeda love plot at all. That is the reason he wanted to kill the kracken in the first place. Instead, they replaced her, bubo, and Athena with some undying,all knowing woman. She did a good job on the part, but it did not belong in this story. they should have stuck to the original! If I wanted to see a warrior go on a rampage with the gods, I would've stayed home and played God of War."

","I tried to like this mess but with memories of the cult classic original I was super keen to see this remake. Aussie Sam Worthington is made for this movie, he is not the problem, it's the darkness, the noise and the stupid situations. How did the scorpions accept a rider to steer it around. No spoilers from me just one more thing, WHY WAS IT IN 3D. There was simply no need to see this in 3D as in my eyes it was not effective until the final credits. Then there was the camp factor, sure, the sparkling jacket worn by Zeus is like something Wayne Newton might wear, but the fake Greek pillars in Mount Olympus look like a set from Showgirls. Overall its nothing more than a big lightweight expensive kids film. The music was good, the battle between hero Perseus and evil Medusa was watchable and a highlight, but nothing memorable. Even the magnificent mechanical owl from the original gets dissed and flying horse Pegasus is Black! huh....This won't hurt Sam's growing career but not good."

","Why this film called ""Clash of the Titans"" even though it has nothing to do with the Titans of Greek Mythology (and the word Titans mentioned only once in the whole movie?) How much did they paid to have Neeson with a ridiculous ""disco-ball"" costume and his brutal voice as Zeus and Fiennes with his creeping face in the -supposed to be- evil role of Hades? Is Worthington an Avatar or he has already transformed to green-eye demi-God with clean face and marine hair-cut? This film is as bad as the original from Desmond Davis back in 1981 (to be honest the original looks very cheap these years and it has at least an interesting love story between Perseus and Adromeda). Here we have a group of brave and full of stupid courage men (not to mention the demon or something like that who support them) in their epic journey (they have scorpions as vehicles!) to kill snake-head Medusa and save the ancient city of Argos (and Andromeda too). The script lines (full of brave words) are laughable, the music score not even memorable, the costumes trashy, a whole movie , must to avoid. Only bright spots, Draco's figure mostly because he is more silent than the others, and a lovely performance from Pegasus"

","A severe disappointment. To be honest, I could only expect this one to be a movie with ""great visuals, but weak story,"" but I was unprepared for just how bad this movie was.<br/><br/>My first huge complaint with this movie is with Sam Worthington and the character he plays. Worthington seems to be making a point to play overly bland characters. In Avatar, he played a character who's part could have been covered by anyone--literally anyone, with the movie's CGI his role could have been filled by an ape--and Worthington didn't bring anything to the table. In Clash of the Titans, he brings less than nothing to the table. His performance is so wooden and his character is so bland, that I was more interested in Medusa, who has no lines and is only in fifteen minutes of the movie, than his character, Perseus. I couldn't get over how bland his character was; I just kept thinking to myself ""Wow. I didn't realize Perseus was so boring."" But Worthington wasn't the only bland character in this movie. Liam Neeson (Schindler's List, Star Wars I, Batman Begins) and Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List, Harry Potter 4 & 5, Red Dragon) I can usually trust to give great performances and were the main reasons I decided to give this picture a chance. To my great astonishment, not only do both actors portray boring characters, but both actors are just so bad. Liam Neeson keeps putting weird inflections into everything he says and Ralph Fiennes plays half of the movie with this annoying hoarse voice and sounding like he wants to get up a fur ball.<br/><br/>And then there's the movie's dialogue. Again, I wasn't looking for anything particularly phenomenal; just competence. The dialogue was so stilted and so bad that I was hoping that the last hour of the movie would be played in silence. It wasn't the worse dialogue I've ever heard; if it had that probably would have been fun to listen to. The dialogue was just so mediocre--as though no effort at all had been put into it--that it really gave me pain to listen to it.<br/><br/>Usually in these kinds of films, they can make up for a lot of their short comings with good action. Not in Clash of the Titans. The action scenes are thrown haphazardly together and sometimes you can't even tell what's going on because the director made the awful choice of using shaky-cam while filming the intense action sequences. I felt like I was watching Cloverfield again, but in Cloverfield you were supposed to not know exactly what was going on, but you did get enough information to know. Here, you get nothing. At one point, Perseus jumps out of a giant scorpion's back. I guess I missed how he got in there in the first place because that part utterly confused me. <br/><br/>The one scene in the movie that I really did like was the fight with Medusa. Not only was the director actually able to balance the action scenes right, but the character of Medusa was really fun to watch. Other than that, there really wasn't anything else in the movie that grasped my attention that well. A lot of the scenes were directed poorly and some of them served absolutely no purpose. And some characters are treated the same way. There are two characters who--I think--were meant to be our comedy relief. But they get hardly any screen time, leave halfway through the movie, and make one 4 second appearance toward the end of the film, but aren't mentioned after that. They did seem like some vaguely interesting characters, claiming they knew exactly how to kill such creatures as centaurs. I would have liked to get to know more about them, but they're hardly given any time on screen after that.<br/><br/>Clash of the Titans was an interesting experience with some pretty cool visuals, but the direction, acting, screenplay, and characters were so badly conceived that the film ends up leaving no impression of any kind on the audience, except, perhaps, that this was a complete waste of time.<br/><br/>3/10"

","This 'remake' of the 1981 classic ""Clash Of The Titans"" is not --I repeat: not-- the miscreant a lot of people want to see in it. On the contrary, I found it to be very well done. Apart from some at times rather cheesy dialogue, that is.<br/><br/>As with most adaptations --in this case, an adaptation of an adaptation-- one should first watch this movie before reading up on history/mythology; or indeed watch the 1981 'original'. Of course, what the 2010 release has in favour over the 1981 movie, are the state of the art special effects. In a lot of modern day movies, those effects are sadly the only thing which make the movie interesting, but not here. Here, they are fitting the story nicely, adding some much needed pomp to the circumstances. After all, we're dealing with the Gods here.<br/><br/>Speaking of Gods, Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are both up to the part they play; Zeus and Hades respectively. Although I must add that Neeson's natural grandeur is a tad lost under the wig of unruly hair they fitted on his head and a rather thinnish beard they smeared on his face.<br/><br/>Worthington is more than okay as the demi-God Perseus, while Mads Mikkelsen is very good as the rather stoic Draco. Add the charms of Gemma Arterton as Io and we've got a more than adequate cast who all perform their duties with grace and adroitness.<br/><br/>""Clash Of The Titans"", while in the same vein, may not be of the solidity of the epic movies of the fifties and sixties (Ben Hur, The Ten Commandments, etc...) but it sure makes for some excellent entertainment and as a consequence it gets a well deserved eight out of ten from yours truly.<br/><br/>JJ"

","It was from the moment when I first heard that they were remaking the Clash of the Titans that I became very excited at the concept and anticipated it, and looked very much forward to watching it. I felt that the original film was awesome, with an amazing storyline and I loved the special effects by Ray H. It was an exciting, atmospheric and enchanting adventure and I was absolutely mesmerised by it. <br/><br/>As a matter of fact, it was the original Clash of the Titans that really got me interested in Greek Mythology, and I've enjoyed reading about Greek Mythology ever since.<br/><br/>But my faith was lost and all my hopes were utterly dashed when I went and watched this new remake in 3D. This was something that I was really looking forward to watching and was praying that being in the hands of today's directors, they would deliver it justice, and even make it even better that the original. But that did not happen. <br/><br/>For instance, I felt that the acting was wooden. There was no emotion or excitement in the characters. Sam Worthington tried to give Perseus an arrogant, hard man, bad boy image, which I felt did not work as the original character was not supposed to be like that in the original story. I really think that Sam Worthington was a very bad choice for this role and was not suited to it at all. In a movie like 300/Troy perhaps he would have been in place, but in the new Clash of the Titans (and as the lead character Perseus??) definitely not. <br/><br/>Also in 3D, there was probably only 1 3D scene.<br/><br/>The storyline and the characters were different from the original, which was to be expected to some degree, but I felt that the film just did not capture the atmosphere, personality and excitement and magic from the first movie. There was just no humility there and I felt that this film did not pay homage to the original.<br/><br/>SPOILERS ALERT: <br/><br/>In the original movie, Zeus commands the Gods to bestow Perseus, his son, with weapons of ""Divine Temper"". And when these weapons are first found and tested by Perseus, we see their true godly powers and the feeling of confusion and excitement of when Perseus first finds and tries them. For example, in the original movie, after the sword is found, you see the astonishment and surprise on Perseus's face when it suddenly cuts through solid marble. In this remake however, you see no such thing. This time, not only is the arrogant Perseus not surprised or excited/bothered that he is the son of Zeus, God of the Gods, but cares very little for the divine celestial weapon that is imparted to him by Zeus. Instead he is instantly ready to discard as a mere trinket by giving it to his colleague. <br/><br/>I was also disappointed with the scene in which Pegasus, the mythical winged horse, makes his first appearance. In the original movie you see how Perseus hears about the mythical beast and lies in wait for it and eventually captures it and earns its trust. But this did not happen this time. This time Pegasus was just ready and waiting for him as a gift from the Gods I felt that that the Director just didn't want to put in more effort to make this into, what could have been a much better scene. <br/><br/>One of the scenes that I was looking forward to most of all was the scene with Medusa. But was very disappointed when watching it as Medusa did not look hideous and evil gorgon at all, as a matter of fact she was portrayed to be quite pretty.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, I no longer have faith in remakes and no longer feel excited at the remake concept. This film had so much potential. This could have been a masterpiece and an epic (like Lord of the Rings), however instead it was an epic failure. <br/><br/>Good: Impressive Special Effects, Liam Neeson as Zeus.<br/><br/>Bad: Everything Else."
"thefinisher_23","5","3","5","27 April 2010"," Note: This film contains no Titans
","If you're going to do Greek mythology there's no need to simplify. After all it's just storytelling. Such is the problem with the mundane ""Clash of the Titans."" I never saw its' 1981 original but I wonder if it's more inspired than this. Director Louis Leterrier (""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""Transporter 2"") knows how to make a kick-ass, fast paced action flick. This is neither. Nor does it have the mythology it should. Greece should serve as a backbone for an epic tale. Instead it's used something to get from one action scene to the next.<br/><br/>The tale at hand tells of Perseus (Sam Worthington of ""Avatar"") who was discovered by his fishermen family (Pete Postalwaithe among them) adrift at sea in a tomb with his mother. The fact that the infant survived and the mother did not should tell them something. Perseus doesn't know of his origin and there's the token ""embrace your destiny!"" ""But I'm just a man!"" scenes that follow. His father is Zeus (Liam Neeson) and his mother a mortal tricked into boinking him. Thus he's a demi-God which is kind of like being Penny Hardaway as opposed to Michael Jordan. Soon Perseus is discovered by the kingdom of Argos who demand he help them. Greece, Argos in particular, have angered Zeus and Co. so much that Zeus unleashes his brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) upon them. Hades' ultimate weapon is the most underwhelming aspect of the film. The Kraken is large, impressive and fierce but its' use is so anti-climatic that you may end up thinking it was nothing more than a marketing ploy used in the trailer to make us say ""ooh fun!"" Trust me, not really.<br/><br/>The cast at hand is rather good and at times they keep the film afloat. Worthington isn't the most complex actor in the world but he makes for a likable and believable hero. He's accompanied by a battalion of Argos soldiers who must bring back the head of Medusa or their princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) will be sacrificed to the Kraken. Among them is the hardy Draco (Mads Mikkelsen; Le Chiffre of ""Casino Royale""). He's sort of a mentor on the fly to Perseus, teaching him how to properly use a sword in one of the films' best scenes. He and his outmatched but savvy and witty group of soldiers give this the fun feel it sorely needs. There's also the matter of Perseus guide Io (Gemma Arterton). She can handle herself in a fight and fits in nicely with Perseus and the others on their quest. The screenplay unfortunately changes her from a character to a plot device as the film goes on. Neeson and Fiennes are fine as they always are but we've seen far better from them. Neeson isn't on screen much as Zeus and when he is, he plays his role rather straight. Fiennes always makes for a good villain but I couldn't help but thinking ""man, he was a lot cooler as VoldeI mean 'he who must not be named'.<br/><br/>The acting isn't the reason anyone comes to a film like this. We're here for epic action scenes laden with awesome monsters, larger-than-life heroes, and some cool mythology mixed in. That's the films ultimate failure. It dispenses its mythology matter of factly instead of with intrigue and excitement. While I don't think the film muffed any of the storytelling to suit its needs, it certainly neglects most it. Where's Poseidon, Athena, Ares or any of the other Greek Gods so crucial in these stories? There's sort of a round-table of the Gods but none of it matters. They are all utterly ignored so that Zeus and Hades can bicker and plot. It's not as if ancient Greece was only about the two brothers. The mediocre and predictable plot line would be more forgivable if the action sequences still delivered. Those too are predictable. We know every battle will end and never are the fight scenes intense and stunning as they were in ""300"" and ""Troy"". The CGI effects are nice but they're nice in the way that every film looks nice nowadays. The Kraken isn't on screen long enough to make an impression. Medusa isn't nearly as terrifying as she should be. The scorpions are a nice touch. So are the things that ride them.<br/><br/>When a film is mediocre it isn't bad. ""Clash of the Titans"" isn't bad but it's disappointing in the sense that's it's never very thrilling. It certainly promised to be. This was even pushed back a week to be released in 3D. Don't waste the cash. While the 3D doesn't take away anything from a movie like this it isn't breathtaking like ""Avatar"" or even peculiar and vibrant in ""Alice in Wonderland"". The actors are good but they are good because they're good actors. Not because this lazy screenplay allows them to be. It's something of a shame. What could have been a grand semi-epic is just a paint by numbers action flick. There's never a sense that what you're watching is some mythological masterpiece. You can't say much about an average movie. You can say a lot though about a disappointing one. Unfortunately that's what this is.<br/><br/>Visit me at Celluloidlove.wordpress.com"

Famous actors act... act? There is no place for acting here and the big names are pretty much unnecessary considering the simple archetype roles. So I wonder why did they even bother to sell us the story anyway, they could have put more action sequences instead, perhaps it wouldn't be so boring. <br/><br/>But I had a laugh or two seeing the ridiculous and shameful shredding of mythology, some hilarious action scenes and the amazingly bad plot. Plus I was very glad it was over.<br/><br/>My free interpretation of a flashback: ''Zeus liked humans too much. So instead of defeating the human army that besieged mount Olympus, he deflowered the king's wife and the war was over.'' Did he make a threat that he will do the same to anyone who opposes him? God's might in all it's glory. <br/><br/>Some of you might say: ''What is he talking about?! The movie was O.K. and the effects were top notch...'' No. It wasn't. I have nothing against action movies, but they needn't be stupefying. If you like American Greek mythology watch Disney's ''Hercules''.

","Kick-Ass. The Dark Knight. Avatar. Sherlock Holmes. These multi-million Hollywood behemoths have recently proved that blockbusters are perhaps no longer the mindless orgy of explosions and crap acting that we had previously expected. Clash of the Titans is directed by Louis Leterrier and having recently worked on the Hulk reboot in 2008 I had decently high hopes for his latest effort. Unfortunately, Clash of the Titans is, whilst great to look at, pretty darn rubbish.<br/><br/>Good old swashbuckling Greek myth adventure films of the past always had likable and entertaining stories to make up for their laughable special effects. This remake on the other hand has a ridiculous and stupid storyline that is easily summed up by the film's set-up. Basically, Perseus (Sam Worthington) is annoyed with Zeus (Liam Neeson) because the God punished a mortal king (Jason Flemyng) by posing as him and getting busy with his wife. The humans of Argos are fed up with the Gods and their treatment of mortals and decide to start rebelling. For some unknown reason, the God are a bit weedy and so need to call upon Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and his pet Kraken to help defeat the human uprising. From here on it's the basic and boring hero's tale in which the god awful (pun not intended) Sam Worthington fights some monsters, gets with a sexy lady (Gemma Arterton) and saves the day. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.<br/><br/>OK, maybe the lacklustre plot is sparked into life by some good acting? It isn't.<br/><br/>As already mentioned, Sam Worthington is as bad as he was in Avatar and in Terminator Salvation. Gemma Arterton looks nice but does little else and Liam Neeson looks as bored as he did in The Phantom Menace. Ralph Fiennes gives the best performance of the lot but don't expect any Oscar nominations for this bunch (perhaps a few Razzies though).<br/><br/>As I said at the start, Clash of the Titans does look quite spectacular. The special effects are top of the tier and the battle scenes are quite impressive. However, put te 3D glasses on and it's a different story. It was clearly tacked on rather than carefully constructed like in Avatar and it clearly shows. The 3D scenes have a blurry, bleeding look, like a busy watercolor. If you want to know what's happening, flat may be a better bet. In other scenes, actors seem to pop out against flat backgrounds like figures in a children's pop-up book.<br/><br/>I came out of the cinema disappointed. The film had a decent cast, a proved blockbuster director, a good opportunity to expand on a much loved story and it just does not work. The acting is generally poor, the story is a joke and the 3D is terrible. In 2D this is a standard and uninteresting CGI-filled blockbuster which is leagues behind the top tier examples of the other Hollywood blockbusters of the past few years. It's big, brash and boring.<br/><br/>1/5"
"starfowl","4","3","5","15 April 2010"," A shallow action film with an uninspired storyline
","This film was really an uninspired one, considering its potential, since Greek mythology may always provide the basis for great stories. When I saw the first film (but that was several years ago), I thought mythology was indeed used in an interesting way. In fact, it was only the original film that made this movie sound so promising to me. But it ended up being a betrayal of the source material and full of terrible mistakes regarding mythology. They tried to compensate for this shallow aspect of the script by adding as many aimless action scenes as they could, and this is not how I define a good movie. But if you don't know the original, nor mythology, and if you are not too demanding, you may be less underwhelmed than I have been. And there is one redeeming quality to this silly movie: the Kraken scene, which was at least beautifully shot and showed a very convincing Kraken. I didn't see it in 3D because it had never been intended for 3D in the first place, and the 3D seemed badly rendered anyway."
"lekgolah","4","3","5","13 April 2010"," Another example of wasted potential
","I would like to start by getting one thing out of the way and that is the 3D is awful. Everything is too dark making day time scenes look like you are watching the film through the tinted glass of car. I am aware that 3D reduces the colour by 20% but it was never an issue with Avatar. I took my glasses off several times and everything looked clearer because this film was not made at all for the 3D transfer. <br/><br/>Moving swiftly onto the film. Staring Sam Worthington the film begins with a weak introduction as we see Pete Postlethwaite trying to work with a poor script. His screen time is brief but good and the film moves quickly on not allowing for any character development. This isn't usually important in action films but in a film that is about a man who plans to kill the Gods, it would help if we felt at least something for them.<br/><br/>This then lead me onto the script which is poor to say the least. The film just moves from place to place without any reason. For some reason after Worthington's boat is destroyed, he his captured by soldiers and taken to their Kings great hall so that he can conveniently be spotted by Hades who is sent to deliver a warning to the city. Everything just happens so that they can move the plot along and this becomes more annoying later on. <br/><br/>The dialogue is also an issue. Ralph Fiennes and Mads Mikkelsen do the best out of the cast but they are never used to their full potential. Sam Worthington's character is hollow and is still in Jake Scully mode from Avatar. The shaved look didn't help either. Liam Neeson, who is a great actor, is given a lot of really bad lines, particularly at the end, which is a shame because I know he could do a lot better with a proper script. <br/><br/>3D was the Achilles' heel of the action scenes (see what I did there...) but taking the 3D aside they were not terrible, they were just underwhelming. The scorpion fight scene started with the characters running through a forest straight to a desert (for sheer plot convenience) and then there were scorpions. The fight was exciting at points but you could not tell who was alive and who was dead. <br/><br/>The Medusa scene was better but for some reason they killed off every soldier (and that strange creature thing who was not explained very well) besides Perseus in this scene so that he would look heroic. Nicholas Hoult played the youngest character and usually the do not die in films so this felt strange when he turned to stone. Sadly this also suffers what the Scorpion scene had where you could only tell who was still alive by seeing who was no longer on screen. The final action scene that involves the kraken was the worst of the three because it was so short and it ended on such an anti-climax when everyone was expecting a battle of man verses monster but instead it quickly turns to stone and BANG the krakens dead. Disappointing. <br/><br/>The CGI was good but a distinct lack of pacing stops this from being enjoyable. We see the statue of Zeus but then it collapses. We soon get to know the soldiers but then they all die and then the kraken appears but that soon dies. There is good material here but it was poorly handled and the film suffers as a result. If you have seen the trailer then you have seen everything that this film has to offer sadly."
"denisvn93-1","7","3","5","11 April 2010"," The Clash is unmemorable but too fun to ignore
","During the era of divine defiance, a man named Perseus is forced to see his family killed under Hades' hands. He vows to kill him and stop his evil from spreading onto the worlds of Man and God. The plot is as paper-thin as can be and provided opportunities for big action, sounds fun for an adrenaline-fueled director but not the audience during their sit-through. As for me, it was entertaining as hell but sure is forgettable by the next morning.<br/><br/>ACTING: Sam Worthington is certainly capable of showing rage alongside with being tough and all bad-ass, which is something you only see in 1/3 of Avatar. However, there is a sequence where he absolutely does not show how Perseus is tormented by his childhood or torn at the incident that fuels his revenge. This is the same when at Medusa's Lair where he has to face the losses of characters quite close to him. In the end, what we have here is a character so ""stone"" that he seems more artificial than realistic, or in this case, more God than Man. Thankfully, he seems more versatile now rather than when he was Marcus 'Mechanical' Wright in Terminator Salvation. But then again, he has room to improve. Being Io, Gemma Arterton is under jeopardy the most as story-wise she is unnecessary to say the least and her accent is a bit of a turn-off (remember QoS?). Gladly, she proves that she is one tough shell when directly in the fight with Perseus and that accent only adds to her alluring exoticness. Her chemistry with Sam albeit not solid on any level but you can sense some light relationship tension between the two, which is good enough considering the movie is not about developed characters. The supporting cast is full of familiar faces, but they are heavily underused or written. It is so sad to see Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are so expendable for a story about Greek mythology (where is Poseidon?!). And don't get me started on Alexa Davalos and Mads Mikkelsen. In short, the characters are really put to where they are in this film - that is, if you are a main one, you are put to the highest spot and the opposite otherwise.<br/><br/>SCRIPT: Like I said, people will be easily put-off by the too straightforward of a story that 'Clash' has. Even more, the dialog twists the common knowledge on Greek mythology just to give sense to the plot e.g. the Kraken does not attack near shore and it is not a creature that belongs to the Greek myth universe. The lines are sometimes quite good but most others they are just sub-par (probably due to the delivery?). Yet, in general they do not add more dimension to the character. The Gods are script mannequins, as they are just there to do nothing when expectations run high about seeing them. In reality, none of these issues are even bothered with since viewers are already so drenched in the ensuing chaos. <br/><br/>DIRECTION: Louis Letterier will always be to action-philic and hating story. Having seen him doing exactly so in The Incredible Hulk, in which the character literally (and visually) screams ""destruction"", this movie has the formula that he can effortlessly bind to. And it shows. The action sequences are huge, better choreographed than Hulk, consistently fantastic and perhaps more fit-to-context than the horrendous Transporter 2, where realism of automobile sequences is bent to madness. It was smart that after a CGI sequence, a shot of real-set scene is immediately followed and this helps in grounding the audience in believing the universe in 'Clash'. Very well done, I might say. As an action-first director, it is wise to beforehand expect some quick cut shots. However, in my opinion, they will not be as hurtful as Bourne series that many seem to complain.<br/><br/>MUSIC: While the music is more along the lines of John Powell or Harry- Gregson Williams for 'Clash', that does not mean Ramin Djawadi will not put a hint of rock in the score, which is what he did so well in Iron Man. It amps things up to an extent and serves the situation properly. Most notable is the score for Hades, where Ramin employs a typical repetitive tune that just oozes homage to the antagonists of cinema. Oh, the nostalgia! In short, Ramin Djawadi's take on Greek myth is perhaps a bit more techno than what we should expect but he does it with absolute flair that to not love is just impossible.<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY: I'll be short with this one since you have to see how amazing it is for yourself. There obviously are plenty of swooping angles and wide shots that display the grandeur of the locations. Interestingly included in the combo is decent hand-held camera-work in fight scenes that greatly enhances the battle's intensity and makes the effects believable. Lens flares are used, making the images lively and ""not sterile"", as J.J. Abrams put it. In other words, Peter Menzies Jr. is just an awesome cinematographer.<br/><br/>VISUAL PRODUCTION: Flying horses, a snake-head woman and a colossal octopus might seem far-fetched but the visual effects team makes you feel they are really there. The sets are detailed, gigantic and adaptive to the current mood of the plot. My only hitch I got is the scorpions, where their movements are a bit iffy at times and their close-up shots display some hazy effects build. Besides that, can I get a ""WOW"" for it?<br/><br/>'Clash' is the very definition of style over substance. Greek myth has a huge effect on viewers but it was left to dust for this one, making this ride unmemorable but too fun to ignore. See it for what it is: a popcorn flick (and in 2D is enough).<br/><br/>From Vietnam, Denisvn93-1"

","There was a lot of really neat effects and graphics and the like... Too slow to start, fighting scenes were too fast to see anything of interest.. and absolutely no depth to it. It was pretty basic and in your face as it is. You can't read further into anything and the characters are so two dimensional (and I'm not talking about how it was shot). You can easily take a good legend and make it an epic movie- this was not it. Far from it. Had my dad not taken me for my birthday I might demand my money back for how horrible it was. Heck I'd like the 106 minutes of my life back. Basically it was a lot of flash and faces you could recognize. With all the good movies that have come out this year, this one feel incredibly short of anyone's expectations. I couldn't imagine paying more than 99 cents to own this film and you'd probably want to play it on mute to entertain a small child or as background noise while cleaning the house or something. And you'd really have to buy it more on impulse. But really, the effects and graphics is the only reason to see this, and I highly recommend not wasting your money. The original film may be old and not quite up to the standards of effects in today's world but you'll probably enjoy it a lot more."
"TwoDFilmBuff","2","3","5","5 April 2010"," Evidence Remakes are not always a good idea.
","It is a shame that so much money and effort has been thrown at this film especially when the vision and the effort was completely misdirected. To have taken from source material that sits firmly in viewers minds as a lovable piece of filmic history and rework it into a clumsy mash of CGI, badly worked 3D and something lacking character development and story is incomprehensible. Bigger is not always better - in making this so full of giant monsters, the final moment of using Medusa's head was the epitome of anti-climax. And the CGI was almost as believable as the old stop motion creatures in the original. In fact Medusa was more realistic in the '81 film. There was none of the tension, or character depth in the original (and that is saying a lot) lost with too many incidentals such as the religious zealot that cluttered the plot - the original idea of the king of Argos submitting to the gods was more effective - and the two hunters? What was the point in that? And why were the gods helping Perseus with the sword and Pegasus when they wanted Hades to win initially? There were too many holes. And the loss of the love triangle between Andromeda and Perseus and Calibos also left a hole as to why not simply sacrifice Andromeda and be done with it? Why should he care? To bring in the weepy Io instead seemed to pull the story off course. As for the 3D, I was going to see it without the 3D, but it was only showing with at my cinema. It was clumsily down, perspectives were off and at times things that should have appeared closer seemed further away, such as Zeus' beard at one point. 3D does not guarantee a good film. It is a sad time when I can honestly say Bubo - the golden owl mocked in the film in its cameo from the original - was actually the best thing in the film."
"paperback_wizard","7","3","5","2 April 2010"," Old vs. New
","The comment I've heard/read most often is people expect the new movie to be all special effects and no real plot. That's funny to me; and not funny ""ha ha"". In my own humble opinion, the same criticism could very well apply to the original movie.<br/><br/>That's not to suggest the first ""Clash"" lacked a plot. It featured a hero, the classic Greek hero Perseus, the mortal son of Zeus. Perseus embarks on a quest to save the princess Andromeda and her home city from a sea monster. Along his way, he faces gigantic scorpions, a trio of hideous witches, a rejected beast of a man named Calibos, and the cursed creature Medusa. It's an interesting enough plot, and one that the new movie emulates to a degree; but the pacing of the original movie and the unfolding of the plot were both rather ... haphazard.<br/><br/>Perseus' presence in the city is the doing of the sea goddess Thetis. Jealous of the fact that Zeus' son is blessed with everything her son Calibos is not, Thetis transports Perseus to the city, where he learns of Calibos' efforts to ruin Andromeda's happiness. When Perseus intervenes and frees Andromeda of the deformed man's influence, and when Andromeda's mother Cassiopeia suggests that her daughter is more beautiful than any goddess, Thetis places a curse on the city which can only be lifted if Andromeda is sacrificed to the dreaded Kraken.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with a hero rescuing cities, slaying monsters, and marrying princesses; in fact, it's kind of the entire job description. On the other hand, Harry Hamlin, who plays Perseus in the 1981 version, goes from scene to scene with all the intensity of a teenager on a scavenger hunt. Sam Worthington adds something Hamlin's Perseus was lacking: motivation. Worthington's Perseus didn't arrive in Andromeda's city by chance; his adopted family were caught in the crossfire of a rebellion between Men and Gods, and only his own divine heritage kept him from dying with them. His quest is fueled by a desire to avenge their deaths on the God Hades, who stole their lives and (in this version) called for Andromeda's sacrifice.<br/><br/>Perseus had good reason to hate the gods, or at least be suspicious of them. His love of his adopted family and grief over their deaths at the hands of a god led him to reject any connection to the gods, even his father Zeus. Played in the 2010 version by Liam Neeson, Zeus is sympathetic to the plight of humanity. However, his anger at the rebellion, which culminated in a group of soldiers tumbling his statue into the sea, led him to allow his brother Hades to remind mankind ""of the order of things"". He does try to help his son on his quest, though. There are overtones of an almost Christian relationship between Zeus, Perseus, and humanity at large in this remake.<br/><br/>A few of the more obvious differences between the original and the remake include Perseus' companions. Originally, most of the soldiers who accompanied him had neither names nor much character development. Now, Perseus follows the soldiers, rather than leading them. They all have names, backgrounds, and their own personal feelings about a ""demi-god"" joining them in their efforts to save their home.<br/><br/>Another character who is ""between"" Men and Gods is the immortal Io, played by lovely British actress Gemma Arterton. Cursed to stay young while those she loves grow old and die, her extended lifetime of acquired wisdom and knowledge makes her an invaluable guide for Perseus. She fills two roles: the wise mentor, originally filled by Ammon, played by film legend Burgess Meredith; and the love interest, originally filled by Princess Andromeda.<br/><br/>That second revision came as somewhat of a relief to me. Perseus had hardly any time (or reason) to become as heavily invested in Andromeda as he did in the first movie. When you save someone's life, it's expected that a bond will form between you; but for Hamlin's Perseus, it was apparently love at first sight. I'm romantic enough to let that slide (usually), but Worthington's on screen romance with Arterton was much more believable.<br/><br/>Now, let's tackle the ""purist"" objections. It's my position, in the case of sequels at least, you should adhere to the source material as closely as possible. Remakes, however, are supposed to stray (within reason). Did Perseus and Io have a relationship in the previous movie? No. On the other hand, Perseus didn't ride Pegasus, the winged horse, in the original Greek myth, as he did in both movies; he wore winged shoes given to him by the gods. The thrilling line ""Release the Kraken!"", delivered by Zeus in both movies, was never uttered by classical Zeus, simply because the Kraken wasn't a creature from Greek myth. Was Hades ever an actual villain, as he is so often portrayed in film? No; he was simply the God of the Underworld, a position he was never ""tricked"" into accepting.<br/><br/>It's called artistic license. If remakes were supposed to be ""faithful"", then we wouldn't need them, would we? We'd just watch the original again, which I did before watching this one. With all due respect to Ray Harryhausen, I prefer the remade ""Clash of the Titans"". Director Louis Leterrier did a fine job diagnosing what worked from the original film and what didn't, cutting scenes here and amending them there. What he ultimately produced may fit the label of a ""rock 'n roll epic"", but it also fits the label of a ""classic epic"", one with a believable hero, courageous companions, and pulse-pounding adventure. More than just an action flick, it is a portrait of one man's journey to discover his true heritage.<br/><br/>(read the original review here: http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=385155166543 )"
"heathalvarez","3","4","8","3 April 2010"," Terrible remake!
","They completely changed the storyline and the changes were obvious from the beginning. This storyline was based more on Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades and how Zeus tricked and banished Hades to the underworld. Hades, wanting revenge, plots a way to grow stronger to overthrow Zeus by feasting on the fears and anger of Zeus' children (humans), and then directly intervenes throughout the movie to help his cause. The religious overtones of the movie were blatant throughout - Gods are only immortal because of man's faith and the gods need to be acknowledged or man would feel their wrath for their lack of faith and insolence. <br/><br/>Perseus goes out of his way to not acknowledge Zeus as his father, much in the way a modern-day atheist would denounce Jesus as his savior or God as the creator. There are several instances of anti-religion bantering with the only pro-religion jargon coming from the gods themselves and some crazed guy you would find on any corner in an urban city preaching to passersby that they need to seek salvation.<br/><br/>King Acrisius was killed by Zeus in the original movie for tossing Danae and Perseus in the sea and the Kraken released to destroy Argos. That whole scenario changed and there was no Kraken that took out Argos in the beginning. Instead of Perseus and his mom washing up on a shore for him to be raised, a fisherman found the casket afloat, brought it onto his ship, and found only Perseus to still be alive. Perseus was raised as a fisherman.<br/><br/>This new version introduces King Cepheus (Vincent Regan, who played Brad Pitt's right-hand man in Troy) and Queen Cassiopeia (Polly Walker or Rome fame) as rulers of Argos instead of Joppa. Cassi' starts going off about how hot her daughter is, which is when Hades shows up and threatens to either release the Kraken to kill Andromeda as a sacrifice or it will destroy the city. The goddess Thetis is nowhere to be found as a catalyst to start Perseus on his crusade to get Medusa's head. Perseus is imprisoned, which is when Io (played by Gemma Arterton who is Bubo's replacement, so to speak) shows up telling him that she has watched over him his entire life. The soldiers of Argos figure out Perseus is a demigod and try to rough him up a bit (because everyone is hating on religion and anything to do with the gods), when King Cepheus stops them so that he can find a way to stop the Kraken.<br/><br/>There are no ties between Andromeda and Calibos. This is a huge change and in my opinion a major error.<br/><br/>The introduction of Perseus' equipment he used to in the original movie was revamped and he only got a sword...no shield or helmet from the gods. The shield he eventually used to fight Medusa was fashioned from a scorpion shell and was given to him by two add-on yahoo characters that played the comic relief. The sword was something only Perseus could wield...kinda like a metal version of a light saber. Yet, he did not want to use it because he wanted to do this whole thing ""as a man"" without the reliance of the gods and his demigod abilities. The storyline behind Pegasus was introduced at this point and ended up being a black horse (whiskey tango foxtrot!?!?!).<br/><br/>Calibos met up with Hades at some point, who infused the deformed man with the power of hell. Calibos stalked Perseus in an attempt to stop him from finding a way to defeat the Kraken. A battle ensued between Perseus and Calibos and after Caibos' blood was spilled in the sand large scorpions were raised (unlike the original when it was Medusa's blood). It is at this time a race of mystical beings is introduced that controlled huge scorpions. All I can ask is - Why?<br/><br/>Perseus eventually gets Medusa's head and goes to kill the Kraken, whose head looks remarkably like the Stygian Witches that Perseus met up with earlier. (Did they run out of monster models??) In the end, Perseus and Andromeda do not live happily ever- after...Perseus and Io do, but only after Zeus resurrects her.<br/><br/>The casting was totally jacked (with few exceptions), especially with Perseus and Zeus. Perseus was played by a totally unbelievable guy (Sam Worthington) that looked more like an skinny extra in a Marine Corps flick. They could have used someone like Eric Bana, who would have been a much more believable Perseus. I still maintain that Liam Neeson made a poor Zeus and that they could have done much better.<br/><br/>The playwright Ammon was eliminated, which I always thought was a superb character to tell the story. Another huge error in the revamped story.<br/><br/>I totally dug that they used that conniving woman that played Atia of the Julii (Polly Walker) to play Andromeda's mother. That's about it for the kudos in casting. <br/><br/>The original Bubo the Owl made a cameo appearance, complete with clicks and whistles. But after a brief, ""What the hell is that?"" when they pulled him out from a blanket, that was the last you saw of him. <br/><br/>The introduction of Hades (Ralph Fiennes) was really aggravating to me. His voice was gratingly irritating and if they insisted on having a Hades element, the character should have been infinitely more foreboding and menacing.<br/><br/>Overall, I am disappointed in the revised flick. I can understand a little tweaking in the storyline, but it was almost an entirely different story all together and purists will be be displeased. If they could have better matched the new cast with the old cast, kept the original storyline with only minor tweaks, and used today's graphic technology...the film would have been awesome. These makers of this film bastardized a classic."

And then I grew up and realized script was not great, but I still have so much fun watching it. Like the customs for the Gods are so flashy and ridicules but it so funny. The acting Ralph Fiennes over acting it, Liam Neeson always sounds like going speeches , Gemma Arterton only there for being hot and Sam Worthing being likable but not the best actor around but I kinda like him actually.

"joelsmith190","10","2","3","29 July 2015"," Some flaws, but it's an epic mythology-based action flick.
","I have previously stated that I'm a myth buff, so I might be slightly biased to this movie from the get-go. It also has Sam Worthington from the new Terminator and Man On A Ledge. It also has Gemma Arterton, from Prince Of Persia and some other movies.<br/><br/>This movie has it down to the lore for the most part. It's ironclad with epic battles and awesome special effects. It's got awesome characters and great acting. It also has a great cast. The story is interesting, though kind of cliché.<br/><br/>And they use Perseus, one of the most ignored myth figures (more on him later).<br/><br/>""RELEASE THE KRAKEN!""<br/><br/>Can't ignore one of the greatest lines in history.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the best, entertainment wise. The fight scenes were fast-paced and awesome, the special effects and musical scores were epic. It's pretty fantastic for a popcorn film with some humor mixed in some parts.<br/><br/>However, it's one of those ""clusterfuck of death"" movies. Which are annoying go say the least. Like 3.5 soldiers live including Perseus. Yeah, there's a point five in there for a reason, I didn't just randomly throw it in there.<br/><br/>Plenty of people rip on the plot and premise, though I gotta say I don't see what they're getting at. Yes, there's your predictable messiah complex, and yeah, the deaths of most of the characters lack impact, but in terms of the world and such, it's actually pretty interesting (though not much is really done with it). The people of Earth begin shunning the Gods, no longer praying towards them, so Hades comes to Olympus and talks Zeus into chastising the humans. And by chastising, I mean brutally murdering and then giving an ultimatum to those still alive: sacrifice the princess of their region or suffer a tentacle-y death (from the Kraken obviously). So Perseus who had been taken into ""custody"" and a legion of soldiers go off to find the Moirai, or the Fates, and hopefully find a way to kill the Kraken. The city is taken over by civilians who just want to live, while Perseus and his troupe of soldiers go on their mighty adventure.<br/><br/>One big thing I want to criticize from a mythological standpoint is that while Poseidon is portrayed quite well (a psychopathic rapist), Zeus and Hades aren't. Both Zeus and Poseidon had sex with so many creatures before humanity was even a thing, yet Zeus genuinely wants Perseus (his son; a demigod) to survive/not be killed by the Kraken. Dude, Zeus would want to eat Perseus if anything to prevent his own death, which is something he did A LOT in the mythology, because he was paranoid. Hades, as usual in Hollywood fashion, is portrayed as your usual bad guy. And just so everybody who isn't a myth buff knows, Hades wasn't actually a bad guy. He kinda got screwed over and thrown into the Underworld, but he was actually a good guy; his brothers were asses, but I digress. The worst thing he did was kidnap Persephone and force her into marriage, and while it's no defense for what he did, here's why he did it: he didn't know any better. He lived in his father's stomach for years, only to be sent to the Underworld after the war against the Titans where there was no time for love. He kinda was just stuck there and never really learned a good way to romance, so when he saw this beautiful and nice girl, he practically hopped on a chariot, went into the overworld, picked her up and drove her back down with him. He was lonely and again, not an excuse, but that's the reason. And you can tell he was a good guy because he still let her go to the overworld one day every year (which is when spring begins). So he suffers the same fate of Magneto: misused as the token villain. <br/><br/>It gets a 10/10. It's epic. Don't listen to the critics, this is an awesome movie. One of my favorites. Definitely better than ""Wrath"". I hope Rage can return this franchise to its roots of badassery.﻿ While it does a good job of respecting the mythos, it still does its own thing. For example, the Perseus of myth, like most heroes, had no real personality. Instead here, he does some (thin) depth.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the original Titans film (I own it, I just haven't gotten around to it yet), but I'm pretty sure most people hate this because ""Aaaargh! Reboot!"". But my family (who has seen it) explained to me where this film deviated from the original, so I can tell you that this film does its own thing; but on the other hand, it does respect the original with some Easter eggs (which I found out via wiki lol)"

","I recall the 1981 version of this film being rather entertaining as a teenager when HBO was new and there was nothing better on... now, thirty years later with a huge budget and lots of stars, the film falls completely flat with a painful script, nonsensical story lines and substandard special F/X AND absolutely no emotion, heart or clarity. Despite having some big acting names, this film is a complete mess. It's hard to follow at times, filled with senseless characters and a set that feels about as real as a bad Six Flags ride from the 80s.

","As a great lover of most things 'long ago' and a fan of this sort of film, I had perhaps unreasonably high expectations of this one. Oh dear.<br/><br/>The casting wasn't great. Instead of a lovable everyman to get the audience on his side, we instead receive a quite dislikable and somewhat thuggish-looking, shaven-headed Perseus played badly by Sam Worthington. Liam Neeson is an unimposing, henpecked-looking Zeus. Lord Voldemort voices Hades wonderfully early in the film, until Ralph Fiennes gets control of his alter-ego and finds a different accent to use (and that voice aside, his performance was quite good). In the half an hour since the film ended I've pretty much forgotten what Andromeda did, so unused was the character, so I can't say much about her; and Perseus's merry men were neither good nor bad.<br/><br/>Saved until last, Gemma Arterton as Io was surprisingly good... well, once I'd come to terms with Io being ripped from one part of the mythology and inexplicably transplanted into this story, hilariously as a 'love interest' for the son of the guy who got her pregnant then turned her into a cow. Then Pegasus appeared (now a species, not a specific horse), and he was a badass black horse who scared all his white mates away.<br/><br/>Just as I was dealing with that, a djinn appeared out of the wrong mythology entirely and struck a devastating blow for odd Hollywood storylining. On the bright side he looked like a baby ent, on the downside... what was he doing in Greek myth? Similarly, the Kraken - who sent him? Loki, Thor? And if we can push the name aside for a moment, why was Hades controlling the SEA monster? Why did Andromeda volunteer to be sacrificed to it? And why did it totally ignore her for ten minutes? As a saving grace the effects are pretty good, and Pegasus looked very nice in flight. One battle scene was decent if a little hard to follow, and some of the acting was good too.<br/><br/>Maybe I ruined this film for myself, but if you know a little about the mythology you'll spend at least half the film picking at it."

"TheLittleSongbird","4","2","3","26 November 2010"," Well done visually, but hollow
","Despite its flaws(the uneven acting and the episodic storybook-like structure) I really like the original Clash of the Titans, especially for the set design and the Harryhousen effects. In short, it is flawed but good nostalgic fun. This 2010 remake is very well done in the costume and set design and some of the effects are truly incredible, but emotionally it is ultimately hollow.<br/><br/>While I do agree the effects were incredible, especially the Kraken, some of the scenes could have been better done. In particular with the gorgon Medussa. A scene that terrified me when I was little in the original and still does to some extent, but as has been pointed out once or twice before there was more emphasis on too much action not enough suspense which diminished that scene's appeal in this.<br/><br/>The music comes across as rather generic. It strived to be rousing, energetic and bombastic, something you would find with Erich Korngold and Bernard Hermann, but sadly it came across as generic and boring. Pacing was an issue as well, it was very uneven here. It felt as though the not-so-important scenes dragged and the important bits felt rushed and skimmed over. The direction was disappointingly lethargic too.<br/><br/>My main complaints though are with the acting, story and script. As I have said, the story and acting weren't the strongest points of the original, but both elements had their moments. However, the story has a very uneven structure, it is quite episodic, but it is also rather unexciting. On the whole the dialogue is awful and very banal, and there were some scenes where it came across as cheesy or forced. The acting wasn't much to go on either. Sam Worthington was merely alright, he has the heroism and charm, but then there is the accent that comes and goes and I got the sense that the delivery of some of the lines and the action sequences didn't come naturally to him. I was more disappointed in the bigger names. Ralph Fiennes doesn't seem to have a clue what he is doing here, and Liam Neeson looks lost and embarrassed. Gemma Arterton can be good(BBC's Tess of the D'Urbevilles) but while she is very pretty, her character is rather vapid.<br/><br/>Overall, it had its moments, but it was unengaging and disappointing. 4/10 for the production values. Bethany Cox"
"Angelus2","1","2","3","18 October 2010"," Awful from the first second
","Perseus must fight the Gods to save the mortals...That is the basic premise of this film. I instantly knew that this film was going to be bad, not because it was a remake..But because the trailer was just awful, rock music with action that was disappointing...And then the film did exactly the same.<br/><br/>The plot too simple, as well as inaccurate to the tales of the Greek gods, there was no Kraken..which seems to be only added because of its appearance in POTC,and once more Hollywood gets the character of Hades wrong, making him the power hungry villain, something that was never mentioned or hinted in the Greek mythologies. While, the addition of an Angel and Jinn make things even more awkward...<br/><br/>Every actor failed to deliver a good strong performance, I'm surprised at Liam Neeson, dull and robotic are the words to describe him. While Ralph Fiennes is just annoying with his raspy voice, the lead actor Sam Worthington was very good in Terminator Salvation, but now I am convinced he cannot act, he is just another actor filling in the 'Action Hero' role. Gemma Arterton does not add much to the plot, or performance wise, similar to her role as Stawberry Fields in Quantum of Solace. But there is one plus, Alexa Davalos, she plays her role as Andromeda well and she's beautiful.<br/><br/>Awful remake...Awful."

","Watching this new version of a 1980s classic movie I was hopping for a similar gripping story line and some fantastic special effects. The story is lame (to call it shallow even would be some kind of compliment), the actors are everything but inspired (Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are a total disaster)and the special effects somewhere between boring and so confusing that you can hardly watch it. And in between the lines you find G.I. Joe fight for whatever propaganda - trying to take the watchers for fools. This movie was the worst big production I have seen in many years and easily qualifies for many many Razzies. Overall a superbly annoying waste of time!!!!!"
"alvarhaggis","4","2","3","23 August 2010"," The Epic with nothing really Epic.
","This movie should have been great, should have been a classic and it should have been Epic. It was not. The original, with a limited budget and quite frankly silly actors, was still a great movie. It told it's story well.<br/><br/>This version on the other hand had a huge budget, some very fine actors and yet it lacks in almost every aspect except CGI. It seems all action blockbusters these days have no real substance other than their effects.<br/><br/>The script is the poorest aspect of this film. Even the lines which were supposed to be Epic and the big lines of the movie did not pay off. The movie jumps around from place to place with no cohesion. There seems to be no real motivation for most of the characters to be doing what they are doing and many seem just thrown in there for the sake of it. Sam Worthington impressed me in Avatar, but is completely lackluster in this movie. His facial expressions and his way of delivering the rather poor lines was pretty awful. Gemma Arterton has been thrown in for eye-candy and her lines were also painfully performed.<br/><br/>None of the other actors in this movie had any decent lines and so their performance was also rather poor. This movie doesn't sag in the middle, it sags the whole way through.<br/><br/>The CGI and action sequences were very good, but they are few and far between. They hold your attention during their duration, but then it returns to it's painful to watch story.<br/><br/>As previously stated, with the large budgets, good source material and some very fine actors in this movie, it should have been great. It should have been Epic. But, instead was actually very poor. Even for a no-brains-required action summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>There are rumours a COTT 2 is in the works. If I could ever request anything from it's makers, is to hire some decent writers, get a decent script and work on the story before a CGI computer is even turned on.<br/><br/>4/10"
"unbrokenmetal","Null","2","3","19 August 2010"," A terrible mess, created only to show the latest FX monsters
","Mind you, the old version of ""Clash of the Titans"" was nowhere near a good movie. I was rather disappointed already when I watched that at the cinema almost 30 years ago. Therefore I thought it would be easy for the remake to exceed the little qualities there were, but I was mistaken. The only redeeming value are the special effects again: Ray Harryhausen's cute models back then, an impressive Medusa and powerful scorpions now. Perseus is a short haired soldier boy now with no character depth whatsoever: he's got a vague feeling he is on a revenge mission against the gods, whatever, and (SPOILER) when his lost love returns to life, he kinda shrugs 'oh, nice to have', that's about as far as his emotional concern goes. The complex cast of Immortals from Greek mythology is reduced to a simple Good Guy, Bad Guy scheme (Creator and Tempter), which means the other gods don't have any function, embarrassed they stand around, watching Zeus and Hades. Cutting the best scenes of Apollo, as the deleted scenes on the DVD prove, was a bad mistake. The makers failed to realize the potential of a different cosmic order which knew many shades of gray, and they even seem to have lost interest in some characters entirely along the way. Thus the audience wouldn't care, for example, if the Kraken ate Andromeda for dinner. Most remember the main actor only vaguely as ""the guy from Avatar"" which is telling a lot - you don't need a new Kirk Douglas for this circus.<br/><br/>I recall somewhere below, a reviewer wrote something like there should be a law against remakes which are made for the sole reason that we have a new generation of effects at hand. I wholeheartedly agree with that."
"jortony","1","2","3","10 August 2010"," terrible, I honestly feel angry after watching part of it
","I jumped ahead when I had made it a quarter way through to find out who was responsible for this. The movie is painful, the attempts to connect with the feelings of disaffected youth butchered the myth, plot, and the original so brutally I couldn't take it. As a movie aside from the *complete* and unyielding failure to bring Greek myths to modern special effects, it was distant, and did not elicit a single emotion to bring me into the story. The makeup and costumes were garbage, it was like watching a 80's glam rock remake of 300. The soldiers were too clean, and the design of the armor was painful. I could go on, but it isn't worth my time. These stories were the lifeblood of thousands of years of worshipers, and this movie failed on every level.<br/><br/>to Hollywood: if you want to make a better movie, treat this as the antithesis of a good Greek myth movie."
"Bored78","4","2","3","6 August 2010"," I expected better
","I was really disappointed with this movie. I have never seen the original but the previews for this looked decent.<br/><br/>The movie is not that well made. To me it seems like the director tried to add elements that made other movies famous or popular.I am not usually picky with action movies but i found myself looking at the clock often through this one. Some things this movie fell flat on:<br/><br/>1)Storyline - Boring.You barely get to know the main character and don't really know most of the other characters at all. They seem more like extras than support cast.The story moves along in a rather choppy fashion. Bad storytelling.<br/><br/>2)Special effects- Not much better than the original which was done nearly 30 years ago. IF you are expecting Avatar level CGI you are going to be greatly disappointed. Even the magical special effects for the ""Gods"" were boring.<br/><br/>3) Witty comments- There are parts of this movie where it seems it was trying to be like 300. Unfortunately it just made the movie more cheesy.<br/><br/>4)Action- Shaky camera syndrome incoming. Its hard to follow action when it looks like someone is running around the fight with a camcorder. The action scenes make you beg for more walking and talking and less action.<br/><br/>5)Musicial Scores- I had this problem with the new Star Wars movies and it was the only thing i hated about them. I cannot stand it when The musical score/sound effects are so loud you cant hear what people are saying. Even with my graphics equalizer set for human voices and toning down highs and lows the music and other sound effects were to overpowering to hear what the characters were saying at times.I find it annoying if i have to struggle at all to decipher voices from an overpowering musical score.<br/><br/>Overall this movie wasn't very well done. I gave it a 4 because its better than watching reruns on cable. It is mildly entertaining but its nothing that your going to remember the story on when you wake up tomorrow. Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief is a much more entertaining and put together story about the Greek gods. I would only get this if i couldn't find another new release to watch."
"thinker1691","7","2","3","3 August 2010"," "" Despite your reluctance, you were and always will be the son of Zeus""
","Audiences across America have waited for years to see a remake of 'clash of the Titans', the reason for that is because the original 1981 version was absolutely incredible. There were a few minor flaws in the original, but audiences hoped they would be refined for this update version. The title is the same "" Clash of the Titans "" and since it stars Liam Neeson as Zeus, we figured, how could it fail? In this film we have Sam Worthington playing Perseus but one look at the rugged actor, tells us this movie is not going to be based on good looks, but a tempest tossed story filled with stark Black images, dark pitiful creatures and gritty, marsh monsters. Although, there are sufficient fiery, exciting scenes, filled with arching volcanoes and incredible CGI created creatures (I liked the BLACK Pegasus), director Louis Letterier allowed the story to be filmed too close to Hades instead of glorious Olympus. As a result, horror, tragedy and beautiful ugliness are the paint brushes of his canvas. The storyline is further burdened with too many options and no central resolution. Still, the final caparison will be up to the forgiving audience, but as far as this reviewer is concern, I liked the original. ***"
"marvin344","4","2","3","3 August 2010"," Why didn't they take their time with this one?
","The original Clash of the Titans was not an exceptional film in terms breathtaking acting or a deep involving storyline. What it did have however was a clear structure and motivation for our Protagonist (Perseus).<br/><br/>Fast forward a few years and we have huge technological advances making what was impossible then very feasible now and on the tail end of the epic Avatar, 3D now seems a sure fire way to guarantee success.<br/><br/>It will be hard to talk about this film without discussing the current hero of the moment, Sam Worthington. He brought the much needed soul to a largely soulless Terminator Salvation; he was the marine we all loved in Avatar so it was just fitting that he would be the perfect choice to step into Harry Hamlin's shoes here. Whilst it is obvious that he injects a fair bit of enthusiasm into this role, it just seems like he is working with a bad script and an impetus of the films creators to get straight into the battles (Which are not exactly original) thereby showcasing the 3D effect. It just feels like nothing develops in this film and we end up not caring if Perseus wins or loses his battle with the Gods.<br/><br/>Another issue I had with the film is the lack of clarity when trying to identify the true Antagonist. Whilst we all observe the fact that Hades is the mortal enemy of Perseus early on in the film, the role played by Zeus is both that of compassion towards the humans and at the same time, malice. It is never clear as to what Zeus really wants to do thereby making the great actor that is Liam Neeson simply look confused in certain scenes.<br/><br/>The biggest gripe however is to the character of Lo and her exact role in the film. It is initially suggested that she is a watchful guardian of Perseus yet she gets heavily involved in his adventure. As the film progresses, it starts to become apparent that she is possibly the love interest of Perseus which makes the presence of Princess Andromeda irrelevant. Every scene between Perseus and Andromeda seems rushed and void of any emotion or chemistry that the adventure undertaken by Perseus seems to be motivated by revenge rather than a clear intent on saving the princess.<br/><br/>The original Clash of the Titans was a love story at heart; this one can't make up its mind whether it is a love story, a revenge movie or a showcase for 3D. I did think Medusa looked magnificent though."
"Dandy_Desmond","4","2","3","1 August 2010"," CGI Borefest
","Another big budget, brainless, CGI action fest from the underbelly of Hollywood. New in thing Sam Worthington stars in what turns out to be a effects heavy and ultimately boring film. Liam Neeson does his Liam Neeson - Ralph Fiennes does voldemort again. Gemma Arterton appears as nothing more than a bit of fluff for the boys. and we have a few more familiar faces trying to act all noble in ridiculous wigs and clothing. Perseus is found in the sea as a baby, it turns out he is the son of a god. A god called Hades (Fiennes) accidentally kills his earth dad and he sets out for revenge to Kill him. We also have Hades threatening destruction to Argos (not the shop the city) unless they sacrifice their princess Andromeda to the Kraken in 10 days. So Perseus and his motley crew set off to find a way to kill the Kraken. <br/><br/>The slight change in the story from the original (as I remember anyway) has an effect on the film. Andromeda has no link to Perseus and is replaced really with Gemma Artetons Io for no reason. In the original I remember Perseus was on a mission to save Andromeda because he loved her. No not in this one he is driven by hate but hate leads to the dark side. No hang on thats a different one. <br/><br/>Anyway it doesn't really matter as this film was utter tosh due to the need to fill nearly every frame with CGI. Rush any in between stuff then get on to the next big set piece. The worst example is the scene involving Medusa. This should have been tense and scary but guess what?....yes they turned it into another action scene with a giant CGI Medusa snake thing wriggling around like a bloody computer game end of level boss. I don't recommend this film. I am seriously considering never seeing a film with Sam Worthington and his whispery voice ever again. Gemma Arterton is a fox though. Enough to Kraken one off to. ha ha"

At all. I don't want to offend anyone who took part in the making but I'd like to know that what audience is this made for? It's too violent for kids and has nothing to say to adults. Next time watch the original before making a remake and build on it's values. Modern filmmakers really have to learn that CGI orgy has nothing to do with quality. It's like writing a book based on the words length and how they sound. I have the feeling that the script was written in two hours during a hangover by a twelve year old. Am I getting old? I don't think so, but todays high budget CGI films are made for the dumb."

","In a movie like this Theme is a strong issue.<br/><br/>This is about Greek Mythology to a point, right? WRONG! It is very apparent in every scene of this movie, that someone either the writer, or the director, had a strong anti-god agenda. I am no god person of any kind, and believe me, if that is where they want take a story I am more than happy to journey with. HOWEVER, when talking about Greek Mythology, even with the poetic license exercised, this is simply out of the question.<br/><br/>The role of Man and Greek Gods has been adversarial at times and down right ugly, but in the end the Gods loved it when the hero would pass the trials given him. In other words, this beating of that tired, ""I will do this without the Gods"" ""We are stronger than the Gods"" ""Man no longer needs the Gods"" ""Gods? What Gods?"", over and over and over and over again in each scene got really tired, really quick! Say it twice or three times, I get it, even though I feel it is misplaced in this type of movie. I sure wish that someone who had a real love for the Greek Mythological material had written and or directed this. Someone at least was mature and strong enough to not treat this movie as a pulpit to preach from.<br/><br/>Although it was lacking in theme, it was unintentionally funny in a LOT of places. I give it two stars for that reason only. Rent it if you must, or wait for it to go super dollar store bargain bin.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson rounds out the cast."

","Well, after seeing a few reviews here I was expecting the worse before seeing this movie, but even then it exceeded (in a wrong way) my expectations. The whole movie looked to me like a hallucination of someone high on drugs. The director/writer(s) just dumped a few (imho important) parts and characters off the classic myth, then filled the empty space with stuff they made probably during/after a really hard drinking night. Conflict between Zeus and Hades? Revenge driven Perseus? Who the hell is Io anyway? Pegassus coming from nowhere acting like a puppy? Djinns? They look like Treebeard from LOTR, but what do they do in this story? And last, but not least - anyone who did not bother to read the Greek mythology before seeing this **** will keep on asking: - Who is this Andromeda girl? What's the big deal anyway? Just dump her in the water and call it a day! I could continue, but this movie just isn't worth it. A nice classic story misused, raped, chewed and spitted to the ground, added some CGI and that's it. The outcome is shallow, boring and absolutely disappointing. I gave it 2 for some acting and the Medusa fight scene, which I find the only so-so interesting part in the whole movie. I was looking forward to it, as it had a great potential to be nice using modern technologies. The puppets in the '81 original did not really give her justice, so OK, the movie earned an extra point for the Medusa and some CGI. That was the actual way of making this movie I'd expect. Take the part of the story, maybe tweak it a little, make it look good and that's all. Yepp, and did I mention Kraken looked to me pretty much like the monster from Cloverfield?"

There's not a single ounce of originality in this movie. Right down to the less-than-exciting casting (oh, another movie starring Liam Neeson as a god, and, oh, another flick starring Ralph Fiennes as the ultimate evil...OMG, literally). Sam Worthington is a complete zero face, there's just nothing interesting to be detected in his facial features... And then: What's with the Kraken? It's not supposed to look like the alien beast from ""Cloverfield""... But to top it all off, this movie really boasted the dullest writing in 2010.

","This film is about the Greek Gods unleashing their wrath because humans lost faith and respect for the heavens. This causes a huge war between heaven and the mortal world.<br/><br/>""Clash of the Titans"" has good visuals (I watched the 2D version), a tight plot and an endless stream of action. However, subplots are not explained so well, such as why the scorpions switches side to side with Perseus. Other subplots are just woefully neglected, such as the two civilians who claim to have specialist knowledge and volunteer to join in the battle. Io, played by Gemma Aterton, is so dispensable in the film. It seems that her only reason to be in the film is to have a girl among the group of guys. The filmmakers could have at least given her more seemingly valid reason to be on screen.<br/><br/>""Clash of the Titans"" has the ingredients of a summer blockbuster.

The story had many holes in it and it felt awfully rushed. I loved the original (yes I know it's old and corny!!) and had high hopes for this movie. However, my expectations were seriously let down by a lazy story (Zeus was about as powerful as paper mache, and don't get me started on Hades' ludicrously husky voice and dodgy pronunciation!) and characters that weren't particularly likable. Many questions went unanswered also, namely, why did Zeus give Perseus only one coin?

To be fair, the Greeks had grand monsters too. The fight a two-faced coin; Zeus gave life to humans, but he is also dependent on their love and worship. <br/><br/>It's an epic movie of an epic tale.

It was killed way way to quickly and a character mentioned throughout the story as much as the kragan was should have done a bit more then it did. Other then that I loved this film.

The blurry 3-D effect is an insult to modern technology and the wittiness of the original has been replaced by the same hard violence that seems to be made only nowadays because it attracts the youngsters now, reason enough for me to never go to any action movie again.

"Galina_movie_fan","4","2","3","28 April 2010"," The Kraken and the Half-Blood Prince. 3D or not 3D?
","I have always been fascinated by legends and myths of ancient Greece the way they were retold from the ancient epic and lyric poems, and I could spend hours counting the liberties taken with the famous legends in the new action adventure Clash of the Titans (2010) but I will only mention few of them. Zeus, the king of gods did not appear seduce the mother of Perseus, the main character of the film, in the form of her husband, Acrisius. Acrisius was the father of Danae, who was predicted to be killed by her son. Frightened Acrisius imprisoned Danae in a bronze chamber open to the sky in the courtyard of his palace. Zeus entered the chamber in the form of golden rain, and from that union Perseus was born. After several generations, Zeus would disguise himself as a husband of another beautiful woman, Alcmene, resulting in birth of the greatest Greek hero, Hercules. The guardian angel of Perseus in the film, the beautiful woman named Io, was according the legend his fore-mother, from who the greatest heroes of Greece would descend. Io died long before the birth of Perseus, and simply could not accompany him in his journey. As a matter of fact, Perseus was on his quest for the head of Medusa Gorgona alone, and two his half-siblings had helped him, the gods Athena and Hermes. Perseus from the legend never was depicted as the rebel against Gods and the fighter for the human rights. The Legend of Perseus is so beautiful and poetic that it deserves to be filmed without deviation and strange changes. I never understood why every director and screenwriter who decided to make yet another adaptation of the well known legends should add some preposterous changes to them? One more thing - what with the title? The Titans, also known as the elder gods, were the children of Gaea, the Earth goddess and Uranus, the sky god. The Titans ruled the earth before the Olympians with Zeus as their leader overthrew them and banished them to Tartarus, a place deep beneath even the underworld, dark, sunless and gloomy. There are no titans in the movie and evidently, no clash of the Titans. And it's been noticed by many viewers that the Kraken was not even the monster from Greek mythology but from the Scandinavian. The huge dragon that was sent as the punishment for the queen Cassiopeia's vanity belonged to Poseidon and had no name. But even these liberties with the source material are not the main problem of the film. The 3D effects, the main reason why I went to see it in the theater, were of poor quality - images had double edges and were unclear. Only after return from the cinema, I found out that the movie was not filmed in 3D but converted after the filming was over. To make it 3D, was the rushed decision, and as the result, did not add to the watching experience but made it worse. The film boasts a lot of action scenes, fast and furious but they were shot by a shaky camera and primarily cause a headache. I personally liked only one action scene, the battle with the Gorgon Medusa. To give a monster so terrifying that a glimpse at her would turn any creature into stone, Natalia Vodyanova's face, one of the most beautiful and adored faces in the world was a cute idea. My advice - wait for the DVD but if you have to see it in the theater, save yourself the money and see the 2D version which I've heard is pretty decent visually. And do not say you have not been warned."

"littlemisshaywood","6","2","3","22 April 2010"," Nothing Special
","Just your basic action movie fodder.<br/><br/>It's not particularly big, it's not clever, really, it doesn't have much going for it.<br/><br/>One of the serious hindrances is that you don't connect/care about any of the characters: I felt no anger towards the Gods or any sympathy towards Perseus. It was even hard to notice when any of the characters died! However if you're hoping that this will be compensated for by mind-blowing fight scenes and dazzling special effects, then prepare to be disappointed, as it certainly doesn't do that. The final showdown at the end is especially brief and for me a total anticlimax.<br/><br/>I watched the entire thing completely unmoved and only vaguely entertained. <br/><br/>All in all, utterly uninspiring but not particularly terrible."

","This is the worst movie ever, I never walked out of a cinema before, but this time I couldn't help it. Even the hot dude couldn't keep me there. Also, it seems to be the same story as Percy Jackson and the lightning thief, my friend told me agitated in the cinema. Probably both based on the same book or myth or whatever, but pretty lame if you've already seen Percy and know whats gonna happen. And maybe did Clash of the Titans have another ending, i will never know, and i'm glad about that ;) Didn't like the computer graphics either.<br/><br/>Also I felt like not much thought was put in the desert-people characters, they looked like a mixture of creatures from the movie The Mummy, Pirates of the Caribbean and more of those films. We know what the freaks look like, think of something new.."
"barrett667","7","2","3","18 April 2010"," Remake or new movie?
","As an original film, I have to say that I enjoyed Clash. As a remake it was an utter, abysmal failure. The first film stayed close to the Greek mythology it was based on while this one rewrote most of the actual story as it went along. Perseus actually made his speedy trips with a pair of winged boots and not a horse with wings. The remake had great special effects (but, agreeing with an earlier reviewer, you want to take the glasses off at times, but this makes the picture almost impossible to watch, go and see the 2D version), good acting and an engaging story line. If you are up for a fun afternoon, go grab a ticket and have a seat. If you are looking for a remake of the original or a story that follows Greek mythology, skip this one. I do have to give a nod and a smile to the creative folks that put this film together for giving the mechanical owl a quick cameo. I got it, but the 15 teenagers that went along missed the joke entirely. The kids sitting near me got a few pieces of info about the original and now they all want to see it. We will rent it, or I will bring in my old VHS copy and VCR to the place I work so the kids can see Harry Hamlin and the special effects of 1981 at work. They will also have the chance to see some of the greatest actors to grace the silver screen at work.<br/><br/>Original Story 7/10 for all the pieces, i.e. special effects, acting, story, etc...<br/><br/>Remake 3/10 There is almost nothing left of the original film"
"Generic_Gooner","5","2","3","15 April 2010"," A clash of the mediocre...
","It wasn't a bad film... it was just forgettable.<br/><br/>Everything about LOTRs that i found a problem, this film managed to cause problems in the opposite direction! The pacing in LOTRs was bad, it lingered on so many scenes it became such a chore to sit through after the first viewing. It also over explained everything with elongated scenes that were in dire need of a trim.<br/><br/>COTT went the other way, jumping from plot point to plot point, occasionally filling in certain gaps with Gemma Arteton giving them all a bedtime story for a few minutes. A film that seemingly could have run for over 2 hours with the plot points it needed to hit ran for less than an hour 50... and in fact I'm glad it was so short because there seemed nothing in this film that blew me away. Nothing new or exciting, nothing with any depth or value that made me care about any of it.<br/><br/>And the 3d... absolutely nothing in it seemed to be enhanced by the 3d at all. I may as well saved a few quid and watched it in 2d, it would have made absolutely no difference in the viewing.<br/><br/>The monsters were good, the CGI was competent and the fight sequences were fine, but all too often they felt a little too familiar, right up to the 'Cloverfield' Kraken towards the end.<br/><br/>Maybe I have just seen too many of these sort of films recently, but there was nothing to offer that gave it a stand out factor, a unique selling point if you will that made it anything beyond a time killer. It speaks volumes for it that one of the best moments was a cheeky little in joke nod to the original 80s film.<br/><br/>Average is all I can say about it, it felt such a let down even though i wasn't as bothered about this as i was other films coming out this year..."

I am an opponent of capital punishment, but I am willing to make an exception for whoever produced this utter crap.

"jacobjankel","2","2","3","14 April 2010"," i laughed at how bad it was
","First of all let me just say this movie was terrible, it made me feel like self expression shouldn't be allowed. Now let me say why:<br/><br/>1.The plot There wasn't one they just went gallivanting everywhere and every so often they came across a monster and just killed it. Then there was this woman who just appeared there every so often not doing anything and giving some 'moral support' and then she got killed and u were supposed to care for some reason, but its fine cause then Zeus brought her back as some apology present for the guy who turned out to be his son so she could stand around and do jack sh*t some more. <br/><br/>2.The characters and acting The main character was a douche and all i heard when he was speaking was I'm from new Zealand I'm from new Zealand thats how pointless what he had to say was. Then there was the messed up tree guy, he was supposed to be some evil guy when we first met him, and beat everyone up, but then suddenly he was part of the gang. And then his only contributions of him groaning weirdly every so often were much appreciated and were the best part of the movie. ANd then the group of humans he wrought with him who were very enthusiastic at the beginning just kept getting beaten up and killed and kept getting outclassed by wood man and these two fat guys who turned up half way through the movie for no reason.<br/><br/>3.Extra comments Basically the whole movie was pointless, but probably worth watching for its extreme badness and like a smart fat kid its fun to laugh at cause it takes itself so seriously.<br/><br/>graphics were alright..."
"greg-1984","4","2","3","13 April 2010"," I just didn't care
","OK my first review here we go. Firstly there were some things I liked about this film; the effects were pretty good and there were one or two bits of humour and there was one character I really liked. Unfortunately I can't remember his name because the film didn't introduce him properly. That's my main problem with this film. The secondary characters were so thinly written they didn't seem like characters more like cannon fodder. I realize that it was Persues's story but still at least give us a scene were we find out more about them. Secondly the monster hunters, they show up a third of the way in have maybe five lines of dialogue don't do anything impressive then leave only to come back for two seconds at the end, these characters served no purpose and their screen time should have been given to the soldiers with names. Thirdly, SPOILER, at the end Zeus rewards Perseus by restoring the woman he (apparently) loves, yet Perseus does not even ask Zeus to bring his family, who took him in when he was an orphan and he loved deeply, back from the dead. My advice either wait for it to come out on DVD or better yet watch the original, it's a bit corny but better written in some parts. P.S this film gained nothing by being in 3D"

"demetrius11","3","2","3","12 April 2010"," Crap Movie Alert
","The costume design of the movie is very good. The ancient Greek armors and props actually look Greek and the Greek Warrior characters look ""damaged"", tired, and original (till they open their mouth and speak ANY line of dialog). The Set design is a good -visually delightful- mix of several civilizations, and even though the locations of the movie do not really look like Greece we let it slide. These are the good elements of the movie.<br/><br/>Other than that... Perseus is a Terminator-like / ex fisherman / Avenger on the war path, who slaughters anything that comes near him, while his comrades ""jump into fire"" for him with no obvious reason. The Perseus character is as shallow as possible, and the script and dialogs hardly give any chance to the actors in general to actually act. There are nice actors in this movie who unfortunately are helpless in the hands of the merciless scriptwriters who doomed them with silly lines a 5 yo could write.<br/><br/>This is a movie based entirely in action scenes and special effects. Unfortunately, the action scenes and special effects are no better than the dialogs. The Medusa character is hardly movie quality 3d (Many games actually have more realistic graphics these days). The Kraken moved from the coasts of Norway and Iceland to the Ancient Greece, but it still did not do much good as most of the time we were watching Perseus chasing a blurry Harpy instead of fighting that poor monster. The lightsaber idea was quite good, as when Perseus was turning on his lightsaber I was thinking of Star Wars and the movie was more bearable. I actually thought he was going to use the Force at some scenes of the movie (but never did to my disappointment). <br/><br/>In general, there are countless scenes that I could comment on but there is point in that. The movie is as bad as they can get, regarding script, dialogs, action and special effects. Other than the Art Direction, there is no reason to pay for this 10 euro in a movie theater. <br/><br/>This is a fun movie, but a huge disappointment too p.s. The ""Slutty"" Io character was a good twist, and we can understand why Perseus dumps ""the love of his life"" (according to the myth) Andromeda, to hook up with herNOT"
"mrcibubur","6","2","3","11 April 2010"," Entertaining enough but not memorable. Slightly disappointing
","This is one of those movies of which I had high expectations as a blockbuster. sorry folks, this is no blockbuster, it is nowhere as good as 300 and the recent Percy Jackson and Lightning Thief scores for me a whole lot better in terms of interpretation of Greeks mythology.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington as Perseus is likable but thats about it. He is no Sean Bean and doesn't deliver a strong enough character performance for me for a 'demi God' and the women throughout are models rather than actresses delivering good lines.<br/><br/>The opening boat scene is intriguing enough but the first let down is seeing the haircut of Perseus on the beach as a child, trying to connect where he was and what he was doing, it didn't wash for me. His taking to the Argos King and Queen and the confrontation inside the Palace was bizarre.<br/><br/>I agree with comments about the Krakken and the Medusa, they could have made more of Medusa and exploited more the real myth of Perseus and Medusa. My 11 year old son liked the film and things like Zeus giving Perseus the coin to enter the Hades underworld (same as in Percy Jackson) was interesting.<br/><br/>I don't say the film wasn't interesting or entertaining and there were some great scenes but I didn't go to see a mix of King Kong meets Lord of the Rings. Too much wizardry for me and the logic of Greek mythology became lost. Too many corny lines, poor lines, too much emphasis on the action without really connecting it to the story.<br/><br/>Certainly not a film to see in 3D."
"yellowporpoise","4","2","3","10 April 2010"," Funny? Action? Characters?
","I know, that many many people invested years into this movie. It took millions of dollars and a lot of time and effort. I am sorry to say, that this film was disappointing. A few funny scenes, sometimes a nice scenery and plenty of opportunities for action, but in the end this movie was a waste of time and money. Most of the special effects were second class and I am glad that I did not invest in the 3D Version. The script was not able to create enough tension to keep me close to the story and again, there was no character I could identify with. I did not care if the hero was successful or not, I was not afraid of Hades or Medusa. Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes are great actors, but they had no chance to look good in this story. Zeus with his curled beard and this twinkling armor was ridiculous and Hades was a lame enemy. The story itself was full of logical gaps and could not rivet my attention.<br/><br/>4 Stars for the investment of time and effort, that I appreciate, but not really a movie the world needed."
"vanishtrail","6","2","3","9 April 2010"," Good Story but Presentation Failure
","The change of story is a definitely fresh choice which is great. The emphasis on more action is definitely fresh as supported by great Visuals.The Plot being switch to Perseus revenge is a great move also. (You cannot follow the same old story) However the movie failed to present itself properly throughout the end with loopholes and unexplained being noticed everywhere.<br/><br/>Still the lack of different type of monsters (e.g the two headed dog, Calibos with his tail, the great Vulture) is the biggest disappointment though the CGI for the scorpions and the Kraken looks great. The flying Cyclops is really wasted the budget efforts as I cannot see their face at all.I really expected more to come from this highly budget movie over the original stop motion movie which makes me begging for more.<br/><br/>There are also not enough invention and ideas to make the plot look meaningful such as the riddle from the original, special powers such as the helmets and the shields.<br/><br/>The appearance of Hades on the mortal world looks silly. (No Gods will appear in their true self before man), Statuttes or material forming his face will be a better choice.<br/><br/>The addition of Io is hampering the direction in the movie because she only knows how to talk. The loss of Bubo role as a sidekick to Perseus also contributes to the unliveliness in the movie. The soldiers accompanying Perseus on the quests still appears feasible and helped to make the quest more interesting.<br/><br/>The witches scene was also unimpressed as I found that the witches had foreseen Perseus is ready to visit them. For the battle of monsters, the action on the scorpion looks great though there presents many loopholes. It is contradicting on what the hunters gives the scorpion's armour as a protective shield while Draco could pierce the top of the scorpion with a spear.<br/><br/>It is strange that Perseus could survive inside the scorpion after there is a great impact when the scorpion rams through the cement structures.<br/><br/>Medusa looks unreal in her face and her secondary appearance which have sharp teeth put her even more unconvincing. Furthermore she does not even look scary at all and it is ridiculous as she moves so fast as though she is riding on a bike.The original with her scary and fearsome appearance create more buzz in such way.<br/><br/>There are many loopholes in her scene however I found that the most important why the charcoal man is ahead of Perseus and ambush Medusa at a certain place where he is not running at all.<br/><br/>The final scene with the Kraken is better than the original though the flying Cyclops is uninteresting themselves is getting on my nerves. <br/><br/>Conclusion the more invention of special powers,more monster, more interesting scenes and less loopholes on the original gives a better edge over this."

Then there is one of the most childish characters ever..the one of Io! She is just into the movie because the hero(and the ppl watching the movie) needed some info about pegasus and other mythological creatures/locations. So what theυ did..is the easiest thing..created a character to explain them. And have a love affair with the main hero..because Andromeda for some reason wasn't the one they needed!

I know now a days black is the new heroic white but growing up I always remember seeing the white horse swoop down to take his drink and that ruined it for me.<br/><br/>Also the downside was, that they really changed too much from the original. Things were taken out that I often cherished in the original like how Calubus put a curse on Agost and the Princess. The two headed dog, and the Vulture chase.<br/><br/>When Bubo the owl had a cameo in the 2010 movie. I was also sadden he was not used in the movie.

"overniteredhead","Null","2","3","6 April 2010"," An Epic Disappointment
","After viewing Clash I can definitely say that I favor the original. First, the writers took an awful lot of liberties when re-writing the script-adding characters while editing out others (the owl). The entire purpose in the original was for Perseus' to save the princess from a horrible fate and win the kingdom as well as the princess' hand in marriage. In the remake, Perseus is completely uninterested in becoming king after saving the princess--unbelievable. For me, the biggest disappointment was actually the 3D. The last time I saw a 3D film was Michael Jackson at Disney World in the early 90's. I was so excited to see a 3D film but found myself taking my glasses off several times to focus on the fuzzy figures during Clash. The 3D was absolutely pointless. I mean, where was the arrow flying or the tip of the sword striking out from the screen into the audience? The 3D just really didn't make any sense to me. I was hoping for a better remake of a classic."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","2","3","5 April 2010"," Too big for it's own good
","So of course I saw Clash of the Titans when I was a little girl, I absolutely adored that movie. It was one of my favorite adventures, it was exciting and just a blast to watch. I haven't watched the movie in many years though, but I had seen the trailer for the remake. I was intrigued, it's not a bad idea to reintroduce the story to a new generation. I didn't even realize how much Titans was considered to be a classic, the director expressed in an interview his love for the story. So I was hearing just alright reviews, but still I decided to see this movie on Easter, I just had to discover for myself wither it would be good or not. So first off, I did see it in the 3D format, which I'm not really getting into, 3D can be a bit too much on the eyes. I understand it's dimension, but I think this is more of a fade vs. making movies just look pretty. I think I would have been just as satisfied watching it in the 2D format, so that's a skip if you want to see this in the theater. Unfortunately though, this movie does go a little Star Wars/Lord of the Rings for my taste and doesn't hold the same charm as the original did for me.<br/><br/>A coffin is seen drifting through the sea before it is rescued by a fisherman, Spyros. When Spyros opens it, he discovers the baby Perseus and his mother, Danaë, inside and raises the boy as his own. Perseus, half god half man as Zeus's son, does not know who his real father and mother are. Years later, Perseus and his family are fishing when they witness a group of soldiers destroying a massive statue of Zeus, effectively declaring war on the gods. Immediately following the fall of the statue, Hades rises from the ocean, killing most of the soldiers and then destroying the boat Perseus and his family are on. The surviving soldiers find Perseus and take him back to Argos. When King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia compare themselves to the gods and compare the beauty of their daughter, Andromeda, to that of Aphrodite, Hades appears again, killing the remaining soldiers. . Hades kills the queen, and demands that Argos further pay for its insolence and vanity; in 10 days, the Kraken will be released, and if the princess Andromeda is not sacrificed, then Argos will be destroyed. Perseus and a group of soldiers go on a journey to get Medusa's head that will destroy the Kraken by turning it into stone.<br/><br/>While I thought the effects were pretty good, there is a scorpion fight scene that was just incredible to watch, the effects didn't make the movie great. The Kraken was a great visual, but the scene fell so flat that it didn't have the splash that the scene should have had. Also one of the most haunting scenes from the original I remember was the Medusa fight, it was one of the most terrifying moments I had ever seen in my childhood. The remake didn't have the same effect as the original, I don't know if it was the set up or the actual Medusa that failed, but the whole scene could have been so much more. Also with Sam Worthington as our lead, I do like this guy over all, but I'm not liking him play the same character over and over again as he has with Terminator Salvation and Avatar. He needs to be a little more diverse. But one thing I did really enjoy with this movie besides some of the good effects was Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson, they look like brothers, they act like brothers as well as they seem like the only one's that took the story seriously and they should have had more screen time. Over all I would say that this movie is a matinée, because it's a special theater experience, UNLESS, you have a blu-ray player, then you can wait for the rental.<br/><br/>6/10"

As a Child I remember watching this movie over and over and each time enjoying it as if it was the first time I had seen it. That is why I was very excited when I heard it was going to be re-made, and although did expect that it would change to make it more relevant to modern times and to appeal to more sophisticated viewers I was not expecting it to change so drastically. This move should not even have this title because it misleads viewers to think it has anything to do with the original, it was so different that it was unrecognizable. Other than keeping the names of the Charraters which they had to for reference nothing is as it should have been. this film does not even maintain the historical references from the original mythical legends.

"xens_pineapple","7","2","3","4 April 2010"," A personal review from a non-bias mind
","This review is seeing the moving, not in 3-D, but merely in a normal theater. Is the best time to write a review immediately after you see a movie? I have not the answer to this, but I will say that this review is coming from someone who has just walked away from the theater with the fresh perspective of ""Clash of the Titans"" (the new version) in his mind (4 April, 2010, 1830). Also to note that this review comes from a male, age 29, who saw the movie first as a young child, and again in his teens. Now that the remake has been created and aired for a new generation, it's only fair to offer a perspective (perhaps in the cliché of 'old vs. new' or just in a recap of how I remembered the original vs. how this new feature holds out. Now, from memory (as I've not seen the original in at least eight years), I recall events as follows: Precious gets first the gifts of the invisible helmet and the sword (of which he then fights and bests the Minotaur who gets his revenge later via the help of his mother (long story, watch the movie)), visits the three witches, touches the 'seeing orb'(which magically gives his cloak the ability to withstand the Medusa's blood), gets the information he needs, kills the Medusa, wraps her head in his now enchanted cloak (to protect from her acidic blood –honestly this PREDATES ALIEN so please do not think they are ripping off ""Alien""); Somewhere in this, the Gods give him another gift, the mechanical owl. The Minotaur then stabs the head (through the cloak while the party sleeps), shedding her blood, creating the giant scorpions, in which he (Precious) fights and defeats. After which, a few more events happen that I think are merely padding the movie; In any case, Precious then gets to the Kraken with the head of Medusa, and petrifies it and thus the movie (more or less) ends and everyone's happy. The new movie: First Precious (as a young man) fights giant scorpions, then denies his father's request to join the gods, (somewhere in there is a small cameo of the mechanical owl, I think merely to please the fans of the original movie because no exposition is given as to 'what it is' or 'why it is' or 'what it's for', and no mention of the invisible helmet), then after a battle against the scorpions, they ride the scorpions (damn I wish I were making this up) to the witches, where he gets the knowledge of how to defeat the Kraken by using Medusa's head. No mention of her blood, and as the scorpions have already been dealt with there is no need for the Minotaur to come back to 'create' them. Well, also in the mess the Pegasus (now black instead of white – yeah just go with it) makes two appearances – first as an 'up yours', secondly as an ""okay you can ride me"". Cue the release of the Kraken, a cliché chase scene (of I think what are supposed to be wraiths or winged demons), the retrieval of the Medusa head, and the destruction of the Kraken and a ""happily ever after"" ending. I don't bash this new movie as much as you might think from my rehash of it (despite its chronological inconsistencies with the first and cameos which have zero point in the movie other than to please fans and the omission of key plot points), I merely state that I am more or less at a neutral stance with the movie. New audiences must have ""CG"" interface and at least a few flashy special effects to fully appreciate a movie these days (or at least it seems, given how Hollywood is staying to this formula) and I am no fool to think that stop-motion animation is in any way superior to today's CG effects (I merely respect the work and time it takes to create stop-motion, and for the time in which it was most prevalent, it was state-of-the-art). All I speak of is that this movie seems to be a ""spring blockbuster"", targeted at new audiences and for a new generation. Do I, particularly, find the movie enjoyable? Yes. Would I re commend it - Depends on who you are. I say it is a good experience and perhaps worth the cost of a ticket, but if you enter the movie bent on a step-by-step comparison of the original, you will be disappointed. Watch the movie for what it is, and you will be pleased, but this movie is a 'stand-alone'. I do not feel it is supposed to be compared to the original. The story's chronology is skewed, and you may question 'what's the point' of certain scenes (if not attempting to at least appease the original fan base). Like it or hate it, but the movie doesn't insult the story ""Clash of the Titans"", it merely is retelling it. Much how history is told two separate ways from two different sources, so can this story be told differently, based on the source material. Of course the entire story is fiction, but if it were 'fact', and you had both telling of the story, you may not know which to believe in its entirety, however you will agree that based on both telling, some events coincide and others are there, merely in a different order. While that won't give you the 'whole' story, at least you will be satisfied in knowing ""these events took place"". Fiction aside, I would say ""see it"", if merely for a fresh, new generation, perspective."

","I went in to see this with low expectations. Most of the reviews were not kind.<br/><br/>But I just wanted a fun, brainless 'popcorn' movie with some cool action scenes.<br/><br/>And that is exactly what I got.<br/><br/>There was only maybe 5 minutes where I was bored. Most of the time I appreciate the mood, sets and plot until the next action piece. And the action pieces were very good.<br/><br/>I am a HUGE fan of stop-motion animation, and love Ray Harryhausen. But I knew this was a cgi-fest and accepted it as such. I actually really liked the improvements to Medusa, and while the other creatures did not have any of the personality of Harryhausen's work (very few CGI creatures do, in my opinion), they were pretty cool and I enjoyed those scenes.<br/><br/>it did feel like a throwback to 1981 and to some of Harryhausen's movies. Which is not necessarily a good thing. Outside of Ray's creatures, the movies were sometimes dull, predictable and the acting mediocre. In many ways, this movie had the same flaws.<br/><br/>But in the end, I enjoyed it and didn't regret seeing it on the big screen. And yeah, I plan on getting the DVD.<br/><br/>I deliberately saw this in 2D based on the reviews I saw. Reviewing the film I really can't see how 3D would make a difference, so unless you have a burning desire to spend extra money I would think the 2D experience is fine.<br/><br/>I didn't go into the plot, because that is covered by other user comments, but there were some nice plot twists over the original and some very nice touches of humor (which works here and did not work very well in the original).<br/><br/>There was something that was lacking however, to make this a great film.

","In one of the scenes of Clash of the Titans, Perseus finds the mechanical owl (one of the landmarks of the original film) and someone says to him: leave it there. Well, to me that's the absolute summary of this motion picture. The CGA is ugly, exaggerated and, worst of all, false. Only Pegasus is a little more convincing, but the scorpions, the djin, the Medusa (with dark breasts in contrast to the pale scales) are very bad. The film as a whole is a mixture of the Lord of the Rings (the clothes, the architecture, the light), with Gladiator (the leather skirts spinning while the soldiers fight) and, in the end, the Kraken that looks like Godzilla. Honestly, I could not see any value in the movie itself. As for Antiquity, not the least attention was paid to myths and how they were constructed: humans could not declare war on the gods (ridiculous), Hades was not perverse (a common modern artifice that owes nothing to the Greek world, which feared the god, but considered him fair. Films may add new elements to th e myths, but the structure of the narratives need to be respected. There is no respect for anything or anyone in those two hours of bad performances, bad script and bad visual effects. In other words, leave it there, it's not worth it."

","This movie is interesting. It diverges far from it's source materiel, and takes a radically different route. It ditches the whole believe and follow your parents faith, and instead toys around with some deeper concepts. Enter Perseus. Perseus has led a hard life, his adoptive family have struggled to catch enough fish to eat, and storms regularly claim people's lives. When Perseus loses his family to a storm, his disappointment for the gods becomes hatred. King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia's army finds him and brings him to their city. There, the populace has become heathens, resenting their gods and defacing the temples and statues that are devoted to them. The queen claims her daughter is prettier and more attractive than the goddess Aphrodite. Zeus's brother, the embodiment of evil and Greek equivalent to Satan, the misanthropic hades, is given permission to spread mayhem with his pet, the kracken,an immense beast with virtually no shortcomings, by Zeus, as punishment for humanity's defiance. However, if Andromeda is fed to the kracken, the monster will become pacified, and refrain from exterminating the human race. Perseus realizes that Zeus is his father, who impregnated a human. His biological mother was killed by her human husband, but not before giving birth to Perseus. Questing across the lands in a bid to find the means to defeat the kracken, Perseus frequently is offered help from his heavenly parent, yet refuses his pity. He much prefers justice and care for his fellow humans, and would rather die among them than live forever in heaven. Throughout his quest, battling many nightmarish creatures, he barely scrapes through, yet never asks for any help from the gods. His morality was above the gods who created him, and their threats and the massacres they carry out on humans never intimidate him into submitting to them. It is only later in the movie does Zeus soften up, and Perseus admit he loves him, but he never allows himself to mould his own morality around Zeus, or depend on him as a guide. Perseus doesn't even need the threat of hell and reward of mount Olympus, or heaven, to dictate who he his. He sticks to his own morality, and aspires to help his fellow humans, whether the gods approve or not. He is even offered advantages from Zeus, that would rise him above the mortal humans, yet he refuses them. This movie definitely paints freethinking in a positive light. Without needing faith, Perseus remained kind, caring, tough, brave, and well-rounded. He still learned to love the gods, and respect them, but never relied on or allowed them to dictate him. Interesting ideas stemmed from this movie. Gods being reliant on, and friendly with the very demon who punishes defiant humans, and the fact gods need prayers to survive, or they die, are not to be overlooked. Religious and atheistic people should definitely gives this one a watch."
"rooprect","Null","1","1","15 May 2016"," An entertaining and action-packed movie, but don't study for your Classical Lit exam with this
","""Clash of the Titans"" (2010) provided everything its cover image and trailer promise, except for the part about authentic Greek Mythology, but if you can get past that you'll have a good time. The draw of the film is fast paced, adrenaline pumping action, a lot of tough guys & gals who never smile, and really cool monsters and special effects for 2010.<br/><br/>It's rated PG-13 for some violence and gore, and there is no sexuality, nudity or profanity (except 1 awesome use of the word b*tch). The ""violence and gore"" is shot very fast, so even though it depicts people being ripped in half & such, it's not quite as disturbing as, say, a Quentin Tarantino film where you watch a guy slowly bleed to death for 15 mins. In other words, this is good stuff to watch with your teenage kids or puritanical parents, either way.<br/><br/>There are some big names on the cast, and all performances were solid, but nothing really stood out as remarkable. That is to be expected in a fast paced film. But I would have preferred a powerful monologue or two just to use the talent to its full potential. I will say Ralph Fiennes did a chillingly original portrayal of ""Hades"", making him to be a twisted, limping, bitter wretch who still possessed terrifying power and fury. He is definitely my favorite part of the production.<br/><br/>Now on to the bad, which others have covered in detail so I'll just graze over. If you think you can study for your Classical Literature exam by watching this, you're going to get flunked all the way back to James Whale's 1931 ""Frankenstein"" (the most successful yet inaccurate adaptation of literature ever). Different characters in mythology seem to have been transposed, juxtaposed and just plain posed for the sake of this 2010 story. The biggest liberty is that here our hero Perseus is fighting against the gods when the original literature shows that he was tremendously helped by the gods by being given special weapons and gifts. In this film he is given those same gifts which he indignantly refuses but then later sheepishly accepts them because they'll save his life. I'm not sure if that was meant to be hypocritical, ironic, or just a sloppy oversight in the screenplay, but it's worth noting. Just what exactly is this film saying below the surface? That humans have outgrown gods? Or that we ultimately still need gods?<br/><br/>But for the most part, this gives us a decent taste of Greek Mythology which was truly the origin of the timeless scifi/fantasy/horror genre thousands of years ago. Chances are, most people will simply enjoy this movie for its action, fantasy and special effects. For that, yes, it delivers. But for literary accuracy... well I would be terrified to approach any literature teacher with the mere mention of this movie. That teacher would kick my Assaracus out of school and I'd be crying all the way Homer."

","Clash of the Titans (2010): Dir: Louis Leterrier / Cast: Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Alexa Davalos, Gemma Arterton: Pure garbage based solely around CGI effects. With that it delivers on its monstrous sea titan the Kraken as well as giant scorpions, the winged Pegasus, and the snake haired Gorgon Medusa who can turn her victims to stone at a glance. What makes the original so much better is its passion for character and story. This film misses out on the whole back story regarding Calibos and his curse regarding Andromeda, as well as the bitterness amongst the gods. Director Louis Leterrier subtracts any dramatic impact of the original for cheap tie in scenes such as the sword in the forest or the Pegasus horses that just happen to be around. The original used great dramatic payoff to produce these elements. Leterrier had better luck when he made The Incredible Hulk. Sam Worthington as Perseus, son of Zeus is a joke. Liam Neeson as Zeus is an even bigger joke showing his perverted authority. Ralph Fiennes as Hades is a laugh. Alexa Davalos as Andromeda just hangs in midair. Watching her take pity on Perseus will make us long for the authority and boldness that Judi Bowker possessed when she performed this role correctly. Gemma Arterton also graces us with her presence and it couldn't be any less welcome than it is when combine with this garbage. The special effects are the norm but even CGI is hardly a replacement when the original had stop motion creativity by Ray Harryhausen that is the stuff of great imaginative imagery. This remake should clash with a fireplace. Score: 1 / 10"

","In 2010 Avatar had become the highest grossing film in history with 3D ticket sales helping the film make over $2 Billion. 3D became all the rage and many films were post-converted into 3D to cash in. But the remake of Clash of the Titans was the first out the blocks and it became the post child for bad 3D post-conversions.<br/><br/>In ancient Greece the Gods are losing their power as humans no longer pray to them and start to rebel against their creators. Hades (Ralph Fiennes) makes a powerplay on Mount Olympus by telling his brother Zeus (Liam Neeson) to make an example of the kingdom of Argos, forcing them to either make a human sacrifice or face destruction from the Kraken. But during Hades' lush for destruction Perseus (Sam Worthington), a demi-God living life as a human, loses his family and ends up promising to help Argos to defeat the Kraken. Perseus goes on a quest to find the weapon to destruction the Kraken with a troop of soldiers, including leader Draco (Mads Mikkelsen) and Io (Gemma Arterton), a woman cursed with immortality.<br/><br/>I have only seen the 2D version of Clash of the Titans (2010), so I can only judge it purely as a film, not for its 3D effects. As a remake of the 1981 version it is inferior. The only improvements are the structure of the film where its narrative was more traditional compared to the original being a series of events, the band of soldiers were better defined and the remake Bubo the owl no more then a cameo.<br/><br/>Director Louis Leterrier came from an action background and he certainly handles action and special effects well enough. The best sequences were when the deformed Calibos (Jason Flemyng) shows up, ripping a man in half and splitting blood (surprisingly violence for a PG-13 film) and the battle with the giant scorpions. Leterrier does know how to stage the sequences, but he did have a tendency to use slo-mo which is his style. He also liked to use overblown CGI sequences, such as when someone throws a coin into the River Styx. Leterrier's eye was also not grand enough for the film he did not success he with the film's setting being more grounded: he is much more suited to modern set stories.<br/><br/>Clash of the Titans embarks on different tones, sometimes it was very serious, other times felt very campy. There were times when it wanted to serious, almost Lord of the Rings likes with its ideas that the Gods needed humans and their relationship to each other and there are dark moments, such as the death of Perseus' family: but the writing wasn't strong enough to back it up. Added to that there were some really bad moments like the origins of Calibos was so cheesy and overblown with him getting stuck by lightning and lifting an idea from Excalibur. And despite the attempts of a serious tone for the most part the film felt the need to add two comic relief hunter characters who felt like they steps out of The Scorpion King.<br/><br/>Whilst the troops had more character then in the original film many of the other characters were unwritten. This is clear with the Gods and Andromeda was barely in the film. Calibos too was much better handled in the original then he was in the remake: it was a waste of Jason Flemyng. Clash of the Titans was also filled with Deus Ex Machinas, such as a race of desert sorcerers known as Djinn who stop and tame the scorpions to the sudden taming of a Pegasus.<br/><br/>The casting was poor. Worthington was given a lot of stick for the role and he was stiff: but he was miscast and the role should have gone to an actor in his early to mid-20s. Many of the other actors like Neeson and Mikkelsen seen to accept their roles for the paycheque and Fiennes was basically playing Lord Voldermort again.<br/><br/>Clash of the Titans was a disappointment because there was potential: it was a film that was in need of a good re-write and flesh out its ideas and characters. I feel there is a place in for films based on Greek mythology due to the vase source material and filmmakers can go from Lord of the Rings style seriousness to a Pirates of the Caribbean like romp. Sadly Clash of the Titans does not fill that void."

","Louis Leterrier's rebooted version of the 1981 cult film 'Clash of the Titans' is one dimensional, inconsistently acted and it's story plods along in comparison to an enormous boulder attached to the end of a truck via a rope, travelling across a rickety road. <br/><br/>On the other hand, for the majority of average citizens, 'Clash of the Titans' is cemented full of stunning CGI imagery and cinematography. The action sequences are on a rapid convener belt which is continuous throughout the duration and there is little time to breath.<br/><br/>As you may have guessed from the above, 'Clash of the Titans' has many positives which are balanced out with an equal amount of negatives. The budget of $125 million certainly polishes the films visual content which cannot be faulted.

However, there is too much of a video-game feel to the film with a paper thin plot, an action overload and a lack of characterisation. <br/><br/>When Perseus (Worthington) realises he is a demi-god, son of Greek God Zeus (Liam Neeson), he is called upon to protect Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) from Hades' (Fiennes) monstrous Kraken.<br/><br/>Following on from the brief synopsis above is an onslaught of action scenarios involving huge, desert scorpions and more of Hades' devastating creatures.<br/><br/>To conclude, 'Clash of the Titans' should fill the gap left on a Friday night/weekend night though I wouldn't expect much more than a dumb but reasonably fun 106 minutes."

"mnpollio","Null","1","1","7 September 2011"," Fertile ground for a remake generates very uneven results
","In the eternal remake mill of Hollywood, it was by no means a bad idea to remake the 1981 action spectacle Clash of the Titans, which was a flawed, but fun epic that functioned as stop-motion special effects legend Ray Harryhausen's last hurrah. It is still fun, but one would need to be blind not to notice that the special effects are showing their age and that a good deal of entertainment stems from watching the cast of aging European acting nobility spouting bad dialog.<br/><br/>This Clash of the Titans keeps the bare bones of the original story with hero Perseus, the son of king of the gods Zeus, pressed into service to lead an expedition to save Princess Andromeda from being sacrificed to the dreaded sea Kraken.<br/><br/>This Clash is neither cheesy nor lacking in big budget effects, but it definitely lacks fun. The adventures of Greek mythology are a treasure trove for filmmakers and they have an entire new generation completely unfamiliar with them, so it seems strange that it is rarely revisited. One can certainly understand the intent of director Louis Letterier and the screenwriters to distance themselves from the potential camp pitfalls of the original and imbue some level of seriousness to the proceedings, I sincerely doubt that the end result should be this listless.<br/><br/>Most of the issues stem from the screenplay. The changes/flourishes they have added to this remake are ill-conceived and seriously hamper being engaged in the film. One of the biggest problems lies in a rather foolish change made in the dynamics of the relationship between Perseus and Andromeda. In the original film, they were romantic foils and Perseus had a definite stake in whether or not Andromeda was spared her fate. In the remake, Perseus (Sam Worthington) and Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) are barely nodding acquaintances. Perseus undergoes the journey largely because he is annoyed with the gods and Andromeda stays behind continuing ministering to the beleaguered citizens of Argos as some sort of Mother Teresa figure. It is a bizarre change which robs the story of any sense of urgency. If the leading man has no particular stake in the outcome, there is something missing.<br/><br/>For a romantic foil, the writers have added a new character named Io (Gemma Arterton), who was cursed by the gods to never age. For some reason, she takes a shine to Perseus and accompanies him on the journey as some kind of consultant. The character is fairly nonsensical and the film really assigns little time for anything that resembles romance, so the infatuation that develops between the characters is fairly mundane.<br/><br/>The protagonists have also changed to some extent. Whereas in the original, Andromeda was to be sacrificed because her vain mother offended the sensibilities of the goddess Thetis, Hades is rather unimaginatively made the villain of the piece. Indeed the goddesses of Olympus, often a force to be reckoned with in their own right, are largely forgotten in this film.<br/><br/>The film is decidedly grittier than the original, completely lacking in the magical visual splendors of its predecessor. It does not even look particularly enticing with many sequences oddly drained of color. It is also lacking in suspense. The sequence in Medusa's lair – a highlight in the original – is strangely missing any element of tension here. And isn't it a bit dumb that everyone except Perseus succumbs on this journey? While there were a number of deaths in the original, the entire party was not annihilated.<br/><br/>While the cheese factor on Mount Olympus has been minimized, it somehow does not seem an improvement. Liam Neeson, who seems be trapped in these roles now, is rather dully cast as Zeus. The only other god of note is Hades, played by a tiresome hissing Ralph Fiennes. <br/><br/>Back on terra firma, the cast does not have it much better. Gemma Arterton is lovely, but her role is ill-defined and ultimately pointless. Jason Flemyng is predictably hammy as the disfigured villain Calibos. Davalos fails to make much impression as Andromeda, who always seems to hover just outside of the action. Any fanboys hoping for a redux of the infamous nude bath sequence from the original with Judi Bowker are destined for disappointment.<br/><br/>There is no question that Sam Worthington – fresh from the success of Avatar – contributes a better performance than Harry Hamlin. Hamlin's pecs and hair seemed to be doing all of the heavy lifting, but Hamlin was also surrounded by a better production. Worthington has the correct physicality and he sure looks nice in a skirt, but the screenplay has turned Perseus into such a one-note dour sort. He only embarks on the quest to thumb his nose at the gods and spends most of the film slapping away any help provided by his father. Defiance seems to be the character's only characteristic, which hogties Worthington acting-wise. With a better screenplay, he may have rocked the part.<br/><br/>In the end this is little more than another missed opportunity. There are a couple of highlights, such as the scorpion battle and the climactic appearance of the Kraken, but these were done better in the original. Similarly, any of the new elements that the filmmakers thought would make things more interesting, more often than not, fall flat. I do like that Pegasus is a sleek black horse rather than the traditional white.<br/><br/>I gather a sequel is in the works. Not necessarily a bad development given that there are so many adventures that can play out from this material, but hopefully the screenwriters have learned some lessons from this effort. A word to the wise – give Worthington's Perseus more than one character trait and a stake in the outcome. And while they're at it, how about giving those goddesses on Olympus something to do as well?"

","The whole look of the film is really good, the amazing CGI and the action was all there. But what was lacking was the believable and emotive characters who we had to watch for an hour and a half. Sam Worthington played this bitter, hard hearted demi God but Sam did not portray his character well, he seemed more like a rebellious and grumpy kid more than a genuine broken man. If this film was in the hands of someone like Peter Jackson this film could have been the next ""Lord of the Rings"" as he would have had taken the time to understand the characters and create a strong plot narrative. But instead some lousy director came along and said forget about the quality of the acting, lets go all out with the CGI effects. Also the silly things is that the accents varied when its meant to be set in Greece: Sam spoke in an Australian accent, Liam Neeson in British and i'm sure there were some USA accents in there which was a stupid mistake to make. But, despite the cringe worthy aspect of the whole film i have to applaud the fact it had no rude or offencive scenes plus there is not foul language of any sort so i guess the fact it was a clean film helped gain 5 stars instead of 4. A great concept which was totally messes up. I wonder what they are going to do with the second one...."
"fashunkween","5","1","1","5 September 2010"," Disappointing
","i was absolutely ecstatic to hear that a new version of clash of the titans was coming out, however after watching it tonight i was pretty disappointed (partly because i missed it on the big screen). The movie was really....underwhelming for lack of a better word. The action sequences were really cool, but in the end it sacrificed depth and character development for action and effects. There was so little character development that when Perseus' ""comrades"" were killed at the hands of Medusa (or the eyes i should say), it really had no impact on the audience, personally i thought that the death of Draco would ""tug on my heart strings"" so to say, but he died before the audience learned enough about him to form an attachment. Also, as with most movies like this one, there were a lot of informational errors. One example of this is the character Io. I know it is just a movie, but the character of Io was such a deviation from the mythological figure that she might as well have had a different name, there was no real point in making her Io. Io was actually a lover of Zeus and Perseus ends up with Andromeda, not Io. Basically, the movie was entertaining but very forgettable. If it had been a bit longer and had taken more time for character and plot development it could have been great! Oh well :["
"TxMike","Null","1","1","3 September 2010"," Action-packed telling of the story of the ancient gods.
","I seem to remember that this is a remake of an older movie, but I don't recall seeing the older movie, so my enjoyment and comments here stand on their own.<br/><br/>I never paid too much attention to the ancient gods, and we must assume they are fiction, mustn't we? So as a fictional story, it presents itself quite nicely.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Zeus who is the most powerful god has banished his brother, Hades, to the underworld. Where Zeus is served by the good in the world, Hades is served by the evil. We see them in their domain, which looks like a very fancy courtyard, but they are standing over a miniature world with mountains and clouds, representing the real world below them.<br/><br/>But Zeus some 20-odd years ago fathered a son with the wife of a king, and in the move we see him as grown up Sam Worthington as Perseus, a demi-god. Hades has tricked Zeus and now threatens to destroy a city unless they offer up a young woman in sacrifice. So the task of Perseus is to lead a journey to defeat Hades and his minions to save both the virgin and the city. The route requires that he enter the lair of Medusa and defeat her, sever her head and bring it to battle.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is Zeus, Ralph Fiennes is Hades. How much ""acting"" do you really need? <br/><br/>The movie is enjoyable as action entertainment, but other than that mostly forgettable."
"Hitchcoc","5","1","1","30 August 2010"," It Does Have Some Cool Scorpions!
","All the joy I had in the hokey first film, disappeared as I watched this plodding, endless remake. There is no suspense, no justification, and the myth itself is pretty much ignored and changed around. There are characters that never existed. It seems that for twenty minutes they battle giant scorpions that later become their camels. The acting is dull. There is no human story. The Kraken is boring. We also have a brother fight between Zeus and Hades where Hades tricks his brother and the big Z has to go along with his wishes. All in all, by the time it was over there was no surprise, no tension, and no satisfaction. And what about Andromeda? Anyway, another time where Hollywood couldn't come up with anything new, so they decided to make this snorer."
"alexart-1","6","1","1","21 August 2010"," Forget the Titans
","Ray Harryhausen would have been rolling in his grave. The special effects in the update of Clash of the Titans are entirely done by computer. Quite obviously, a lot has changed since the 1981 version, some for the better but most for the worse. The new Clash of the Titans is enjoyable at times, but most of the time, it is boring and tiresome. Some of the action sequences are cool, but these sequences cannot make one forget the horrible acting and silly script.<br/><br/>The remake of Clash of the Titans follows a similar plot to the original. In ancient Greece, the people have turned against the gods. Zeus (Liam Neeson) is extremely mad and decides to punish the people of Greece. When Zeus vows to kill Andromeda, the beautiful princess, the people assemble a group of warriors to fight back before Andromeda dies. Perseus (Sam Worthington), a demigod who also happens to be the son of Zeus, is chosen as one of these warriors.<br/><br/>The movie's uneven pacing is responsible for why it is so boring sometimes. The movie trudges along for the first 45 minutes, in which barely anything happens. But after it is done being slow and eventless, the plot ends up moving too fast, skipping most of the good parts. The action sequences are, for the most, part slick and fun to watch, but unfortunately, there are only three of them. All of this can be attributed to a bad script that makes no sense and forces the actors to spew sentences that sound strange and unbelievable. On top of all this, the acting is terrible, which makes the delivery of these lines even harder to like. Sam Worthington's dull acting lends no help to the movie's problems or the audience's interest. But an acceptable performance from Liam Neeson is not horrible to watch.<br/><br/>The film's other main problem is that it takes itself way too seriously. The old 80's version felt hokey and fun, while this one wants to be good so desperately that it constantly trips over its own feet. At least the old film has not been completely forgotten. Fans of the old version will be pleased to see Bubo, the mechanical owl, making a brief appearance. Louis Leterrier's clever placement of allusions to the 80's version let me appreciate the film a little more because it showed that the film was not only a remake, but a homage at heart. Still, the older version remains far superior.<br/><br/>3-D cannot save this film. Clash of the Titans is somewhat fun, but mostly forgettable due to a poor script, B-movie style acting, and a lack of action. Although Leterrier has left a few hints that he still cares about the original, the movie is too serious and not hokey enough. Even with 3-D, the film still feels dimensionless and contrived most of the time."
"jhpstrydom","7","1","1","31 July 2010"," Worth seeing as an action adventure, nothing more.
","This film may not be completely accurate when it comes to Greek mythology but this film does deliver if you want an enjoyable epic action adventure with better than average CG effects and action scenes that are fun to watch.<br/><br/>The storyline is pretty straight forward, it has a reasonable amount of character development as well as great performances from the leading and supporting cast, the direction by Louis Leterrier (THE INCREDIBLE HULK & TRANSPORTER 2) is not completely rock solid but it is well done nonetheless.<br/><br/>Overall, to me this was fun as an action adventure but if you're looking for something that is accurate in terms of Greek mythology this is not the film for you, also I only saw the 2D version so my opinion about this film's effects might differ a bit from others."

","OK, so I saw the original version when I was in high school for a project. I loved it being a big fan of mythology. Yes, the original is ALWAYS going to better. Whenever there is a remake of any movie or a remake of a book the original always takes it. Thats something thats common.<br/><br/>Although I don't see why a lot of negative comments about the film. For anyone who doesn't really know much about mythology, its a good movie for them to watch and actually be able to understand the story line. <br/><br/>I honestly loved it. Its not everyday you get this kind of film. I thought it was great and loved the special effects. Im sad I didn't get to see it in 3D. But I def have the DVD now."
"jdkraus","3","1","1","26 May 2010"," Release the CGI, because that's all there is!
","Years ago, I took a mythology class. We went over in-depth the different gods, goddesses, and heroes. I have probably heard of all the Greek mythical tales, but not of Perseus. I was thinking this would be a treat, as I am a lover of mythology, but the negative reviews pushed me away from seeing it on the big screen. I found it online. I'll be honest, I'm glad I did not spend seven dollars or more to see it.<br/><br/>This movie has run into the same issue as many Hollywood films do, effects over story. I should take it for a grain salt, since I had no idea what the myth is about, but even in the story itself, there were little plot holes that just made me chuckle. I won't bother even mentioning them, for I could write a several-paged essay on them. <br/><br/>The other let down was the acting. Thoroughly impressed by Sam Worthington's role in Avatar, I thought he would be a good lead. But in this he was dry, uneventful, and even at a point of where he was supposed to express great emotion, I found myself laughing instead of being moved.<br/><br/>The only actors who seemed to have fun with this movie were Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades. Yet still, Neeson was dry and Fiennes, who pulls off an eerie, raspy voice is almost unintelligent in his dialog. On top of that, the 96 minute film also felt slow. But the one thing the filmmakers put their moneys worth, was in the effects. The ten-minute sequence involving the Kraken is shear brilliance, and so are the other creatures in the film. I will note that the encounter with Medusa was not as creepy as I later saw in the 1981 version of ""Clash of the Titans."" Yes to effects, no to substance. I was at least entertained for the time I devoted to this film, but memorable, not really.<br/><br/>**/****"
"Bunuel1976","6","1","1","25 May 2010"," CLASH OF THE TITANS (Louis Leterrier, 2010) **1/2
","When I first heard about this one, I was not enthused – not just in view of Hollywood's lamentable obsession with remakes (and it no longer even matters whether the original was successful, or for that matter any good, to begin with!) but also because the 1981 film had been partly shot over here in Malta and had been among my very first trips to the cinema! <br/><br/>In retrospect, the result is more or less the equal but certainly not preferable to it – especially when pitting the earlier version's charming stop-motion technique vs. today's over-reliance on CGI; for all the progress in the art of visual effects, nothing they came up with here can be compared with Ray Harryhausen's still-amazing creatures from the original: especially lacking in this regard are the none-too-scary Medusa and the absurdly ALIEN-like Kraken dispatched in no time at all during the climax! <br/><br/>Sam Worthington in the lead role of Perseus comes across as appropriately stoic but still miscast, given that his mannerisms are all-too-modern! Liam Neeson, then, is imposing as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes a menacing Hades (though some of the latter's over-the-top antics brought to mind those cheesy effects-laden flops from my childhood days – namely BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, HOWARD THE DUCK and THE GOLDEN CHILD {all 1986})!; incidentally, watching this, I completely forgot these two actors had already appeared together in SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993).<br/><br/>The new CLASH OF THE TITANS is oddly compact (running 12 minutes shorter than the 1981 film), so that it then ends up feeling somewhat undernourished as a narrative! For one thing, I did not approve of the various plot changes: why should Hades (who does not even figure in the original) hold dominion over the Kraken when it is a creature of the seas, hence Poseidon's territory (played here by a barely-glimpsed Danny Huston – which goes for the other Olympian gods as well)?! Similarly, Calibos' role is diminished in favor of Hades (not to mention, sporting a far less terrifying guise than Neil McCarthy's in the original) and, in the same vein, Perseus gets a fellow demi-goddess for a lover (Gemma Arterton as new character Io rather than Princess Andromeda – again, greatly undermining the latter's stature and Perseus' interest in his quest to begin with!). Yet another novelty is the Gill Man-like creature(s) Perseus & Co. meet in the desert: with this and the tamed giant scorpions, one has almost begun to perilously tread ""Star Wars"" terrain! And what to make of the hysterics of that insufferable high priest, inciting the people to human sacrifice in order to placate the wrath of the gods?! <br/><br/>Mind you the film is more than adequate entertainment for the duration (with reasonable action sequences and a surprisingly good sense of a devastated world) but it is also not particularly memorable or rewarding – unlike the earlier version which, furthermore boasted a majestic music score that finds no equal here. In this respect, it is telling that the only previous effort I had watched from director Leterrier was the likewise unoriginal (if slightly better) THE INCREDIBLE HULK (2008)"
"MaxBorg89","6","1","1","18 May 2010"," Dumb fun, but not enough
","On paper, Clash of the Titans was a good idea for a remake, since the original, while fondly remembered, hardly qualifies as a classic, with its uneven acting (notably male lead Harry Hamlin) and dated - though still quite impressive - visual effects. Throw in a director who knows how to do action (Louis Leterrier), some classy supporting actors for the divine parts (Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, last seen together in a totally different film, Schindler's List), and the new superstar of the decade (Sam Worthington), and you've got all the right ingredients for a fun romp. Unfortunately, the new version, while good in parts, fails to deliver as an overall viewing experience.<br/><br/>Surprisingly enough for a remake, the script sticks quite close to the original: Perseus (Worthington), a demigod, has to face numerous perils in order to save princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) and prevent an all-out war between gods and men. What's new is a more epic approach to the story, with a focus on the rivalry between Zeus (Neeson) and Hades (Fiennes), and a bizarre ""romantic"" twist, with the mysterious Io (Gemma Arterton) replacing Perseus' elderly mentor (Burgess Meredith) from the first film.<br/><br/>In theory, there would be no need to bicker about the plot: Clash of the Titans is meant to be nothing more than sheer, dumb fun, and anyone with a true passion for Greek mythology might want to look away from blatant alterations to the myths (see the whole story about Perseus' birth) and borrowings from other cultures (the Djinn and, of course, the Kraken, recently brought back by the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise). However, whereas Desmond Davis' 1981 take on the story truly opted for sheer fun, the 2010 update stumbles into a few logical pratfalls (Zeus' behavior is a bit schizophrenic in the last act), chunks of appalling ""contemporary"" dialogue (the protagonist's warning about Medusa: ""Don't look this b*tch in the eye!""), a pointless cameo by the infamous mechanical owl Bubo and a plain ridiculous epilogue that - rumor has it - was added at the last minute to leave the road open for potential sequels (what a surprise...).<br/><br/>Another major problem is the ""big"" new contribution: 3D. Having seen both versions, it is safe to say the three-dimensional Clash is a rather unappealing sight. This is because, unlike Avatar or Coraline, which were conceived and filmed in 3D from the start, and made an intelligent use of the technology, Clash of the Titans was shot in 2D and subsequently ""converted"" to the new format in the wake of Avatar's huge business (the fact that Worthington stars in both pictures may also have been a factor). The result is a movie whose action scenes, which are edited very quickly, become unintelligible in 3D, which takes most of the fun out of it (also, slow motion looks awful with the added dimension). With the exception of a couple of scenes, namely those that were fixed in post-production to begin with, the experience is a pretty negative one.<br/><br/>However, there are still a few things to enjoy: with the 3D out of the equation, Leterrier deserves credit for nailing all the huge sequences - Scorpioks, Medusa, Kraken - with a subtle use of CGI that sort of pays tribute to Ray Harryhausen's original work. Additionally, the cast does a more than passable job, although the wide array of accents on display (Australian for Perseus, Irish for Zeus, unspecified for Draco and English for everyone else) is a bit baffling at times. As expected, Neeson and Fiennes are the best of the bunch, with the kind of gravitas only British actors seem to possess in this kind of production, while Worthington delivers a committed but not entirely charismatic performance, occasionally coming off as a bad Russell Crowe clone. It is also worth wondering why the filmmakers bothered to cast relatively famous actors for throwaway parts: Danny Huston (Poseidon) and Polly Walker (in a role reminiscent of her Rome character) are wasted, while Alexander Siddig's appearance is so brief even die-hard Star Trek fans could have trouble spotting him (that's what happened to me, anyway).<br/><br/>Overall, the new, ""improved"" Clash of the Titans provides some excitement but generally disappoints, compared to other blockbusters of recent memory. Best stick with the original: it may have aged a bit, but the fun factor remains unaltered."
"insomniac_rod","6","1","1","8 May 2010"," Solid popcorn fun. But Doesn't makes you feel powerful.
","I remember in 2009 when I first watched the poster for this remake. I was so excited as the original ""Clash of the Titans"" is one of my favorite movies. ""It makes me feel powerful"" anytime I watch it.<br/><br/>I love Greek-Roman mythology, action, sci-fi, etc. The remake didn't live up to the expectations.<br/><br/>Sure, it features the always working on-screen team sub-plot that should please the audience. Sure, we have likable characters like Perseus and Io. Sure, there are some intense action moments such the first encounter with evil Acrisius, the visit to the evil witches, and the fight against Medusa.<br/><br/>But, is the movie any good? The answer should be ""not that much"". This remake is 100% popcorn fun. It didn't pay attention to plot devices, character development, make a bonding between the main characters and the audience. It only focused on the f/x and CGI.<br/><br/>The main problem with the movie is the lack of heart. I mean, you don't care that much for ""Perseu's party"". The Medusa sequence had to be much more scary like in the original! Here, Medusa wasn't even cool looking. The Kraken climax wasn't that exciting and the sub-plots weren't that interesting.<br/><br/>You just see Perseus and co. suddenly starting a mission against Zeus's will. That's it. So we only have to be prepared for the Kraken.<br/><br/>On the positive side, I have to mention that the atmosphere, art direction, and cinematography is excellent. Medusa's lair was nightmarish and cool. The action was pretty good most of the time. I enjoyed the necessary amount of violence, gore, and exciting chasing (Perseus running after Acrisius was neat!).<br/><br/>Some one liners were funny and gave a fresh feeling to the movie. Perseus motivational speech before reaching to Medusa's place was cool and prepared the audience for an exciting climax. I liked how he referred to the Dijin as ""whatever the hell you are"".<br/><br/>Sam Worthington is a likable lead and I bought his part although I felt he was too much Jake Sully. Liam Neeson is always great. Gemma Arterton is extremely beautiful, sexy, I couldn't stop watching her. Alexa Davalos looked like Megan Fox when the Kraken was about to eat her. Ralph Fiennes did what he had to.<br/><br/>The direction is dynamic. No problems with it. The score is great. I really appreciated the action theme. The f/x are extremely well done but I think they could do so much better with the Kraken. And the now infamous (for cheesy) ""release the Kraken!"" line demonstrates the real feeling of the movie.<br/><br/>It would be unfair to compare this one with the original because the 1981 epic masterpiece is flawless. Sure, it has aged but I prefer it anytime than the remake.<br/><br/>Sometimes, low budget made with a heart is more efficient than blockbuster films.<br/><br/>P.S. When I saw the robot owl I almost cry. It was a very nostalgic moment. Probably the best in the movie."

"MetalAngel","6","1","1","5 May 2010"," Entertaining but unexceptional.
","I remember my fifth grade English teacher making us read Padriac Colum's ""The Golden Fleece"", a long children's novel about Perseus, the sorceress Medea (the love of his life) and their adventures around the world, hunting for titans, monsters and defying the Gods. I remember this clearly, for she warned us that when we got to Mythology in our advanced English classes in college we were sure to flunk lest we learned our mythology right then and there, ""and what better way to do so than through this extraordinary introduction to the subject?"" I've always been a literature fan, and I love doing my research correctly. Back then, my research amounted to having my mom taking me to the Cineplex to watch Disney's ""Hercules"". She took me on a weekend, and I remember returning to school on Monday anxious to inform the teacher and my classmates that Colum was wrong, because Disney didn't depict the mythological gods and heroes like he said. My teacher, bless her, set me straight and explained to me how films will never resemble the book, and how the book, in turn, will differ in many points from what Mythology scholars would say.<br/><br/>That was 1997. I've never taken a single course of Mythological Literature since, but it was a surprise to go to the Cineplex again to watch Louis Leterrier's ""Clash of the Titans"" and find that it didn't differ much from the portrait of Mythology our English teacher had painted for us back in 1997. The story is very much the same as I remembered it: Perseus, son of Zeus and a human woman, is seeking revenge from Hades for killing his Earthly parents, and is traveling with a bunch of soldiers from Argon to the ends of the world, seeking a way to stop Hades' Kraken from destroying Argon and trying to come to terms with his being a demi-god and his falling in love with the demi-goddess Io (not Medea, as my book would have it).<br/><br/>There are three quite notable differences from film to Mythology, though: a) the characters' beards are wildly long and unkempt (I wanna say 'Neanderthal') unlike the clean-shaven heroes I saw in my book, b) their costumes don't fit into the preconception I had of Greek apparel; rather, the people are dressed in battle-wear and silk robes that scream ""The Passion of the Christ meets Frank Miller's 300"", and c) there was no Kraken in any part of the Mythology that was taught me; I remember a Leviathan in The Bible and a Kraken in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", but no more.<br/><br/>Then again, I had to constantly remind myself that this is Hollywood we're talking about, and no amount of unshaven Neanderthals in Greek armor can deter the main hero from being an Adonis, clean-shaven, perfectly-built and bearer of a modern port, handsomeness and demeanor which teenage girls would melt over. So, according to the Hollywood standards, casting Sam Worthington as Perseus is nothing short of infallible. Then there's the casting of Ralph Fiennes as Hades, God of the Underworld...and no, he's not dressed in a smoky dark tunic or has no blue flames as hair (like Disney would have you believe), but looks rather like Genghis Khan with ethereal fiery wings. Talk about imagination. Then there's Liam Neeson as Zeus, God of Lightning; his shining armor almost blinds the viewer and I was sure he'd join King Arthur any moment, brandishing his shiny sword around and having his braided and flea-infested beard flying behind him...but I digress.<br/><br/>I guess I made my point about the costume design. Yes, they went too far and yes, it doesn't even look remotely Greek, but that can all be forgiven because of the imagination that went behind the design of the titans and demons Perseus and the Argonauts fight against. You'll find yourself in awe at the serpentine Gorgon, the stone scorpions, the Eyeless Fates, Pegasus, and even the non-mythological Kraken, who looks simply awesome.<br/><br/>The plot is predictable, whether you know your mythology or not, but one doesn't see ""Clash of the Titans"" because of its plot, but because of the action scenes, and it DOES deliver at that. Action scene after action scene leave you awestruck, even if the so-called drama and seedily clichéd dialogue attempt to destroy them whenever the battles stop for a breather and we're left with the characters simply staring and talking at each other à la Transformers Two. But to be sure, ""Titans"" is your usual Hollywood action flick that bases its success on the special effects and a pair of steaming hot leading actors; the difference between ""Titans"" and any other commercial money-milker, though, is that this one actually entertains the audience and pumps you up.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a heavily flawed film. Yes, it's not the best film of the year. But it IS a great time at the movies and it IS guaranteed to entertain. Rating: 2 stars and a half out of 4!"

","I was pretty hyped when I came across a trailer for this movie on you tube, it looked promising, it offered really great special effects. So when the day of theatrical release finally came and after watching through the movie, here's what I think of it: <br/><br/>Firstly I'll start off with the good things of this movie. I really liked the action scenes, although the showdown between Perseus and Hades ticked me off, but my point is the action scenes were a fun watch. I also liked some of the humorous scenes it was pretty well timed and lightened up the atmosphere of the film. The cinematography was really good too, I liked how they shot the really good scenery and view, it gives the film a pretty epic touch to it.<br/><br/>The bad things about this movie, now where do I start? Poor character development, we've got the main character, Perseus (portrayed by Sam Worthington), a half-man half-god whose adopted family was killed by Hades and now he seeks revenge by joining King Cepheus' soldiers in a battle against Hades. I personally think that Perseus wasn't given enough depth and complexity so that viewers can enjoy and care about his character, not that I'm saying Sam Worthington did a poor job though, but it's just that the script wasn't well written, which brings me to my next point.<br/><br/>Weak plot development, although it had a lot of potential, the story felt rushed and it was pretty shallow. Because this movie, for me, indulged too much on the flashy special effects and as a result, compromised a good plot.<br/><br/>Good main characters would not be complete without good supporting characters, and unfortunately this was what the movie lacked too. They were pretty forgettable, and I will just talk about two of them: Io (Gemma Arterton) and Zeus (Liam Neeson). Io, is a woman who is cursed with agelessness, and throughout the film, she acts as a mentor and, possibly, love interest of Perseus. The mentor and student relationship between these two characters wasn't given enough development to make it convincing. Then there's Zeus, Perseus' real father. For a god, he acts like a whiny kid who, for the entire course of the movie, just complains about how humans are not expressing enough love and devotion to him and his fellow gods, and he just isn't likable as a character overall.<br/><br/>The villains also didn't have the proper treatment in this movie too, because, for me, they were not very intimidating and didn't have enough qualities for viewers to care about as a villain.<br/><br/>So that sums up my review of this movie, and I heard from rumors that they are planning to make a Clash of the Titans trilogy, well if that's true, I just hope that the filmmakers will realize the mistakes they did with this movie and improve on them.<br/><br/>My final thoughts: if you're looking for an in-depth epic fantasy film such as Lord of the Rings, this ain't the movie for you. But if you're just looking for a fantasy/adventure flick just to kill time and for entertainment, this is the movie for you."

","Clash of the Titans, starring new Hollywood wonder boy Sam Worthington, is not a bad movie. In fact it is great fun - fast-paced and ambitious.<br/><br/>But therein also lay its weakness. Running in around 1 hr 45 min Clash of the Titans never takes the time to build characters or delve into the mysticism surrounding for instance The Stygian Witches or the frightening Medusa. It becomes a classic example of the sacrifice movies relying heavily on CGI has to make nowadays, where the characters rush from one scene and location to another.<br/><br/>2D, 3D or not - Clash of the Titans could have been a massive movie beyond what the title would suggest, but instead ends up as yet another expensive blockbuster-tailored Hollywood flick lacking in suspense and imagination."

","As a child, the original Clash of the Titans was one of my favorite monster movies. I still have a nostalgia for watching it periodically today.<br/><br/>The majority of people going to see this movie want to watch humans battle realistic looking monsters. However, this film attempts to complicate the original story with a subplot about ancient gods needing prayers and fear for their own immortality. An additional subplot about the hero rejecting his demigod status and therefore refusing help from his father was also added. This just bogged down what should be a straightforward excuse for showing realistic looking monsters on the big screen.<br/><br/>The CGI beasts were much more impressive than in the original. However, the action sequences were shot too close and too fast to allow the viewer to have a good understanding of what was happening.<br/><br/>Unlike Jurassic Park and The Lord of the Rings, most monster movies fail to transcend visual candy. That is fine. Sometimes a mindless monster movie is a visual masterpiece that hits the spot. I could not tell you the plot of a single Godzilla movie. This film attempted to complicate the plot and transcend its monster movie status instead of just sticking with a basic story. The result is a movie that is partial eye candy and an attempt at plot depth, both of which were incomplete and left me unsatisfied."

","Thiz movie is a remake from the original version in 1981 which was still using stop motion techniques. Now on CGI era, ""Clash of The Titans"" is resurrected back to live. Perseus used to play by Harry Hamlin, now is replaced by Sam Worthington. The Director is Louis Leterrier, the creator of ""The Transporter"" (2002) and ""Incredible Hulk"" (2008). I note that there are three mega actions which are giant scorpion battle, Medusa hunt and the unleashed kraken scene. The Special Effects work just fine. But for the close up fight scenes, the camera doesn't seem to focus and too fast, we even don't know what is really going on. The dialogue is a little bit lame and lack of interlude humor. The two opposite titans, the heaven king Zeus and the dark lord Hades are played very well by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. However, I like the Gods gathering at Mount Olympus as shown in thiz film. It is better and way beyond of what we have seen previously in ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief"" (2010) which is also based on Greek mythology. My school teacher used to say, ""Sometimes what we saw in movie-trailer is what we saw in entire movie"". It really happens to thiz film. It's not the best of Worthington, comparing to his latest performances in ""Terminator Salvation"" (2009) and the ground-breaking ""Avatar"" (2009).

","I have just seen Clash of the Titans (a movie with the mention of Titans in the movie once but no Titan ever appears). I went into with full expectations of a bad story and a lot of CGI action. I must say I even got disappointed on this. Not that the CGI is bad, not at all it is very good. This is what made me change my original vote of 1 to a 4. But there is just way way too little of it. They should have cut out all the talking and non fighting scenes and the movie would have been better. The rest of the story is either 100% predictable or 100% illogic. Perseus is very well played so is Hades. It is nice to see them act. Zeus is such a pathetic role not even the best actor on this planet could make something out of it. But anyway for the first half an hour or so there is hardly any significant action just Hades as several winged creatures killing a few guys and the family of Perseus. But this is maybe for 3 minutes and then it is already over. I have also seen in the IMDb reviews that this movie had best ratings from women aging under 18. This is most probably due to the fact that Perseus actor Sam Worthington runs around in a skirt. But for me as over 20 male there was way too little action, too confusing story and women too dressed up (I was so disappointed when they met Hydra in a snake body but still wearing a bikini top why if nobody can look at her anyway??? and i wonder where she got it from). Then Zeus seems to be helping Perseus all time but at the same time is working with Hades this is just so weird. Then several Pegasus' appear the Djins, in all honesty I was asking my friend ""Did you see Lassie? I am sure she will come too as she always come in the right moment."" This is how bizarre the logic is. All in all I would say if they would have tried to keep some basic logic and 50% more fights this movie could have gotten a 7 in rating. Never more but at least that. p.s. If you got confused during the reading of this it is because of the movie. Severely illogic."

","Contrary to what a few have said I do think that this is a fantastic action movie. The opening scenes with the description of the Titans and gods is spine tingling. The scenes of Olympus are magnificent and any movie dealing with the Greek myths has the potential to be simply mind-blowing.<br/><br/>Bizarrely, however, the script writers and/or director decided to turn it into man vs the gods and gave it an unworkable post-modern twist. These gods who brought down the Titans, built worlds and have vast powers can be weakened if people don't pray to them???!!! Had someone read Terry Pratchett? It doesn't even fit. It was frankly a ludicrous angle to have brought into a movie on Greek mythology. It weakened the story terribly as Perseus became a whining brat who wouldn't use Zeus' gifts and kept saying he would succeed as a man when he is patently a demi-god and therefore could not and would not ever be just a man. Are we really expected to believe that a puny band of humans could defeat the gods of Olympus? And why would they wish to? In Greek mythology Helios was the sun crossing the sky every day - spit in his eye and the sun doesn't rise. In a vain attempt to make humans appear supremely noble and good there are no really bad people in it. This, again, weakens the plot. Even toward the end of the movie Calibos tells Perseus not to be like the gods....so be like Calibos? Murder your wife and attempt to murder a baby? Really? Instead of creating in-depth characters and a strong storyline with layers we were irritatingly lectured on post-modern humanism in a movie based on Greek mythology and truthfully it doesn't work. And so a movie that could have matched some of the greatest fantasy movies slips into mediocrity."

","I really liked this version of Clash of the Titans. I did see the older movie years ago. I don't think it matters if either followed the mythology accurately. I do know there are various versions of the myth concerning Perseus but he is indeed the one who slays and gets the head of the Medusa with the aid of Athena and a few others. I could go on and on about the differences with the mythology. There is a beast that Poseidon lets loose which has another name and is not a Titan. Nor is a Kraken a Titan but a familiar sea creature I believe from Norse mythology. The thing that matters here is whether the movie was entertaining. I thought it was and I really like the movie. I know there are goofs listed but the movie moves so quickly it is not noticed by the average person. I thought Sam Worthington did a great job in his part.<br/><br/>It followed similarly to the first movie but had Hades involved with the Kraken and I thought it interesting that they tamed the scorpions to ride with the addition of Djinn which are out of another mythology. I liked the additions because it made the movie entertaining and unique. I would recommend it if you are a person who doesn't worry about the accuracy of the mythology involved and likes a good old fashioned action adventure, a man on a quest to save the day."

Io, according to the movie, rebuffed the advances of an unknown god and was cursed with immortality.<br/><br/>Perseus (Sam Worthington) is the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Danae (Tine Stapelfeldt). Danae was tricked by Zeus as he was disguised as Danae's husband, Calibos (Jason Flemyng). Calibos is enraged that his wife is impregnated by Zeus and kills Danae and her child... well he tries to kill the child. Perseus survives. Calibos is hit with a lightning bolt as he attempts to toss Danae's casket into the sea. The lightning bolt disfigures him.<br/><br/>I know I say this a lot, and I mean it a lot, I really like this movie. Although, the creative license that the writers have utilized in creating Clash of the Titans has been pretty extreme. Don't believe me. Look up Io or Perseus or any of the other characters online. The way their lives are depicted in Clash of the Titans is pretty different than what the ancient Greeks believed. Fortunately for the writers, these characters are made up... so they can use as much creative license as they was in order to make the kind of movie they want.<br/><br/>I liked a lot of the fighting scenes. Especially the scene when Perseus and his fellow travelers are fighting Medusa. Perseus is successful in chopping her head off which was his mission to begin with. However, it cost him his companions... including Io, who he had begun to fall in love with. And the bitch of it was... she loved him also.<br/><br/>Because I love mythology and everything that goes along with it I loved this movie.

"lukalele","3","3","6","13 July 2010"," Trash of the Titans
","Leaving aside the mythological inaccuracies of the film, which for any fan of Greek mythology is understandable, or the fact that it's a remake, this was still disappointing. The original definitely did the actual story of Perseus more justice, had way more character development and a better storyline.<br/><br/>Nothing more than a hack-and-slash action flick, further to the complete lack of any character development the stab at romance falls really flat. Don't expect to garner much emotion for any of the characters or for the storyline itself. The first film's story where Perseus' actions were driven by his love for Andromeda worked a lot better and was more fitting to the mythology. Why they changed it into a strange story of revenge, I really can't fathom. Perseus and Andromeda barely talk to each other in this version, and the Kraken in this film seems to be more an excuse to show off lavish CGI than anything else, and I didn't like the way it was done. You know it's going to finally show up at the end, it makes its way to the city almost instantly once it's released and then proceeds to writhe around in the water for ages conveniently waiting for Perseus as he sets himself set up to kill it. It was supposed to be suspenseful, but wasn't in the slightest. It just went too long, and for some reason it left me feeling sorry for the Kraken.<br/><br/>Also, in the midst of the Kraken attack why did the annoying preacher guy stab and kill the king when all he did was express anguish that his daughter was strung up as a sacrifice? That was very strange and random. He was already annoying, no need to create another reason for us to hate him even more.<br/><br/>Why did they bother with the 2 minute 'training' scene? That was also random and really reeked of being just thrown in. It had no point and didn't serve to show us anything we didn't assume or know already.<br/><br/>Add to this a painful comic relief axe-wielding blatant Gimli ripoff and his equally annoying friend, who leave halfway through much to my delight because things are getting too serious for them, only to have them appear in the midst of the climax in a horribly gratuitous act of formulaic 'heroism' we've seen dozens of times before, which never really works any more and as a result worked even less here. Their bit at the climax was probably the most annoying thing I saw in the film. It left me literally shaking my head and made me want to switch off right there.<br/><br/>The film ended with a blatantly obvious lead-in to a sequel, where Liam basically says to Sam word for word 'the bad guy's gone now, but he'll definitely be back and madder than ever' and that was it. I was left with an overall feeling of dissatisfaction as the credits rolled, and a sense that the whole thing felt way too rushed.<br/><br/>On the acting front, there's nothing to really mention. They all do their job, I guess. Mads and Liam stand out as the talent. I can't help thinking that all Sam Worthington was trying to do was a bad impression of Russell Crowe in Gladiator. He'll never have that same intensity, so don't even try. Continuing on the impression front, Ralph Fiennes seemed to be doing an equally bad one of his much scarier looking/sounding/acting Lord Voldemort. He definitely wasn't taking his role in this film as seriously, and it showed.<br/><br/>A few points for the effects, but as good as they can be effects are no longer enough to carry a film in terms of quality (unless they're of groundbreaking Avatar-like quality, and the effects of this film don't even come close to that). Unfortunately effects alone are enough to carry a film at the box office and probably always will be so until that changes we'll continue to get films like this, devoid of anything much more than said effects. Don't go into this film expecting much else."

","One of my very earliest memories of being blown away and scared to death by a movie was when I was a kid and saw Jason and the Argonauts on TV. With a child's eyes there was no doubt to me that it was some sort of documentary, and the fight with the skeletons stayed with me for a long time. Ever since then I have been a fan of Greek mythology and the huge monsters that inherit the stories. So you can imagine I was really excited for this one, despite all the negative reviews. I went in to the movie expecting little more than simply an entertaining popcorn movie, and that was exactly what I got.<br/><br/>The makers of this remake have changed the story around a lot, the original also deviated from the original myth about Perseus, but this goes even further away. The result is not perfect, part of the film's biggest problems is the bad lines and all the exposition that is needed because of the changes made to the original story. The story of the 2010 version seems to be made to be some sort of allegory to the war on terrorism, with Perseus in a marine haircut going out to the desert to find evil (Osama Bin Ladin), and then return to ward of the terrorist threat made by Hades and his horrific Kraken. The original Clash of the Titans is far from a perfect movie even though it's more true to the original myth, and one of the good things about the changes made is that it allows for more action scenes. Which should be the main reason why you go and see a film like this one.<br/><br/>I've not done any academic research into the subject, but I have the firm conviction that movie ratings and whether you like or dislike a movie depends 95 percent on your expectations. If you go into a movie like this and expect another Godfather, of course you are going to be let down. If you go into this movie and expect a light hearted action film, you are likely to be satisfied because that's exactly what this is and it doesn't promise anything else. The special effects are really good and the action scenes rival those in Avatar. The 3D effects are only a gimmick in CotT and they look really bad (especially the actor's faces in closeups, they look like they are inflated balloons or something), but it's not enough to ruin the film. Any fans of action films should be able to enjoy this one as long as you go into it with an open mind and realistic expectations."

Added to this is an awfully thin layer of 3D effects which makes the film look and feel like these old school 3D toys where you insert a disc with pictures into a device that looks like a binocular to give them some depth.<br/><br/>Added up you get a thin and broken up story line, somewhat more than OK 2D effects and very very bad 3D effects.

The Set design is a good -visually delightful- mix of several civilizations, and even though the locations of the movie do not really look like Greece we let it slide. These are the good elements of the movie.<br/><br/>Other than that... Perseus is a Terminator-like / ex fisherman / Avenger on the war path, who slaughters anything that comes near him, while his comrades ""jump into fire"" for him with no obvious reason. The Perseus character is as shallow as possible, and the script and dialogs hardly give any chance to the actors in general to actually act. There are nice actors in this movie who unfortunately are helpless in the hands of the merciless scriptwriters who doomed them with silly lines a 5 yo could write.<br/><br/>This is a movie based entirely in action scenes and special effects. Unfortunately, the action scenes and special effects are no better than the dialogs. The Medusa character is hardly movie quality 3d (Many games actually have more realistic graphics these days). The Kraken moved from the coasts of Norway and Iceland to the Ancient Greece, but it still did not do much good as most of the time we were watching Perseus chasing a blurry Harpy instead of fighting that poor monster. The ""lightsaber"" idea was quite good, as when Perseus was turning on his ""lightsaber"" I was thinking of Star Wars and the movie was more bearable. I actually thought he was going to use the Force at some scenes of the movie (but never did to my disappointment). <br/><br/>In general, there are countless scenes that I could comment on but there is point in that.

There was minimal character development and not since the introduction of the twins in Transformers 2 have I seen a more pointless pair of comic relief sidekicks.

","Cherish your fond memories of the cult film favorite ""Clash of the Titans"" (1981) with Harry Hamlin, because ""Incredible Hulk"" director Louis Leterrier's remake twists virtually everything inside out. The superior remake eliminates some characters, replaces them with others, and alters the line-up of scenes. Indeed, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's ""Clash of the Titans"" revised the Greek myth of Perseus, but the Warner Brothers redux gives the legend a heavy-duty overhaul. Scenarist Travis Beacham along with ""Æon Flux"" co-scripters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi have taken even more liberties with Greek mythology than Beverley Cross dared in the original. Comparatively, Leterrier and his scribes have surpassed the original simply because special effects technology has come so far since stop-motion guru Ray Harryhausen dazzled audiences with the 1981 version. Leterrier assembles gargoyles, gigantic back-hoe sized scorpions, a reptilian Medusa with writhing vipers for locks and a gaze that turns men into statues, and a humongous sea monster that resembles the adversary in Leterrier's ""Incredible Hulk"" sequel. Unlike the tongue-in-cheek, juvenile-oriented original, the ""Clash of the Titans"" remake takes itself pretty seriously and its solemn, larger-than-life shenanigans boast a brawny, believable look. Gone is the toy mechanical owl from the original, but the remake acknowledges Bubo the Owl before it consigns it to oblivion. The chief error that Warner Brothers made with this $126-million remake is they converted it from 2-D to 3-D. No ""Clash of the Titans"" was not lensed in 3-D. Indeed, some shots display some extraordinary depth from the foreground to the background. Nevertheless, you will miss nothing if you watch ""Clash of the Titans"" without your glasses. The edges around some characters and objects may appear fuzzy, but not as fuzzy as usual. The dead giveaway that the action was not photographed in 3-D is the absence of anything being hurled at you throughout this 106-minute melodrama.<br/><br/>""Terminator: Salvation"" and ""Avatar"" star Sam Worthington plays the heroic Perseus as a sort of conscientious objector. As the film opens, the infant Perseus and his dead mother Danaë bubble up from the depths of the ocean in a wooden casket. An ordinary fisherman, Spyros (Pete Postlethwaite of ""The Usual Suspects""), saves Perseus. He raises the lad as his own flesh and blood. Perseus knows he is an orphan, but Spyros loves him. Otherwise, Perseus knows nothing else about himself. In the original ""Clash of the Titans,"" King Acrisius of Argos condemned Perseus and his mother Danaë to death and set them adrift in a coffin. Acrisius feared a prophecy that stipulated his death if his daughter bore a child. In this version, Zeus impregnates King Acrisius' wife and Acrisius sets them adrift. Perseus grows up and witnesses greater momentous events. Zeus (Liam Neeson of ""Taken"") created mankind so that human prayers would fuel the immortality of the deities. Unfortunately, mankind has grown weary of the Greek gods atop Mount Olympus, and King of Argos demolishes a towering statue of Zeus. After the monument falls into the sea, the God of the Underworld, Hades (Ralph Fiennes of ""The English Patient""), unleashes gargoyles and even puts in an appearance, too. Hades creates a disturbance that sinks Spyros' ship, sending it to the bottom and drowning his entire family. Perseus survives this debacle and swears vengeance against Hades.<br/><br/>In the palace of Argos, Hades reappears, wipes out the palace guard, and informs King that Perseus is a demigod. Furthermore, as punishment for their blasphemous behavior, Hades plans to turn the Kraken loose on Argos and destroy the city in 10 days unless the King sacrifices his beautiful daughter, Andromeda (Alexa Davalos of ""Defiance""), who is willing to die for the populace. Hades is angry because Zeus tricked him into presiding over the underworld. At one point, Zeus ordered Hades to create a monster that would destroy the Titans, the ancestors of Zeus and company, and Hades created the Kraken. Mind you, the Kraken is a creature from Scandinavian, not Greek mythology. As the son of Zeus, Perseus feels greater contempt for the gods and wants nothing to do with his hallowed father. The King of Argos persuades Perseus to lead an expedition to consult the Stygian Witches about the power of the Kraken. The Stygian Witches—blind hags with a single eye between them--explain that only the Medusa can destroy the Kraken. The Medusa, however, doesn't make house calls. We learn about the Medusa's origins and how she was punished for having sex with an Olympian god. When you see the Medusa, you'll understand why she doesn't get out often. One big difference between the original and the remake is Perseus lands a new romantic interest, Io (Gemma Arterton of ""Quantum of Solace"") who also serves as his guardian, replaces Andromeda. In the original, Perseus had 30 days to save Princess Andromeda and marry her. Meanwhile, Hades returns to the underworld and gives Acrisius a new lease on life to kill Perseus.<br/><br/>Rarely do remakes surpass the original, but ""Clash of the Titans"" qualifies as an exception. Meanwhile, ""Clash of the Titans"" qualifies as a good adventure opus and our heroes face some rather awesome adversaries. The scorpion fight is good and the giant scorpions come in handy for our heroes. French director Louis Leterrier knows something about pacing movies and this one never slows down. Every one of Leterrier's three previous films—""Unleashed"" with Jet Li, ""Transporter 2"" with Jason Statham, and ""The Incredible Hulk"" with Edward Norton—was a fast-paced fracas that intertwined white-knuckled action with exposition. The single shortcoming of ""Clash of the Titans"" is all the narrative information that Leterrier and his writers have to force feed us. The prologue about the gods is essentially repeated later, but you don't have to know squat about the actual Greek myth because the revisions would only serve to confuse you. Worthington makes a credible but sympathetic hero and Gemma Arterton is easy on the eyes. The scenery is breathtaking and the larger-than-life heroics are exciting."

","I just came back from watching this movie . . . and I have to say that the production is a marvelous updating and re-imagining of the original. Growing up with the original (the time that the original was released with was state of the art) I have to say that this re-imagining of it is perfect. The simple plot line of the original is kept somewhat intact, but the addition of the Magi was wonderful and a well needed addition.<br/><br/>But there are two setbacks to the movie that made me give it a 9 instead of a 10. 1) Pegasus is black (in mythology he is supposed to be white). And they called it ""the pegasus"" (as a noun, a thing, an animal) instead of Pegasus a proper name the horse of Zeus. 2)Gone is the golden owl for a companion of Perseus (which make a very brief appearance in the movie, you have to go see the movie to know where. But it was used in the original as the comedy relief) Besides for the two things mention above this move is for the OLDER CHILDREN and not for the young ones. There are some parts that are very intense and scary images for the young ones, but OK for the older children.<br/><br/>For what is worth, great story, action balanced with just the right amount of CGI makes this movie for good entertainment. For what other reason do we go to the movies?"
"JustStone","3","3","6","4 April 2010"," Sam Worthington is no Harry Hamlin
","In Roger Ebert's review of the original 1981 ""Clash of the Titans,"" he praised the film saying it had ""faith in a story-telling tradition that sometimes seems almost forgotten, a tradition depending upon legends and myths."" This makes sense considering both film versions of ""Clash of the Titans"" is loosely based off the Greek myth of Perseus (Greek for ""Avenger"" apparently) a myth that has been passed down and kicking around since roughly 490 BC. There is no definitive version of the story, and like all good myths and legends, the best parts get added as the story get passed on from generation to generation. When Ebert praised the original 1981 ""Clash of the Titans"" he was referring to the same mythic storied tradition that the film seemed to be able to maintain with the help of a well developed script and crafty special effects work from Ray Harryhausen, who was one of the best around before computer CGI took care of everything.<br/><br/>But now CGI does take care of everything, so much so that we've also almost forgotten how hard it is to create special effects like the original ""Clash of the Titans"" did without the aid of computers. You would think then that a film like ""Clash of the Titans,"" which relies so heavily on SFX and mythical gods and creatures, would be perfect to remake in the age of CGI. But in its remake, Hollywood forgot that it's not just about how much CGI you can throw on the screen, but how you use it. It's always ironic when we have the power to visually create whatever our imaginations can dream up, yet once we have this ability we're less creative with how we use it. We treat the technique as the be all and end all, forgetting that, no matter what, the quality and depth of the story should always be the film's foundation. The two things that made the myth of Perseus work so well throughout time were its strong narrative structure and the fantastical nature of the story. Actually, come to think of it, this is true with all storytelling; it's what makes you root for the protagonist, hate the villains, and get swept up in the emotions of the characters. The Greeks knew about this, and it seemed that Hollywood did, too, for a while – but the new version of this film is so befuddled with questionable character motivations and derivative plot twists that the epic tale of Perseus seemed to have gotten lost in a CGI mess.<br/><br/>In the classic Greek myth of Perseus, the son of Zeus (half god, half man) grows up while his mother is exiled on an island after his bastard grandfather sent them away after hearing a prophecy predicting Perseus will one day kill him. Perseus grows up knowing he is half god (demigod) and yearns to become an adult so he can begin his own heroic adventures. In the original myth, Perseus has a single motivation: to seek the adventure and excitement of becoming a hero. In the 1981 film, Perseus does not know he is a demigod until he is an adult, and it is not until he sees the princess Andromeda that he decides his ultimate quest is not for the sake of heroism, but love. In the new film, Perseus' motivation changes one last, complicated time; his adoptive parents are killed by God of the Underworld Hades, and Perseus' sole motivation becomes revenge. I call this the ""Gladiator effect,"" which worked well for Maximus, but not so well for Perseus. This is also the first variation in which Perseus doesn't agree with his real father Zeus, and wants to win his battles not as a god, but as a man. But the problem here isn't Perseus' daddy issues, it's that he becomes a man fueled by revenge against the gods and completely resistant to using his divine abilities. Using these gifts is what makes him so lovable in the original myth and movie, so why abandon it? As far as acting goes, Sam Worthington as Perseus is no Harry Hamlin, and comes across more as an angry Maximus/Russel Crowe archetype rather than an altruistic hero. This combined with the problem of superfluous supporting characters, deus ex machina love interests, and no mechanical owl, this movie is mostly for kids and tweens who will love the computer graphics, but ultimately doesn't leave a lasting impression or has the imagination of a truly epic tale, one that relies on story-telling anyway.<br/><br/>Oh and it wasn't shot in 3D, so don't waste your money seeing it this way."
"ferguson-6","6","3","6","4 April 2010"," Perseus, Let's get Kraken
","Greetings again from the darkness. I have a weakness for the 1981 version and still get a kick out of Ray Harryhausen's stop-action art in that film, as well as the Sinbad films. One of my favorite trivia questions is ""What film starred both Harry Hamlin and Laurence Olivier?"". That cracks me up, and stumps most people ... even though most have seen the original.<br/><br/>Director Louis Leterrier provides a remake that is very much a film project of current day despite the mythology involved. Here, Liam Neesom as Zeus and Ralph Finnes as Hades are (not so close) brothers supposedly battling for the same thing - getting those pesky humans back in line. This comes after the army of Argos gets fed up with the whims of the Gods and makes a move toward independence. You either know the story or not, but either way shouldn't affect your enjoyment of the movie.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington, fresh off his ""Avatar"" fame makes for a solid Perseus, the half-son of Zeus (thanks to an earlier trick, that most would call rape). However, I never could make sense of his perfectly barbered look of facial and scalp stubble, while those around him all sport the late-60's Hell's Angels look. Gemma Atherton (former Bond girl) plays the quasi-God who is to protect Persues, and Mads Mikkelson (former Bond villain) fights alongside him. However, this is not an actor's film.<br/><br/>The special effects are bountiful. Hades comes and goes as a cloud of thick black smoke and is quite comfortable splitting himself off into a flock of evil-spirited flying dragon things. Pegasus, the flying horse is back, as are the giant scorpions, who are much bigger and badder than before. Still don't understand how they went from mean to sweet between scenes. Of course, the coolest thing is Medusa and her hairdo of creepy, crawly snakes. That's one bad chick. The most impressive special effect is the Kraken, Hade's underworld pet who is ""released"" to destroy mankind (unless Perseus can stop him).<br/><br/>There is one humorous tip of the cap to the original, but most of the other shots at humor fall extremely flat. This is not a movie to see for the dialogue. The mythology and wonderment of the Gods have a certain appeal, though this one certainly falls short in providing us any real insight into the daily tasks of the lucky few on Olympus. So enjoy this one for what it is ... and stump your friends with that trivia question!"

","So the hubs was yearning for some greecian war movies and being a big Greek history buff myself I was all for it. We even opted to pay the extra two bucks to see 3D. I mean Sam Worthington in 2D is good but him in 3D is wow! To my dismay the 3D wasn't worth it. If I could whine to the movies theatre to get my money back for that I so would. Moving on. 1st there are no titans in it. Not one.also the kraken is historically norwegien. What was that about? Disney's Hercules had better use of titans than this ""clash"" also not an ounce of character development. Sam Worthington running around saying ""I will do this as a man"" was about as far as it went. It was predictable, boring and not worth the time. I did have high hopes for this movie due to my love for avatar, sam worthington and greecian history. But this movie seriously falls short of anything other than the same old song and dance run of the mill Greek action flick. In short this movie was a serious clash of decent cinematic idea."
"JimD73","6","3","6","3 April 2010"," Fun, but not enough Titans
","Clash of the Titans, from the title alone, made many promises. We expect to see many monsters of Ancient Greece, and we expect them to do battle, alongside humans and the Gods. We expect many many epic battles, lots and lots of CGI and appropriately over the top performances to go with them, but mostly, we want the monsters. While Clash delivers on some level for each of these promises, it surprisingly really lacks in the monsters department.<br/><br/>It must be said as fair warning, you do not get to see Kraken VS Hydra or anything like that in Clash of the Titans. The action is centered squarely around demigod Perseus, who for our purposes is basically a man secreting badass. After Hades threatens to unleash the Kraken on the city of Argos, Perseus and a group of soldiers go in search of a way to kill the Kraken, encountering many perils along the way.<br/><br/>The problem is its always Perseus and the soldiers who end up fighting the monsters. I'm sure I'm not the only one who expected the beasts to fight one another at some, mythology be damned (not like its particularly close to the myths anyways). Only four real combat beasts emerge anyways: the Kraken, Medusa, a mutated Acrisius and some random giant scorpions. Not even the Gods get to fight much, despite the much-hinted battle between Zeus and Hades.<br/><br/>The Kraken in particular really should've had a battle with another beast thrown in, and its use seems like a wasted opportunity. The scorpion battle is quite exciting, though is broken up as its really four fights with different scorpions simultaneously. The Medusa sequence is easily the best of the film, as although we know from a plot perspective Perseus can't die, the fate of the group of soldiers is considerably less clear. It all makes for a very tense and rewarding sequence, somewhat hindered by the surprisingly poor CG on the Medusa character model. Shame, as the rest of the monsters are quite good looking.<br/><br/>The cast is quite good on paper, but it doesn't work as well as expected. Worthington is a suitable lead, but I see him heading to Stallone-esquire B-movies quickly if he doesn't find more interesting characters. Liam Neeson is fairly underused, and aside from the ""Release the Kraken"" line, never gets any moments. Ralph Fiennes is the biggest disappointment as Hades, spending far too much of the time whispering like a bad Sith impersonation than being actually menacing. The standout is easily Mad Mikkelson as the leader of the soldiers. While not a terribly meaty role, he has more than enough charisma to be much more interesting than Perseus himself.<br/><br/>Clash is definitely not a waste of a matinée ticket, and I felt I got almost what I expected. But I know it could've been more, and it seemed to be purposely saving certain creatures for a sequel. Its solid fun, but hardly the must-see some might think from the trailers."

","At first i thought this movie is going to be epic, but unfortunately it's not. ""Percy Jackson"" is better than this one. The action scenes were awesome but the trailer spoiled almost everything as usual. The screen writing and editing is bad, The costume design is silly, too many questionable moments and goofs, and ordinary CGI. Clash of the Titans is one of the most disappointing movie of the year.<br/><br/>The action scenes were awesome, exciting, and entertaining but the rest of the movie is (blowing raspberries). The only good CGI here are the giant scorpions but the Harpies, Medusa and the Kraken are just like the CGI in G.I. Joe. The music score makes the action scenes exciting but it is still not the best. The editing was bad, there are some scenes aren't complete.<br/><br/>Zeus' costume is silly. is he suppose to be a god wearing a knight armor? because in that costume he looks like a cheesy super hero.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington is a miscast, he needs to stick to roles like Marcus Wright. Liam Neeson was good but his costume makes him look silly. Steve Coogan is better Hades.... just kidding Ralph Fiennes was awesome to play the role.<br/><br/>Clash of the Titans isn't the worst remake ever. The movie is still watchable because the action scenes are exciting and awesome. But it's still disappointing. You will like this film if you love movies with sword fights and fast action, but Greek myth or Clash if the Titans of 1981 fans won't like this.

"secondhandrose-1","8","3","6","3 April 2010"," Great film, very entertaining. Worth the cinema trip.
","Going in to see this movie, I wasn't going to compare it to the original. Ray Harryhausen is a hero of mine. It was never going to beat the original, or come close. So I shall not mention the original, or compare parts in any way. I took it as what it was, a modern style action adventure, based around two of my favourite subjects. Greek Mythology and buff men in little outfits.<br/><br/>Although the movie did feel a little rushed (coming in at just under 2 hours) every second of it was literally filled with action. I don't know if my heart could have taken much longer, but I was sitting ever so close to the cinema screen, with my eyes bleeding and ears bursting..Wait, thats a bit dramatic. I didn't even see it in 3D! The star of the show for me was definitely Gemma Arterton (IO). I was stunned as I watched her, such a beautiful woman, and its great to see a girl kicking butt. The only downside was her lack-lustre chemistry with Sam Worthington(Perseus).<br/><br/>The special effects were amazing. Particularly standing out to me were the Djinn and Medusa, who you could barely tell was actress Natalia Vodianova. I thought she was quite terrifying, not as much so as my favourite part of the movie with Kharon, the ferryman. I don't want to spoil anything for you, but it did send a chill down my spine(that could have been the damn air-con in the cinema).<br/><br/>Overall the film was lots of fun, and kept me very entertained. I really felt like seeing it at the cinema heightened the experience, but not so keen on the idea of watching it 3D. As a film being in 3D doesn't really hold a great fascination to me.<br/><br/>My only disappointments were not getting a good look at all the Gods up in Mount Olympus (who, from the distance we saw them, looked very interesting), and the whole anti-climax of defeating Hades. So the film isn't exactly a lesson in Greek mythology, but who wants talk in an action movie? The young boy sitting near me looked absolutely enthralled by the film, with a huge smile on his face throughout."
"joebloggscity","6","3","6","2 April 2010"," Swords and sandals in 3D epic adventure treatment
","With the boom in 3D in recent years, Greek tales are an easy choice for a cinematic extravaganza. A modern take on the old Clash of the Titans (with a few old references to the old movie) this is as you would expect. Big action, big set pieces, big monsters and big kills.<br/><br/>The story encompasses Greek god rivalry, family revenge, mankind's attack on the Gods and statecraft. Yet this is all in the way of the action. The storyline just doesn't develop enough and the directors are just setting all up for the action scenes. That's disappointing as with Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes playing the warring Gods, there was room for a stronger story.<br/><br/>The graphics and the actions are impressive and fine, but not more so than many other of the ilk in recent years, so doesn't amaze as could have. Possibly getting harder to do so.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a fair popcorn flick which could have been more. It lacks the character of the old more popular version of the film which is a hindrance to this. Not a bad film, just nothing special despite the big cinematic treatment."
"Samiam3","6","3","6","2 April 2010"," Shallow, Hokey, kind of fun (not quite enough though)
","The year is young, but Clash of the Titans qualifies as the hokey semi-epic of 2010, the same way Forbidden Kingdom was to 2007, or 10 000 b.c. was to 2008. From a lobotomized point of view, I suppose the action scenes make up for the total lack of story and the frustration generated by the pointless use of characters and bad acting. So I guess, the film is superior to the 1981 version, but it's got a long way to go<br/><br/>the story is a retelling of the Perseus myth, and the screenplay does it no justice. It feels rushed and cheesy, with not a moment of time spent on intelligent dialogue. Director Louis Leterier likes to stage his fights in martial arts cinema tradition, and although he takes it a bit over-the-top with too many slow-mo shots, I suppose it's fun stuff. Of course, it has nothing on his last movie, The Incredible HuIk. Also, would've liked to see a little more from the climax, which is far too short, and presents a pretty big plot hole (which for obvious reasons I wont describe)<br/><br/>The geology of the movie is fascinating, but half of it is not Greek. (I know I've been to Greece). It's pretty easy to recognize the volcanic ash fields of Argentina, used in numerous movies before, or the lush green wet forests from the Pacific coast. Not like any of this is a real problem. I also like the make-up jobs on peoples faces, although to be honest Ralph Finnes and Liam Neeson look more Viking than Greek, and ironically Zeus's beard 'clashes' with the color of his armour. <br/><br/>Sam Worthington is hot stuff, but he cannot act. He's the new Jason Stathum. It's not like he has much to do or say though. Clash of the Titans is just another case of poor script = mediocre movie. The special effects do make a difference next to Ray Harryhausen, but the movies intention to honor him, is inept, and I think it could've delivered more."

And even then, because i was already bored and didn't care for the story or the characters, it just didn't impress me that much. Yeah, the creatures are well designed and executed (except the Medusa who was almost as bad as the scorpion king from ""The Mummy returns""), the action quite spectacular and the visuals really impressive. But in a movie that is as bad as this one, it just is not enough to turn the rudder around. If at least it had the charm and fun factor of the Japanese Godzilla Movies, but it hasn't. It is just bad. Without charm, without fun, just bad.<br/><br/>My advise to everyone: Even if you usually like this kind of movie: spare you this one. It just isn't worth your money and time."
"DonFishies","4","3","7","7 April 2010"," Entertaining enough for a throwaway laugh or gasp
","I watched the original Clash of the Titans merely days before the new remake to try and understand why it has become such a cult classic since its original release back in 1981. While people will tell you it is one of those films that are so bad it slowly becomes good, I actually found the film to be quite entertaining. It was by no means a great film, but it had heart and an epic scope limited only by its need to employ the effects of Ray Harryhausen.<br/><br/>Enter the remake, or reimagining as it so conveniently seems. As the people of Argos lash back against the Gods, including Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Hades (Ralph Fiennes), the Gods start to lash back. Caught in the crossfire is Zeus' bastard son Perseus (Sam Worthington), who seeks revenge against the Gods, but quickly finds out it is his destiny to save the townspeople and to help Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) from being sacrificed to the mythic Kraken.<br/><br/>What was charming about the original film was its lack of dimensionality and complications. Perseus is raised and trained to fight against the Gods, and find his calling in saving Andromeda out of love. The plot was focused entirely around him, and the Gods took a back seat to his storyline. Hell, there really is no specific bad guy in the film at all. In the remake, it seems like they attempted to pile on as much story as they comprehensively could, cutting out certain Gods almost entirely (or having them stand almost as a placeholder and do next to nothing, such as Danny Huston's Poseidon or Alexander Siddig's Hermes), cutting out or changing characters around entirely, or curbing the screen time of some of the first film's integral characters (Jason Flemyng's Calibos immediately comes to mind).<br/><br/>But even with the changes and the added dimensionality for some, the film lacks the heart that drove the original almost entirely. There is nothing charming here, nothing fun. Sure the film is exciting, but it lacks the pulse that made the original so enjoyable. Of course, this is not helped by the script, which plays itself out much too seriously for its own good. There are a few amusingly ridiculous one-liners sprinkled throughout (the blatant sexual euphemism ""Ease your storm"" is a gem that sticks out), but the majority of the dialogue jumps quickly in scale of bad to worse. There was a reason huge chunks of the original film did not have any dialogue. Apparently the filmmakers here did not get the memo, and decided to jump amp up the silly dialogue as much as they could at any moment they could. And was there really a reason to replace Bubo the mechanical owl with a not so subtly camouflaged ripoff of Chewbacca? <br/><br/>Acting wise, the film is entirely hit and miss. The majority of performers are lifeless, and emotionally banal. While Neeson and Fiennes do their best to overcome the contrivances of the script, you can tell almost immediately that they really have no place in a film like this. They are much stronger thespians than that (although Fiennes appears to be channelling his inner Voldemort in far too many scenes). While it is nice to see them in a goofy picture like this, I find it very disheartening to note the last film they appeared in was Schindler's List. Bond veterans Gemma Arterton and Mads Mikkelsen seem to get the juiciest material in the whole picture, but both lack the real charisma and drive for the audience to really care about their characters, or their relationships to anyone else. Davalos fares even worse, seemingly making even a damsel in distress look difficult to pull off.<br/><br/>Worthington is the glue that holds the film together, and for the most part he does well. Even when he is clearly being held back or delivering the silliest pieces of dialogue, he still has the emotional presence to carry the film and make you care about his plight for revenge. I was not overly excited about the overly cliché revenge plot, or that he was playing an off-shoot of Jake Sully from Avatar here, but he still manages to make the character unique enough to stand alone. He may have been a breakthrough in Terminator Salvation, and simply great in Avatar, but here he merely maintains his status as an excellent newcomer. I look forward to his next film with great trepidation.<br/><br/>While there are a few bad green screening moments (and a few throwaway shots clearly thrown in to appeal to 3D viewers), the special effects are quite excellent. Gone is the stop motion and claymation of the original film, and in its place are CG effects that make everything look more realized that I imagined (and even include a few great makeup effects too). I was impressed by just about everything thrown at the screen (outside of the absurd scorpions), as they looked a lot better than I imagined they would. While not every scene is as polished as the next, they all come away looking very well done.<br/><br/>I did not expect a whole lot from Clash of the Titans going on what the trailers offer us, but having the shell of the original story still in place works in its favour. The film, even at its worst, still manages to be entertaining enough for a throwaway laugh or gasp. Although it is done in a more epic way in the God of War video game series and with more heart in the original film, there are still some things to like about the film. It is not a great film by any means, and it likely will never find the cult classic status its brethren did. But it is enjoyable enough, and could have been so much worse.<br/><br/>4.5/10.<br/><br/>(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."
"aernest","2","3","7","2 April 2010"," Mythology - with extra cheese
","Everyone BUT the two leads (Worthington and Davalos) is just passable in this. I can't figure out all the Sam Worthington love -he's pretty bland in this and everything else. And why does HE get a buzz-cut when everyone else has long braids? Mads Mikkelson walks away with this movie, and when Fiennes and Neeson have a ham-off, it's just good, cheesy fun! The look of the film is good, with the cutest tame scorpions ever. There were a couple of shots that I knew were CGI, but really didn't look CGI, which was neat. The use of real exterior shots helped some, I think. I saw it in 2D, not 3D, which I heard was horrible-looking. Stiil, CGI cannot replace a script.<br/><br/>Why Io instead of Athena helping Perseus? I dunno. Why Io at all? I dunno. Why are humans revolting against the gods when the gods can and do strike them with lightning? I dunno. Since they went to all the trouble to dress up a bunch of people as gods, why didn't the gods (with the exceptions of Hades and Zeus) get any lines? I dunno. Why the Norwegian kraken instead of a Greek monster? I dunno, but at least that was in the first movie. In the end, like all mythology, you just go with it and have a great time, which I did. Don't expect to learn anything substantive about Greek mythology, though."
"scottishjew","6","3","7","2 April 2010"," OK but could have been much better
","I recently took a classical mythology class and the myth of Perseus is strongly to believed to be a children's tale rather than being a full blown myth. The reason for this is that Perseus doesn't really have an internal struggle and he is helped greatly in his adventures with gifts from the gods. Sadly this movie doesn't really deviate from the children's tale, which is too bad - it had a lot of potential.<br/><br/>Also, this movie seems to suffer from the ""Mummie"" movies' problem of using way too much CGI for the monsters. Don't get me wrong, I love CGI, but when creatures are made so huge they become cartoon-ish. Sometimes less is more.<br/><br/>I think a lot of people will like this movie, I just found it to not have enough ""grit."""
"Thistle-3","6","3","7","1 April 2010"," The gods must be crazy, but how would we know?
","I think you'll find just as many people love Clash of the Titans as those who do not love it. I went with the boy (who is actually 18, for those of you who are not familiar with his nickname). We were both underwhelmed. In fact, when the credits started to roll, he took off his 3-D glasses, looked at me and said, ""Well, that sucked."" That warranted a smack from me, because he's not allowed to use that word around me. I forced him to be more specific in his criticism, and as it turns out, we totally agreed on our review.<br/><br/>Good news first. Sam Worthington is terrific, as Perseus. I think the production value is high. The movie, the settings, look beautiful. It's an interesting story. The set up is good. I am sad when Perseus' human family dies. After that, though, it's all a blur of action and mess. It seems like they're trying to cram every detail of the Greek epic plus every effect and monster possible into 90 minutes. None of the characters are developed enough in that time. How could they be, when they're fighting monsters and on an adventure and there's an Olympus back story? If all the warriors on the odyssey were actors I already knew, maybe I could keep them straight. But, I don't, and I don't get to know them, and therefore, I don't care when things happen to them. It's not that the characters aren't interesting. I would love to see a movie and learn more about Andromeda and Draco and these two crazy brothers who like to hunt things.<br/><br/>At this point, I'll defer to my son's review. He says he wished the movie was longer so we could get more character development. He liked another epic guy, Jinn, but said he didn't learn anything about him, over the course of the movie, and that was frustrating.<br/><br/>""It seems like these guys know each other for five minutes, then they're like, Hey, we're not coming with you but here is this cool shield. Andromeda is like, hey, I gave you a cup of water, now you should be my king."" We both would have preferred a movie even 30-45 minutes longer that left us more satisfied.<br/><br/>While the 3-D is good, the creatures all seem cobbled together from other films. There is a cute homage to the original Clash of the Titans. Our disappointment is more pronounced, because this cast is really good. The acting and characters could have elevated the movie above the effects, given time to develop. We give Clash of the Titans a 6 out of 10."
"aid_h6","7","3","7","1 April 2010"," Does not meet the hype.
","Well it may not meet the hype, but it is not terrible. Other critics are comparing it to Transformers 2, in the way that it is all special effects with some plot thrown in.<br/><br/>And in some ways, they're right. The effects are probably the best in recent history. The story is very strange; Louis Leterier did his best to keep the original story relatively intact, while adding a whole new antagonist in Hades.<br/><br/>This resulted in many characters being cast without any meaningful roles. All of the gods are in this movie, with only 3 of them featuring lines. Hades and Zeus of course, and Apollo throwing in his bit with one line.<br/><br/>As much as this is much like the original, it is much more noticed by modern standards.<br/><br/>The acting is nothing Oscar worthy, Sam Worthington (Avatar) and Ralph Fiennes (Harry Potter) all giving passable performances. Two big surprises were found in Mads Mikkelsen (Casino Royale) and Gemma Arterton (Quantum of Solace).<br/><br/>For me, if Louis Leterier had nailed this movie, he would be on my watch list for directors. Considering he had just remade The Incredible Hulk really well, I thought he would be the ideal director for this movie.<br/><br/>I still recommend it even though the plot is messy and the most of the main characters are forgettable. Come seeking action with a touch of romance.<br/><br/>7/10 Nothing Special."
"jpach31","10","5","15","3 April 2010"," The gods have spoken
","The power of the three gods – Zeus, Poseidon, Hades – have ruled the skies, the waters and the underworld for more than 3,000 years, now it's time for Hades to come out of hiding and reclaim Mount Olympus as his own. What Hades does not know is that there is a demi-god, Perseus, Zeus's son, and he will be the one to stop Uncle Hades from destroying mankind. Louis Leterrier directs an all-star cast from Avatar's Sam Worthington to Harry Potter's Ralph Fiennes to Liam Neeson, this movie proves its worth among the race of man. Clash of the Titans proves that it is worthy of Oscar buzz as well. This movie reclaims the gods have spoken and it's time to re-own Mount Olympus and the race of man."

Even when I was a lil' kid I used to read the legendary myths and be amazed by all these incredible ideas and stories the people from the very Cradle of Civilization would hold true and passionately believe in. Yes, I used to watch the campy ""Hercules"" with Kevin Sorbo. Later, I loved the ""Age of Mythology"" RTS. And now, after long years of deep slumber, my love for Ancient Greek gods, and heroes, and fearless mortals who opposed them was magically nourished and reborn by this new ""Clash of the Titans"" film.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, adrenalin was being pumped non-stop, my face of jaw-dropping amazement could only temporarily be replaced by a glittering smile. The 3D visuals were simply TOP-NOTCH, that is, like something I have never seen before. The acting was great: Sam gave a genuine and charismatic performance; Liam Neeson redeemed himself of his ""Taken"" nonsense; it was pleasant to see the amazing actress Polly Walker from ""Rome"" have a part in the spectacle, but, to me, Mads Mikkelsen and his staunch acting was the one worth the title of the demigod.<br/><br/>I saw this film a nice, still spring evening.

The makers of this movie don't understand the mythological world and the story of Perseus.

Let's forget this piece of junk as soon as possible."
"merevick","3","2","4","24 January 2011"," Um...were there any actual writers in this project?
","**Contains Spoilers*<br/><br/>Being a fan of the original Clash of the Titans, I was very optimistic to see what a CGI Kraken and Medusa could look like. The 2010 Medusa was pretty well rendered, but the Kraken was nothing more than a Cloverfield rip-off, and a bad one at that.<br/><br/>But these additions are not the worst part of it...first off, did any of the script writers actually read the myth of Perseus? A Cliff-Notes edition would have sufficed. Instead, they took most of Disney's Hercules script,brought in a few names they barely recalled from high school English, which they undoubtedly failed, and placed a Jason Stathom version of Perseus into the mix. <br/><br/>Here is a little 101 of the myth: 1. Perseus never knew of Andromeda until AFTER he had slayed Medusa. 2. Hades played NO PART in this story and Zeus played barely anything as well. 3. Athena and Hermes were the two major Gods in this myth, as there was no f**king way Perseus could get to the land of the 3 gorgons (yes, there are three of them) without some aid of airborne transportation...he received winged sandals from Hermes. 4. Perseus was getting the head of Medusa as a bargaining chip for the king of Argos who wished to send Perseus away so he could have his mother. 5. Pegasus emerged from the severed neck of Medusa...please see number three above. 6. No, there were no god d@mn scorpions in the myth. Harryhueson came up with that for visual effect, which incidentally made it fun for 1981...2010's version just made it silly. 7. Who the f**k is this Calibus guy? Yes, he was an integral character in the 1981 version, and was well played. No, he was never in the original myth. Perseus had enough of a challenge taking on three reptilian creatures and a big freaking sea lizard. Yes, the 2010 Calibus was, without a doubt, the most unused potential. <br/><br/>There is more, but I will hold there. Now, I will forgive the 1981 version for its misinterpretation of the original myth, based on the fact that it tried to make a myth exciting, which it did. It allowed people to read more about ancient myth to see what was really written. All the 2010 version is do a misinterpretation of a misinterpretation, and did it with a story-line that had more holes than Swiss Cheese. Unfortunately, all this version is going to do is enable the laziness of most people into thinking that Perseus was a stubborn sailor who suddenly acquired the skills of Bruce Lee with a sword overnight and that mountain-sized Scorpions spring to life from the blood of a drugged up satyr. <br/><br/>In addition, doesn't it seem odd that a giant leviathon with the lung power of a solar flare couldn't knock any human down by bellowing at its highest note?<br/><br/>Way to go Hollywood...another brain buster.<br/><br/>I give it three stars, as there was some obvious hard work done by the CGI animators and renderers, who more than likely knew the original myth and were scoffing at the stupidity of the so-called writers behind this pile of crap."

","I am not going to repeat the comments of so many who have trashed this piece of garbage. A friend rented it last night; it was one of the few available movies that we had not yet seen. We were lured by the cast (Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes) and the prospect of probably seeing some cool CGI and massed battle scenes. We stopped watching at the 20 minute mark. Our assessment? This was nothing other that a 106 minute long commercial for the video game of the same name. This is surely a worthy candidate for nomination for this year's worst film at the Razzie Awards and it is hard to come up with a rival candidate off the top of my head. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see this piece of cinematic crap sweep the Razzies."
"tburke85","6","2","4","22 September 2010"," Clash Of The Titans Is Decent But With Flaws That Weigh It Down
","Class of the titans is decent but with flaws that weigh it down which I'll get into later. I thought it was all right but not the greatest. First off I didn't think it was very realistic that in a land full of bearded and long haired men Worthington's Perseus was clean shavin with a buzz cut. Worthington was okay as the lead but the role and performance seemed very familiar to Avatar and Terminator Salvation. Director Louis Letterier has shown in movies like Unleashed starring Jet Li and The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton his talent as a filmmaker. This on the other hand isn't the best movie he's directed at least not to me. I liked Unleashed and the new Hulk film more than this one. The rest of the cast is decent including Liam Nesson as Zeus, Ralph Fiennes as Hades, Gemma Atherton as Io, and Alexa Devalos as Andromeda with what little they were given because most of them don't have a whole lot to do (with the exception of maybe Fiennes and Atherton action wise anyway). Mads Mikkelsen was the stand out as Draco who gave the movie some much needed comic relief from time to time. Pete Posthewaite does what he can with his brief part. He's written out too quickly though for us to care about him. James Flemying is pretty good as Calibos/Acrisius despite a lack of development and screen time. Danny Huston makes a blink and you missed it cameo as Poseidon with one line of dialog before disappearing for the rest of the film. The dialog was weak occasionally and the movie itself as a whole felt rushed. The two most disappointing things were the Medusa creature and the Kraken mainly because they're hardly in the movie at all. The fight with Perseus and Hades at the end after The Kraken's dispatched was also a let down because it's over in the blink of an eye before you can enjoy the showdown between them. Some build up that doesn't have any real pay off. The Medusa action sequence was okay but the character gets 5 maybe 8 minutes of screen time tops before being killed off. The same can go for the Kraken that shows up near the climax to destroy a small portion of Argos and just when the terrifying beast's face is finally reveals it's easily defeated. It seemed like a total waste because it obviously took so much money to build this creature in a computer and to only show the Kraken for a few minutes was a big disappointment. This movie could've been a lot better. It has some character development (mainly Perseus), decent action sequences but none we haven't seen before, so-so acting from the cast and average special effects. The climatic final battle with the Kraken at the end however was a major let down. I actually thought Prince Of Persia was slightly better which had it's share of flaws but I found it to be more entertaining than this remake."
"PartialMovieViewer","2","2","4","15 September 2010"," There Are Worse Out There
","Wowthis was such a good movie when I rented the video and I could not sit through it once!!! Liam Neeson has turned out such great movies like, 'Taken', 'Michael Collins', 'Schindler's List', just to name a few and then he stumbles into garbage scripts of remakes of good classics like, 'The A-Team', 'The Haunting' – and now 'Clash of the Titans'. When he was offered this part, I wish he had turned it down. Hollywood directors – for the most part – suck these days. I really wish they would keep their personal and radical views to themselves. They have a tendency to be overly obvious in their tireless preaching. This movie was no different. The youth has the answer, and the gods should be tossed aside and forgotten about. By golly, the hero refuses the gifts from the gods, unlike the originalkind of thumbing his noses at his father. In many cases, Hollywood is no longer about entertainment – it is more about misleading the none-elites."

","After reading one of the reviews, I felt it necessary to put in a few good words for this film which I thought was a pretty decent effort! If you are looking for entertainment where you can park your mind at the door and just enjoy yourself, then Clash of the Titans fits the bill. Having read and enjoyed ancient Greek and Roman mythology for over 30 years, I always find it refreshing that the legends are kept alive in one way or another through new forms of storytelling. I didn't think the effects were dodgy at all - the fighting scenes were reminiscent of what one would expect in an epic battle and frankly, I thought it was very well accomplished. It's a pity not everyone was able to relax into the adventure and were more focused on looking for the 'ooo-ahhh' moments. Perhaps the advertisers shouldn't be hyping the effects as much as the story so that people don't go into these movies with false hopes. If you like adventure - see this; if you want a thriller or a mind bender - look elsewhere. Ultimately, the choice on how to spend your money is up to you!"

"Ric-7","5","2","4","9 April 2010"," How to train your Kraken
","Toothless is lucky that he did not decide to attack Argos, or he might have been turned into stone in addition to being misunderstood. <br/><br/>As for the mythology, just forget anything you may have earlier read--you are probably better off if you have never read anything about the ancient myths. And probably better off if you have not seen the eighties film.<br/><br/>The ancient ""politics"" behind this film were muddled. It first seemed like man vs. gods. And then it seemed like Zeus vs. Hades. And then there was Perseus, who was a demigod and seemed rather confused. But probably no more confused than his father Zeus, who eventually ordered Hades to ""Release the Kraken."" And why did they have to wait until the eclipse? Why not instant revenge on the mortals? Why was Zeus still speaking to Hades? Didn't Zeus know what Hades was doing? And if the Kraken was kept under the sea, what became of Poseidon? Maybe the god of the sea was lost in a budget-cut. Or maybe his part was given to Ralph Fiennes. And the Kraken gets released, and then gets marble-ized within a minute of emerging from the deep. Not much suspense there.<br/><br/>The hunting of Medusa is an example of bigger not really being better. In the eighties film, you had a sense of space--the arrangement of the pillars in Medusa's residence. Here, Medusa had moved to a place in the country--on the other side of the River Styx, and why? Who would need to be turned into stone after they were already dead? Would Medusa find much fun in killing boatloads of already dead tourists? Her lair was just a confusing craggy locale with a pit of fire somewhere inside. You had no idea where anyone was.<br/><br/>The gods seemed to be British (Liam and Ralph), and the bastard demigod son was Australian. Hmmm . . . And the not-very-comic relief sounded vaguely Russian. Was a statement being made? And Pegasus was black. But apparently had a lot of white girlfriends. And Perseus could just hop right on Pegasus at will whenever necessary, like hailing a taxi. And if there were all those other winged horses, why didn't Perseus and his buds just saddle up, rather than having to travel by scorpion?<br/><br/>There was no real way to care much for any of these characters. I didn't hate the film (I didn't see it in 3-D) because it's not that awful. It's just not very good."
"Robert_duder","8","2","4","8 April 2010"," Ridiculously stone cold action flick---nothing more and nothing less...pure entertainment
","There is plenty to say about Clash of The Titans. Is it historically/mythologically accurate? Well who cares for one...I mean it never was set out to retell in accurate details the religious beliefs of ancient Greece and if you're going to see it for that then you need your head examined. Films like this especially were made for pure and utter entertainment. That means if they take liberties with familiar characters or legends they are simply trying to put a new spin on things instead of dragging out the same old bit. The story for Clash of The Titans exists but barely matters and is only a surface story because this film thrives on absolutely mind blowing special effects, brutal and impressive battles and red blooded male heroes. Under different circumstances this style of film could really belly up and turn out to be boring and over shot but instead this recipe works whole heartedly for this film. You will sit there and your jaw will drop at the incredible effects and battles which there are a few key moments in the film that are nothing short of stunning. I did not see this in 3D and don't particularly wish to mostly because I think the 3D for this film was forced in at the last minute and the special effects are amazing enough with cheap gimmickry.<br/><br/>A star has risen...Sam Worthington had an incredible 2009 having starred in Terminator 4, and of course the biggest film of all time Avatar. And now 2010 gets kicked off with the first really big flick of the mid-Season blockbusters. I don't find Worthington is really star status...yet. I don't dislike him I just find him a little dull sometimes. He has an intensity about him but its a quite intensity, and not quiet like Bruce Willis but truly under the radar and that could hurt him. Still he leads the cast well and pulls off the underdog hero very well. Rising as a Hollywood legend Liam Neeson plays the god amongst gods Zeus. Its not a huge role but he definitely commands screen presence and instantly ups the ante on the cast. He is terrific. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as Hades. He does an amazing job and the only thing I can say about the role is that I wish there was more to it and I wish there was more scenes between him and Neeson as enemies and brothers at odds. He is a terrific villain but sadly underused. Alexa Davalos is lovely but mostly a third tier character with little depth to her. The supporting cast that is Worthington's small army are terrific but mostly undeveloped characters meant to support only.<br/><br/>Director Louis Leterrier is becoming a force in Hollywood. He did nearly the same thing with The Incredible Hulk reboot in 2008...great special effects, decent story, all entertainment. However he did great action and a good story for Danny The Dog (his first film) which I greatly recommend. He was ideal for directing this. There were some definite mistakes in the film. First of all the most impressive creature, battle and special effect was the incredible build up and appearance of the Kraaken. The unfortunate part is how incredibly fast it is defeated and vanishes. You want to pause and rewind just to see the creature. They spent just a little bit too much time on the scorpion battles (as incredibly cool as they are) and not enough time on the final battles. Clash of The Titans could have been a Lord Of The Rings sized epic but instead they put it together for sheer entertainment at a reasonable length and cut out what would have made it story based. Unfortunate perhaps but the entertainment is non stop and you won't be disappointed but please don't see this with expectations of mythologically enhanced story. 8.5/10"

","Found in a coffin with his dead mother as a child, Perseus is raised by a fisherman. Persues lives a quiet and normal life despite wanting to know where he came from. As mortals begin to rebel against the Gods, the Gods lash back by having Hades do his thing, which includes releasing the Kraken, unless the people sacrifice the princess Andromeda. Persues joins a small crew of men to go and stop this madness. <br/><br/>I love Greek mythology, I find it so interesting and when I watched the original Clash of the Titans when I was a child, the most memorable scene was Medusa's lair. Hearing about the remake made me excited, but it seems the filmmakers went the old generic Hollywood route and went for senseless action and and the cash grab that is 3-D. I don't remember everything about the original, but I do know that it is more entertaining then this forgettable swords and sandals 'epic'. I use the word epic loosely because the film does not feel as big as it's story. I don't know if Lord of the Rings has spoiled my ""people on a quest adventure"" but this film doesn't hold up to what it should be and it feels like a miss opportunity. <br/><br/>The biggest problem is the film lacks any kind of heart. I felt nothing for the forgettable characters, I can't even remember their names. The conflict didn't feel like it was raised to the right stake for me to care about what happens. There is no time spent with the Princess, why do I care if she gets sacrificed. I felt nothing for Perseus and his family, or his so called love interest. Which feels fake and tacked on to appeal to the females in the audience. <br/><br/>Worthington has literally exploded onto the big screen from nowhere. His acting chops haven't been tested yet and this film does nothing to try and provoke some kind of emotion from it's lead character. He screams and jumps from place to place and cries about wanting to defeat people as a man and nothing more. What should I have expected though right? Well, for one thing I was hoping to like all the Gods. Yet they managed to screw that up to. The Gods are hardly in it. My favourite God Poseidon stands in the background and has one line. I should be thankful he got that much because every other god just stand around in the background and serve no purpose.<br/><br/>The two main Gods that get the spotlight are Zeus and Hades. Played by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. Neeson does nothing, he just stands around and yells the famous trailer line ""Release the Kraken"". Fiennes does a good job and stands out, but at the same time he is simply playing Lord Voldemort and the connection is obvious. <br/><br/>What the film does offer is what most people going to see it want. Action. The special effects work and the action sequences are entertaining. The Medusa scene is nowhere near as memorable as the original and doesn't feel as important and the Kraken sequence, while spectacular is over far too soon. It's all about him getting out of the water, that's it. I was expecting Jack Sparrow to be stuck in his teeth. <br/><br/>In the end this film is sloppy and had problem from the script to the last edit. It's clunky and has no heart, the special effects and action sequences are entertaining, but not enough for one to invest their time into. Looking back on this film, there is not one moment that jumps out at me as impressive or note-worthy. More mythology, more character development and more story driven aspects would have helped the film immensely. Instead we get this Hollywood Blockbuster that fuels the fire of what a lot of people dislike. <br/><br/>Oh and I saw it in 2-D."
"georgioskarpouzas","6","2","4","7 April 2010"," very free adaptation of Greek mythology
","It is true that many people in Greece were offended by the treatment Greek myths receive in the hands of the movie industry. This movie gave reason to do that again. I am not sure if that is a correct reaction though. Since mythology is not history one can take liberties with mythology since myths have many versions and no canonical corpus exists.<br/><br/>This has happened in the present movie where the Greek elements of myth have been enriched by the sea monster Kracken-which I have first encountered cinematically in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean""- although the Kracken in Clash of the Titans is much more impressive. It is also strange that being a sea monster is not under the control of Neptune but of Hades. Also some Beduin/magicians which seem like the magicians Xerxes had with him in the ""300"" have been added, giving a ""Prince of Persia"" quality to the the movie. They ride huge scorpions also. The monsters of the film are disgusting enough, especially the fluids oozing from the giant scorpions when killed or mutilated, as well as the former King Acrisius turned in Kalyvous.<br/><br/>Except the crude monsters, the citizens of Argus, that is the humans of the story, have a distinctly middle-eastern flavour and the soldiers are called a legion although this is a Roman and not Greek military term. On the other hand the gods inhabit an ethereal universe and their outfit reminds one of seventies pop groups.<br/><br/>The most inspiring moment of the movie is the bonding that exists between Perseus and the team of warriors that follow him in his quest to defeat the Kracken and save Argos. It reminds one the bonding among Ulysses and his comrades- and the similarity goes further since only he survives.<br/><br/>The interplay of gods, humans and monsters is good and attuned with the Homeric poems, where those entities co-existed and manipulated each other. The relations of the godly family are no better than most human families since sibling rivalry is rife between Zeus and his brother Hades, ever envious for his brother's predominance over Olympus while he has been relegated in the shadowy underworld.<br/><br/>Good moments exist and the film has an actor from ""Agora"" who from fiery parabolano has became a hunter thus creating a tradition of portraying characters in a semi-civilized state. The film may be crude and sometimes even buffoonish but I will not agree that it is a total failure since it has some sound moral message about comradeship and courage in the face of odds."
"nikpathak","5","2","4","6 April 2010"," And I thought Terminator IV was bad. Totally lazy reliance on CGI
","Hollywood is best known for its ""professional"" film makers but when you see movies like this it makes you wonder if there should be some heart involved in movie making rather than the algorithmic logic of BO collections surpassing production costs. For the last couple of years there has been a staple diet of sort for producers to churn out remakes which in most cases turn out to be duds. Terminator IV was a prime example of how a great franchise was sabotaged and a complete contrast was Dark knight. This one is in the middle of both though not exactly the mean but kind of skewed more towards the bad part. I had not seen the earlier version (1981) of the movie so I can be more ""unbiased"" towards the so called ""remake"" but this one certainly lacked the soul and basic elementary art of movie making.<br/><br/>I must admit that the trailers and marquee promos of the movie were exciting enough for creation of a buzz which indicated the movie to be ""good"" if not an epic. But the actual 1:45 min 'Tamasha' was nothing short of a ""script gone bad + comic attempt of remake + 3D effects"" all combined. 3D in itself is not an end but mere means to a blockbuster. 'UP' and 'Ice age 3' perfected it while 'Avatar' raised the bar altogether. But this one and Alice in Wonderland proved that using technology as a substitute to content will demean the genre as well as the faith in 3D technology itself. The desert-brown background is dimmed even more by the glasses – something the other 3D movies could cope with due to their vibrant colors – and all panorama wide angle shots appear blotched. The various creatures aren't quite always photo-real, although the sheer size of them – especially the octopus shaped Kraken – are impressive enough but wasted due to screen presence only in minutes. Worthington's acting was largely camouflaged in Avatar due to the naavi avatar but the flaws are glaring in this one The basic undoing of this one is that there's little story here, and everything that was happening was a sad excuse to somehow get the story quickly moving onto the next big 'set' action sequence. The action sequences have a 'inspiration' from the past hits like the Scorpion attacks related to Transformers, Uma Thurman's rendition of Medusa, and Godzilla coming complete with that octopus Kraken. I pity Worthington, who has been only 'half man' for his entire career – 'half machine' in Terminator: Salvation, 'half Naavi in Avatar, and now, 'half god'!! He seems to be perpetually on search for salvation as far as professional and career development is concerned Gemma Arterton is a welcome eye-candy in the film and she seems not to be stereo type into such roles (prince of Persia coming up) and the word ""cougar"" would suit their relationship just fine.<br/><br/>The 3D didn't work enough in this film as it was used only during post production, thanks to the stunning box office success of Avatar. That's not to say that CGI cannot work at all; Jurassic Park is a rare example of effects being used well where the contest is not strong or almost superficial. This one will likely be forgotten since it's nothing more than 'average action drama', though the box office collection due to its marketing would be ensured.<br/><br/>(ONLY) One time watch better if you get a bargain ticket / free popcorn to heal damage to your wallet  <br/><br/>PS 1: I thought Pegasus the winged horse, was white in Greek mythology but I guess the crash (oops ""clash"" I meant to say) made him 'dark'..<br/><br/>PS 2: Sam Worthington may have taken sword fighting lessons in his mothers womb; cos I don't remember him learning it in this movie nor in Avatar / terminator salvation"
"cre8toruk","7","2","4","6 April 2010"," Good but not great
","I went to see this last night at my Odeon cinema, in 3D with my Real D glasses on, I expected to be entertained.<br/><br/>I wasn't disappointed, Real D 3D technology is something to behold at the moment a novelty, but fast becoming the norm. I'm not 100% sure the effect works in all situations especially in this movie, but I can forgive it's imperfections.<br/><br/>This film should have been great, the original film starring Lawrence Olivier won awards and that was nearly 30 years ago ! The fact that is was good but not great is testament I think to the lack of depth that is given to the movie.<br/><br/>At 1 hour and 45 minutes long, the film follows a very simple plot that you're not left in any doubt will be fulfilled by the hero...So like the film Titanic, you know ultimately what will happen, but as with Titanic there's scope to build in sub plots, a love affair, a troubled hero and some really nasty villains... well, in clash the last one only survives. It's a real shame that the visually stunning effects of the 3D genre weren't put to more use and a more grown up film perhaps lasting 2 - 2 1/2 hours wasn't put out.<br/><br/>It's almost like the script was re-written by a five year old.<br/><br/>The cast are excellent and believable, if a little hamstrung by the limited script.<br/><br/>The CGI elements work quite well, but again, once you've seen one giant scorpion, frankly you've seen them all.<br/><br/>There's being faithful to a story and there's being faithful to a story, this one doesn't deviate, so what you end up with is a plot that you know, an outcome that's not in doubt and some big monsters in between.<br/><br/>Chuck in some slow motion stuff (frankly the only point to showing wizzy flight scenes in 3D is in slow motion) and you've got the basis of a good movie...It certainly isn't going to win any awards.<br/><br/>I would just aim a little criticism at both Zeus and Hades (though if I do they might smite me !!;-)), The ultra too shiny armour that Zeus wears, I'm sure is relevant to something, I seem to remember seeing it in the original, but really is that beard necessary too !!? Hades, well the voice, sounding like you've eaten one too many strepsils, again really isn't necessary and belies Ralph Fiennes actual ability to act a menacing character.<br/><br/>All in all worth seeing but don't beat yourself up if you don't get to see it until it comes out on DVD."
"neil-476","7","2","4","5 April 2010"," Quite good. Ish.
","Ray Harryhausen's brand of fantasy was very much to my taste. Harryhausen was cutting edge at the time, but the cutting edge has moved on and I have long wondered what would be the results if Harryhausen's films were to be revisited using state of the art CGI.<br/><br/>Now we have the answer.<br/><br/>This film, though quite clearly based on Harryhausen's original, plays fast and loose with some elements of it but, since the original played fast and loose with myth (both versions feature the Kraken, from Norse myth, for instance) I don't suppose one can complain too much.<br/><br/>There are things to like and things to regard as less than wonderful. Things to like - the effects, for a starter. They are excellent. Mythological monsters have never looked so real. They have followed Harryhausen's design for Medusa, but improved her by way of her having a beautiful face. I would have welcomed her having some dialogue. Ralph Fiennes is a splendidly villainous Hades, Alexa Davalos works wonders with a dismayingly underwritten Andromeda, and Gemma Arterton effortlessly walks away with every scene she is in. I'm glad the comedy owl from the original puts in an appearance, but I'm even more glad that it is no more than a 10 second cameo.<br/><br/>On to the less positive aspects. The 3D adds nothing (as a major 3D fan, it saddens me to say this - see How To Train Your Dragon in 3D, and this one flat). The constantly moving camera during action sequences (Bourne syndrome) is dreadfully distracting. The story is mostly fine, although it loses something by having Perseus' quest driven by anger rather than the need to save Andromeda - a bit of romance would have been welcome. The script is no more than serviceable. Most of the characters are pure cardboard, and Sam Worthington brings no more to Perseus than Harry Hamlin did.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I have noted people commenting that Sam Worthington's accent slips from time to time and his natural Aussie shows through, but I don't think he's actually doing an accent - I think he is au naturel throughout.<br/><br/>If I am honest, the original Clash Of The Titans was essentially an insubstantial romp with great monsters; this remake is pretty much the same."
"Kelchubordnor","4","2","4","5 April 2010"," Watch the original
","Okay if you are a fan of the mythology of Greece etc Zeus and all that. Don't bother with this version. I am a fan of the original film and quite frankly as camp as it may be now it is still superior to this version. Sam Worthington is so angry all the way through understandable without his avatar.......sorry getting confused it's the haircut. Anyways this is so far from the original that it struggles to be honest, and if you sit and pick apart the problems with the myths and Perseus legends etc you will need a lot of paper. Liam Neeson sort of enjoys himself as Zeus and what actually bugs me is the way that he sends Perseus a sword which only works for him (literally it is a hilt to anybody else) and Perseus wont take it and growls ""I do this as a man"", yep sorry but if the Gods are trying to help you. Lets face it if somebody sends you a light-sabre (not literally unfortunately) and all you have is a wooden prop sword.... The mythology and the legend is so messed up and the film basically a case of lets throw CGI at this script and make it better by having far superior effects than the original attempt. The majority of the cast are wasted and the fight scenes quite frankly are too long and boring after a while. This film could have been so much more and better. Shame because I was looking forward to it. I have given this a 4 incidentally simply because I am a Liam Neeson fan. Don't expect much from this movie."
"vivekreddy-1","3","2","4","5 April 2010"," Clash of the morons
","Just watched the supposedly ""3-D"" version. The movie lacks continuity, character development, any sensible dialogue and smart acting. The 3-D effect is not cognizable. All it serves is to make the image look darker and probably give you a headache. After Avatar, I expected better from Sam Worthington. The acting is monotonous and there seems to be no effort put into delivering the dialogues. Of course there is only so much one can do when the script is so ridiculously bad.<br/><br/>The CGI and the boss-like battles at the end of every scene are the only things keeping you from walking out in the middle of the movie. <br/><br/>Save your money or go watch ""How to train your dragon"" again."
"Blueghost","Null","2","4","4 April 2010"," Well.... I kinda liked it.
","Okay, look, for me this film is a vast technical improvement over the one starring Harry Hamlyn toting a clockwork owl. Now, having said that, I've got to admit that like Variety's Brian Lowrey, I too felt like I was watching a rehash of Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"", only set in Ancient Greece with a few minor alterations here and there.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I liked the film. Oh sure, the dialogue was canned, as was the dark feel of the film (a thing I didn't like), but it was entertaining. Truth be told the SFX did overshadow what could have been a better film, but the acting is what it is, solid, not really outstanding as this really isn't high drama (though it could have been).<br/><br/>The action scenes and the brooding by the characters holds back a better film. But the story is solid. In fact, I'd say it's better executed than the original, which to me always felt like a Disney film gone bad.<br/><br/>If I had another complaint, it would be that there's a lack of grittiness about this film. Everything seems to have a dark fantasy sheen painted over it. In fact, with all the twirling overhead shots, browns saturating the picture, and other Pete Jackson like trademarks, I wasn't sure if in fact I wasn't watching a film secretly directed by Peter Jackson himself!<br/><br/>The original film was nothing to brag about. Okay, it took a classic myth and put it on screen, and did so with a kind of artistry that small boys (my friend included) enjoyed, but, beyond that, in spite of a solid cast (Olivier, Meredeith, et al) it didn't fly very well. This new iteration of the classic tale does a slightly better job.<br/><br/>Things to improve upon; lighten up the colors and frame for Zeus' sake. Let us see the true color of the water. I mean this is supposed to be the Mediterranean, not the North Sea. Let us see how Greeks lived. Heck, you don't have to show us an olive press or winery, but show us more than just the Greek equivalent of Japanese citizens running from a mythological Kaiju. <br/><br/>Art direction, other than what I just mentioned, is top notch, though one gets the sense that not all of the props were used to their fullest. That's more of a story fault, if anything, but, the story is what it is, and it's not that bad.<br/><br/>I've got more to say, but I'll let it be for now. It's not the best film ever, but it's got some minor redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>Take a chance, but don't pay extra to see it in 3D."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","4","2","4","4 April 2010"," First modern movie foray into Greek mythology offers little
","A good special-effects era mythology movie is bound to happen at some point, but we're definitely still waiting. ""Clash of the Titans"" is merely a modern incarnation of the original that in the age of CGI monsters and impressive fight sequences plops lazily in the category of status quo, something its 1981 cult predecessor was anything but thanks to the groundbreaking stop-motion work of Ray Harryhausen.<br/><br/>That's where my comparison of these films nearly 30 years apart starts and ends. 2010's ""Clash of the Titans"" has enough faults of its own. It serves up the meat and potatoes we come to expect of any action film, especially in a post-""300"" world of modern swords-and- sandals epics, but there's a definite lack of gravy. No surprises, no unique features -- even star Sam Worthington as the hero Perseus comes off dusty after the true ""titan"" that ""Avatar"" was.<br/><br/>The myth of the Greek hero/demi-god Perseus, though butchered completely in this movie, is still essentially the quest to retrieve the head of Medusa. In ""Titans,"" Perseus finds himself in the troubled city of Argos after his adoptive family is killed by Hades, who has uncharacteristically left his domain in the Underworld because humans have begun acting out in defiance of the gods. Hades gets the gods of Mt. Olympus to agree to unleash his Kracken, the beast who defeated the titans long ago, on Argos if they don't sacrifice their princess, Andromeda, in reverence of the gods.<br/><br/>Angry at the gods himself, (and already embittered by the opinions of his father who not- so-subtly suggests ""someone, someday will take a stand""), Perseus is slightly unhappy to learn he almost is one. He agrees to consult the Fates and learn what he can do to defeat this fearsome beast, but he wants to do it on his terms -- as man, not as a god.<br/><br/>Twisting mythology is small stuff, however, on the list of the script's flaws. It's a typical hero's journey story told almost entirely by dialogue. Not narration, but using dialogue to move the scenes rather than let images and events speak for themselves. It's horribly amateur and as a result the lines are all throwaway. The script speaks of grand themes such as humanity vs. godliness which don't work when you don't care for the humans because the beginning is scraped together and told in this talk-heavy way.<br/><br/>Impressed by the action work on ""The Incredible Hulk,"" I had reasonably high expectations for director Louis Leterrier, but the action scenes are aimless and ill-conceived. I once again fault the trio of inexperienced and low-quality writers, however, because they gave these scenes no shape and which prodded Leterrier toward milking them for whatever they did have, using too many slow-mo shots and the like. He does some great flying camera takes and the Medusa scene turned out fairly exciting -- even though the gorgon was kinda awkwardly sexy, which you can interpret however you like.<br/><br/>The art direction renders mixed results. Medusa's lair was well-conceived and I did like the vision of Charon the Styx ferryman, but the weird shiny armor of the gods was corny and the horrific makeup used to disfigure venerable actors Neeson as Zeus and Fiennes as the oddly asthmatic Hades was below true blockbuster quality. The cgi effects were pretty good, particularly Hades turning into puffs of smoke and such.<br/><br/>Finally -- and no spoilers here -- yes, the Kracken is released, just in case you didn't catch Neeson saying that in every TV spot. Why Warner Bros. wanted to release the Kracken in ads and completely spoil the biggest reveal/tool to shock the audience the movie has is a question is beyond me and says a lot about their confidence in this generic adventure film.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","The whole movie I was trying to find mythological mistakes, there were definitely some, but I am not going to get into them. One I will point out is that, on page 28 of Edith Hamilton's Mythology, ""(HADES) was unpitying, inexorable, but just; a terrible, not an evil god."" This movie denies this mythological fact completely and makes Hades evil. This was the only thing a found hard to watch in the movie, and a big thing in the movie.<br/><br/>The plot is Perseus is found in a box with his deceased mother, by a fisherman. He adopts Perseus and he grows up happy. Later on the family is killed by Hades because people have begun to defy the gods. Perseus is rescued by Argonians and eventually has to find a way to kill Hades (another problem). There are the Fates, only one gorgon, and the Adromadean conflict.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the characters felt somewhat rushed. Draco started off hating Perseus, but five seconds later they were best friends. Andromeda wasn't really properly introduced. Also the other soldiers had distinct personalities, but we were never given any reason for them existing. Perseus and Io were the only characters to have a steady, developing relationship. The Gods could of had more screen time, but it was better than their screen time in Troy (which was none.) <br/><br/>This was a great movie, but not a serious movie; a CGI fest with a good plot. Don't go to this movie expecting some Oscar winning film. Go into this movie expecting to see a lot of great action.

","To begin with I cant believe that nobody has brought this up, but being too young to have seen the original when it came out, this is the only version of this film I have seen and although it went along quite nicely if you know anything about Greek mythology then it will have you cringing in your seat as you watch. The number of mistakes they make are ridiculous and entirely unnecessary. The list could probably go on forever, so I won't try , but I will give a few examples of where it was entirely unnecessary for them to make such mistakes. 1. There is no need to call the fates witches, just call them the fates its what they are. 2. The fates not only had one eye, but also one tooth between them 3. They also live in a cave, not a mountain and weave a tapestry 4. The kraken is a VIKING myth, not a Greek one â€“ but they did have their own sea monsters, so why not use one of those 5. Pereus was not put in a box with his mother by his mothers husband, but her father because he was destined to kill him 6. Perseus also marries Andromeda 7. Io was not given the gift of eternal youth, but turned into a cow These are just a few of the things in this film which i found annoyed me to such an extent that my enjoyment of this film was seriously damaged because of it.

And there's nothing like a movie that you've been dying to watch ever since the viewing the insanely awesome trailer in you tube months ago to escape the effects of a grinding your nose to stone for weeks. And the movie was by Louis Leterrier, whose incredible hulk I'd liked a lot. So I went to watch Clash of the Titans in the theaters on the first day-first show with huge expectations, something akin to 300, since this one also had Greek mythology, and lot of cool action and effects. And believe me, its all there, but something doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>The story i guess is lifted as it is from the mythology, with some cinematic license; whatever it was, it didn't feel very good. The first half seemed to drag, and the second over too soon. Sam Worthington is ""Meh..."" as the main protagonist, Perseus...there's nothing worthwhile.Its actually funny, because he's supposed to be a demi-god, but it was the mortal soldiers accompanying him who saved his ass from those big scorpions. Whatever Perseus does, appears to be sheer, dumb luck. Things just happen with him. Maybe thats the main problem with the whole movie. Things just happen for the sake of happening. Like there are a couple of characters who're just killed off for the sake of it. And then there are some who were not needed at all. (Like the two hunter brothers. I can only conclude their existence was for comic relief, because traditionally , when you're going on a mission, there should be a couple of oddballs in it. And the last time there was a twin brothers for ""comic relief"" ended in a disaster. read transformers 2) Gemma Arterton, who was one of the better things about quantum of solace is given a considerably more screen time here, and well, I like her..I mean, she IS very pretty. Liam Neeson is also okay in his role as Zeus, but its Ralph Fiennes who shines as the God of the underworld. While Mr Neeson looks a bit comical in his white sparkling armor, Fiennes looks every bit of Hades, dark, sinister, and vengeful. Jason Fleming is under-used.<br/><br/>The special effects of the movie is pretty good, but the Kraken disappointed. Its introduction which we've already seen in the trailer is the only worthwhile sequence featuring the Kraken. Its given too little time before Perseus finishes it off, and it didn't feel very scary, for all the big talk beforehand about it being too dangerous and frightening, even for the Gods. The scorpions were actually better than the Kraken. So was Medusa. But for you to actually understand how lame the action sequences were, you should know that there are so many of them in the movie, but not one thats worth mentioning. Except maybe,... maybe the climatic chase scene and the subsequent execution of the Kraken. The background score sucks too.<br/><br/>I was actually telling myself through the whole movie that maybe now the movie will get really interesting, maybe now, maybe now...and then it got over; without satisfying me for a bit. Maybe 'twas because I expected a lot. Watch it if you don't have anything else to do. Maybe you will like it."

","We all know when remakes are done there is a certain methodology to adhering to the original. In this case we fell way short. Yes there were similar characters but the way they developed the story had little to do with the original. I am certain this is in one way to be a stand alone film in it's own right. <br/><br/>The CGI was rampant in this film and was rather tasteless in my opinion. Sam Worthington as Perseus was ok but NO Harry Hamlin. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes were less than stellar in their respective roles. Maybe it is just me but the original held more plausibility. Medusa was down right deplorable in this film compared to the original. Due to the CGI and actors associated with this film I give it a hard fought 6 out of 10."

","There is that difference between the remake of a movie, and it's sequel. This is a remake of the 1981 Clash of the Titans; and when you remake movies, you have to stick to the original's thematic elements. This movie didn't quite do that.<br/><br/>For me, the cons slightly outweigh its pros, hence the 4 of 10. Lots of action to enjoy in the movie; and the updated computer imagery adds more fascination to it including the beautiful, super-fast, serpentine gorgon, Medusa (as opposed to the first movie). But, you can't substitute a good storyline with what I've mentioned. Having seen the first film, I thought this would replicate it with updated stuff. The introduction of mysterious, annoying, guardian angel Io, and the djinns; absence of any romantic whatever between Perseus and Andromeda; and change of theme (first movie, love; second, revenge) and much more all made me dislike the movie. Calibos is more aggressive but if he had a lot more to do, it might have helped matters."

","A big cast that wasn't really required, as the (sometimes overused) CGI Effects steal the show anyway. There are very few scenes without CGI, but admittedly some of these scenes are pretty awesome - especially the desert scorpion battle scene, and the Medusa fighting scene. This is non-stop action and entertainment from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The film is not short on plot flaws and while I won't go into them, I'm just wondering why the powerful Hades needs to transform a mere mortal to pursue and kill Perseus, instead of killing him himself. He was able to 'consume' over a dozen guards in the beginning after all. Liam Neeson seems out of character as Zeus, and I must be honest Ralph Fiennes is way to good an actor for this kind of film. Sam Worthington, on the other hand, makes a worthy protagonist."

This movie is not that interesting and kind of forgettable, but I remember a few details that made me really dislike the movie because it made no sense. The king has no soldiers left to he sends the old and the young on this dangerous mission. But when the city is about to be destroyed you see the king running around with a few soldiers that looks awesome and not old or young, but like regular soldiers. Why did these not go with the others on the mission? Seems like they could have done a lot to help it. But maybe they where not that great because they did not protect the king from getting stabbed. For that matter it is known that the city will be destroyed if not the mission is completed and that the mission will possible, if not probably fail. Why has no one in the city left it? Everyone seems surprised and unprepared when it starts to fall. These where a few details which I really disliked."
"Hey_Sweden","6","0","0","30 August 2017"," Mildly amusing at best.
","This modern day remake of the 1981 fantasy favorite is at least somewhat faithful to its storyline. It spins a yarn based on Greek mythology, when mankind is sick and tired of the tyranny of gods such as all-powerful Zeus (who else but Liam Neeson). Perseus (stone faced Aussie hunk Sam Worthington) is the young hero of the piece, sired by Zeus with a mortal woman. Perseus actually has no desire to live the life of a god, but finds himself drawn into a quest. He and others will journey to the land of the Stygian witches to learn how the monstrous Kraken can possibly be destroyed. At stake is the land of Argos.<br/><br/>From the beginning, it appeared to this viewer that the main reason this movie existed was to swap the charming stop motion animation of legendary special effects man Ray Harryhausen for cutting edge CGI. It's more of a grandiose technical achievement than a story well told, really. Director Louis Leterrier rarely gives us a chance to breathe. Granted, some of the action set pieces are intense, but they also tend to be incoherent at times. The digital effects are variable: the scorpions are pretty cool, but the Kraken, quite frankly, is a washout despite the attempts to convey its immense size. The venture into Medusas' lair should have been a better set piece, but she doesn't come off all that well either. And it's much too bad that Pegasus (referred to here as ""the"" Pegasus) has such a small role to play. The taming of this winged horse was a much more substantial sequence in the original movie. Impressive location shooting (in such places as Ethiopia and the Canary Islands) and thunderous music by Ramin Djawadi can't do a lot to make this version stand out in any way.<br/><br/>Like the visual effects, acting is variable from the usually excellent international cast. ""Clash of the Titans"" 2010 can boast such players as Jason Flemyng, Alexa Davalos, Mads Mikkelsen, Izabella Miko, Liam Cunningham, Nicholas Hoult, Polly Walker, Pete Postlethwaite, Elizabeth McGovern, Alexander Siddig, and Danny Huston. Most of the cast isn't given that much to work with, but the beautiful Gemma Arterton, and a heavily made up Ralph Fiennes, offer standout performances. She plays the wise guiding spirit in Perseus' life, while he plays the vengeful antagonist of the piece: Hades, dark lord of the underworld.<br/><br/>Overall, this is passable entertainment, but it's also awfully forgettable.<br/><br/>Look for a cameo from one of the Harryhausen creations of 1981.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."

This is by no means a great movie, but if you're ""really"" bored, I might recommend it. The worst part is probably at the end when Hades finally appears to fight and he's defeated almost instantly. Also, the dialogue is pretty tacky especially between Zeus and Hades. It's really not much that hasn't been done in much better films.

","Sir Laurence Olivier's film, with Maggie Smith, among other renowned actors, was a film with a script full of magic and fantasy, where the gods participate and have the role that is believed in Ancient Greece. In the new film, it is the same classic Hollywood mistake where the Greeks hate the gods. Perseus hates his father Zeuz, hates all the gods because they punish the men, and from there we go on a bad road. Zeuz can do whatever he wants, he is the creator of everything, therefore, he knows the fate of all men, of all Gods and can control it. I cannot believe that with the special effects we have, we have so bad stories that make the movies do not get that attraction of the viewer.

","Yes there are lots and lots of spoilers! Don't read if you haven't seen it yet and still want to. <br/><br/>I was hesitant in seeing this movie to begin with because I knew I would be disappointed and I was. This is nowhere close to the actual myth: <br/><br/>Perseus's mother didn't die, and was in fact the reason he decided to obtain the head of Medusa. (It was meant as a wedding gift for the king Polydectes, the brother of Dyctus who took them in after they washed ashore. Polydectes wanted a stallion from every household in his kingdom knowing that Perseus could never attain one, hoping that Perseus would flee in shame and Polydectes could make Perseus's mother his lover, Perseus instead insisting on bringing him the head of Medusa.) <br/><br/>Acrisius, though he was a king, was Danae's father, and he was never turned into the hideous monster Calibos, who doesn't even exist in the myth. The Kraken was not part of the myth, it was the monster Cetus. <br/><br/>Though Io does,somewhat, accurately relate the story of how Medusa was turned into a Gorgon, Io herself is not in the myth at all and in fact was a priestess that the Goddess Hera turned into a cow and then drove mad by a gadfly.<br/><br/>Although Athena and Hermes do aid Perseus to an extent, there is very little involvement of the gods at all in the myth. <br/><br/>The part of Andromeda's mother Cassiopeia infuriating the gods who demanded she sacrifice Andromeda was almost correct. Cassiopeia did claim that Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereids, which infuriated Poseidon, they were the daughters of his friend and another sea-god Nereus, and he demanded Andromeda be sacrificed to Cetus. This was not the reason for Perseus to attempt obtaining the head of Medusa though, see above. This was more or less a coincidence on his way home as he traveled through Aetheopia.<br/><br/>He did not have Pegasus when he traveled to find Medusa either, as Pegasus was the child of Poseidon and Medusa and sprung fully-formed from Medusa's severed neck when Perseus slew her. <br/><br/>There are many more inaccuracies,though these are the most obvious. Some viewers may not care about these, however it is something of importance when a movie is retelling a myth or story that it be accurate. <br/><br/>The other problems with this movie is the wooden performances, Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes just appear to be going through the motions and don't want to be there at all, same for Sam Worthington who appears to only be in it to collect a paycheck.<br/><br/>The special effects are overused and take away from the movie rather than enhance it. Also, back to the inaccuracies, Cetus was said to be either a giant shark or whale.<br/><br/>Movie as a whole was disappointing and probably not something I would watch again, nor recommend to anyone else."

","In 29 September 2015, I wrote a review about the Terminator Genysis. Interestingly, I can pretty much copy and paste that review on this movie.<br/><br/>I admit, I went to see Clash of the Titans for Sam Worthington, Medusa and Kraken. I saw the original movie but not attached to it. Now I found out, I was the target audience, so all I can get are watching Sam Worthington, Medusa and Kraken, NOTHING ELSE: the Hollywood suits think audience are dumb enough to accept a script below standard as long as there are big budgets on big stars, bigger props and visual effects.<br/><br/>The script in T5 is lame, at least the characters' actions have a logic and reasons. After watching the Clash of the Titans in 2010, I was baffled at that time: <br/><br/>Wow, Zeus is a rapist by pretending the victim's husband. He sent the thunder to punish the angry husband, but did nothing when the poor woman and baby Perseus fell into the sea. When Perseus grew up, Zeus just showed up and said, ""Hi, I am you dad, I have superpower, despite what I did to your mother, even I did nothing to raise you and never contact you before, worship me, son!"" Way to go, dad!! <br/><br/>Perseus and Andromeda are basically strangers to each other throughout the whole movie. Why the first time she met him, knowing nothing about that humble fisherman at the end of the hall, went forward to give him a drink with sympathy? Have they really known each other then? Nope, there is no connection, bonding, or any relationship between the hero and the princess, the whole adventure of Perseus turned a puppet show without necessity and human emotions. To take a revenge on Hades is neither important nor exciting to audience, alright? <br/><br/>Why the team went on the trip without horses? How far could they go on foot in ten days? Even a child can tell that is unrealistic and not practical. Why the team so accepted the existence of Io? She showed up from nowhere but none of the soldiers questioned why a hot woman was following them, and none of them has reaction to her beauty, those soldiers were made of paper or cardboard? <br/><br/>Why the two hunters joined the trip? Why Draco was mean to Perseus in the beginning, and later he suddenly turned so kind to teach Perseus sword fighting? Why the big scorpions are so lethal and suddenly turned to be vehicles? Why the creature made of wood came to help them? Why Calibos in his final scene changed his attitude towards Perseus? Why none of the soldiers in the palace protect Andromeda and let her kidnap by the mobs easily? Why Andromeda in her final scene knew her father was dead? <br/><br/>Motivations, interactions and emotions of characters, mostly are unconvincing and blank due to the lack of logic and reasons in the script, which made the movie fell into pieces of fake and crap.<br/><br/>The worse is, the movie made enough box office despite of bad reviews, so the studio made the worse sequel, the Wrath of Titans; Wow, they do think audiences are too dumb to find out the script they approved, is hollow and bad!<br/><br/>Alongside with T5, Pompeii, the Legend of Hercules, it proves that some Hollywood suits take movie making merely a business and figures on spreadsheets."

","As a whole people have a difficult time accepting help whether it be from friend or foe. Generally speaking, a person carries emotional baggage with them that affects their decisions for good and for bad. A large part of this baggage is passed down to us by our parents and those who influenced our lives early on. Sometimes this results in the acceptance of help and other times it compels us to refuse help out of pride, shame or any number of secondary emotions.<br/><br/>These thoughts coalesced during a secondary viewing of remake of the film, ""Clash of the Titans"". While the movie did fail on many levels, what it did get right was the above message. Perseus throughout the entire story, refused his father, Zeus' assistance. In his mind he needed to prove and to know and that he wasn't like the other gods and that a human could accomplish great deeds. Only once, he was able to cut off Medusa's head without godly assistance was he able to accept that he could allow Zeus' offerings; a Pegasus and a sword.<br/><br/>This is not something that is exclusive to a narrative. Everyday we make decisions that have the potential to be based on qualities passed onto us that he feel shame or pride in. Often, these decisions limit our potential and what we are able to accomplish in our lifetime. On the extreme end of that, those who cannot cope with their baggage may even descend into a lesser life lived. There is no one path for a person to take in order to work through this baggage and achieve happiness. It is accomplished through trial and error. One person may have to reconcile their feeling about a perceived inadequate parent while another person has to cut a monster's head off. It's all a matter of interpretation."

","I am truly torn on what to rate this movie.. as a stand alone movie it was about a 5 maybe a 3 at best... however if you went to see or buy this movie with the original one in mine I would have to give it a 1 ... because the two movies had absolutely nothing in common other then the title in my eyes.. They totally rewrote the story to the point that other then some of the characters names it had zero in common. To be honest I also think they it was not written as well as the original. it is mostly the special effects that carried it the acting was not terrible but it wasn't good either. I believe all in all I can sum it up with a simple sentence if you are going to do a rewrite at least improve upon the original."

","After defeating the Titans, the Gods created mortals, whose faith & prayers would assure their immortality. However, through time, the mortals lose their faith in the Gods so they stop praying and also destroy a statue of Zeus. To punish the mortals' defiance, Hades is given leave by Zeus to go to the city of Argos to tell King Cepheus & Queen Cassiopeia that if Princess Andromeda is not sacrificed to the Gods, he will release the Kracken to destroy them & their city. Perseus, who lost his family when Hades arrived, learns here that he is a demigod, son to Zeus, and that he is the only one who can defeat the Gods and save Argos.<br/><br/>Devout fans of the original 1981 Clash of the Titans will probably hate this film without even seeing it and will treat it as some sort of blasphemy but in all honesty this version is actually a very decent remake. Is it better? Well, yes and no. It's not any better (or worse for that matter) for telling a version of the story of Perseus defeating the Kracken, but it's obviously miles better in showing that story with the acting, action, and the visuals.<br/><br/>Obviously the original version is extremely dated now, but it's still a classic in it's own right, and while the effects will probably be laughed at by a lot of people these days, for 1981 they were cutting edge and were well done, especially for the time. Will this be classed as a classic? I very much doubt it, but that doesn't mean it's not worth watching and it doesn't mean that both cannot be enjoyed just as much equally.<br/><br/>The visuals & the effects are fantastic all round, especially for the Kracken, and while the Medusa scenes were decent, I must admit the original film's showing was better, not because of the action or the effects, but because of the sheer mood & creepy atmosphere. Even to this day, I remember watching those scenes when I was about 7 or 8 and being genuinely creeped out.<br/><br/>This isn't a jaw-dropper by any stretch, but it's still a very good movie."

","""Clash of the Titans"" is one of the most anticipated films of my life. I was dazzled by the trailer involving awesome looking visuals that promised a fun theatrical experience. Little did I know director Louis Leterrier would use his ability to make a spectacular looking epic to a bare minimum. ""Clash of the Titans"" is a remake of the original involving Greek mythology. Perseus (Sam Worthington), mortal son of Zeus (Liam Neeseon), battles the minions of the underworld to stop them from conquering heaven and earth in this disappointment. We all remember in the trailer seeing Liam Neeson shout ""release the Kraken"" in electric energy. Honestly, some of us probably saw ""Clash of the Titans"" because of that line. This story has all the potential elements of a stupid, breathtakingly amazing looking CGI fest to dazzle audiences in 3D. Where do we begin? The 3D first of all was sued after the success of ""Avatar"" and has absolutely no ability to make the audience feel in the film itself b y visual means. It doesn't even have 3D potential. All the creatures seen in the trailer are all you see, and for about the same length of time. Scorpions, the Kraken, creepy bats, Madussa, and more are used minimally. They look spectacular, but are hardly used! More monster mashing please! The Kraken is especially remarkable. He's in it for about a minute. Instead of having a bunch of dazzling visuals thrown at us, we're forced to sit through some of the most pretentious, ludicrous, pathetic destiny-driven aspects that bore us to tears. With a huge budget, a studio known for producing blockbusters, and a plot that revolves around monsters and unique creatures, it sickens me that the remarkable visuals were not used enough."

","Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Mads Mikkelsen, Alexa Davalos and Gemma Arterton star in this 2010 fantasy remake of the 1981 classic. Worthington (Avatar) plays young man, Perseus who loses his adopted family to evil God, Hades (Fiennes).

Perseus is chosen to go on a quest to save the kingdom of Argos and Princess, Andromeda (Davalos) by battling mythic beasts and facing Hades. Mikkelsen (Casino Royale) plays Draco, Captain of the King's guard who helps Perseus. Though the original is superior, this isn't a bad remake featuring a good cast, great score & neat effects.

","Clash of the Titans was for me the best action, adventure fantasy of 2010. Fantastic CGI, especially on Medusa and The Kraken and a well written storyline made this film one of my favourite reboots. The action scenes were epic and very enjoyable to watch. The acting was inconsistent however, Sam Worthington doesn't have a great range for an actor and as i had seen other films with him in in the same year i found him quite monotonous. However, Ralph Fiennes was a superb Hades and as a character who should be feared, he did not disappoint. Among the other actors, Liam Neeson and Jason Fleming were also impressive in their roles. It is a typical action blockbuster that is very enjoyable to watch."

","Clash of the Titans goes to show the importance of a good story for a movie, even if it is a couple of thousands of years old. Of course, if you're awaiting an ancient Greek myth brought to screen you'd be disappointed.<br/><br/>As far as i understood there has been a whole genre called sword-and-sandal or similar which were basically historical epics. I even remember seeing several of those as a child, at a time when The Lord of the Rings has been merely fantasy aficionado's literature. Although old, they have definitely offered stories different from my ordinary movies at a time, despite the outdated special effects.<br/><br/>Given the strong story you might expect that contemporary CGI might help improve the viewers' experience, but you'd be just partially right. CGI is superb in Clash of the Titans, yet we've seen a whole bunch of it when the aforementioned The Lord of the Rings turned mainstream, thanks to Peter Jackson's adaptation. And all the mythical creatures are but a fraction of the fauna populating the worlds we've seen afterwards.<br/><br/>Eventually, we've been left with a Hollywood blockbuster full of half-witted dialog and superior CGI."

","""Timeo danaos, et dona ferentes,"" as Julius Caesar himself said. Perseus is the legendary founding father of the Mycean Danaans, but in this film, beware of what he bears: a lackluster performance in a lackluster remake.<br/><br/>The plot substitutes Hades for Poseidon as the wrathful God, and Perseus' female chaperone Io for princess Andromeda. The main purpose of the latter seems to be to allow a female character to tag along for the quest; maybe not necessary when you are making a teen-boy action film.<br/><br/>The strangest thing about this movie is the mash-up of special effect elements from other fantasy films, rather than coming up with its own elements. For instance, we have Ray Harryhausen's scorpions blown to gigantic size, so like the oliphaunts in ""The Lord of the Rings"" they can bear tents on their backs guided by desert people.<br/><br/>The script writing is weak (Perseus curses ""like hell"" a lot, instead of ""like Hades""; his motive is base revenge instead of noble love and salvation; etc) and derivative (of the original and LOTR of all things!), the characters are pretty anemic, with the Gods more human than the humans.<br/><br/>A mediocre film than can be watched once, not bad enough to get upset about, not good enough to displace any of the memes created by Harryhausen for the Perseus myth."

","Clash of the Titans is directed by Louis Leterrier and collectively written by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay, Matt Manfredi and Beverley Cross (1981 film version). It stars Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Jason Flemyng, Mads Mikkelsen, Liam Cunningham and Gemma Arterton. Music is by Ramin Djawadi and cinematography by Peter Menzies Jr.<br/><br/>Perseus (Sam Worthington) is the mortal son of Zeus (Neeson), who has to battle the hellish minions of the underworld to stop them from conquering the Earth and the heavens.<br/><br/>There's a lot of fondness for the original 1981 version, which while understandable, and it features the considerable talents of effects maestro Ray Harryhausen, it is hardly a great picture anyway. So with that in mind it didn't seem such a bad idea to remake it with all the current advancements in special effects to hand. Then there is a pretty great roll call of actors filing in to star in it, while for fans of 3D that was also an option to potentially savour. How come, then? It ended up such a big dull dud?<br/><br/>The blame for that falls at the door of the writers, who come up with an unadventurous story. Film's trajectory basically sees Worthington and his band of grumpy men set off to kill The Kraken, where they of course stop off a couple of times to slay some hellish nasties. It's all very muscular with slice and dice and shouting, but the trouble is is that this band of not very merry man just don't look or act the part, especially Worthington, who still looks like the grunt from Avatar. While dangling hair extensions on and applying make-up to the others doesn't make them underworld warriors, it's still Cunningham with a weird accent - Neeson in spangly costume - Flemyng being Flemyng - and Nicholas Hoult being in the wrong movie.<br/><br/>The effects work is very hit and miss. Giant scorpions score well and provide one of the high action points, even if you will struggle to see who is actually being killed in the ensuing mêlée and the winged horse segments are beautifully done. But on the flip-side is the awful Medussa footage (Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova donning the snake wig) and the 3D moments just feel like tagged on gimmicks (oh wait, they are). Dialogue is often served with a helping of Brie, and come the finale you will wonder what exactly was the mission about in the first place? In fact was it ever made clear? I'm not sure, such was the waft of tepidness that cloaked my brain.<br/><br/>It plays like a video game and is badly written, while costuming never once convinces. Were it not for some fun to be had with Fiennes as Hades and the slice and dice machismo, this would be a total write off and no sequel would follow... 5/10"

Hollywood had to touch the classics because they are out of ideas. Most of them are failures and this version is a mediocre of the original. <br/><br/>I never went into any of the characters because the makers were more busy with the CGI used then with the story itself. It do has a few good moments like with the scorpions but there wasn't anything new to see. Th world of the Gods and the humans didn't work for me. It worked in Thor (2011) or in Immortals (2011). But in both those flicks we had a bit of brutality a thing we are missing here. Sometimes it even reminded me a bit of another failure, Van Helsing (2004). The problem there was too the fact that they forgot to put an actual story to it. Just have a look here. The metal owl that was important in Ray's flick is only shown for a few moments. What I did like and worked was Medusa.<br/><br/>They couldn't make it without CGI and I have nothing against it as it works but here it took the overhand and you never really get into the story. While writing my review I'm thinking who played who and that's not a good point.<br/><br/>Still, it entertains and for those never seen Ray's version it will deliver. But I was more into Ray's version. Maybe they went for a low rating so children could attend it at theatres. There's no nudity and no blood to spot.

","Another point is proved with this film. Hollywood has no more ideas for a decent film! So, let's remake some. And we pick good old ""Clash of the Titans"" (1981), the classic adventure film, with greatly adapted characters and story from Greek mythology. I mean, so many things about this old movie was good, I watched it as a kid, and I was blown away, especially by Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion monsters, his Medusa... scary... his Kraken... amazing... the music score was astonishing. But this remake... well here goes...<br/><br/>Story is entirely different, well let's be blunt and short. The story, characters and special effects were modified for a today's audience, I mean, you can't argue with that fact. But, it also doesn't mean that is good. Now, This is extremely expensive film, and what is it exactly? An abundance of CGI, nothing more. The movie's runtime is an hour and 20 minutes... I expected something like... two and a half hours, but we just got a fast film that is filled with special effects, that's just it. No emotions, here's bunch of computer effects and they were good... but sucked. The CGI was sooo... artificial, and when I remember the stop-motion from old version... that was freaking real! It was there, simply it was there. But these... damn! Now, a star Sam Worthington, well he was not all that bad, but he constantly speaks in some low tones and, honestly he can do more than that, come on man, you're not Steven Seagal, free that voice of yours! Liam Neeson as Zeus? Well, pretty cool, if you ask me. But still, again in some father like role... Ralph Fiennes as Hades? Good, he was OK. But, when I heard that James Woods showed interest to play Hades in live action film... I thought... that would be a joke. Alexa Davalos as Andromeda... good, she was OK, haven't seen her in long time. Gemma Arterton as Io? Who's she? She was not needed. Waste of time character. Jason Flemyng as Calibos? He is a good actor, but I expected someone bigger and more menacing. This Calibos is nothing but a berserk monster, the original one was more scary and commanding... Mads Mikkelsen, Danny Houston and Luke Evans perhaps... well they were OK in their own terrain...<br/><br/>Now, other things as costumes and music score, those were OK, perhaps two things that worth in this film. And Pete Postlehwaite, one of his last films, RIP Pete, he was one of the best.<br/><br/>So, if you want, watch it. Don't listen to me. And one more thing, I won't deny that I enjoyed in adventure."

","Pulverisingly loud and in-your-face blockbuster retelling the legend of Perseus, Hollywood style. As is Hollywood's wont, a lesser-known actor gets the main part, surrounded by bigger-name character actors in support to give the project some heft, but everything here is in thrall to the booming soundtrack and especially the special effects.<br/><br/>These are plentiful and eye-popping at times, each sequence obviously setting out to top the preceding one, with the battle against a slithering, mesmerising Medusa only topped with the attack of the Krakken at the climax.<br/><br/>Characterisation, again as is the norm, is slim, with the dialogue wooden and pretentious by turns. A little post-modern ironic humour wouldn't have gone amiss methinks instead of the odd mixture of contemporary modern and studiously archaic language on show here.<br/><br/>As for the acting, no-one rises above the SFX, with Liam Neeson an unlikely Zeus and Ralph Fiennes almost indecipherable as Hades, while Worthington appears too squat for the heroic role of Perseus, although there's no doubting his athleticism.<br/><br/>All that said, while the purists would probably hate it and liken it to a Disney park thrill-ride, as one who has ambitions to return to Florida next year, this whetted my appetite considerably."

","Okay so this is a movie about Greek mythology and a very shallow and narrow one at that. To put it simply this movie pretty much sucks, there is almost nothing special about this movie and almost nothing stands out. The plot is very narrow and simple, sort of like going from point A to point B but there is nothing really imaginative or creative or even entertaining about it. The actor Sam Worthington came out of nowhere and was in ""Terminator Salvation"", ""Avatar"" and now this. And I guess Hollywood is trying to sell him off as the next big thing but he just plays a boring and generic character in everything I saw in him so far, which is few but still. If this was a video game cut-scene it might be somewhat forgivable but it's not. In fact watching the video game ""God of War"" is more entertaining than this. The CGI is alright but nothing all that special and same elements has been done before and can get kinda crappy sometimes for a movie that was released in 2010. The movie is about a half human half god guy named Perseus(Same Worthington) rising up against the gods. Liam Neeson looks the part and fits Zeus very well but his character is easily manipulated. The gods in this movie just seem pretty weak mentally and there powers seem far from being omnipotent. But some parts in the Greek mythology is like this but it gets sort of awkward in a negative way because the gods in this seem too human sometimes. Ralph Fiennes plays Hades who is sort of the opposite of Zeus in some ways. Which is interesting because the last time these two actors played opposites in the same movie was in ""Schindler's List"". One aspect I liked about this movie though personally is how it shows how arrogance can lead to downfall including when it comes to the mortals. I also find it interesting how Luke Evans who plays Apollo in this will play Zeus in ""Immortals"". For marketing reason this film goes 3D as well at last minute and the outcome isn't very good. I haven't seen the original but I have a feeling that it must be better than this. The man build up is for the Kraken and even that was disappointing, it's very short and it's nowhere close to a epic fight. Hollywood does a good job of making the trailers way more epic than the movie itself and that applies this.<br/><br/>3.6/10"

Kraken scene is the best. I felt what was really missing from it is the heart and the acting (besides Liam Neeson, solid as usual). It felt like director tried to simplify already simple story, which in turn made it look extremely hollow. Sam Worthington couldn't do what he did in Avatar and terminator - look charismatic hero. in fact at times he looks quite degenerate - but i think it's the producer's fault for cutting all the ""unnecessary"" scenes.

For instance instead of Darth Vader being Anakin Skywalker and the father of Luke our hero, he's the governor of some planet under some sort of mind control by the Emperor. Instead of Rancor being owned by Jabba the Hutt, it is now controlled by Lando. Instead of Han and Lea falling in love, Han runs off with some female Jedi he met while Lea is left all alone. Well if you think that this would be a terrible idea then don't see the remake of Clash of the Titans. The story line has been rehashed so badly that it only resembles the original story in this respect, a hero named Perseus must find three witches to find and defeat Medusa to use her head to defeat the Kraken. That's it, the rest of the movie takes elements of the original and turns them inside out. Calibos, a major villain in the original was just a wasted character in this movie as well as being someone else other than the original love of Andromeda and the caretaker of the Pegasus which he hunted down and killed all but one. Instead in this movie Calibos was the king who sent Perseus and his mother out to sea. The Kraken a monster sent to destroy the town was in the original a creature of Poseidon. Instead in this film the Kraken was released by Zeus by the suggestion of Hades??? In the original Perseus and Andromeda was married and ruled the people with kindness. In this movie Perseus blows her off and runs off with a demigod (I think that's what she was). This was just a garbled mess of a movie.<br/><br/>Clash of the Titans takes a classic film and turns it into a Michael Bay movie. Now I don't mind remakes and Clash of the Titans was certainly a movie I didn't mind being remade as the original (while a very good movie) lacked the special effects a movie like this deserved. So in the modern age of CGI I was excited to hear that Clash of the Titans was being remade. But this movie was all style and no substance. The story was just not there to carry the special effects.<br/><br/>Perseus was mediocre at best. I didn't understand why a fisherman would have a military style haircut (The soldiers back then did actually cut their hair like that, just as they do today) and he seemed to despise them as well.<br/><br/>The Kraken's scene at the end of the movie was a big disappointment as well, for the most part nothing really happened with him other than being turned to stone after arising from the sea.<br/><br/>The Harpies were cool but by the end of the movie I was sick of seeing them, the same goes for the scorpions.<br/><br/>Hades voice was atrocious.<br/><br/>But not all was bad. Medusa was done well and the movie decided to not have Bobo in it except for a very short scene as a joke.<br/><br/>In the end though this movie was just a huge disappointment.

","I was really anticipating this title when I first laid eyes on the first trailer and being a fan of Greek mythology I immediately geeked out with what I saw. It showed such promise especially when it showed the kraken at the end of the trailer. After seeing this on opening day, I left the theater mildly satisfied but really entertained. In terms of story, it's about a man named Perseus whose family has just been murdered by the gods themselves and wishes to seek revenge and in order to do so, he is given an opportunity when the gods have threatened to destroy the city of Argos if the princess is not sacrificed to them by the eclipse. What follows is basically a quest type of film that is action packed . That's basically what the story is with a few supporting characters that deserved better character development. <br/><br/>The film's cast delivered a somewhat convincing performance but to be honest I thought the acting could've been a tad bit better like Sam Worthington for instance. His acting is alright for the past movies I've seen him in like Terminator Salvation and Avatar, but for a movie like this, he just didn't convince me. Liam Neeson was pitch perfect as Zeus. It was almost like a match made in heaven. No pun intended, as well as Ralph Fiennes as Hades was great as well and if you look at them you would actually believe that they were brothers in real life. They just have great chemistry. The rest of them were just there for show but Gemma Arterton is beautiful as always.<br/><br/>The film's action sequences was the bright light of the film. In my opinion it had some of the best CG I've seen so far (if you watch it in 2D) clearly this movie was originally made for 2D and only slapped in the 3D effect in post production or so I heard and also heard that It didn't look great at all. All I could say about these action sequences was that it really kept me at the edge of my seat especially on the scorpioch fight scene. Not all of you might agree with me about the action scenes but this is just my opinion is all. But the biggest disappointment would be the kraken fight. I mean seriously watch the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about<br/><br/>Overall if you are ever in the mood for just sitting back, turning off you're mind and just enjoy mindless action with huge monsters then you can't go wrong with Clash Of The Titans.

The 3-D is attractive, but doesn't really add much.<br/><br/>The story has been shuffled around from the original film, but basically is faithful to the premise. A few characters were traded for new ones, in order to tweak some scenes. The Medusa/Perseus chess-match battle was one of the best scenes of the original, but this film eschews that in favor of a wild CGI free-for-all that looks more like a soccer match. Like many action scenes, there's an overwhelming amount of stuff hitting you in the face all at once. Medusa herself looks more like a Bay Watch babe than a hideous creature that can turn you to stone.<br/><br/>The Hades plot is unnecessary. Just bring on the Medusa, the scorpions, the witches, and ""Release the Kraken!"" That's all this story needed. But give the CGI wizards credit; the Kraken makes a pretty cool debut.<br/><br/>It's a decently fun ride, an ambitious but flawed effort."

","I would say this is definitely more of a special effects action film than anything else. If your looking for character development, and plot, then you probably won't like this movie. The film is based around Perseus (Sam Worthington) son of the mighty god Zeus (Liam Neeson) who must go on a journey to defend Earth against Haitis (Ralph Fiennes), and the underworld. I never cared at all for these characters, but it did certainly a good job at keeping me entertained throughout the film. I saw this film in 3D, which didn't really make any difference to the film, maybe because it was converted to 3D at the last second. Sam Worthington has been in quite a few blockbusters lately (Avatar you may have heard of, Terminator Salvation, and now Clash of the Titans). Liam Neeson gives a nice performance as Haitis, although he was barely in it, but that's the best you'll get in the acting category. Overall, this is a fun popcorn movie sure to please, well, any popcorn movie fan. 6/10."

The only gods who got much screen time were Zeus and Hades (I think Apollo and Poseidon were the only others who spoke or got close-ups!). The plot didn't need to be changed, they should have stuck to the old one and just updated it a bit - fans are always going to be put out when they change much loved stories like that. <br/><br/>The 3D wasn't so great either, for those who haven't seen it yet, you might as well save your money and go and see the non-3D version because if you're expecting something as good, visually, as Avatar, you will be sadly disappointed.<br/><br/>In fact, the only thing that improved it for me was the CGI - if the original could have had the special effects that this version had then there would have been no need to remake it at all!"

No. The new storyline is more elaborated, fresh and catchy. I think they really nailed it with the changes they made on the plot. The story is now easier to understand and its more appealing to the audience. There's nothing to miss about the old one. The whole dream-thing and the vulture was absolutely ridiculous. The changes made to the plot were necessary.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the characters aren't flat anymore-like in the 1981 version. These (characters) are deeper, more complex and seem more real to the point that the audience can easily identify with them. For instance, the new Perseus is not your typical hero. He is shown as a regular human being, with flaws,conflicts and all. (Plus, he really knows how to fight,unlike the other one!)<br/><br/>The bottom line is, this movie is more believable than the ""old "" clash. Its far more entertaining, the plot is more dynamic. There's not a thing not to like about this movie. <br/><br/>And sure, it is not true to the ancient Greek mythology. But who cares? If it were, it'd be plain boring.

"3xHCCH","4","3","8","13 April 2010"," An Emotionally Hollow Remake
","I confess I watched the original 1981 film again recently in preparation for watching this remake. There was not any way for me to watch this new movie without making comparisons with the earlier movie. By the way, I only watched the 2D version.<br/><br/>I can safely say that this new movie did not really make a significant improvement on the original film. Yes, the two movies are both have Perseus as the main hero. Some details from the first movie still appear, like Pegasus, the Stygian witches, Medusa and the Kraken. Even the wretched mechanical owl Bubo makes an appearance, thankfully in only a short cameo.<br/><br/>Harry Hamlin is not really that much of an actor. But vis-a vis Sam Worthington, Hamlin is an Oscar winner! First of all, Worthington looks terribly out of place there, having not a shred of Greek appearance in him at all. And more importantly, he had very weak charisma as the hero of this epic. And with him, the whole enterprise simply collapses.<br/><br/>It did not help that Perseus' all-important love affair with Andromeda is NOT even part of this new film! This gave the whole movie the totally different direction and perspective, opposite from what was originally in the myths which were supposed to have inspired it. The origins of Calibos and the scorpions were also changed, though not necessarily for the better. And, where on earth did the character of Perseus' guardian angel Io come from? That said, the actress who played Io (the beautiful Gemma Arterton) is, for me, the best part of the new movie.<br/><br/>Now how about the special effects? Yes, Ray Harryhausen's stop motion animation in the first movie already looks dated. But still, the Medusa sequence in the first movie remains superior than the very artificial, CG version here. The very palpable suspense, tension and scare factor of the original was NOT present in this new version. I must say though that the Pegasus special effects of this new movie, especially the flying scenes, were beautifully done. Too bad its role was lazily shoehorned in so conveniently and illogically.<br/><br/>Overall, I am disappointed in the way the script was written and the way the whole thing was acted out and executed by the director. For an action movie, yes, it was OK. However, there are expectations when it is an epic mythical story that is being told. There had been too much concentration on the special effects extravaganza, such that a lot of the all-important story was lost in the adrenaline rush. The whole film did not really work too well for me."

In some of the scenes, you cannot even understand what is really happening, how many beasts there are and who is fighting with whom. And please what about the romance? Boy and girl meet; and after 2 days they fall in a great great love... And they only talked for, what 10 minutes. In conclusion, story, script, directing are below average. It s not worth watching for only visual effects."
"jcgarner","7","3","8","3 April 2010"," Ridiculous But Satisfying
","I admit myself a bit biased (and therefore a failure as a film critic) when it comes to Clash of the Titans for several reasons. Firstly, as a young lad I fell in love with the 1981 original. I still occasionally watch the film, although it is more of a nostalgic experience rather than an entertaining one. Second, as a former student of classical Greek mythology, I'm always interested in the newest depictions of the ancient Greek characters and legends, no matter how much of a Hollywood treatment they may have received. Thirdly, the film boasts two of my all time favorite actors: Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, longtime friends who are sharing the screen for the first time since the Holocaust masterpiece, Schindler's List. For these reasons and more, I have closely followed the development of this film from the scripting and casting process all the way to the heartbreaking news that it would be receiving the 3D treatment. <br/><br/>The story is loosely based on the thousand year old legend, while adding elements of the 1981 original. The filmmakers have also added elements of their own, which I believe was a wise choice since everyone and their mother should know the basic story. Sam Worthington is Perseus, the demigod who is chosen to save the city of Argos from the Kraken, a great big beast with an appetite for the young virgin princess, Andromeda. As an action hero, Worthington is great. But for a fisherman who claims to be nonviolent, it's odd to see him walk, talk, and grimace as though he's about to jump into a boxing ring. There's also the never aging Io, Perseus's lifelong protector and possible love interest, played by Gemma Arterton, who serves the film mainly to stand around and look good. Neeson and Fiennes play Zeus and Hades, and are great as usual, but the real scene stealer in this film is Danish actor Mads Mikkelson. You probably last saw him in Casino Royale as James Bond's blood weeping nemesis. In Clash, he plays Draco, a hardened warrior who supports Perseus on his journey but is hesitant to respect him.<br/><br/>The 1981 original used impressive claymation to create the beasts and monsters; today's film uses CGI, and results in some of the best visual effects I've seen in years. There are plenty of giant scorpions, winged horses, and of course, the Kraken, all of which look terrific. Medusa's design is disappointing, but the scene leading up to her beheading is thrilling and satisfying. Another surprise is the use of landscapes, which I believe were filmed in Ethiopia. If you really want to enjoy the visuals, stick to the 2D theaters. This is the way director Louis Leterrier intended it to be viewed, and you'll only miss out on a few credits flying through the screen. <br/><br/>I enjoyed this film, but I'm afraid a lot of audiences won't. I suppose it's hard to be accepted as a fantasy movie in the serious world of post-Lord of the Rings Hollywood. Clash of the Titans is a relatively simple film about gods, beasts, and plenty of battles. There are plenty of ridiculous bits of dialogue, impossible stunts, beheadings, and de-limbings. I would call it lighthearted and fun. A lot of viewers will use words like ""silly"" and ""dumb."" Does it have its flaws? Yes. Am I happy I saw it? Absolutely."
"TheXeroXone","8","3","8","2 April 2010"," CLASH!! Ahh-Aaah! Savior of the Universe!!
","First of all, you have to acknowledge that the original Clash of the Titans was a weak storyline that focused more on special effects than plot line and this one, essentially, is no worse.<br/><br/>The storyline is different than the original in that here the gods are the antagonists of all humans and humans stand upon brink of abandoning the apathetic gods who need human worship to survive. There is also a subplot that pits the gods against themselves, which is kind of cliché, but as I said, this film is more about the visuals.<br/><br/>The majority of the main characters of the original are also in this film. The guards who follow Perseus on his quest are developed better and thus their respective demises are felt more. Calibos and Medusa are humanized more than their original counterparts and become more than mere antagonists, but extreme versions of the godly interventions upon man that Perseus is fighting to put an end to. The Kraken is a great menace, but somehow lacks the visual personality of the original Harryhausen masterpiece. However, the Stygian witches are wonderfully grotesque and Charon looks more impressive than the standard Grim Reaper.<br/><br/>The playwright is woefully missing, but instead replaced with Io who guides Perseus with knowledge and wisdom. Also, instead of Bobo the Owl (who makes an obligatory cameo) we get a half-Ent with blue flames for eyes who rides around on giant scorpions and offers abilities above and beyond the average action figure.<br/><br/>Perseus is also more developed in this film, however I can't say I like his new look. No longer is Perseus a Mediterranean pretty boy, but looks more like a mid-western jarhead. His motivations also mirror Batman's motivations a little too much (His parents are killed in front of him and he has an aversion to using divine weapons like the ones that killed his parents).<br/><br/>All in all, this film is a lot of fun. There is a lot that is cheesy and over the top, but its a quality entertainment piece. I recommend it to all fans of the original.<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10"

","Never mind that Clash of the Titans play fast and loose with the mythological story of Perseus. Never mind that Medusa wasn't a Titan. Never mind that the Kraken is from Scandinavian mythology, and that casting Lawrence Olivier as Zeus in the 1981 version was sort of typecasting.<br/><br/>The new Clash of the Titans is a darker, grittier more realistic Bronze age world than the 1981 version, but the story hasn't changed all that much. The citizens of Argos have become disenchanted with the rule of the Gods. The Gods have caused too much chaos and ruin to their lives so they've decided to take their destinies into their own hands, and destroy the temples and statues of the Gods. In doing so, Perseus'(Sam Worthington) family is killed by a falling statue of Zeus. When Zeus (Liam Neeson) learns of the desecration urged on by Hades (Ralph Fiennes), he decides to destroy the city in four days or they can offer the sacrifice of the King of Argos' daughter Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). In a visit to the throne room of Argos, Hades lets it slip that Perseus is a son of Zeus, a demi-god. Being told of his near divinity, Perseus and a group of soldiers go off on their quest to save the city.<br/><br/>The special effects are great! The monsters look real and the characters realistically interact with them. In 3D the water roiling off the undulating tentacles of the Kraken must look really cool! The problem is they shortchanged the story in favor of the special effects. The story only follows the barest of outlines of the myth. Same with the 1981 version, although it's a little more faithful to the myth. The most glaring lapse is there really isn't any reason for Perseus to save Argos. In the myth his reason to save the city is for the love of Andromeda. In this version he's a stranger to Argos and doesn't fall in love with Andromeda. She's barely a consideration until she's needed to be sacrificed to the Kraken. The only reason he seems to take up the quest is because he's the nearest handy demi-god that can help out. Worthington's Perseus doesn't seem very heroic, there doesn't seem to be any emotional investment in Perseus in either the quest or the surrounding characters. Most of the time he has a stoically sullen, put upon attitude, and this keeps the audience at arms length from the character. He doesn't seem to embrace the heroic at all. Yes, he kills the monsters, but the tasks he must accomplish like tricking the Stygian witches and figuring out how to survive the encounter with Medusa, he seems to accomplish almost by accident. It seems that Perseus isn't meant to be heroic. he repeatedly says he wants ""to do this (the quest) as man, not a God,"" and he keeps refusing the gifts of the Gods. The message in the myth is for mortals to find the divine, to find the god, the hero within themselves, Perseus' refusal of the gifts of the Gods, is the refusal to find the hero within himself.<br/><br/>The 1981 version, although a bit campy in it's delivery tells the hero's story better. The 2010 version delivers better on the special effects. If such a thing were possible as to merge the strengths of both, you would have a better movie."

","This movie wants to be nothing and succeeds. Great actors are waste, the characters are not developed at all. You do not care about any of them. our hero starts off looking to kill Zeus, but needs to get through hades first. About halfway through Zeus starts helping our hero fight hades and all is forgiven yet the hero is still after hades because he knocked over a boat and killed his adoptive family. Seriously the tone and inflection of the characters voices could be altered and with the same exact script it could be a Wayan's brothers spoof of myth movies. When the action was over at the end i looked at my watch and thought- Great lets get the reconciliation with Zeus over so i can leave. On cue Liam Neeson comes in in full Qui-gon mode and says just the right thing. The funny thing is that before the end credits roll they blast the logo on the screen, like you need to be reminded. If you pay to see it you got duped, like me. About halfway through it dawned on me that it was probably much more expensive to make than Inglorious Basterds.

","I went to see Clash of the Titans today with eager anticipation and was looking forward to a visual delight, after having seen Avatar over the Christmas break. All I can say in one word is: ""Bullsh..!"" If I had known the film was a mere 2D conversion, I'm sure I would have foregone this film, opting instead to watch Avatar a second time which I think, in hindsight, would have been wiser.<br/><br/>The film is flawed in so many ways, not least because of its underwhelming visual appeal, its lack of '3Dness' but also because the story is just as flat as the visuals. The characters are disappointing, not given enough time to develop and the plot inevitable and obvious. But the storyline misgivings could have been forgiven if the film delivered what it was supposed to deliver – a grandiose, an extravagant ocular 3D delight that it was supposed to provide. Instead it crashes meteorically and deserves to be relegated to a second rate 'B' flick.<br/><br/>Perhaps 'Avatar' has raised the bar far too high for ordinary films to satisfy a significantly cleverer film-going population. We've seen the delights that a 'properly' constructed movie from the hands of James Cameron can bring to cinema and we won't stand for being treated like imbeciles – 2D to 3D conversion my curry-burning ass!

Although, the movie falls way short of expectation, its not in any way intolerable and worth a watch, maybe just for 3D.<br/><br/>The movie has no story or flow. It's like as if you are dreaming and it could end whenever and the last 5 minutes would have nothing to do with next 5. <br/><br/>The movie starts with a small introduction on Greek gods and how the came to power, and moves strait into the birth of Zeus's bastard son Perseus(or however the hell you spell that) and how he will be the savior for MAN from the GODS. The only Gods we get to see are Zeus, and his envious brother Hades who wants to overthrow Zeus and take over the world. After that the movie takes a fantasy turn and seems like different directors were given slices of 15 minutes to direct. After the first 30 minutes of crap of the titans, You can safely cut chunks of 10 minutes and air them 10 min episodes on TV with the following titles : Hades strikes back. : Scorpion attack : Return of the Medusa ( for those who don't know Medusa, she is the goddess that appears on Athena's shield. One look at Medusa's head turns anyone into stone) : 5 minutes with a Giant Squid: the Kraken : Farewell Hades.<br/><br/>All in all my advice: Set your expectations low, have fun, and you will avoid disappointment."
"Venus-25","Null","3","8","2 April 2010"," Good SFX Doesn't Compensate for Bad Mythology
","With the advent of 3D it was inevitable that this would be remade, but why do the story and the dialog have to suffer? The mythological creatures look more real and scarier (although Pegasus should be white) and the scorpion battle is about as nasty as it should be, but the story changes do nothing to improve this version. Perseus -- instead of being likable and heroic -- is a bit of a jerk in his determination to reject his divine origins instead of deciding to use them to the advantage of the human race (the ultimate revenge within this context). The sibling rivalry of Zeus and Hades would have been long over by the period of this story, but merely serves here to be an argument about atheism vs. religion. Which only serves to prove most humanists' point that a god who behaves like a toxic parent should not be worshipped in the first place.<br/><br/>There is no counterpart to the character of Ammon from the 1981 version, so this film lacks the wit and wisdom that was in his dialog. The numerous minor characters serve mostly as fodder for the monsters and there is not enough screen time for most of them to give us a chance to care about them. It also looks like the other gods all got left on the cutting room floor and somebody clearly forgot that Apollo is supposed to have golden hair.<br/><br/>Let's not even get started about the hair and the armor on the human characters.<br/><br/>I normally comment on the acting, but the script was so bad that these actors had almost nothing to work with.<br/><br/>If you haven't experienced 3D yet, you may want to see this.

"Legendary_Badass","3","3","8","2 April 2010"," Titans has a nationwide ""sneak"" preview on April Fool's Day. The joke's on us.
","On paper, I like the concept of remaking the '81 Clash of the Titans. As a fan of classic cinema and establishing canon, I want Hollywood revisionists to avoid my babies (keep your mitts off Citizen Kane). Asking them to sign a gentleman's agreement to prohibit remakes would be impossible, so the best we can hope for is to offer a sacrifice. Thus much like princess Andromeda of this movie, we have authorized Clash of the Titans and in 3D no less.<br/><br/>It is a time long ago. The mighty Zeus (Liam Neeson) will not tolerate the insolence of the humans he created. If they won't love him, he'll allow the evil Hades (Ralph Fiennes) to smite their city of Argos with the powerful elemental beast The Kraken. Caught in the crossfire is Perseus (Sam Worthington), a man who finds that he's actually half god and must go on a quest to prevent the catastrophe. Aiding Perseus are an Obi-Wan Kenobi clone played by Gemma Arterton and some disposable soldiers who are unfortunately more charismatic than our hero.<br/><br/>What has become of screen writing? They remade a movie, that wasn't good in the first place, and with an even lazier script. Every mistake in the book is on display. Notable gaffs include, but are not limited to: having characters verbally state their emotions, calling people friends right before there are written out, portraying the gods as so imposingly powerful that it's silly to defy them, unclear objectives with perplexing stances, and Medusa is now a sympathetic rape victim.<br/><br/>Louis Leterrier, who's known for comparable mindless fair such as Transporter 2, directs this version. Action isn't carried out perfectly, but it's the best thing about this movie. If you were planning to see it, and this is your sole reason, you won't be dissatisfied. Most of the effects are top notch and you get plenty of them. Where things get a tad out of whack are in fight continuity. I couldn't make heads or tails out of how many giant scorpions were in the skirmish. It looked like one, because you never got a decent establishing shot that is until the battle came to a close. Also, 90% of the time, having actors look at the camera is a bad idea, it just so happens the half dozen times this occurs falls into the bad idea family. Leterrier's techniques are dated and play it safe. There isn't an ambitious moment or inventive cut, making Clash of the Titans look very similar to Troy and not a bit like 300.<br/><br/>I did catch it in 3D. This is the first feature to be released with 3D effects added in post- production. Despite the estimated $10 million dollar expense of this, I have to say it was money wasted (yes, I realize Warner Bros. will make it back with hiked tickets). Compared to a film that was shot with 3D cameras such as Avatar, this new process is not consistent. Scenes of dialogue don't extrude and there were some moments where a far off castle looked like a nearby painting. The ominous Kraken ""pops"", but at the sacrifice of resolution.<br/><br/>There is a cameo appearance that could garner some laughs, but Clash of the Titans needs more fun elements ala the Disney treatment that reached raving success with Pirates of the Caribbean. Without steady comic relief, it takes its absurd situation far too seriously to be much fun. Maybe there is more to this since Clash of the Titans has a nationwide ""sneak"" preview on April Fool's Day. The joke's on us."

Call me a nerd for being a tad too much into this but my annoyance started when the movie begins with a conveniently hacked up and incorrect story version of the Gods' win over the Titans to rule earth. I do understand the abstract nature of this movie and the reality that this particular Perseus (Sam Worthington) was not the one of the ancient poems. But something about the matter-of-fact nature of the narration rubbed me the wrong way. <br/><br/>The armor and clothing is dark or black, there are no colors. The people or relevant armor that rang true of ancient Greece is not here. What we get instead is the X-Men treatment, black on everything and a mixture of armor and architecture of cultures that come about hundreds of years after the time of the Gods. Maybe Zeus wished in some steel from medieval Europe and haircuts from the modern day Armed Forces? He is all-powerful after-all, let's say he did, just so I can shut up about it.<br/><br/>Aww screw it, I can't ignore these things! Seeing Zeus (Liam Neeson) walk away from his throne in a type of mock plate mail armor, reminded me of his role as Gawain in Excalibur. Why was he dressed like a medieval knight in a movie about ancient Greece I wondered? This is not to say that the other Gods were much better off either, Apollo in golden standard was also in a form of scale mail and so was Poseidon (Danny Huston) who is replaced in relevance with the new owner of the Kraken, Hades (Ralph Fiennes). How does this make sense that an obvious water creature is owned by the king of the Underworld? Who cares right!? <br/><br/>Perseus, again in ancient Greece sporting a buzz cut reminiscent of a Marine or a Roman Legionnaire was only second in lack of relevance to him actually being played by Sam Worthington. Sorry folks, Jake Sully did not show up to play this time. Gone is the likable kid from the original who grows in front of our eyes from a boy gifted by the gods to champion them, into a man who is bold and clever enough to take on the gorgon Medusa and topple the champion of Poseidon. No we get a Perseus who is simply not in the right time period, mindset or character to either be believable or formidable. When Io (Gemma Arterton) basically takes his hand and teaches him how to kill Medusa (Natalia Vodionova) it summed his character up very well. This is not the brave Perseus of the original, not by a long shot.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes as the bent and ultra dark Hades was a great character, his low, gritty voice and dramatic entrances made him extremely scary. The satyr-like Calibos (Jason Fleming) who chased Perseus and made his life hell in the original is reinvented in this as a jilted lover, whose body has been turned into some sort of demon, albeit not a satyr. Io is the replacement for the lovely goddess Athena, whose wit and metallic owl of the original were mainstays in our memory of its charm. Io is beautiful but she is no Athena, and thanks to the pacing which made this 2 hour movie seem like 30 minutes, you get no true feeling of familiarity with her or the other beauty in the movie, the princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos).<br/><br/>I really wanted Clash of The Titans to be great, and based on the high votes I see on the web, it's apparent that super fast pacing and lack of character development is positive right now. Maybe I am too old school and like to learn the personalities, histories etc. of my heroes but what can I say? For me the inaccuracies, pacing and shallow nature of this 2010 Clash of The Titans makes for a bad movie – which by the way is another to take full advantage of the 3D fad going on since Avatar. This makes me wonder about Sam Worthington and his range, or lack thereof, and why Liam Neeson thought that it was a good movie to be a part of. The trailers had me salivating, especially at the Kraken, yet upon seeing it at the end, I was already done with the movie.<br/><br/>Of all the characters and wasted talent, I must say that chief soldier Draco (Mads Mikkelsen) was my favorite. His portrayal of a grizzled, old wartime soldier was well done. Despite the pacing issues, we got enough of his character and history to go from hating him to respecting, then finally liking him. <br/><br/>If you own the original Clash of The Titans and you bemoan the campy, cheesy humor or the extremely dated special effects. You will find yourself forgetting its faults in lieu of its character; because for all the 3D effects, expensive CGI and acting talent, this 2010 version lacks character and I am sorry but no amount of 3D debris flying in my face can make that a good movie for me. <br/><br/>SpicyMovieDogs.com"
"Quinoa1984","4","3","8","1 April 2010"," release the campiness! it's not all there, it seems
","The original Clash of the Titans will come up in most reviews of the new 2010 version directed by Louis Leterier (Incredible Hulk). Might as well join in: frankly, the original was no full-blown classic, but it was a good chunk of Saturday afternoon fodder for us fans of the Ray Harryhausen school of stop-motion in fantastical tales of Gods and monsters. But it does appear to have more classic tendencies than one remembered when looking at the new film. Even if I hadn't seen the original, I'd have the sneaking suspicion that something was up with this film, that its story went through a mechanical meat-grinder in the studio executive sense, that the scriptwriters were behooved to make a film for a low-common denomenator, and to make sure, of course, that everything was as neatly explained as possible. Zeus, Hades, who are these people to Joe six-pack? Nothing they can't take in simple action-movie stride, it would seem.<br/><br/>This Clash of the Titans is a stupid, quite possibly bad movie. I can't say I didn't have fun with it, however. Its makers must be aware, at least on some level, that they are in spirit remaining true to the original, which itself had its level of camp (and, where that had nothing less than Olivier as Zeus, they bring on Liam Neeson this time to fill the role, something he's up to task to do, perfectly straight-faced doing some ridiculous lines). And make no mistake, you shouldn't take this stuff *too* seriously. Go back to your school books in the Greek mythology school for that (if you start comparing this to the 'history', by the way, you might find more than a few discrepancies, like, for example, the much more blatant disregard humans have for the Gods, when in the text it was just the occasional hiccup of dissent).<br/><br/>The story is cookie-cutter, but then again it was in the original: Perseus is a Demigod, bastard man of Argos via Zeus, and put in place to stop Hades and, more crucially, the A-bomb in the beast Kraken. From this premise on, it's a series of wild action scenes and confrontations, lots of sword dueling and men in steel-plated chest guards fighting things like scorpions and Medusa and other weird demony things. Again, similar to the original. But there's something about Leterier's movie that, in a way, doesn't quite go far enough with the campy-ness (mostly Ralph Fiennes, playing Hades as if still mostly in character as Voldemort, and on occasion Neeson - Worthington is a complete cardboard cut-out hero as he was in Avatar). Some lines and scenes bring some laughs (i.e. all of the ""Pegasus-es"", ho-ho), but then it stalls and goes into crap common-ACTION movie mode. Ho-hum.<br/><br/>It is not that all of the direction is bad, but some of it just so mechanical, moving from one thing to the next, rarely with much emotion or spark. And the effects, save for the big finish with the Kraken at the climax, barely have the same intensity or just pure joy and wonderment of Harryhausen's creations (and this may be a minor gripe, but it's a true shame there's no owl save for the brief mention). When I wasn't trying to hold in my laughter at the stone-faced delivery of some lines, or the hambone delivery of others (i.e. Fiennes, the flamboyant character awaiting to sacrifice the girl to the Kraken), I was kind of bored. Somewhere inside of Clash of the Titans it knows it's as bad as it wants to be, but it also thinks its as cool as all of the major blockbusters in recent memory.<br/><br/>It's neither total foul nor is it a rousing success. I'd say it's worth it to see those spectacular sights on a big screen (and in 2D only, not the 3D that's suckering people in after the fact), but in reality one would feel comfortable with a bunch of friends mocking it to pieces. Some of this is a lot of fun, in the most guilty-pleasure way possible in Hollywood product. Other times, it's just dull as hell."

A lot of people go into this movie comparing it to the old one... but it's not the same. The concept of Perseus saving Andromeda is only the same... It has new characters instead of the old and the journey to Medusa is different from the original. Remember that not all Greek Mythology were the same in stories. <br/><br/>I watched this movie in 3-D and in 2-D. I would watch it again in 3-D. Even though there weren't much to jump at you, it was better than 2-D. The characters, the little details that I missed in 2-D, were in 3-D. I also enjoyed the 3-D in Clash better than Avatar. I'm still mad at the story line of Avatar. It was stupid.... Very stupid. I just don't get what all the buzz is about Avatar. I only went to see it because of Sam Worthington and was highly disappointed in that movie. Still so upset it was a corny movie. But for Clash, I was only disappointed that they didn't use the owl through the whole film. I thought he would've made the movie funnier. <br/><br/>And I am so relieved that no one kissed at the end of this movie!

"michaelthonger","8","3","9","2 April 2010"," As close to a 'God of War' movie as we're gonna get
","Having seen the original film, I would like to counter most of the criticisms being levelled at the remake by stating that the original has NOT aged well. 60% of the performances are ridiculous (borderline laughable) and the special effects, although cool, cannot possibly be taken seriously. When I went to see this, I expected a fun hack'n'slash creature feature, and I must admit (even though I can be a bit of a cinema snob) I enjoyed the hell out of this. It never tried to be anything it's not (it's far from being the next Lord of the Rings), but instead it revelled in ever visceral fight scene and breathtaking set piece. As a great fan of Greek mythology, I've been missing an epic mythology movie, and i got my fill with this (as unfaithful as it is to the myths- but it's an action movie at heart; who the hell cares if they took a few liberties with the source material?).<br/><br/>Liam Neeson and Raph Fiennes chew the scenery as only Greek Gods can to great effect- although I would have liked the story to have focused more on them and the other Gods. Sam Worthington is reasonably relatable and dynamic as Perseus, and Gemma Arterton claims her crown as the queen of unnecessary, bland, emotionless characters as Io (the movie would have been better off cutting her out, and having the other Gods taking her screen time- perhaps an actual God should have guided Perseus?).<br/><br/>Great quality CGI and set design makes for some breathtaking set pieces and scenery- particular favourites being the fight with Medusa in her lair, and the desert home of the scorpions. I have seen many incarnations of Medusa, and this was one of the better ones I've seen- a very threatening and intimidating presence for such a well recognised and cliché monster. Good costume design allows characters to shine (literally in Zeus' case, and figuratively in the case of the tree-man; I forget his name), and most of the characters are truly compelling and interesting to be around. <br/><br/>It does have its flaws- script doesn't really stand out at all, some parts are quite formulaic, few lapses in believability (damn Pete Postlethwaite did well getting his wife)- But it was a tremendously fun time at the cinema- I recommend it to any enthusiast of Greek mythology, the original film, or just straight-up matinée action. Just don't set your expectations too high!"

","The power of the three gods – Zeus, Poseidon, Hades – have ruled the skies, the waters and the underworld for more than 3,000 years, now it's time for Hades to come out of hiding and reclaim Mount Olympus as his own. What Hades does not know is that there is a demi-god, Perseus, Zeus's son, and he will be the one to stop Uncle Hades from destroying mankind. Louis Leterrier directs an all-star cast from Avatar's Sam Worthington to Harry Potter's Ralph Fiennes to Liam Neeson, this movie proves its worth among the race of man. Clash of the Titans proves that it is worthy of Oscar buzz as well. This movie reclaims the gods have spoken and it's time to re-own Mount Olympus and the race of man."

","I've noticed that most of the reviews panning this movie seem to be more about complaining about the 3D effects. News flash people; the greedy studio heads decided to convert this movie to 3D at the last possible minute. Therefore the 3D effects look like crap because not only was it rushed, but it wasn't filmed in 3D!!! So if it was that bad why the hell would you sit through the entire movie then write a review on how bad the movie was? Go get your money back and watch it in 2D! As for the movie itself; I had only seen the original about a week before seeing the remake. While I enjoyed some elements of the original, I thought it was lacking in terms of pace. This film, definitely improves on the pace, and you get to care a bit more the rest of the soldiers that followed Perseus into the underworld. My main complaint is that they added a new female character to the plot, and as much as I enjoy seeing Gemma Aterton, it pushed away focus from Andromeda. Who really was crucial to the plot. So here we are caring for Io, and not really seeing enough of Andromeda to really be concerned for her. Yet the whole plot is about saving her more or less.<br/><br/>Bottom line, great action/adventure movie. Doesn't really follow Greek mythology so don't let that shock you. Could have used a bit more character development but most action movies could. I give it 8/10."

","I just finished watching this at home (BlueRay, Surround, 55"" TV) and came to the IMDb to read some reviews. I have to admit. Reading some of the critical reviews here made me laugh out loud. One guy actually complained about the movie's logic as it related to what the Gods/Titans could do and not do and what they should have known and not known. Another complained that the main character's motivation of vengeance failed in comparison to the one in the original movie, which was love. Are these people serious? They act as if they know Greek mythology. Alas, dear Yurik, they don't. They're all bent out of shape because a Hollywood movie didn't take Greek myth seriously. Pleeeaaaaase....<br/><br/>First of all, in truth, Perseus seeks Medusa's head because he's embarrassed for not bringing a present to a wedding. The cheap bastard is basically shamed into doing something brave. Yeah, great stuff for a big CGI movie.<br/><br/>Secondly, who the hell cares that there's no Kraken in the ancient myth? There are all kinds of other mythological creatures. And this is a great Kraken. Beats the hell out of Godzilla.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, if you want to learn about Ancient mythology, go back to school. Don't try and learn stuff from a Hollywood movie, and don't think you're getting much wisdom by reading reviews from a bunch of whiny IMDb know-it-alls who wouldn't know a Harpy from a Sharpie.<br/><br/>If you want have some fun on a Friday night, and you liked the original, and you don't want to waste time searching for deep and meaningful cinematic allegory, Clash of the Titans might fit the bill.

","The technology nowadays have brought a lot of things into almost real. Story lines have been very predictable that the excitement to the story is gone. The challenge is balancing technology and storytelling making the audiences nowadays feel that they are seeing a classic literary work. Acting should have blended to the story having the real human element on humans and understanding hows gods (good/evil) think. Sam Worthington was like Marcus Wright or Jake Sully in the movie even his hair was still the same. There was much less dialog, more of one liners that people are waiting to hear. I felt that there was less meticulous preparation in order to make the film better than before. It is one thing to keep in mind that there some audiences who saw the first film and cannot avoid to compare."

"ticket_for_one","6","2","5","4 April 2010"," DVD on a rainy Sunday night is more like it. I wonder what Ray H thinks?
","Saw this last night and as I sat in my seat waiting for the movie to finish. I struggled to think how I was going to write this review. Now that 12 hours have passed, here's my review.<br/><br/>Most of you know Clash of Titans is a remake of the 1981 version, directed by Desmond Davis. This version directed by Louis Leterrier (Transporter 2, Incredible Hulk, Unleashed) is not a patch on the original. The story is simple. Actually I won't bother this time round, so I'll get straight into it. WHAT I LIKED: One thing I'll say about this movie is that the action scenes are well filmed. Leterrier does very well to capture muscular set pieces this film has. Two that come to mind are the fight against the giant scorpions and Medusa's Lair. You can see everything that's happening in every fight scene. It's a change to what we have seen recently from Michael Bay and Paul Greengrass. Special/visual effects are good in some places, choppy in others. Scorpions good at times, not so at other times. The decision to make Medusa CGI pays off, having her look even scarier than the original. Film ran at a steady pace and didn't drag in areas. Performances in my opinion were half and half. Take Sam Worthington's role for example. Out of all the demi gods from Greek mythology (Hercules, Achilles), Perseus is ordinary. I think Sam Worthington did well playing Perseus, really bringing some humanity to the role. As an action hero he's quite believable. Liam Neeson was OK, as was Gemma Arterton (eye candy) and Jason Flemyng. Other supporting cast members put in a good shift. The always reliable Liam Cunnigham (The Hunger) was good and more or less had the best lines. Mads Mikklesen (Casino Royale) and Skins actor Nicholas Hoult were also good in their roles. Ralph Fiennes however, was brilliant as Hades. And literally stole very scene he was in. This is the same guy who plays Lord Voldermort in the Harry Potter series. So he felt right at home playing the bad guy. I felt he did a great job. Special mention to Pete Postlethwaite whose brilliant in everything he does.<br/><br/>WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Dialogue/script were awful. But despite this, the actors do well with what they were given. There were some really cringeworthy scenes involving Perseus, consistently going on about what a great man he's adopted father was. And also before going into Medusa's Liar, how proud he was of the guys who had come with him on this journey. Didn't need to hear that, sometimes actions speak louder than words. The first movie was darker with a lot more tension and had reputable actors such as Laurence Olivier and Maggie Smith who acted as if they were Gods, which made the film memorable. There were far too many jokes in this version, so you cared little for which characters live and which ones die. The Kraken had short screen time but was impressive none the less. And as a whole, the film fails to deliver in 3D. Why they released this in 3D is beyond me? A lot of the scenes did not require the wearing of polarised sunglasses. More of a hindrance than they were an enjoyment. <br/><br/>All in all, Clash of Titans is worth the release, but you'll be disappointed. Like a lot of movies that were released around this time. Great trailer, OK movie. DVD on a rainy Sunday night is more like it."
"TheUnknown837-1","4","2","5","4 April 2010"," my love for the original definitely fueled my disdain for the remake, but even if that weren't the case, I doubt I would have stayed interested in this video-gamey narrative
","Let me state right off the bat that the original 1981 movie ""Clash of the Titans"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. The last film by special effects pioneer Ray Harryhausen continues to linger in my heart with a particular level of fondness. As apprehensive as I am to remaking a classic, I must admit that I was really looking forward to this one because ""Clash of the Titans"" is one of the few great films of the past that could be effectively remade in more ways than just updating the special effects. However, once again, the filmmakers have fallen for the illusion that if they merely flood the screen with flashy special effects and offer 3-D glasses to make things seem to leap at the audience that it automatically qualifies as being worthy of the original. And if all you are looking for is flashy visuals, then you will be absorbed. If you are like me, however, and do no fall for that flimsy, simple-minded gimmick, then your interest will fade out very, very quickly. As technically smooth as it is, the remake of ""Clash of the Titans"" is regrettably just a forgettable bore.<br/><br/>The basic plot (not the expanded story) is similar to the original, detailing the life of Perseus: the son of Zeus who was given the task of rescuing the princess Andromeda from a vicious sea monster known as the Kraken. Perseus is played by Sam Worthington in another picture where he mostly just snares out dialogue and glowers at everything around him. Perseus encounters (I think) more creatures and menacing situations this time around, but this is a turn for the worse.<br/><br/>By pumping the movie full of visual effects, that unfortunately pushes out more time for the story. The original ""Clash of the Titans"" may not have had the greatest narrative ever told, but it was a solid, thorough plotted tale. This remake has a narrative that plays out not as a story. It has more in common with a video-game.<br/><br/>And that is the reason why I became very bored with this movie. It was not merely because it did not follow the original very well; it was just that it was only an objective game course on screen. Perseus is introduced to us very quickly (and in a jumbled manner that might confuse new audience members) and right away he is forced to wade his way through locations (or levels to go again to the video-game analogy), takes out that scene's (level's) baddies, and works his way to the ending. He has no relationships (not even primitive ones) with the other characters or the monsters, and his adversaries are even blander. They are only in the movie to appear, be killed, and be gone for the rest of the picture. There is also no motivation behind Perseus's daring odyssey. In the original movie, he was compelled to face Medusa and the Kraken to save Andromeda, whom he was in love with. He's not in love with Andromeda here; he hardly even knows her because her part in the picture, though plot-important, is really just a cameo. Maybe it's a little unfair to compare this to a video-game. Heck, I've played games that had better constructed plots and story lines and with better character development than this.<br/><br/>Worthington is miscast as Perseus (he still looks and acts like a cyborg here) but he does an adequate acting job. He just doesn't have the charisma that Harry Hamlin in the original. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes (who had previously gazed with untrusting eyes at each other in Steven Spielberg's masterpiece ""Schindler's List"") are also featured as the rival gods Zeus and Hades and their performances are good, but they are even blander than the human characters. I like Mads Mikkelson, but he does not have to do on the movie except look menacing, which he does well. Perseus has a primitive semi-romantic attachment not to Andromeda, the damsel in distress, but a demigoddess played by Gemma Arterton. She's good too, but there's no character for her to work with. Not even in a primitive sense. It's just a video-game.<br/><br/>On a technical level, ""Clash of the Titans"" does a good job. The special effects, though not dazzling or nostalgic like Harryhausen's stop-motion animation from the original, is persuasive enough to be commendable. The picture has some good visuals, but that's hardly enough to fuel the whole picture. The creatures look good, but they are only there to be wiped out. There's not even an attempt to give them presence. The Kraken in the original did not look as convincing as the new one, but it had a personality and was a great villain. This new one is bland and one-dimensional; it also is just a cameo in this video-gamey story.<br/><br/>In short, this ""Clash of the Titans"" is not an unbearable movie, but is completely forgettable. It's been less than twenty-four hours since I saw it and already I've practically forgotten about it. I haven't forgotten its existence; just the merits of watching it, because there were none to begin with. The whole movie just a video-game. And it's the equivalent of watching *somebody else* play a video-game. How long does it take for you to get disinterested? So what's the most important difference between this and the original? Well, not the story or anything like that. The original picture is a classic and remains to this day a very popular extravaganza. This remake has only been out for a short while and within a year or so, nobody is going to remember it.<br/><br/>footnote: fans of the original movie, fear not, Bubo the lovable mechanical owl does make a cameo in this movie."
"zetes","4","2","5","4 April 2010"," Really lousy
","I can't say I had high expectations for it, but, as much as I love the original, it could certainly be improved upon and I had a tiny bit of hope, since this was announced, it could be an improvement. Leterrier, his screenwriters and (maybe especially) the film's star really drop the ball. Yes, Sam Worthington proves twice in just a few months that he is a beacon of suck, just a black hole of a human being who makes everything he touches worse. Actually, I did kind of like him in Terminator Salvation, but these last two starring roles have not been kind to him. The man just has no charisma whatsoever. His Perseus comes off as a whiny bitch, and you kind of don't want to see him succeed. Harry Hamlin in the original is kind of a dull hunk, but at least he came off as a likable hero. Worthington is just a meathead whiner. Almost none of the rest of the cast registers whatsoever, except for maybe Gemma Arterton as Io, an ageless woman who accompanies the heroes on their quest (taking the place of Andromeda from the original movie, who in this one just stays home and does nothing). Arterton's main positive point, though, is her lovely face. She doesn't seem to have much of a personality. To tell the truth, the CGI monsters of the film, which, face it, was the reason anyone's going to go anyway, ain't half bad. I much prefer the original's counterparts, but this film's Graiai, giant scorpions, Medusa and Kraken are all perfectly neat (if not as impressive as the painstaking stop-motion effects of the '81 version), and I was decently excited during their sequences. But nothing else works. I didn't even mention the whole plot about the gods. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes (united for the first time since Schindler's List!) play Zeus and Hades respectively, and they are both warring against an ungrateful humanity and each other. The conflicts are not well enough written to make any real sense, or to make the audience give a crap."
"renecborbon","4","2","5","4 April 2010"," A Poor Remake of the 1981 Classic
","I was initially excited to see that a remake of the 1981 classic was due out in Spring 2010. Sadly, this film is really just a video game shadow of the classic with Laurence Olivier and Harry Hamlin. The plot is nearly nonexistent. Almost all of the actors have annoying English accents (normally I like the accents, but these actors had a snobbish version of the English accent). The only thing interesting in the movie is the Medusa scenes which were well done. The djinni looked like they were wearing $50 Halloween masks. The dialogue was a joke. Sadly Fiennes's and Neeson's performances were also poor capstones to this half hearted attempt at a remake of a classic. I'd like to give it a 10/10, but really, this was a 4/10. Save your money and don't go see it or buy the DVD. Do yourself a favor and buy the 1981 classic."
"stabb666","4","2","5","3 April 2010"," I wish that I was a teenage boy again...
","...because I would be able to get past the awful dialogue, truly terrible acting and direction bereft of any dramatic flair or intensity.<br/><br/>That being said, the special effects were truly magnificent, and definitely worth watching even in 2d. You will probably love this movie if you enjoy cheesy lines that attempt to pass themselves off as comedy, ridiculous stunts, plot-holes that you could fall down and break your leg on, and absolutely pointless sub-plots that make a mockery of one of the greatest Greek legends.<br/><br/>And that may be my biggest gripe with this tripe; That a Hollywood studio, in the eternally pointless quest to find the next big thrill, has managed to take one of the greatest stories ever told and mash it down into the baby food equivalent of entertainment."
"curtiswb","5","2","5","3 April 2010"," Doesn't touch the original
","I watched the original when I was a kid and have watched it several times over the years and have always enjoyed it. When I saw the trailers for this remake, I was excited but also weary that Hollywood would take such a wonderful movie and destroy it. And I was partly right after watching the new movie last night.<br/><br/>If you are into non stop action movies with very little dialog or story then this movie would be for you, however it takes a lot more than that to get good ratings from me. They changed around the story to make it revenge based instead of love. The main star Persius goes from being a fisherman to automatically knowing how to fight and being fearless like a pro as if he was automatically granted that knowledge without informing the audience. The fights all seemed very short and made Persius out to be almost untouchable as he doesn't have very much trouble with whatever he fights.<br/><br/>I won't buy this on DVD when it is released."
"limoncella-641-42235","3","2","5","3 April 2010"," A Baffling Experience
","I went to see Clash of the Titans last Friday - the day it came out in Britain, the cinema was not even half full, which was extremely odd for a brand new movie on release day.<br/><br/>The first quarter of this movie was story-telling. Story-telling that we have all heard before in school; Zeus created man, Zeus sent Hades to the Underworld, The birth of Perseus, etc.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie was just.... Fighting. They go out into the woods, there's a fight. They go into the desert, there's a fight. It seemed that the heroes cannot go 2 metres without some generic-evil- device trying to squash them.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was mediocre at best. Many characters were developed reasonably well but were disposed at the drop of a hat. Sam Worthington's performance has all the same flaws it had in Avatar. The best acting was from Ralph Fiennes (Hades) and Liam Neeson (Zeus) whose brother-on-brother-conflict relationship was far more interesting than Perseus going around brawling with anything that moves.<br/><br/>Negativities aside, the CGI was decent but not incredible, and the 3D was also good. One thing that needs to be mentioned is that the CG on the Scorpions, Kraken and Pegasus was good, but Medusa looked terrible.<br/><br/>To conclude this, Clash of the Titans is not a movie that will leave much of an impact, Greek Mythology Nerds might find something to like here, but most of us will be left in the dark, scratching our heads and trying to count the infinite number of fight scenes"

","This movie could have been so much better. And as with many movies today, the problem was the length. This was way too short to make sense. The characters were one-dimensional, there was little-to-no backstory developed. There were plot holes you could drive a truck through. The visual effects, though life-like and well blended with the live action material, came at you way too fast. It was hard to keep track of who was dying, what just got destroyed, and which characters were where in the scene.<br/><br/>This movie is a prime example of why Avatar haters are wrong. This movie had everything Avatar had, 3D effects, lots of CGI, Sam Worthington, you name it. This movie falls unbelievably flat, and I will be SHOCKED if it makes its money back. Hate James Cameron all you want, the man knows how to make a movie, and it is clear he had nothing to do with this one."

","If your lucky enough to see it in 3D, Wow, Very cool looking...<br/><br/>Great movie to see if you want a good 3d movie, Now, onto the movie it self... Now, I was expecting a really amazing movie, I was left disappointed..<br/><br/>OK, to sum up this movie, its about the Greek gods, and man deciding. We have had enough of the cruel treatment and the neglect over the years... So man decides to step up to the gods and fight them, but it doesn't work so well, the gods get angry, and lash back at man.<br/><br/>It has everything you really need to have a good movie. sadly this movie just wasn't quite there... They jumped from one thing to the other, and hoped that everyone would follow it perfectly, which made you go... Huh? How does that work? They didn't really focus on the characters throughout the movie.. They didn't really evolve, you didn't feel a connection to them. They were so life like in 3d, but they felt they weren't there... that they were missing something...<br/><br/>If your expecting a EPIC movie... not gonna find it here.. The fights weren't that amazing, they were predictable, short, and slightly frustrating and confusing to watch. When they were getting ready to have a huge fight, that looked like it was gonna be awesome. They had sort of mini-fights.. Where they kept on switching, between the groups, it was hard to follow, who was dead, who was still fighting, where they are... and what the heck was happening...<br/><br/>When the movie was said and done, you were left with a feeling of... Why did this happen, what happened to that part... Why didn't they do that at the beginning...<br/><br/>Sadly this was one of those movies where they had too much of a story to fit into a short running time, so pack it full of special effects, and hope that compensates for the lack of story.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion to wrap up this movie, it tended to drag at a lot of parts, the special effects were really cool, the 3d was great. But the gods felt stupid, and week. and not so... well god like... The parts you couldn't wait for, took for ever to get to, and were gone in seconds...<br/><br/>Was it worth paying for? Sure, for a quick flick you might like the movie. (If you can't see it in 3D, its not so worth it) If your into Greek mythology and / or awesome fight scenes, you might find this movie aggravating.<br/><br/>If your wanting to see some Titans (The name has titans in it, but it has no titans in the movie it self.)"

","It is unfortunate that so many people went into viewing this epic film with certain expectations, mainly so because it was considered to be a ""remake"". I went to see it with a friend who wanted to take a look at it on its own merits and we did just that. There were definitely no expectations on my part so I was not disappointed like some of the reviewers here who do not have enough objectivity to see this movie for what it is.<br/><br/>I totally enjoy these types of films, it was very good and easy to watch, with astounding visual effects and scenes. For sheer entertainment value, Clash of the Titans is one of the better movies being released this year and I highly recommend viewing it."
"litninguy","3","2","6","7 April 2010"," Why ""Clash of the Titans"" was a bust
","First, to positives. I saw the movie in 2d expecting a similar visual experience as 300. The special effects were incredible. Many artists certainly spent long hours designing the Kraken, scorpions, and the beautiful city. Thanks guys, for putting your heart into that so I didn't feel scammed by the promising previews. That's it for the pros.<br/><br/>Why was this movie a bust?<br/><br/>1) Perseus had no drive. At times he stood up for what he believed in...wait, what did he believe in? <br/><br/>a) He didn't want help from the gods, yet ended up accepting help every step of the way (from men what he was almost killed at the beginning, from his Zeus with the coin, sword, and Pegasus, and from Io who trained him to kill Medusa and then waited out side for him) <br/><br/>b) He claimed to be a man, not a god. Who wouldn't want to be a god? His motives were purely racist. He didn't like one god, Hades, so he hated all gods and didn't want to be one. <br/><br/>c) Then there's the fact that he didn't take charge in battle. Things happened to him, he didn't make them happen. <br/><br/>2) The battles sucked. Perseus was Passive!<br/><br/>a) Calibos was presented well with super human strength, but Perseus got dominated until a friend stepped in and saved him. That's Passive Perseus not a hero. <br/><br/>b) The scorpion scene was a flop. Hahahaha. What a joke. With Calibos you assume he's off to a slow start. Perseus couldn't be any more passive. His fellow man if off fighting their hearts out, getting killed, jumping on the scorpions back. Even the water-boy, Eusebios. got in on the action throwing a spear to a soldier riding the scorpion. Perseus, the should have been hero of the movie, stood there while a giant scorpion landed on him with his belly. Two seconds later the still scorpion erupts and Perseus is sanding there covered in guts in the center of a corps. It would have been a great finale to a dominating action scene, but when it's there supporting cast that does all the killing, it turns a hero into Passive Perseus. <br/><br/>c) The 3 witches. Perseus catches their eyeball in a game of monkey in the middle when the eyeball was throw right to him. Good job kiddo.<br/><br/>d) Medusa. After every other companion dies trying to kill Medusa, yes including the water-boy, Perseus grabs the shield, that another man made for him. He sees Medusa in the reflection and waits a few seconds for her to come to him, then turns around and cuts her head off. Great, this time he was 100% passive until he was the last one standing, then he was only 80% passive. We can make a man out of him yet. In the original Perseus went 1 on 1 with Medusa.<br/><br/>e) Hades on the way to the Kraken. While riding Pegasus Perseus flies around the Kraken, into the city, back around the Kraken to the building overlooking the sea. Why? And to kill one of Hedes' minions Perseus cuts someones drying clothes, which land on a minion. The minion somehow falls in front of Perseus who is traveling at about 30mph, and Pegasus stomps on him. First off, that scene doesn't make sense. How did the minion land in front? Why was he riding through the city? Again, he was Passive Perseus. He only cut some hanging clothes. His horse did the dirty work<br/><br/>f) The Kraken. This could have been an epic battle. Instead, the giant monster was killed by Madusa's head. In the original movie, it works. Perseus shows off his whit after having defeated the other monsters. Here, it keeps the theme of Passive Perseus. You can't complain about this one, but it certainly didn't make for a good action movie.<br/><br/>g) Hades. God of the underworld! The god that just over through all mighty Zeus! The god who killed Perseus's family which motivated Perseus to go on this unmotivated quest. Epic battle brewing. Hades is as powerful a ever. What happens? In the first second of the battle, Perseus throws a sword at Hades, which sends him back to the underworld. Epic battle over. Total time, 2 seconds. Climax, NA. Compare that to Neo's epic battle in the third Matrix, full of drama, purpose, great fight sequences, and new effects (the face punch). Thanks for nothing guys. This movie flopped.<br/><br/>3) I'm not going far down this road, but the dialog was pathetic. Like it was meant for a 5 year old. I felt like the writers thought I was retarded. I can't get over how great the mismatch was between the effects, and the rest of the movie. Have effects become so cheap that they can make them incredible? Or do the film makers realize that effects make the previews awesome, and that's all that matters for making a dollar. Forget pursuing excellence. <br/><br/>I could go on, but that's enough time spent on this mind numbing crap. Hopefully they'll make a 300 the movie sequel to satisfy my action craving."
"judywalker2","4","2","6","6 April 2010"," Boring, not even a shadow of the original
","I guess Sam Worthington's the new darling of Hollywood. Well he better start picking some better projects. I mean, Terminator Salvation, Avatar and now this snooze fest, Clash Of the Titans. This movie had the worst dialog I've ever heard in my life. The writers should be ashame to put out something as bad as this. The story was lame and I think poor Perseus must have said the same thing about fifty times. Ralph Fiennes also needs to find a new agent, between Harry Potter and this mess people are going to start forgetting that this is the same man who starred in the English patient. The same can be said of Liam Neeson too. Both of these actors are too good for this kind of mess. I was relieved when this movie was over. Hopefully they won't make a sequel."

","This movie has good CGI effects and it seemed so real to me. The acting was fantastic, although it had minor flaws that caught my attention. It seemed that they made the supposed major fight in the movie with Hades into a minor one. It wasn't really interesting compared to the fight with the scorpions. In fact, i think that the scorpion fight was the best action scene in the movie. They could have worked on making the movie longer because the fight with the Kraken and Hades were far too short in length. But it was still a good movie. I recommend it to all, its worth your money!

"galahad58-1","7","2","6","4 April 2010"," Clashed Between the Movies
","Let me start off by saying that I enjoyed the new ""Clash of the Titans"" before I continue with this summary.<br/><br/>In 1981, the original ""Clash of the Titans"" was released. It was a very good movie, with great characterization but lacked in special effects. Harry Hamlin was not the greatest choice to play Perseus, but the rest of the cast were marvelous. In today's ""Clash of the Titans"" it is a bit different. The reverse is true in the new version--the characterization is lacking a great deal, but the special effects are great.<br/><br/>In the first movie Perseus is the son of Zeus and living comfortably on a remote island. Calibos (son of Thetes) has Argos under a curse where Andromeda must present a riddle to suitors if they want her hand--if they fail to answer the riddle, they are killed. Only a correct answer to the riddle will lift the curse. Calibos, in the past, was cursed by Zeus and lives as a monster in the marshes. Thetes is envious of Perseus and brings him to Argos and thus angering Zeus--who gives Perseus a shield, a helmet and BoBo the mechanical owl. Perseus saves Argos from Calibos' curse, but in haste the queen of Argos claims that Andromeda is more beautiful than Thetes, thus incurring the wrath of the goddess. This sets up the story where Perseus now goes on the hunt to stop the Kraken.<br/><br/>In the new version there is no mention of Thetes, Perseus is not known to be alive so Zeus does not recognize him, Calibos is not in the new version, Perseus lives as a fisherman and events lead him to Argos--not the goddess. The Pegasus is hardly used in the new version and the teacher/mentor role played brilliantly by Burgess Meredith is missing. In the new version, Hades sets up everything--the Kraken, the call for the sacrifice and the pursuit of Perseus.<br/><br/>The old version had a rich story with great character development---the new has a weak story with zero characterization. The old version used stop motion animation---the new is all computer generated. The old had that wonderful antagonist Calibos---the new uses the old king in the role and his part is pretty lame. The old used Greek warriors only---the new uses some kind of weird desert humanoid that looked awful. The old had Zeus helping his son---the new had a woman helping.<br/><br/>If you combined the acting (except for Hamlin), story and characterization from the 81 version with the effects from the new version you would have the perfect ""Clash of the Titans"".<br/><br/>The movie was still enjoyable---the old better."
"namashi_1","3","2","6","3 April 2010"," A disappointment...
","A remake of the 1981 film of the same name, itself loosely based on the Greek myth of Perseus, 'Clash Of The Titans' is a dull fare. 3-D has never been so pointless before! 'Clash Of The Titans' has a tepid start, a fair second, but a bland end spoils the fun. Louis Leterrier's direction relies on CGI completely. Cinematography by Peter Menzies, Jr. is the mainstay of the film, he's done a mind-blowing job.<br/><br/>In the acting department, Sam Worthington is okay. Liam Neeson is wasted. Ralph Fiennes is the only actor who pitches in superb act. He stands out. Gemma Arterton is passable. Others are passable.<br/><br/>'Clash Of The Titans' is not good stuff, according to me. Watch it if you must!"
"dpuczek","Null","2","6","2 April 2010"," Started yawning towards the end...
","Much ado about nothing. This is a classic example of a trailer being much better than the movie it represents. Sam Worthington is cut out of every other movie he has previously been in - cardboard acting, terrible job of hiding his true accent, tough guy persona with modern-day haircut and attitude. Same with Neeson - he plays the same character in virtually every movie he's in - from Darkman to Taken to Love Actually to CotT. Many of the supporting actors feel properly cast beyond the main few though - I like seeing no-namers in new roles, actors with something to lose. The CGI is OK, sometimes you catch the actors looking at nothing in front of them - the interactions are very loose here. The Kraken is a remake of the Godzilla remake - beady eyes to go along with a head full of teeth. This remake won't make anyone forget the original in the long run. I saw it cause I bought into the hype and the wife likes Worthington. But I could have - and should have - easily caught this one on DVD from our library for FREE in a couple of months. If you miss this one in theaters, you're okay - the world will still turn. Saw it in 2D by the way, and I don't feel like I missed much."
"DarkPhoenix77","4","2","6","2 April 2010"," Anyone who was a fan of the original may be seriously disappointed...
","I was very scared to see this version of Clash of the Titans seeing that I loved the original 1981 version so much. And my fears ended up proving true. This newer version was very CGI driven, which I expected. But instead of it enhancing an already good story, it was driven by the ""machine"" and the story was re-written in such a way that it left you wanting. Best way to break down this movie is the pro and cons. Pros: The Kracken was awesome. I loved the new updated version of it. In fact, it would have been great if it came as a total surprised as to how it was going to look, but the previews spoiled that. Pro: The CGI overall was awesome. It did make some parts visually spectacular. Hades entrances and exits were very cool. And now the cons... Con: OK, Medusa... just looked SO fake. I mean, if you are going to do the CGI and go all out on the other characters (e.g. the large scorpions, the Kracken, etc), why would you make a character that is so important to the story look so un-real? Even though the story is a fantasy, it's always bad when you are in a movie and catching yourself thinking that you're ""watching a movie"" Con: Perseus is rushing to save the Andromeda from the Kracken. Rushing rushing rushing... then he saves her and leaves. I mean it left you thinking what was the point? She is supposed to be the love of his life... the reason he went into the underworld to fight a half snake chick who could turn you into stone, then he saves her, then tells her he's not interested!? Um.. OK Con: Character development(the story). This version of Clash of the Titans was all about the ""rise of man"" and how man hates the gods, etc. It just didn't sit well with me for some reason. It just felt like some atheist wrote the screen play to sort of ""make his point"" while leaving out any good character development. You don't see why Perseus was so determined to save Andromeda, you don't see the relationship of Perseus to Pegasus (one thing I REALLY loved about the first), and then they also took a ""cheap shot"" at the first one, which was clearly a superior version of the movie but mentioning the mechanical owl as a sort of army weaponry prop. Just seemed like a joke where no one was laughing. mainly because those who didn't see the 1981 version wouldn't have gotten it and those who DID probably would have thought this one sucked. Then Perseus was sort of a rebellious little brat. Even to his father, Zeus. Zeus would give him a gift, and Perseus wouldn't accept it, then Pegasus came, and he would accept it. Then he's argue about being a man and not a Demigod, then he'd use the gift from Zeus to fight Calibos... but I just kept thinking about how weak Perseus was. How it seemed he couldn't do anything without help from gods and man. Finally, the character of Calibos. Just a letdown altogether. He seemed pointless. Con: The 3D. I found myself taking off the glasses a lot to check and see if the movie was still in 3D or not. Some scenes didn't even look like 3D to be honest. It didn't feel like it enhanced the movie one way or the other. So, if you go to see this version of clash of the Titans, i wouldn't expect too much. if you just want to kill a few hours with some minor enjoyment, by all means go see it. However, if you have any intentions of seeing the 1981 version and have not yet, I would suggest seeing it after wards. if not, you will be kicking yourself for paying $10+ on some visual effects you could probably already have a better version of with your LOTR DVDs"
"travinitrav","4","2","6","2 April 2010"," OK for the tweens and people who just need to kill some time.
","It stunk. Not badly, but there was a definite factor of non-awesomeness. They tried a little too hard to make it over-the-top Epic, and fell short. As such we are left with a movie that felt like it could have been fantastic, but ended up being a good way to kill two hours.<br/><br/>Audio was over driven to cover up for the lack of quality content. Graphics were so heavy on the CGI, I lost the imersiveness and kept getting reminded that Hollywood was trying to blow my mind. Story was stripped down and poorly told. And I think they changed quite of a bit of the original mythology. I know they changed heavily from the original movie. Again its obvious they were pushing the action. Hera was completely cut out of the story. Apollo had one line and it was meaningless. The other Olympians were seen for maybe 2 or 3 frames. Acting from the lead was not great. It was obvious he was trying to over act. Maybe cuz he was a young newb surrounded by veteran actors. Liam Neeson is better suited to Zeus than Hannibal, but he still just didn't come across as quite right. Most of the supporting cast did a great job, but it still wasn't enough to make this movie great as a whole. It makes me not wanna go to the theater anymore. <br/><br/>Its a fine way to kill a afternoon, but don't go in expecting to get your money worth, or hoping for something that will be remembered in years to come. Its pretty darn forgettable. I suspect the kiddies will love it and then not speak of it 6 months from now."
"east-emerald","6","2","6","2 April 2010"," Epic Failure
","With a title like this I had better have some reasons for really not liking ""Clash of the Titans""; so here is my best attempt to list my disappointment:<br/><br/>-I wanted more Greek gods. The opportunities thrown away by not using even Hera are mind boggling ( to me).<br/><br/>-A messy miss mash of throw away characters. I never connected with Perseus whose angst should be driving the story. Andromeda is boring although I did enjoy her drunk father and drag queen like mother. Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't ""the end is near"" prophet in Argos remind you of someone who was headed to Bannaroo and took a wrong turn?<br/><br/>-Clunky special effects. I am not an expert on this. When effects are done well, I know it and enjoy. When they're not I recognize that too. Large scale CGI like the Kraken looked good but smaller effects like Medusa didn't blend well. Worse yet, on the ferry ride to the underworld, Charon ( hope I have that right, anyway the guy guiding the ferry) looked practically animatronic.<br/><br/>-Too much action at the expense of story. I hardly felt we were in the theater for 118 minutes because one fast action sequence moved quickly to another with very little downtime. I need the downtime if not to connect to the characters, then to at least feel that I am watching real people act and not just a CGI fest.<br/><br/>OK, there it is. I'm pinning my hopes on next week's ""Kick-Ass"" for a good movie experience."

Like most movies made after another, you don't want to copy what was done. Keeping to the roots is cool.<br/><br/>I hope this new version captures a new audience. Still a fan, I love any new version that does something that keeps old school old school.

"Bloomer","4","2","6","1 April 2010"," Pretty joyless...
","This remake of the starry-eyed 1981 Greek mythological fantasy adventure has a grungy, ugly look and a completely joyless opening quarter of an hour. Sam Worthington's blokey performance as Perseus turns out to be roughly interchangeable with the performances he gave in both Avatar and the last Terminator film, though Clash has next to no character development on the cards for Sam or any of its other actors. What little humour there is comes in the form of cynical one-liners from one of Perseus's bearded mates. The film is mostly a series of grunty fight scenes involving sandaled humans versus giant CGI monsters – giant scorpions, giant medusa, giant kraken, etc.<br/><br/>One of the heroes of the original Clash was a cute clockwork golden owl named Bubo. When trailers for the new Clash were screening, my friend and I joked about whether Bubo would make the remake. I said, ""there's no way they're going to have a cute robot owl. This film looks way too grungy and they're playing heavy metal music on the trailer.""<br/><br/>To all our surprises, Bubo did appear, albeit for ten seconds. Just before Perseus sets out on his adventure, he is digging around in a supply chest when he pulls out... Bubo, looking and sounding exactly like the little blighter did in 1981. This caused me to cry aloud: ""Oh my God!""<br/><br/>Perseus considers the owl briefly and says something like, ""What the hell is this?"" His bearded one-linery friend responds with, ""Don't worry about it, just leave it here."" Then they shove the owl back in the box and go adventuring. In retrospect this was the wittiest moment in the whole film, even if it only made sense to people who knew the original. If you had been wondering if the owl would reappear, this scene both satisfied your desire to see the owl again and then reassured you that, ""Okay, that's the owl issue dealt with, so no, the owl won't be in the film in general, and now you can stop worrying about it.""<br/><br/>The basic strike against the new film, which amounts to 1000 strikes, is that not a single aspect of it is developed in any satisfying way. Dialogue is absolute nuts and bolts stuff to propel the simple plot. The people in the film aren't moved when their pals are killed, so you aren't either. There's a cast of gods in Olympus, but 80% of them stand in the background saying nothing, etc. etc.<br/><br/>The new Princess Andromeda is dull as dishwater in a cut down role (but I was kind of in love with Judi Bowker of the original film, so I am biased). The principal female role now belongs to lovely Gemma Arterton as Io, the ageless half human, uh, toga'd spirit type woman.(?) If I thought anyone would ever say anything remotely poetic in this film, I'd have put money on her character saying it. But nobody does and she didn't.<br/><br/>The old Clash of the Titans was extraordinary with romance, G rated magic and beautiful scenery, no matter how naff some of it was. The new one is ugly and weak, brisk and dumb. I think it's safe to say that no kid who is seven years old now will be looking back on this film with any fondness in thirty years' time."

This updated JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS (1963) nicely infuses the plot with a rich assortment of Greek classical legendary myths. However, the script fails to fully capture the Zeus legendary emotional God paradox and successfully execute the special effects action/chase scenes like the last three STAR WARS or even HARRY POTTER movies were able to formulate.

","Unnecessary and unwanted remake of the 1981 Ray Harryhausen classic. At least it acknowledges the charm of the original was based around the wonderful stop motion animation, which it predictably replaces with an abundance of digital effects, including several CGI monsters copied directly from its predecessor (though not necessarily present in the original Greek myth), including giant scorpions and a very snake like Medusa. The plot remains largely the same, though in this more modern look on mythology the gods are treated with much less respect, portrayed as interfering omnipotent beings leeching off of humanity's worship over them, which is rapidly diminishing, making Zeus (who else but Liam Neeson) angry enough to release the monstrous Kraken on mankind, though he still deems humanity worthy enough to allow his son Perseus (Sam Worthington displaying his usual poor acting skills) to successfully fight the terror. Meanwhile, Zeus himself is betrayed by his brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes playing yet another effectively scary bad guy), God of Death – who by now is undoubtedly used to play the villain in Hollywood's contemporary view on mythology – so Perseus also needs to save his daddy despite not carrying much love for him. Though fairly entertaining, this movie simply features too much digital creature fights to make any of them memorable, except maybe for the final Kraken battle. The film is infamous for its horribly poor post-conversion 3-D effects, adding little depth at all but instead messing up many a shot. Though the movie covers most of the original film and actual myth, the amount of money it made warranted a sequel, Wrath of the Titans (2012), which ixnayed the story altogether and focused almost exclusively on people fighting digital monsters, to predictably disappointing results. Despite the failure, a third Clash is in the works. It remains unknown what Ray Harryhausen thinks of all this, but obviously Hollywood can't care less about the opinions of former masters of movie making magic."

","CLASH OF THE TITANS is surprisingly fun for an effects-heavy Hollywood blockbuster, a remake of Ray Harryhausen's last movie (of the same title), made in 1981. While this is the inferior version - and I'll always plump for stop motion effects over CGI - it remains an engaging, entertaining piece of modern cinema.<br/><br/>Meathead Sam Worthington gives another ultra-wooden turn as Perseus, a demigod on Earth who decides to go on a quest to teach the vengeful gods a lesson. He's teamed up with a bunch of characters who are far more interesting than him (including Mads Mikkelsen and a wooden golem type guy) and spends the rest of the movie battling various CGI creations.<br/><br/>The story is slim and the dialogue slimmer, filled with predictable characters and stereotypes (Gemma Arterton's walking exposition-type character is particularly ill served). The scenes with the gods are silly and trite, with the likes of Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson looking like they're dressing up at the local panto. In essence, CLASH OF THE TITANS is a string of set-pieces involving the mythological monsters of old, including the Medusa and the Kraken.<br/><br/>Yet something works. It's an easy film to watch, light-hearted and unpredictable in places in regards to the fate of certain characters. The movie is heavy on spectacle and the action isn't too bad at all. I enjoyed it, and I'll be sure to check out the sequel (WRATH OF THE TITANS) in due course..."
"piratecannon","6","1","2","26 December 2012"," It's all Greek to Me
","Let me get this out of the way first: I have not seen the original Clash of the Titans. Because of this, I'm—obviously—unable to compare this remake with the 1980′s flick that so many people have fond memories of. I must also explain why I chose to experience the latest vehicle for now Hollywood commodity Sam Worthington the old fashioned way (which, of course, would be within the realm of the two dimensional). Knowing that most 3D endeavors are typically laden with the worst sort of filmmaking gimmicks, I wanted to give this one the chance to ""wow"" me without waving the tail of a giant scorpion in my face or having a larger-than- life Kracken tentacle bearing down on me as I inhaled popcorn.<br/><br/>So, how does this over-the-top tale of Greek gods and mythical beasts fare? Really well, when one considers the fact that it was meant to be nothing more than a B-movie set in a long-forgotten world that plays within its own set of clearly defined rules.<br/><br/>If someone enters Clash of the Titans expecting high art, then A) they haven't seen a single one of the previews for the film, B) they've watched any one of the Lord of the Rings movies one too many times or C) they've somehow managed to snuff out their inner child. What we get here is essentially a watered down version of the God of War video game series: the character of Perseus isn't nearly as well developed as the ash-covered anti-hero Kratos, but he's infinitely more likable.<br/><br/>After watching his surrogate family perish at the hands of Hades, the demi-god (who's the son of Zeus) seeks revenge on the overly malicious god of the underworld. As he encounters the citizens of Argos—a town that's doomed because of it's blatant refusal to worship the inhabitants of Mt. Olympus—Perseus' motivations slowly shift toward the humane, and, after it's all said and done, he does emerge an enlightened protagonist. The word ""enlightened"" should be taken with many grains of salt, though, as this is character development of the most barebones variety. Titans is a movie that, despite its gargantuan scope, is strangely episodic in nature. Depending on your expectations, this is either a good thing or a bad thing, but, given the implicit nature of the movie, I found it to be entirely appropriate.<br/><br/>As one would imagine, this doesn't meant that Titans is entirely without fault. It does become a little tedious to watch Perseus hurl himself from one exotic/mysterious locale to another, and we hardly get to know any of his companions before they're impaled, dismembered, or turned to stone. And at 106 minutes, the movie feels like it ends prematurely (there's also the long-anticipated confrontation with the oft-alluded to ""monster of epic proportions,"" which, like a number of other scenes, is over far too quickly).<br/><br/>Still, this is a movie that's all about temporarily excusing reality and soaking up some beautifully crafted eye candy. In that regard, Clash of the Titans is just the sort of light-hearted fluff that most moviegoers are able to appreciate"

","Clash of the titans is great but they could have made it better if it wasn't for some mistakes which is pretty annoying. First of all the Kraken was a giant squid that crashed ships and so on, didn't look like that, this Kraken looked more like that pale alien that get sucked out in the space in the end in one of the Alien movies, don't remember which Alien movie to be honest. Second the the flying horsey Pegasos should have been white and not black, you guys should have done more research. Now the third thing and that was the fighting scenes was to short, like against Kraken and Hades just trowing a sword and he goes down to the underworld again... thought he was more powerful than that...could have dodged it or grabbed it.

","""Clash of the Titans"" could have been so much better. And as with many movies today, the problem was the length. This was way too short to make sense. The characters were one-dimensional, there was little-to-no backstory developed. There were plot holes you could drive a truck through. The visual effects, though life-like and well blended with the live action material, came at you way too fast. It was hard to keep track of who was dying, what just got destroyed, and which characters were where in the scene.<br/><br/>This movie is a prime example of why Avatar haters are wrong. This movie had everything Avatar had, 3D effects, lots of CGI, Sam Worthington, you name it. This movie falls unbelievably flat, and wasn't worth the price of the DVD.

"Boba_Fett1138","5","1","2","28 March 2012"," What a mess of a film.
","Lets all be honest, the original ""Clash of the Titans"" was far from a perfect or classic movie but it at least still offered some good entertainment, of a more old fashioned sort. This modern 'update' and remake of the 1981 movie is one huge mess to watch and only entertaining to watch, in some parts.<br/><br/>This is truly one bad constructed movie. The way scenes follow each other...it's all just so incredibly messy and feels totally disjointed. The movie truly never gets to flow well. There seems to be no interest for the story or any development at all and the 'story' is just being used as an excuse to throw in as many different action scenes as possible. Even the most shallow movie goers won't be fooled by this and will be annoyed by it instead, just like basically everybody else will.<br/><br/>I at least expected to be entertained by the movie its action and visuals but because nothing else about this movie really worked out, mostly because they simply didn't even bothered with it, all of its action also fell kind of flat. It occasionally gets a spectacular movie to watch but because you never feel involved with any of its characters and aren't taken by its story at all, since you'll basically have no idea what it is all about, you also don't ever feel any involvement or excitement for any of its action moments. Things just simply and very randomly happen, without making you care for any of it.<br/><br/>Now I admit that this all gets slightly better, as the movie heads toward its end but only just slightly! Still enough for me to give it an extra point but not enough to rate this movie as a good or entertaining enough one.<br/><br/>The moment when the movie started to get better for me, was when they entered Medusa's temple. I thought that scene was great and probably the highlight of the movie. The movie never peaked again after that but it was enough to keep me interested and it kept me watching, till the end.<br/><br/>There is no denying that this is also a good movie to look at, visually. It's obvious a whole lot of money got put into this movie, which makes still still look like a somewhat decent blockbuster. If only there was a better flow to the movie and its story, this might had been a good enough movie still but I now just can't recommend it at all to you.<br/><br/>The special effects are all pretty good but still, it also gives the movie a fake and unreal look, which also makes it hard to ever feel involved with any of the events happening in this movie.<br/><br/>I think that Sam Worthington is not half as bad as some people are trying to make you believe he is. He simply is a good and charismatic enough leading man, for any type of any type of action movie, this one included. But it's not like any of the actors get to do anything good in this movie. Even Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, who are also in this movie, get very little to do.<br/><br/>Too big of a mess to recommend this movie.<br/><br/>5/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","There is one scene in this movie that says it all: Perseus finds the annoying tin owl from the 1981 picture in a box of junk.

Here, this production shows nothing but disdain towards the brilliant original production. This pretty much sums up what you have to expect from this ""Clash of the Titans"".<br/><br/>State of the art CGI stuff, but otherwise annoying and shallow characters that fulfill all the clichés you could possible think of. Good vs. evil at its simplest. The plot drags on without much suspension. This movie is once again proof, that fancy special effects alone don't make a good movie."
"The-Sarkologist","7","1","2","16 February 2012"," A visually spectacular remake
","This movie is pretty much identical to the 1981 movie though the special effects are worthy of a modern movie and the plot seems to be somewhat tighter than the previous film. However, pretty much the themes and the plot remains the same. The story is really about how humanity has turned its back on the gods and declared war against them, believing that they are now the rightful rulers of the world. This is the theme that runs through the bible, however the difference is that in the bible, it is God who has been wronged, whereas in the film it is a matter of a power struggle between the gods and man, and sympathy tends to lie with men.<br/><br/>The background is (which sort of follows the Greek Myth) that the original rulers were the Titans, who were the parents of the current Greek pantheon. However, the gods, led by Zues, warred against the Titans and defeated them, and Zeus claimed rulership over Olympus. However, Zeus created humanity so that they might worship them, and that their prayers would be the fuel for their power. Hades, one of the three major gods, was tricked into becoming ruler of the underworld, and as such has arisen (in this film at least) as the bad guy. This is not entirely correct, as Hades was lord of the dead, but was not necessarily considered and evil god.<br/><br/>The main part of the movie opens with humanity going about a destroying the statues of the gods, and while they are destroying one particular statue, Perseus and his father are sailing by in their fishing boat. As man is destroying the idols, Hades appears and destroys the lot of them, and Perseus' family is killed in the ensuring melee. Perseus, who is then rescued by the Argives, is taken to Argos where he vows to seek vengeance for his father's death.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie sort of follows the same plot as the earlier version. The gods curse Argos (this is not the Argos that I knew, particularly since I did not believe that it was a port city, I know that there is currently no harbour in Argos, and that it is located at least 5 km from the sea) in that it will be destroyed by the Kraken (the Kraken is not a Greek monster, it is Scandanavian) unless the daughter of the king, Andromeda, is sacrificed (once again, this departs from the myth, as Andromeda was Ethiopian, and Perseus rescued her on his way back from killing Medusa). So, Peresus, and a number of soldiers, go on a quest to get the Medusa's head and kill the Kraken.<br/><br/>What differs in this film from the original is the Perseus rejects his divine heritage and seeks to do everything under his own power. He is a fisherman, and desires to remain a fisherman, but he is thrust into this world of adventure, against his will. In the original film, his love interest is Andromeda (as is the case in the myth) where as the filmmakers added Io into the mix, who becomes Perseus' love interest. The problem with Io is that she is not apart of this myth. In fact the story of Io is set much earlier than many of the other myths. Io was one of Zeus' lovers, however she was turned into a Heifer to hide her from Hera. However, Hera was not fooled, and set a gadfly to eternally torment her, driving her from place to place. Io was not human either, she was a Neried, a demi-god connected with nature and spring, and it is also suggested that her father was a river god. However, in the film she is a human who was cursed by Zeus to remain forever young because she rejected his advances.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, when it comes to a lot of movies like this I tend to be a purist. I have yet to see The Immortals (and am unlikely to do so in the near future, though I am sure to wander into a video shop sooner or later and hire it), and I simply groan whenever I see a movie that has liberally referred to the original source. Granted, not every book can easily be turned into a movie (particularly if we delve into the thoughts and feelings of the characters, which can be very hard to move onto the screen), but when the filmmakers clearly butcher ancient mythology, it does put me off. However, this film is still entertaining and visually spectacular, and the plot has been tightened up a lot more."
"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","6","1","2","5 January 2012"," Clash of the Titans (2010)
","The original Clash of the Titans is a pretty campy piece of fun. It was behind the times, but the stop motion animation was incredible. The remake is a more serious and action packed romp. The story has been added to, but they should have cut some stuff. Calibos shows up a couple of times but is pretty pointless as Hades is the main villain. The film excels thanks to the reliable Mads Mikkelson, whom gives his character some depth and delivers his lines with absolute conviction. It's a film that should satisfy the action junkies. Each set-up is played out on massive sets and on location. Leterrier's greenscreen reduction allows the world to seem very real. Ironically, the film is just as patchy as the original in terms of effects. The Medusa scene almost ruined the entire film. It was too fast, forgetting to build tension, and eliminating characters to simplify the ending. As for the CGI in the Medusa scene, it was as textureless and terrible as the Scorpion King in The Mummy Returns. It's amazing that 29 years on, a film with advanced technology could fail to capture the terrifying simplicity of stop- motion. The Kracken did look fantastic, and the scorpions were so-so. You can really tell where the budget went. If only there'd been a bit less CGI and bit more character development."

","The thing is, the first one was completely cheesy, and that was fine. It was enjoyable junk. In this...well, everyone's determined to play this seriously, and that is a very large mistake. To begin with: given the rich action in all Greek myth, it seems kind of unnecessary and stupid to rewrite it. The Kraken was a Norse creature, and Zeus never ordered such a beast from his brother. OK, you know that. Still - why? There are tons of monsters and titans to pull from. Then, Worthington. He tries (a little), but I can't get past the marine hair. It's like he slipped into the skirt on a break from 'Avatar'. But at least he's got the legs for it. Ultimately, this just isn't much fun. The CGI is all right, but both the Potter franchises and peter Jackson could sue; in fact, I truly thought Hades was Lord V all over again. Note to producers: next time, make Sam play it naked, or don't bother filming the rubbish. PS Last time I checked, Io was a cow, transformed from a maiden for her own protection. Oh, well.

Churches rejoice.<br/><br/>CLASH OF THE TITANS is written for 16-year-old boys, to be enjoyed exclusively by 16-year-old boys. Hell, I loved the 1981 original film. When I was 16. The 2010 remake obviously has better special effects and much better-realized and refined supernatural creatures, but the acting and the story have not graduated past the level of acceptance required by 16-year-old boys.<br/><br/>Perseus (Aussie Sam Worthington, who just can't seem to shake that accent as his ancestors Mel Gibson and Guy Pearce did), a demi-god in ancient Greece, must battle against the gods themselves when the city of Argos is forced to sacrifice its princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) to the Kraken.<br/><br/>Like any story that involves religion, everything happens for irrational reasons and without motivation and without any point. Perseus's very birth is laden with irrational backstory, as mortal King Acrisius (Jason Flemyng) feuds with Olympian god Zeus (Liam Neeson), causing Zeus to rape Acrisius's wife.<br/><br/>Let's backtrack for a moment: How exactly do you feud with a god? How does one ""raid Olympus""? Isn't it on another dimensional plane? And even if Olympus IS just a physical abode resting on the lowest clouds, how do the ancient Greek soldiery (possessing no flying machines) actually ATTACK Olympus?...<br/><br/>Onward...<br/><br/>Acrisius's wife births Perseus, who is half-god, half-Australian. Acrisius, in a fit of rage, uh, waits nine months until baby Perseus is born, to entomb both baby and mother in a coffin and hurl it into the sea ""to destroy Zeus's seed."" Guess his ""fit of rage"" didn't take into account it might have been easier to just stab the mother while she was pregnant...<br/><br/>Long story short: Perseus lives, becomes a fisherman, in a world which has started to defy the gods who created them. Soldiers destroy a giant Zeus statue and broham Hades, ruler of the underworld, immediately appears as a giant black winged entity (with smaller bat-winged demons reminiscent of JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS) and wipes the floor with the soldiers. So what kind of cretin would continue insulting gods? Yet they do. Queen Cassiopeia of Argos boasts that her daughter Andromeda is more beautiful than the goddess Aphrodite, at which point Hades (Ralph Fiennes, doing his best Gary Oldman), appears again and calls for Andromeda's sacrifice - or he will release the Kraken (which we presume is a Very Bad Thing because he pronounces the name so terribly feyly).<br/><br/>After Hades lays down his curse, Perseus unwittingly gets roped into the quest to stop the Kraken, which involves visiting Stygian witches, taming a Pegasus flying horse, lopping off the head of the gorgon Medusa and using it to turn the Kraken to stone. While Hans Zimmer's music makes it epic on toast. All in a day's work for a demi-god. But Perseus spends half his skirt-wearing, sword-wielding time bitching about wanting to be a man not a god.<br/><br/>Perseus maintains to Zeus, ""We live, we fight and we die for each other - not for you,"" which again, is spoken like a man living in a world WITHOUT gods, or in a world with imaginary gods, i.e. ours. If the gods showed themselves and performed magical, physics-bending havoc when you defied them, I'm betting you would learn quicksmart how to live, fight and die for them.<br/><br/>Blaming director Louis Leterrier and writers Travis Beacham, Phil Hay, Matt Manfredi for these discrepancies would be like blaming Peter Jackson for the illogical happenings in THE LORD OF THE RINGS. The Greek mythology is already written - if the movie writers stuck to every detail and inserted every ulterior motivation of the complex characters, we would need a trilogy of movies. As a movie version of CLASH OF THE TITANS had already been written in 1981 by Beverly Cross, these remake writers simply took that script - and dumbed it down even further.<br/><br/>As illustrated by the box office, no one cares. In modern parlance, ""going Greek"" doesn't involve mythological classicism.<br/><br/>The visualization of the creatures - from Flemyng's Calibos makeup to the ferryman Charon, to Medusa, the Pegasus and the Kraken - is monstrously good, although I will say that Medusa should have been topless. She's a snake-like monster who lives amongst ruins and turns people to stone with her stare; can you really see her adjusting her ornate bra for maximum push-up effect? I'm just sayin.' Movie makes an infantile decision to paint Hades as a ""villain,"" as if synonymous with the Christian devil, but Hades was not a simple polar opposite to Zeus; Zeus ruled Olympus, Poseidon ruled the oceans and Hades ruled the underworld, which was called either Tartarus, Elysium or Erebus, and was a region ALL human souls passed through, not just ""bad"" ones. And Olympus was NOT the equivalent of Christian heaven, it was the exclusive abode of the gods - NO human was allowed there.<br/><br/>Would that any human cast his unworthy gaze on Liam Neeson's fake pirate's beard and absolutely fabulous outfit; gadding about in a shimmering silvery ballroom gown made of chromium wings that is even gayer than his costume as Qui-Gon Jin.<br/><br/>The grandest misnomer of all: the twelve Titans of Ancient Greece were Cronus, Oceanus, Tethys, Mnemosyne, Hyperion, Themis, Thea, Iapetus, Phoebe, Rhea, Coeus and Crius. None of whom appear in the movie. (Though Zeus and Hades are erroneously regarded as Titans by some texts, they are merely offspring of Titans, Cronus and Rhea.) So... a movie called CLASH OF THE TITANS which features not one actual Titan.<br/><br/>The movie makers are just bending us over and going Greek on us."

And in general, popular actors themselves say something just a couple of phrases in the movie and all, well, then disappear and finally say something pathetic. If even shoot a blockbuster about the gods, we must just think about the story, so everything was like in history, not to push any crabs in 3D. Even for the sake of the actors do not want to overstate the estimate. The film boring, insipid. But what can I say, a movie with absolutely no soul. The fact that he filmed for the money, it is evident, Jonathan Libesmen lift a decent sequel, his films with a soul, he knows how to make blockbusters and at the same time he thinks about the plot, and not dully shoves 3D and the cast of the first magnitude.

","I came into this movie with not many expectations as I didn't want to ruin it, but there was just too much going on to keep straight.<br/><br/>The Greek idea of this movie was definitely apparent; the clash between the humans and Olympians. However, they added too many other mythological ideas. The kraken, which is from Norse mythology, was supposedly created by Hades. Along the voyage, Perseus and his group encounter Jinns, from Arabic myths. Not sure why they were even there, but apparently they come with an alien-like self destruct mechanism.<br/><br/>Medusa is pretty much the Roman mythology version of the character. Ravaged by Poseidon and punished by Athena. In the Greek mythology, she and Poseidon lay together, and she didn't beg Athena for help.<br/><br/>Many of the myths of Greek mythology are there but changed. Andromeda being sacrificed to the kraken is close, but there's no kraken in Greek mythology.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the movie looked very good. I liked the plot idea and I was a very big fan of the CGI. Medusa looked great, as did the kraken, even though it turned into a more advanced looking version of Godzilla and Gamera. And for some reason, Perseus falls in love with Io rather than Andromeda as he did in mythology.<br/><br/>Zeus was humbled in the end, which is rather the opposite of his character, and Hades was portrayed for most of the movie as a feeble old man who cowered from Zeus. Again, the opposite of mythology as all of the Olympians feared Hades. Sadly, when the battle between Hades and Perseus came, it was over too quickly with one sword throw.<br/><br/>But besides my finding faults with the mythological side of the movie, it was entertaining and well done. The CGI, as said before, was very good and it had a great plot to it."
"ajs-10","5","1","2","20 February 2011"," Nice visuals but not a great film...
","As this film was released in 3D I had no interest in seeing it when it was released, I'm not a fan of paying extra for something that adds very little to the film and usually gives me a headache. Although, I believe, it made a bit of money, it was not critically well received. Well, I don't always agree with them, but on this occasion I'm here to tell you I have to agree with the critics. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those who don't wish to know anything about the plot please fend off those giant scorpions while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>The gods live on mount Olympus and feed off the worship of the humans below. Unfortunately the humans are getting restless and don't feel the love any more. The leader of the gods, Zeus, isn't too happy about this and when his brother, Hades comes to him with a plan, he listens. Hades wants to teach the humans a lesson by releasing the Kraken, a giant sea monster, on them. Meanwhile back with the humans, a young man, a son of Zeus called Perseus is chosen to find a way to defeat the Kraken. A band of men go with him and one woman, Io, who proves to be of great help to Perseus. They must first find three witches who hold the secret to destroying the Kraken I think you get the drift. There's also the story of how the gods are trying to stab each other in the back going on, but I think there's enough there to give you the gist.<br/><br/>This is a very well made film, you can tell they had a pretty large budget to make this one. There is quite a lot of CGI and it is all of high quality. The trouble is, it did tend to detract from the story by making the visuals more important and not progressing the story in places. Decent performances all round; Sam Worthington was good as Perseus, although I felt he was a little too subdued for the role. Liam Neeson donned the sparkly armour and did a good job as Zeus, Ralph Fiennes was the best of the bunch (IMO) as Hades, you got two for the price of one with Jason Flemyng as Calibos/Acrisius and Gemma Arterton did a decent job as Io.<br/><br/>I felt the plot was a little over complicated, there were lots of sub-plots going on and I could feel it getting a little confusing at times. Although the visuals were great, again, they didn't really add a great deal (for me). Over all, although it's not going to win any prises, it's entertaining enough, a good one for a wet Sunday afternoon on the TV but I wouldn't pay to see it in the cinema.<br/><br/>My score: 5.2/10"
"MLDinTN","6","1","2","12 January 2011"," OK story and special effects
","While the acting is nothing to talk about, the movie does have good special effects, but not great. Perseus, a demi-god, sets upon a quest to save a kingdom against Hades and the Kraken. He also has a personal grudge against Hades since he is responsible for his human families deaths.<br/><br/>So, he sets out with some soldiers and travels through a desert. There they encounter these mystical people and giant scorpions. Here we get a battle scene that after a while gets old. One of the desert people joins the quest as they go to see these witches to learn how to defeat the Kraken. Then it is off to the underworld and to kill Medusa. The Medusa part was OK, but the special effects could have been better. Then the fall of the Kraken was rather uneventful.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: The story definitely could have been better. But it was a descent action flick. I recommend it if an action film is what you are looking for."

","The line I posted for the summary title, whether you like it or not, has to be the corniest line in the history of movies. But, I like that line delivered by Liam Neeson as Zeus. I think that's what stood out in the movie other than the CGI.<br/><br/>This movie is a remake of the 1981 original. It's about Perseus who goes on a quest to rid Ancient Greece from the evil of Hades.<br/><br/>I have mixed reactions on the acting. Some were excellent such as Liam Neeson or Ralph Fiennes who reminded me of Lord Voldemort from the Harry Potter films. Sam Worthington i think is miscast. He looked like the same guy from Avatar.<br/><br/>This movie is what I call a good popcorn film. There is impressive action and CGI(especially to the kraken). The script and some of the acting is mediocre. But, most people including myself likes that kind of film. I can't wait for the second one in 2012. I rate this movie 8/10."
"MBunge","5","1","2","10 September 2010"," What do you expect out of this sort of thing?
","The new Clash of the Titans does show off all the advances in special effects made since the original back in 1981. But while the first one wasn't exactly a masterpiece of storytelling, this remake might be even dumber and a bit more obviously slapped together. I don't think these filmmakers tried to make a good movie. I think they tried to make a big, loud, flashy distractionand they succeeded at that.<br/><br/>At a time when humanity is rebelling against the dominion of the Olympian gods, young Perseus (Sam Worthington) sees his family killed by Hades (Ralph Fiennes), the lord of the underworld. Perseus finds himself in the city of Argos just as it threatened with divine destruction. For its defiance of the gods, Argos must either sacrifice the beautiful Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) or be destroyed in 10 days by the monstrous Kraken. Perseus sets out on a quest to find a way to defeat the giant beast, but not before learning that he is the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson). Joined by a small band of warriors and an immortal girl named Io (Gemma Arterton), Perseus battles a series of CGI creatures and one dude in traditional monster make up.<br/><br/>This film looks good, though it doesn't come close to the visual magic of Avatar. It moves relatively quickly, has a few honestly funny lines and its action scenes are both reasonably exciting and comprehensible. Very little of it makes sense if you think too hard, but who goes to see a movie like this to think?<br/><br/>None of the performers embarrass themselves here, though none of them are asked to do more than the acting equivalent of walking and chewing gun at the same time. Only actresses Gemma Arterton and Alexa Davalos are noteworthy, each making a real effort to give depth to roles that don't ask them to do more than look pretty (which they also do quite well). Sam Worthington continues the trend toward more straightforward and unflamboyant action heroes. He's little more than a crash test dummy in this film as what little characterization there is in this script gets sprinkled among the supporting roles/cannon fodder.<br/><br/>The new Clash of the Titans isn't ""good"" in any meaningful sense of the word. For a big budget blockbuster, though, it isn't noticeably bad. The bar for these sorts of movies has sadly been set rather low and this film barely manages to get over it. If you like this sort of cinema, you'll have a decent time. If you loathe this sort of brain-optional spectacle, there's nothing here to change your mind."
"scarletminded","1","1","2","10 September 2010"," Dumped on the Greek myths even more than the first one did...
","OK, the first Clash of the Titans didn't follow the Greek myths exactly. Aphrodite gave Perseus his weapons, not Athena, for example and it was Ray Harryhausen who wanted a Kraken because he hadn't done a stop motion Kraken, since there wasn't one in the myth.<br/><br/>But at least the old version had a romance, charm, the silly owl and witty banter between the Gods. Here, there isn't the majesty of Athena with her owl or Hera with her peacock, only Zeus and Hades in an almost Christian aimed fight of good and evil that doesn't line up with Greek myths or ancient Greek culture. Hades has winged demons, red eyes and basically is like the devil, which he isn't in Greek myth. He just guards the underworld. Poseidon barely makes an appearance as does Apollo...I got sort of nostalgic for the dialog between Hera and Zeus which isn't here. Aphrodite is just an extra here too...and at least the old version had one Titan, Thetis, in it...this one has none. It cuts out most of the dialog of the Gods that appeared in the original and that was what I wanted to see. I thought Zeus with the eagle in the background on the trailer led me to believe Hera would be there with her peacock and Athena with her owl. It's like none of the Greek Goddesses even had a voice there. That's really sexist. <br/><br/>The charm of the Gods' dialog and other things has been taken over by dark Hot Topic like cool. Gone is Perseus' mother who played a big part in the myth. Gone is the challenge Perseus had to get the Medusa head in order for his mother to not be forced into marriage she didn't want. Gone is the romance with Andromeda, who he falls in love with from returning from his quest. Gone are most of the Olympians, since this has to be only a bland good vs. evil movie. Gone are the Hesperides too. A plot line to save family is whittled into a boring revenge movie because a guy can't get some fish in his boat. <br/><br/>There are other things wrong with this movie too. The Medusa has a pretty face for some reason. And a metal hip Hot Topic metal hand piece. Rock and roll. I don't get it. I feel the story of Perseus is very interesting if you follow the myth so why this garbage? It feels like the screenwriters have never read a lick of Greek mythology. I mean, they call Pegasus ""The Pegasus"" which really bothered me and the horse was black, not white. And there was a herd of them. Zeus' eagle is now a bald eagle, is that supposed to be a US metaphor or something? Poseidon and/or Athena created Pegasus, only one of them. And what was up with Io? She's from another myth. Cursed with not being a cow, but with immortality. What? And Charon looked like a bad Halloween store prop. And Hades comes also to reek revenge when Andromeda is said to be more beautiful than Aphrodite...I was expecting Aphrodite to come to bash heads, but she didn't. And the Djinn, why where they even there? Wrong mythology. Which throws Islam into the already Christian Zeus (God)/Hades (devil), Perseus (Jesus) framework. It's such a mess, I don't know what else to say about that.<br/><br/>This movie is like a vampire, sucking any joy out of the myths. They replaced a story about how a man tried to destroy his son because of an omen and turned it into a lackluster adventure film. It has no heart, no decent acting other than Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, but really, give them a phone book to read and it would be worth while to see. I started fast forwarding through it once I saw Hera wasn't around to counter Zeus, nor Athena with her owl. Disappointing. The rest was lame adventure film with OK special effects. I wish it could have had more story or once closer to the Greek myths. Like I said the first version messed up Greek myth a bit but at least had charm. It was fun, it uplifted you at the end, kids could see it, it was more of a family film. This is pure dreck. It's devoid of any values, moral quests since in the myth Perseus is trying to help his mom, romance or anything joyful. It's just dark and vapid. Eye candy for those who don't have the patience to read a book on Greek myths."
"eddax","6","1","2","6 September 2010"," Adequate but unremarkable
","I'm pretty sure I watched the original Clash of the Titans and forgot to rate it. Now I have no idea what I thought of it. Anyway, there is enough of a deja vu from having watched Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief.<br/><br/>This movie was quite adequate in terms of special effects and action, but unremarkable in every way (I say that now that it's been 3 weeks since I've watch the movie and I'm hard-pressed to remember any good scene). Sometimes the special effects were too obvious - as with medusa and the kraken - but at other times it looked pretty good. The story, meh. I don't know which bits were the original mythology but it all felt too manipulated towards its inevitable conclusion. And I'm pretty sure Zeus can't resurrect anybody without getting Hades to do it. <br/><br/>I'd like to comment on Sam Worthington but I can't. If he had been painted blue, I would've thought I were watching Avatar. He hasn't really been given a chance to progress beyond emo action hero. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are both hammy and disposable. I think they really should've gone with legends for the roles of gods, like how they had Laurence Olivier and Maggie Smith in the original."
"MarkSaltzer","8","1","2","28 August 2010"," Entertaining None The Less
","The story may be a copy of the 1981 Classic, but who cares, this version was well executed with visual effects that did it justice. The adventure was well worth the watch. The performances were typical of a Hollywood blockbuster, but after all the negative feedback on my shoulders, I was still able to carry myself through this film without complaining once. Everything from the costumes and production design to the visual effects and stunt work was spot on. Excellent detail and a black Pegasus just to keep the political correctness in place, probably would have been a white Pegasus if Bush was still in power. Highly recommend this film for those of us who enjoy a good adventure even if it is a stylish and well executed rehash.<br/><br/>Footnote: This came directly from IMDb news updates.<br/><br/>Warner Brothers is backing a ""REMAKE"" of Ray Harryhausen's Clash of the Titans and has attracted some first rate talent to the project."
"p-stepien","4","1","2","25 August 2010"," Epitome of dumb fun
","In this very loose retelling of the myth of Perseus and his quests which lead him to kill Kraken, Medusa and and host of other beasts everything is big. Except for the storytelling. Cutting bits and pieces of real myths they mold it into a pretentious story about a demigod Perseus, who loves man more than god and will do anything to destroy the gods, including his own father. Well... later on Zeus is a good pal with whom our hero chit chats... but initially he's 'ble'.<br/><br/>I understand the gods like playing with humans, but the whole storyline keeps running into hurdles and instead of jumping them it hits them head-on. This is epitomised by Zeus first saying 'Release the Kraken', but simultaneously assisting Perseus in killing Medusa and giving him a couple of playthings to boot (a sword and even a Pegasus).<br/><br/>Than you also have key elements of mythology unrecognisably changed. Most of it doesn't bother me, but why the scriptwriter introduced a character called Io to be Perseus's fling instead of sticking with Andromeda, sacrificed to the Kraken and rescued by our hero, is a retcon worthy of a head check.<br/><br/>What worries more is the amount of corny lines coupled with bad scripting and less than enthralling characters and you can understand why this movies stumbles to achieve an improvement on the original, albeit the special effects are way more impressive. The last scene of the movie with Zeus and Perseus talking is a telling example, but such sub-par corny scenes litter this movies constantly. The further we enter the movie the more obvious they become, when the clichés and poor character writing (exemplified by the pair of hunters introduced solely for the occasional comedic relief) drag this movie to the ground.<br/><br/>On the plus side the Kraken is really impressive as were the giant scorpions. But even there the action sequences seemed to lack something. All in all it would have probably been better if the movie had copied the route suggested by Zack Snyder's ""300"" and basically overdid the action, pathos and performances on purpose to make the movie out of this earth."
"les6969","4","1","2","23 August 2010"," Big disappointment
","Sam Worthington was the wrong person to play Perseus in this awful remake. He is wooden and has no screen presence but worst of all why did he keep his hair like that? All the other actors made an effort to look the part, but he looked like a modern soldier who had been sent back in time. Added to that the fact that his accent was clearly Australian or New Zealand, ( I don't care which ) he really stood out for all the wrong reasons in my opinion. The CGI was outstanding but the sequences themselves surprisingly boring. I didn't care about the outcome too much and the only one that was remotely good was the Gorgon sequence near the end. A lot of the monsters were over done, especially the scorpions, it was a bit unbelievable that they could have been so easily defeated. The way the story was shown in this remake also lacked humour apart from the golden owl send up ( always hated that owl in the original anyway ) But as I said the main failing was Sam Worthington's totally unbelievable performance. This could have been a better film with a stand out character in the lead role."
"Targe","4","1","2","11 August 2010"," I never thought I'd say this, but the original is better!
","And the original was awful.<br/><br/>The holes in this movie are 'Legion', which is funny, because for some strange reason, Greek warriors keep talking about 'serving in the Legion', which is nonsense. This movie is supposed to be set in classic Greece, and Greeks served in the Army, ROMANS served in the Legion. Their uniforms and weapons are also decidedly Roman, what is with this fixation with Rome? Do Americans think Greek soldiers are not man enough?<br/><br/>The story is garbage. Really not sure what Zeus is doing, we never have any idea what he is up to, suddenly at the end Hades his brother 'deceives' him, how again? Oh, the Kraken is going to kill everyone instead of make them worship you, or some such nonsense?<br/><br/>HOW do you fly out of hell? If your trapped on the wrong side of the Styx, your DONE, you can't fly out of Hades, that's just stupid, or all the birds that die would get away. The battle with Medusa was pathetic, he just happens to spot a shiny shield at the last minute, 'Just don't look at her!' is his strategy going in?? The original, where he thought it out and then polished up a shield, is far better.<br/><br/>Where is the ship? Didn't Perseus sail around on a ship, ala Jason and the Argonauts? I guess they blew the budget on the stupid fat Kraken thing, no money left for showing sailing ships. So we are treated to a bunch of Roman dudes wandering through the forest, with some girl in tow that somehow, nobody even questions or asks about.<br/><br/>Then we get giant scorpions. The action is so badly done, too up close and in your face, that I miss him getting swallowed. How does a scorpion, which have very tiny mouths, swallow a guy in armour, anyway? They don't swallow their food anyway.<br/><br/>SO then these weirdo evil looking mages show up. We don't see them tame the scorpions, just the start of them doing that, then next scene they are all riding giant scorpions. WTF?? <br/><br/>This movie has: - Horrible writing, full of plot holes, missing info, stupid contrived devices, you name it. - Horrible acting. Watching Liam trying to fumble his way through a horribly written Zeus was cringe-worthy, and I typically LOVE anything the man attempts. - Horrible editing. The scenes jump, there's missing parts that we need to know, etc, just a bad cut job overall.<br/><br/>I thought it was quite telling of them to chuck away the mechanical owl in the barracks at the beginning, an obvious slight thrown at the first Clash of the Titans movie, like somehow we all hated that damn owl and they were telling us NO, we AIN'T DOIN' THE DAMN OWL again, like somehow that would have us cheering from the rafters or something. I was disappointed when they left him behind, I liked the mechanical owl, and to me, this was saying, ""We will not get anywhere NEAR as good as the first movie, so we won't even bother to try using the robot owl""<br/><br/>Thumbs down, I want my money back, garbage."

But the real pain is that the characters were hollow and pointless, and their lines were just included to fill space between two special effects. <br/><br/>The director should have seen King Kong by Peter Jackson before doing this remake. My recommendations beside the perfect King Kong, are Beowulf and Outlander. Enjoy in those movies."

Oh, just for the record, if you witnessed 1981's ""Clash of the Titans"" you'll understand what I mean. I was just 10 years old when I watched it and it was brilliant - No 3D, no CGI, just a great story with a great ride to be on for 2 hours. When there's a remake of an old movie, it should add some depth, some good acting, some ""WOW"". There was nothing there. Actors were as if they were reading from a piece of paper learning how to be in a movie; false feelings, false rage, false fear..I didn't care for any of them. Sam Worthington is not a good actor (And I am an Avatar fan), the accent is awful. He shouldn't star in these ""block buster"" films.

A hunky hero with not much to say passed the occasional grunt and screaming ""NEVERRRRR"" every so often and that should do. Some passable but below par and overall unbelievable CGI. The kind of CGI that makes you wonder if you are ever going to see old school special effects again. The kind of CGI that makes you think that nothing moves like that in reality and really these people are just standing around on a set pretending to look astounded. It just makes it seem a little foolish. Not epic regaurdless of the theme, not enough GOOD action for action, no humour at all, no romance, no friendships although they tried to fake one up it just didn't stick or was lost on the editing floor.

"vlad-alexandru88","4","1","2","8 July 2010"," Mature and Classical Era Percy Jackson?
","Well, given the last few ""epic"" movies that have disappointed us more and more, I can't say I was expecting much from ""Clash of the Titans"". But I really did not expect yet another gross insult to Greek mythology.<br/><br/>10 minutes into the movie, after the narrative and a few corny, over- the-top CGI shots of Olympus, I knew this movie was going to be bad, but against my better judgment I watched it until the end.<br/><br/>First of, saying that the movie ""deviates"" from the original myth is a huge understatement. It is basically a collage of the most popular items in Greek mythology. Take one son of Zeus, add a huge powerful Kraken that has nothing to do with said son of Zeus, mix it up with a bit of Medusa (oh how fans love Medusa) and finally add some ""touching"" scenes of beautiful flying Pegasi and the classic Hollywood ""hero gets the girl"" and you have a mainstream high-budget crap-fest because ""Hey! Who cares? People are so ignorant they don't even have a clue who Perseus is. They just want epic battles"".<br/><br/>The sad truth is that people actually fall for this crap. I'm not even going to bother to enumerate all the things wrong with the story, most literate people will know for themselves, the others... well they probably rated it 10 because they liked the shiny sword.<br/><br/>The story would not have been SO bad if at least the acting and directing was worth ""the ferryman's bribe"". The only decent actor in the movie is Liam Neeson, but even he manages to make a mess of things. It might not be his fault, the dialogue is so sketchy that you'd actually think it's all improvised. <br/><br/>To sum it all up, ""Clash of the Titans"" is the ""original bad copy"" of ""Percy Jackson"", more bloody, more action, more and more CGI."

","I went to the theaters with some friends to see this film. One of them wanted to watch the movie in 3D. I knew it was a bad idea considering that Avatar turned out the same way with or without the glasses. Yes, I know that the whole 3D experience is used to prevent piracy and make theaters more appealing to people. But now it is just a shameful method to charge more. In reality, I wouldn't feel so upset to pay more if both Avatar and Clash of the Titans were actually 3D movies, but they weren't. There were no differences when I took off those annoying glasses. It might work with other movies but it felt like a rip-off.<br/><br/>Now, onto the movie. It haven't watched the original movie, but I'm familiar with Greek mythology. I know that it is not possible to put every detail in a movie, so I expected a lot of differences between the actual stories and this movie. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but in this case the plot was not able to stand for itself. The movie turned out to be very weak. It was mostly consisting in some not so well done action sequences between some of the most forgettable characters in the world. Well, that is mostly due the lack of competent actors. If you ask me about this movie in the future, I will most certainly forget it before I'm able to give you an answer.<br/><br/>The script didn't help either. In fact it made this whole experience worst. When some characters were in Medusa's temple. the main character said: ""Let's kill that b*tch"". It felt like a kick in the throat. I know that they weren't supposed to speak ancient Greek, but come on.<br/><br/>It's a shame that this the first time that Ralph and Liam got together since the great ""Schindler's List"". They weren't really good in this one.<br/><br/>It is certainly hard to find mainstream movies with some depth or with some little accuracy regarding the period of time they're trying to portrait. I think that if a film takes place in japan (And it's not made there), the actor should try to speak Japanese at least. But the target audience is too dumb and lazy to even read subtitles.<br/><br/>This is another mindless mainstream film. Some might love it, but I don't care for it."

","Clash of the Titans was a movie I was really looking forward to. being a fan of the monster genre and being interested in mythology, I thought this would be brilliant...I was wrong.<br/><br/>The plot lacks depth and moves too quickly meaning much of the detail which could have been there is lost. Many of the scenes are poorly executed such as the scenes where Zeus and the other Gods are talking on Olympus. This could have been much better, the room looked tiny and the clouds beneath them just didn't feel real. When one imagines Olympus, you think huge rooms, giant pillars, ornate decorations, domed ceilings and all this just wasn't there. The acting is worse, with Sam Warrington's accent changing from scene to scene. One thing which really ruined the film for me was before they are about to kill Medusa and Perseus (Warrington) says 'Don't look this bitch in the eye', now as far as I know, no one said 'bitch' 2000 years ago. So if you want an accurate movie, this isn't it.<br/><br/>Its only saving grace is the monsters and effects which are, thankfully, good. The Kraken is especially good, but the same cannot be said for how it is killed. Warrington just shows it Medusa's head...no epic battle?! Same with how he defeats Hades, he just throws Zeus's sword at him, throwing him to the underworld. <br/><br/>The movie is too rushed and so much potential depth is lost.

I know maybe they still make it based on the original story or it's predecessor but its OK to make it a little bit different , for me, I think people prefer good story although it was totally fiction than original history that will make them yawn during the show. third, this was imperfect way for Sam Worthington, as you know , avatar was impressively stunning, incredible one, ever! and then what? After avatar, he is on this movie? it was like after you eat a piece of delicious black forest, then someone gives you a s*** to eat, you wont eat it right? of course you wont, Sam shouldn't take a part in this movie. fourth, I know it might be silly, but I need to say it all to you, I still wondering about how could be Hades had a son named Kraken and just as you know, Kraken is not a god, he's not even looks like as ""son"", I thought it was only happened on sponge bob square pants world, a crab named Eugene could have a daughter named Perth and guess what? she's a whale! but its very OK then, it was a movie after all =D I'm so relieved that my sister had no time to go cinema with me, if she has, I might in tear because I'll lost some money for waste. and by the way, the visual effects were amazingly dull, especially those scorpions, they just look like unfinished 3D animation assignment of a 1st grader of high school student! my suggestion, next time hire more eligible people please... but OK, It's good that I found : to kill a mega big and cruel and powerful Kraken you don't need any nuclear weapons, all you need is a Medusa's head, kind of simple, no waste,rocks except, and you can use them for buildings."

","This movie has no essence, no value, no logic... no nothing. This is the type of bullsh*t movie that producers and directors these days like to spend money on it becauseeeeee... it sells to the masses.<br/><br/>The storyline is... Wait! There is no storyline. Maybe I'm ignorant but what's the actual story? It starts there, it continues there and it ends there. This is the story. It has no substance and no narrative delivery whatsoever. There is no why/when/who/what or where. It's just simple, dull, boring and so obvious. There is no emotion that this movie could deliver, there is no reason it's just more of a MOTIVE to do a movie that will fill their pockets. So, like I said, the story itself has meaning and it's rushed-up just for the fight between Perseus and the Cracken or whatever his name is, which by the way, the fight was ended in less than 3 minutes. But was it a fight? Was it something ""cool"" to watch? Hell Naw... The dialogue was more than lame... I mean I could come with so many disturbing things about this movie but it's just to WEAK... not just WEAK but BAD...<br/><br/>The acting didn't save this movie at all... everyone either overplayed or just missed to fit into their role... Hades was ridiculous! Ralph Fiennes did a very poor job, I mean I was not feeling at all he was Hades... he sounded like he had been on the crack-pipe the night before he shot those scenes... When I first heard him i was laughing my ass off in the theater... Zeus was lame... he sounded more like a Hades instead of the King of Heavens. Gemma Arterton was the only good thing about this movie but wait I forgot about someone didn't I? OH YEAHHH! Sam Worthington as the mighty Perseus... such a lame performance... he was Jake Sully in this... I think the movie Avatar was that good and required real hard-work for him that affected his persona... so LOL!... Oh and Medusa? What the hell they were thinking? Let's finish with the script and acting since there was none of both and move to the way the movie was made. It was edited badly, many of the hand-to-hand fight scenes were filmed in closed-caption angles, and the cinematography was poor, I mean there were no actual stand-out moments or anything... it was just boring and disturbing. The visual effects who in the trailer looked so awesome were a joke. I mean the scorpions, especially their movement, the winged horses, even the Cracken was terribly made. You saw it was fake from 10 miles... it was that obvious and for a 2010 film that promoted the visuals more than the story or concept it is just unacceptable. Not to mention i laughed when I saw it in 3D... 3D? Really? It was bad... a lot of blur here a lot of blur there... and there was no stability during the movie.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was ... I could not even remember it because of how bad the movie was I was more impressed by the failed elements so to see the good parts in it was kind of hard... The good parts... Maybe some of the characters which might seem cool to watch or I don't know... It's hard to get the good things out of this... Absolutely forgot to mention that this was a big insult to the original movie...<br/><br/>This movie was/is such a joke... I think as far as expectations and the outcome it's definitely a stand-out this year for failure in cinema... Hate my review if you want... movie was bad."

While in classic films there was a story unto soluble and artists who love their roles and elevate out of the personal these days as the wonderful thoughts and bring them to the creator and no one can do this way again. I know I took you in a maze but it's my passion for movies Heritage Classic. The Sense of disgust with the film and director of the film where a hero Tal we do not know yet where he came by for a reckless understands something of the session of Will Wright older version of the film Did you see how he felt the hero shows that he Romany Did you see the expressions of it addressed Will Wright when he was sweating and fear of Medusa Have you seen a love story great between him and Princess Did you see how watched the winged horse and how kindergarten and how the war horse you ever noticed that the story of the conflict between the true fraternal evil and the good the Princess isn't All of this is better than the film does not make sense is that he wants to be just contrary to the original version and it does everything opposite to prove its existence until it reached its limit to make it shield metal from the inside unlike all the armor in the world to prove that his film printing own. Conclusion I think that this movie is very bad compared to the original classic masterpiece, and he focused so as to be contrary just so lending itself to a special character and he came out the worst foul."
"heath-stephenson","2","1","2","18 May 2010"," Lets take some mythology and ignore it.
","I watched this film then went out side and shot a guinea pig. It is awful, the directors have read the synopsis of a couple of comics based loosely on Greek mythology and made the movie on what they found on the back of a serial box. To be more accurate, they based the movie on what the got from interviewing a 4th grade student and then adding some Hollywood editing. But then again what should we expect? This is what they do now days, take ideas and put them through the big MACHINE, which consiquently is what I believe the Hollywood sign is. This used to be a very effective process, ideas went in and great movies came out but now days it seems to have gone a bit hit and miss and this is one big miss. Sure there are some pretty cool effects but we, the audience, have gotten so used to it now that it is of now effect. These films now feel like they are lacking in something and it seems to be taking some while for the producers to realise that it is content that they are lacking. Clash of the Titans is amusing at best, there are some big explosions and some interesting scenes but overall I had to work hard to maintain any sort of interest. I would say that if this review did nothing to convince you not to watch then enjoy but I know you wont.<br/><br/>Enjoy"
"rayanredstorm","2","1","2","14 May 2010"," Uhmm... no.
","Let me start off by saying this movie SUCKS. It has to be the worst one of the year. <br/><br/>First of all, It's story is terrible, I don't want to spoil anything for you but this movie is so bad that it doesn't even matter. So here it is: Humanity is revolting against the Greek gods, so the god of the underworld threatens to release the ""Kraken"" unless the humans kill a princess (I'm confused as well. This plot sucks.)<br/><br/>So instead of killing the princess, they decide to go on a journey to prevent the kraken from coming. Sounds epic, but too bad it's horribly executed. The action starts off with the God of the underworld sending his personal fighter (How cliché) out to kill the group of adventurers. He fails, and it results into a fight against giant CG scorpions. Then the adventurers fight some Labyrinth of Pan creatures, and then they fight more stuff.... and then they fight some more, and then some more, and then finally, the best part of the movie... the credits roll. <br/><br/>This movie is just a mindless fight to the next. That's it. <br/><br/>This is basically God of War smashed carelessly into a movie. The only difference is that God of War is better in every way (did I mention it's a video game?)<br/><br/>So do yourself a favor, save your money to see Robin Hood instead. You will thank me.<br/><br/>I give this a 2/10 (and I'm pushing it)."

So I didn't have high hopes, but I really enjoyed the movie. Maybe it was because during intermission I sat on my 3D glasses costing me 25 euro's + not seeing the last half in 3D.<br/><br/>Okay, the movie has it's weak points and it is by no means a classic.

Hats off to the casting crew.<br/><br/>Thats it.<br/><br/>Now the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Nothing like the original or book. Certain key characters have severely reduced parts, which you could call cameo appearances. They have taken out large chunks of plot line and character development in order to cut corners on cost. I could go on, but there's little point. Its a bad film and if I had paid to watch it, I would have been extremely annoyed. As it happens, I got in for free.<br/><br/>My final note is to Hollywood. Don't ask why people are watching your films illegally when your making crap like this. You should have left this and many of the other remakes you have done, well alone."

It wasn't quite like the original, or anything like the myth, really, but who cares? It's kind of like books-turned-movies. You can't compare them, or you won't enjoy the movie. The movie is separate from the myth and it's separate from the original. It was great. I didn't see it in 3D, because it hurts my eyes to watch movies like that, but I'm sure it was just as good.

"Likes_Ninjas90","4","1","2","2 May 2010"," Clash of the Titans displays visuals that do not justify the ridiculous prices of admission charged by cinemas
","In Ancient Greece the gods have grown restless as they have discovered that the mortals below them are tearing down their statues in a bid for independence. Hades (Ray Fiennes) pleads with Zeus (Liam Neeson) to allow him to be sent down to Earth to punish the mortals. Perseus (Sam Worthington) is a simple fisherman who is unable to save his father from drowning during the attack from Hades. The mortals fear the threat of a beast called the Kraken, set to be unleashed by Hades, unless a sacrifice can be made to it. It is soon revealed that Perseus is not just a fisherman, but the illegitimate son of Zeus, and thus he must rise up with a number of other soldiers to discover his true self and to find a way to defeat both Hades and the Kraken monster too.<br/><br/>The decision for director Louis Leterrier to remake the 1981 version of Clash of the Titans into a bigger, louder and more expensive spectacle stems from his love of the original. He has stated that he was a huge fan of the original in his childhood. His remake is showing in both 2D and 3D but it is impossible to recommend the film in either format because the adventure here takes so few chances and is so insignificant and dull that it is not even worth seeing for the visuals. The screenplay written by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi is very loosely strung together through a handful of action sequences, leading from giant scorpions, Medusa and then a showdown with the Kraken itself. For as big as monsters are, there is still a distinct lack of personality for almost all of the characters here. It would be unreasonable to expect personas of intellectual and emotion depth in a film like this, but as adventure films like Pirates of the Caribbean (2003) have shown, there is still enjoyment be found in developing characterisation and allowing the audience to be more involved with the story. Clash of the Titans wants to be taken seriously when there is very little reason to care about where the characters are going and whether they live or die or not. With a running time of less than two hours, the film is thankfully brief and the pacing is brisk. Yet those that are going to pay full price to see the film in 3D will either feel cheated by the quality of the picture or by how short it is.<br/><br/>Audience that are determined to see the film purely for the spectacle will be disappointed by the outright laziness of the 3D effects. Presumably rushed to coincide with Worthington's success with Avatar, the 3D technology here would barely be recognisable if it were not for the consistently blurry textures at the start of each scene, as there is very little depth added to the picture here. The most significant difference that the glasses make is that the frames make scenes darker and muddier than they should be. The issues with the visuals here highlight the greater problems facing 3D, specifically whether studios are going to abuse the trust of viewers by coaxing them into more expensive films, when the least amount of effort has been placed into the technology. The scale of the film's monsters is more pleasing, particularly the giant scorpions, but even they are contained in fairly uninvolving action sequences. Those that are expecting visceral combat and gore will be disappointed because the violence here is particularly tame, with people being thrown into the air, and only a select number of limbs being loped off, without much force. Without any attention to the characters it makes very little difference as to who is being killed and the final battle between the Kraken and Perseus is pitifully weak, ending very quickly and easily.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington gives a disappointingly lacklustre, one-note performance here and if he is not more selective and careful about the sort of films that he chooses to make in Hollywood his talents are going to be continually wasted. He shows very little charisma here and his character is left simply to be angry and snarl for much of the picture. The film has presumably been shortened and cut as well because his character Perseus transits from being a humble fisherman to a warrior in the space of about two scenes. There are a number of other high profile actors in the film like Liam Neeson and Ray Fiennes, who have smaller parts to play, but they are wasted and really should have known better with this pretty thankless material.<br/><br/>Clash of the Titans displays visuals that do not justify the ridiculous prices of admission charged by cinemas. They are simply not up to the high standards of a number of superior 3D films. The adventure itself is also not violent or gory enough to satisfy younger viewers who are excited by the prospect of giant monsters and the distinct lack of humour or self-awareness does not allow the film to transcend the tired familiarities of this particular genre. It might not be the most cringing or annoying film this year, but it will surely be one of the most forgettable."
"talkymeat","5","1","2","2 May 2010"," Action and Nothing Else
","Clash of the Titans centers around a half god, half human named Perseus(Sam Worthington). Zeus is mad that humans don't fear/respect him anymore and decides to let his brother Hades wreak havoc on the earth so humans will again bend to his will. The only thing stopping Hades from destroying the human race is a small force of Greeks led by Perseus. They must find a way to defeat The Kraken, a deadly creature that Zeus has threatened to release, and save the world as they know it.<br/><br/>Sound Good........Well, It Isn't.<br/><br/>NO cliché is left unturned as Perseus and his band of one dimensional friends must make their way through a trek that feels like so much well worn territory. I especially enjoyed the obligatory romance and the two ""cooky"" characters that lightened the mood with their ""hilarious"" one liners. Once again, Sam Worthington brings his cardboard ""hey, I'm an everyman who must magically become the greatest warrior ever in five minutes"" shtick. I'm not sure why he has been getting so much work but if you've seen him in any other movie you've seen him in Clash of the Titans. Aside from him pretty much every character follows suit, acting as if they are robots programmed to say their lines and nothing else. Liam Neeson, the only halfway legitimate actor in this movie is only in about two scenes and is wearing the most ridiculous Zeus costume I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Not to say that it's all the actor's fault. Their acting can't fix a script that seems to be nothing more than stage directions leading the actors to the next big action scene, which their are plenty of. Not to say that their good, in fact they are actually very bland and uninteresting. It's amazing to me with all the effects and money put into this movie that the filmmaker's couldn't even make breathtaking action scenes, especially when you consider how little time must have been spent on the other parts of the movie.<br/><br/>So, Clash of the Titans manages nothing but lots of action scenes and the action scenes aren't even that good."

","Greek mythology is awesome. Seriously-Zeus, Hercules, Icarus, The Hydra, etc-it's the definition of totally bad ass. When I was a kid, I was obsessed with this kind of thing, and I still hold a special place in my heart for it. So I guess that's why the original ""Clash of the Titans"" was so pretty much one of my favorite movies as a kid. sure, The Kraken wasn't originally in Greek Mythology, and it was more of a squid like entity, and looking back, it was a fun but hardly perfect movie, but that's okay. Unfortunately not okay is the new remake of said movie, which is a major letdown.<br/><br/>The skinny on the plot: The gods, particularly Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Hades (Ralph Fiennes) have noticed something-man is not too happy with them, and are turning on them as well. So, it's time to remind mankind the order of thing, which will involve the son of Hades-The Kraken in this case-laying waste to mankind. But there is a man who is destined to stop the monster-Perseus (Sam Worthington) who with the help of some soldiers, must embark on an epic quest.<br/><br/>There are a few things to enjoy about the new ""Clash of the Titans"", and it certainly didn't make me angry per say. The Kraken itself is awesome, and many of the visuals and designs are fun. It's also nice to see that like in those old stories, the gods are assholes. The trailer says ""Damn the Gods"", but watching it, I though ""To hell with that, Screw the Gods."" But for every thing it does get right, it still comes up short. The acting is mostly unremarkable, with Worthington being particularly bland (though Perseus was bland in the original), and Fiennes and Neeson seeming to be in a competition to see who can overact the most-Fiennes wins, but just barely. The direction and editing is also messy-the whole thing is edited in a way that it at times resembles the world's longest, most expensive metal music video, but sadly not in a good way. The battles and action scenes are occasionally fun, but mostly feel too much like they'd belong in every other dull Hollywood blockbuster movie.<br/><br/>Which leads to the film's biggest flaw-it's so hollow. Sure, there's big monsters and spectacle on the screen, but it lacks the heart and enthusiasm of the original. The original was a good example of a popcorn movie done right-nothing spectacular, but fun in it's own right. The new one though, is just another Hollywood movie without much that stands out, and not a whole lot that is memorable. It's mostly a whole lot of nothing.<br/><br/>In the end, there's not a whole lot to hate about the new ""Clash of the Titans"", but that's because there isn't a whole lot to feel about it either way. It's practically the definition of ""whatever."""

In my town, only the 3D was playing during the day, so my friend and I decided to cough up some extra money and see it in 3D...And we may as well have thrown the money out the window on our way to the theater. The 3D is craptastic at best, and makes it really hard to see the high-action scenes...Everything is blurry, and you can't see what's going on, especially whenever Hades' flying monsters attack. It was a pretty good movie with a completely different story line from the original, yet as a fan of the older one, I wasn't disappointed at all. Just stick with 2D."

","Once in a while a film comes along that should be avoided at all costs - a film that you know as soon as you pay your money at the box office is going to be a 'leave your brain at the door' type affair, yet you venture into the auditorium and watch it anyway. Such a film is this, full of portentous - and pretentious - lines about the hubris of mankind when they reject their Gods, lots of oh-so predictable daring do, lashing of CGI monsters etc, and yet I loved every single minute of it! Why? Maybe it was the mood I was in, just right for a bit of pure escapism with no great, deep hidden meaning (I had watched the wonderful 'A Prophet' on the Sunday, a film with so many layers my head is still trying to get itself around it!), or maybe it was simply that I got carried away with the daring-do of it all.<br/><br/>To say that this is a film that lacks any originality is like saying Manchester United is a well known football team! Everything you would expect from such a film is here - mainly stuff that will be familiar to any fan of the 1981 version. Persius saved from his watery grave, Zeus and Hades angry with mankind for rejecting them, the prophet begging the citizens of Argos to sacrifice their Princess, Andromina, lots of fighting with big - and I mean BIG! - scorpions, the death of Medusa, and the ultimate battle with the Karken all nicely ticked off. The effects are, as one has come to expect from a big Hollywood movie, are all very good (I saw the 2D version, so in 3D I would imagine them to be even better) - and shows just how far this kind of movie has come from the days of the great Harry Harryhausen etc.<br/><br/>If you should desire to watch this film do not expect much in the way of depth, or even great acting (all pretty wooden if truth be told), but do switch off your brain and just let it happen!"

","Having not seen the original, as I was only a few years old when it came out, I still knew the general idea of the movie but I was unable to follow the movie often. I know the critics complained about the CGI in the movie but my complaint about this movie is the action scenes. Everything and everybody is moving so fast that everything is a blur. I've walked out of seeing a bad movie but still enjoyed my time but not here. It seems crazy to have a movie where you can't follow the movie not because of the storyline but because of the speed. To show how hard it is: my favourite character in the movie is the djinn and he/she/it doesn't speak English!!! The acting is not great and in some instances is bad, you generally don't care about the characters and pretty much everyone dies except for the ones you expect. I walked out of the movie and my thoughts were on playing a computer game and being thankful that because of my wife's discount card it cost only 25(chinese dollars) where everyone else in there mostly had to fork out 130(chinese dollars). That's not a good sign for a movie."
"william-hartanto","4","1","2","19 April 2010"," Confusing from the start to finish
","It seems like 2010 is the year when Greek mythology suddenly becomes the trendy thing. I have seen Percy and the Olympians, and now I Have seen The Clash of the Titans. Both are loosely based on Greek mythology - and both of them leaves most of the audience confused.<br/><br/>The Clash of the Titans is a very expensive, and pretty movie. The CGI is impressive, and the actions are ceaseless from the start to the end.<br/><br/>I haven't watched the 1981 version; or read the Greek version of the myth. So I will not judge the movie based on how much or how little they deviate from the ""Classic"" It should be a simple and standard story - boy come from humble beginning (son of a fisherman); boy face a great challenge (defeating a kraken); boy goes to a journey with his trusted friends (from the city of Argos to the underworld and back); boy wins; boy gets the girl (Princess Andromeda).<br/><br/>But somehow it gets confused.<br/><br/>The main story of the movie is how the Gods are evil Tyrants and one human king after another are rising against their Tyranny and failed. But then the script does not (or could not) enforce this story.<br/><br/>The Greek Gods are neither all bad or all good. They, like human, have their flaws and strengths, kindness and cruelty. They like human, abuse their power from time to time, but also protect the human from time to time. The script can not turn these traditional Gods into the Sith Masters or Hanibal Lecters.<br/><br/>Then, Perseus is hardly a Jedi Knight either. Repeatedly throughout the movie he said how he ""will defeat the Gods as a man"", yet in the end cave in and use his dad's sword, gold coin and horse. This is predictable since the idea of ""fighting Gods as a man"" seems to be as effective as moths trying to extinguish a fire. Perseus is hardly strong enough to take a scorpion on his own, let alone the God of the Underworld.<br/><br/>The supporting characters seems to exist just to die against one monster or another - so the producer did not even bother creating real distinct characters between one soon to be dying soldier to the next.<br/><br/>This should be a simple story of a Hero's journey. In the end , I'm just confused as who the hero is. I'm guessing it's one of the two hunters with weird accent, they, at least, have memorable and consistent character.<br/><br/>Perhaps if the movie lasts 2 hours instead of 90 minutes, they can actually make the audience identify with the supposedly ""Hero"" of the movie? That's how James Cameron did Avatar. You don't just throw a jarhead in the middle of war from beginning to the end (it worked for Black Hawk Down, not this movie); especially with an unfamiliar setting like the ancient Greece.<br/><br/>The action itself is horrible. The CGI is great; but the fighting choreography really sucks. It is like watching starship troopers - throw enough human and hope the last one kills the monster. Strangely 90 minutes goes pretty quickly while you are watching - but you'll ended up confused and slightly bored.<br/><br/>I hope they do much much better with the sequel."

","I wanted to watch this movie, 'cause I usually like the actors and the genre. But here, I really got disappointed. First thing I noticed and shook my head - the haircut of Sam Worthington. Everyone else had long hair, but it looks like Perseus found a hairdresser back then, who cut his hair exactly a couple of inches. Great! Why didn't all the other persons go there?? He would have been the perfect actor for this role, if he had just a bit more courage and less vanity. Okay, here are some déjà vus now. The battle with the scorpions reminded me a lot of ""Starship Troopers"". When they all walked the whole way to the witches, it was ""Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring"". And where I had to laugh out loud was the scene where Sam Worthington flew Pegasus! This scene was absolutely ""Avatar"", fun fact - he rode the Banshee there!!! They could have made more out of it, but the final result was quite devastating. Well, at least for me."

","As a film, Clash of the Titans does not succeed. The story is unengaging, and the direction sloppy. Some of the action sequences are entertaining and boast some nice visuals, but ultimately it is not worthwhile. As a 3-D experience, it completely FAILS! I am not one of those people who just want 3-D to see things pop out at you. For me, when 3-D is done right it transports you into the actual film, where films like Up, Alice in Wonderland, How To Train your Dragon, and to a greater extent Avatar succeeded. BUT this is my first unnecessary 3-D experience. The only scene that is actually amazing in 3-D and transports you to another world is the opening scene with all of the mythology and the heavens. It looks utterly amazing! That is actually the best scene in the entire film, and what a shame the rest of the film failed to live up to that one scene. Overall, the film is sloppy and predictable, but for those seeking out some (not all) nice action scenes and visuals, go see it, but please, do NOT see it in 3-D because there really is no difference.

","If it were possible to remake a film that was more campy, more corny than the original, this movie accomplished that in spades.<br/><br/>Aside from great special effects (the film's only real attraction) and A-list stars, the final product is a loud, tiring film that one is glad to see come to an end.<br/><br/>As campy as the original was -- also with A-list talent and state-of-the-art special effects for its time -- at least it had a storyline that was not too rushed so as to get to more action and more special effects, characters you care about because they were somewhat developed and enough dialogue to keep even the mythological novice informed as to who the characters are, why they are important and what makes them heroic.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT (if you know nothing about the myth of Perseus) My biggest disappointment was the Medusa sequence, which in the life of Perseus is the climax of the myth. Perseus was born to kill Medusa and bring back her head. Here, it is just another fast-paced action sequence with no sense of climax or importance to the story other than he has to do it to get to the next awesome special-effects laden action scene. End possible SPOILERS<br/><br/>All in all, if you are a lover of Greek mythology, see the original, and try to forget that Pegasas was ridden by Bellerophon, not Perseus (he had the winged sandals). If you want a mindless action film that could just as well have been Jason Bourn in ancient Greece, see this movie."
"RickmanFan42","2","1","2","17 April 2010"," An Epic of Time Wasted
","I give it....a D- at tops. It was a horrible film! Firstly, the plot was mediocre, the acting was mediocre as well, the cuts were awful, the camera angles disgraceful, and there was no character development whatsoever. I can't even tell you the names of more then four characters.<br/><br/>The director was obviously too lazy to come up with any real fight sequences, so he used the cheap trick of fast cuts and shaking the camera. Either that, or the camera man started jacking off. Danny suspects they hired Michael J Fox to film for them. Maybe it's all of the above.<br/><br/>The scenes followed a plot, so I won't say there wasn't one, it was a very weak plot however, and so no one developed. By the time the end of the film came, I didn't give any care as to what would happen to the characters.<br/><br/>The designs were dull as well, the sets were unimpressive, the costumes lame, and the Gods' armor looked like cheap plastic Knights of the Zodiac costumes.<br/><br/>The film techniques beyond the action sequences were unoriginal as well. Using Lord of the Rings travel montage, training with sword montage, Cloverfield shaking, Pegasus cut to credits...it was all cheap imitations of other better films.<br/><br/>I also think the lead actor was desperately trying to be Russel Crowe from Gladiator...but I digress.<br/><br/>I could go through each and every scene, and point out significant plot wholes, and why random camera angles don't work. I'm glad I didn't go see it in 3d, probably would have vomited all over the place. All in all, I'll never get that 7.75 cents back.<br/><br/>Now to watch a GOOD Liam Neeson film, like Schindler's List."
"minky-mark","6","1","2","16 April 2010"," Strange and Phenomenal collide to make a so called ""different"" movie
","The words ""strange"" and ""phenomenal"" are widely different and yet somehow manage to come together in this movie. The whole concept of the movie is the strange part. I mean, really, gods and huge monsters battling people with swords? Come on, they could have tweeked some of it to make it maybe a little bit more interesting. <br/><br/>I was unsure of what to make of this movie when i watched it. I could tell that there was some sort of message being portrayed, but i couldn't really recall what. It has got the version of ""God"" and the version of the ""devil"", but yet again, it has ""gods"" that try to control the world also. It is a mixture of the Christian faith combined with the class ""god"" scenario. It didn't seem to come together well. Was the message to defeat the evil gods but somehow remain human? Was it to deny any god, live your life, and try to be a hero? Or was it perhaps that when your town is threatened by evil beings, that you should take down an enormous amount of devils? I will never be sure of this. <br/><br/>Clash of the Titans has some minor confusing parts that seem to add up and create more confusion than intended. *spoiler* - How does multiple scorpions the size of a house appear from a drop of blood from a demon? I assumed it was the hand of the demon, but more and more appeared. What about the fact that camels randomly appeared as the group of people marched across the world? How did they get there? And there is the lady that never dies. She seems to be placed very conveniently. Knowing where they all need to go, what to do, and basically knowing everything possible, while remaining invincible, she seemed to be the center focus of all of the characters. The overall concept of how to kill the kraken seems to be misplaced. I was confused when this path was layed out before them and was basically implied for everything they needed to do. It wasn't released to the audience, more like it was just there.<br/><br/>Let's move onto the very small phenomenal part of the movie. The fights. These fights in the movie possibly have redeemed the whole movie for me. Considering the fact that people were attacking strange and unreal creatures and somehow managed to win was the phenomenal part. The amount of action was about normal but it seemed to keep you focused. The special effects were also at the top of the list. They were quite good, especially with the kraken. The battles that erupted between the people and the creatures are what kept this movie together.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie only for people to see in the ""cheap"" theatres or to possibly rent it. All though it was action packed, and fairly exciting, the concept was a bit ""out there"" and somewhat confusing. As i give this movie a ""6"", i considered that all movies will have flaws however, most scenes will eventually over ride the flaws. This film did some of that. The strangeness part of it seemed to power higher than the phenomenal parts, but somehow they managed to combine to create a not so expected, ""different"" movie than expected."
"thesar-2","3","1","2","16 April 2010"," Release the Original!
","Regardless that it's been nearly 30 years since I saw the original, a fantasy that awed, inspired and excited me as a child, I had to see the updated Clash of the Titans. And this is despite the fact this is NOT my type of movie. (In fact, I have virtually no plans in seeing the forthcoming Prince of Persia film, though I played the original video game, again, as a child.) Fine, the original used clay. To a child that was close to cartoons, and that was okay – especially since it was on a grand scale with giant monsters. Kewl! Obviously with the update, they would switch to the (newly) time-honored CGI (or Copout Graphics for the Indolent.) I was hardly impressed with the special effects. Sure, they were well made, but original? No. Exciting? Eh. In fact, I felt for the most part of the movie, I just wanted it to be over, even though the script promised a climatic (RELEASE THE KRAKEN!) demon of sort. By the time the sea monster appeared (another unoriginal creation) I was anxious to take off.<br/><br/>Now, that doesn't make it a complete waste. It was worth a viewing (and I saw it in 2-D, I've heard to stay away from the 3-D for good reason.) But it was absolutely not worth a second viewing. Even on DVD.<br/><br/>Demigod Perseus (Worthington) must go on a journey, get dozens killed and defeat the Kraken while proving to Uncle Hades and his father, Zeus, he's a man. (Get used to that last part, he'll protest, though cheat multiple times, that he has to complete his journey and fight like a man a few dozen times.) Meanwhile, the most downright wimpiest and ridiculous gods (played so softly by two very talented actors, Neeson and Fiennes) are plotting/working together(?) to stop Perseus.<br/><br/>Though I am not 100% educated on the mythological gods, I thought they were supposed to somewhat or fully omnipotent. If so, they're doing a terrible job at stopping this half-mortal. This proves my lack of interest in this genre. Much like Lord of the Rings, if someone has great power, I want to see them use it! These ""gods"" actually seem content to just sit around and ""hope for the best."" Basically, it's a point A to point B adventure that rarely steps above anything, EVERYTHING that has come before it. Again, it's not horrible, but never reaches even ""average"" status. Recommended for die-hard fans only of the genre."
"jimihughes01","2","1","2","16 April 2010"," What were they thinking?
","This is so bad I'm angry about it, how they've managed to take a good story and ruin it is incredible. It's cheap rubbish going for a high profit margin based on popularity of the previous one. Special effects are reasonably good but without that the sheer lack of effort is appalling. The expectation is that this is a big budget movie but try counting the extras. They seem to only have been able to afford about 60 of them to run from one end of the shot to the other then change clothes and run back again. It also seems over edited where most plot was taken out to make way for monster battles (monster meaning large scary looking stuff, not huge) and yet the movie is 1&1/2 hours long. Imagine Legend of the seeker or xena warrior princess with better special effects. This is an awesome failure of a movie and could have been done so much better."
"G_yeah","5","1","2","14 April 2010"," Crash (and burn) of the Titans
","So I went to go watch CLASH OF THE TITANS last night, a little taken back by the terrible reviews this film was getting. As I sat down and the opening credits rolled, I thought to myself, ""It can't be THAT bad!"". But, I (unfortunately) have to agree with everyone that called this movie terrible, 'cause it is. Here's a few reasons...<br/><br/>I have to say, the main problem (for me) was the convert from 2D to 3D. It was completely unnecessary and headache-inducing. The characters looked out of proportion. None of the action/fight sequences manipulate 3D, or maybe that's just 'cause the people/creatures involved are just a CGI blur 95% of the time (woah, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen flashback right here...) <br/><br/>Next up- Character development. WHAT character development?... exactly. There was none, I didn't know anyones names or anything. To put it straight, I didn't CARE about any of the characters. There was only ONE character in the entire film that I cared about, and that was the leading Djinn (which didn't even speak a known language). And I was extremely disappointed that the only character that I DID feel an emotional connection to... blows up.<br/><br/>The script... or lack of, I guess. Sam Worthington has about 6 lines (aside from going ""ARRRRGHHHHHH!!!"" or preaching about ""doing this as a man"") in the entire script, and when he does have a solid line to deliver, it's undeniably cheesy and kills the serious tone that the film was trying to convey.<br/><br/>So I really do think it should be re-titled to CRASH of the Titans, 'cause that's what this film was... a crash and burn. It had a lot going for it but the end product just... sucked.<br/><br/>I give it a 5 out of 10. 1 star for the (remotely) interesting action sequences, and 4 stars for the awesome Djinn character that actually had me emotionally connected to the film... for a moment."
"zactac","6","1","2","14 April 2010"," Nice story and special effects, just doesn't have the character's developed enough.
","While ""Clash of the Titans"" has a good story with a nice setting and special effects the characters just don't give any reason to like them. The movie is around two hours long and even if it took another hour just to actually get to a point where its fun watching the characters (and like them) then my seven dollars would have actually been worth it.<br/><br/>""Clash of the Titans"" is the story about the son of the Greek god Zeus and his battle to try and make peace between the mortals and the gods. When the gods have become mistreating of the mortals they begin to rebel. It is the prayers of the mortals that give the gods strength so with no where else to go Zeus turns to his brother Hades for help. Zeus tells Hades to unleash the Krakken a powerful creature created by Hades himself onto the humans in ten days if a sacrifice is not made to please the gods. However Hades has his own plans, which involve taking over Olympus. So its up Zeus' son and others to try and stop them before its to late.<br/><br/>While the action sequences are enjoyable you can't feel the suspense of the fight because the characters just aren't that likable. I have seen some of these actors in other films and they are a lot better than they are in this movie. The roles could be good for them, but the way the script was written it was like the film-makers didn't want there to be any emotion at all. The characters are just plainly boring and not likable at all, end of story. Another thing is mostly action and not enough of the story (while it is nice the story can't truly be seen through all of the action).<br/><br/>If I could I would give one star for a good story and nice setting, two stars for beautiful special effects and great action, and two and a half stars for characters being boring and not likable."
"coolguy9690","4","1","2","13 April 2010"," Total disappointment!
","I just came back from seeing the movie at the theater. Just two word, ""total disaster!"". Firstly, I have high expectation toward this movie after watching the heartbreaking trailer, however, I was really disappointed. The plot, the storyline, and the scratching voice of Hades really messed it up. I still wondering, the reason the main character, Perseus has to make those scratching, annoying voice just like Cristian Bale in Batman Begins for which there are no reason at all. It doesn't make the audiences to realize that he is so manly, as we can see just by looking at his six-packs body. Despite of great CGI effects, it still couldn't help the movie to reach the level of thrilling and exciting that every viewers want.<br/><br/>Overall, i will give the movie 4 out of 10."
"Jerique","2","1","2","13 April 2010"," Worst movie of 2010? So far, yes.
","I was really looking forward to Clash of the Titans, however, perhaps my expectations were too high or perhaps it is due to my following reasons as to why this movie failed so miserably. I have no idea how I'd feel about this movie having seen the original, but if the original is anything similar, I'm guessing I wouldn't like it.<br/><br/>Let's start off with the cast. I loathe the casting director for this flick on the principles of miscasting nearly each and every character. Sam Worthington in Avatar and Terminator Salvation, both promising and career advancing roles, in Clash of the Titans, I didn't like him. As Perseus he brought nothing but Jake Sully (of Avatar) to the role and I just felt his character was tame. Liam Neeson, while an astonishing actor in most roles, fell flat on his face and I wasn't convinced he was Zeus. He just didn't mold into the character. Ralph Fiennes is well known as Voldermort, but as Hades he wasn't cunning, nefarious and he wasn't very intimidating.<br/><br/>As a story, this film is utter trash. It comes off as a rip-off of 300 and is more so a march, similar to Pirates: At World's End, than a battle of humans and the gods. I felt the movie was very slow paced and very much so dragged on and was just hoping it was closer to the end than it was. I didn't like the idea of having to walk to the battle. It gave me the prolonged Lord of the Rings walking feeling. It just didn't seem to have a purpose or goal.<br/><br/>There's a subplot, apparently, of a love story between Io and Perseus. I didn't see any chemistry nor romantic scenes until the very end when Io is killed. But apparently, I was blind because by that point he all of a sudden is in love with her and doesn't want to leave her side. I was originally intending to give the film a 6/10, but with the end of the film giving Io life (thanks to Zeus) I bumped it down to a 4/10. But it fell to 3/10 due to the fact I was looking forward to seeing Izabella Miko play Athena, but she wasn't even shown.<br/><br/>Forget about the fact that Poseidon is mentioned at the beginning of the film. He is unseen and the entire film becomes about Zeus, Hades and Perseus. It's a showcase of who's the best actor. Ultimately Worthington is given more screen time, but unfortunately neither of the leads were anything special. Hades and Perseus is built up throughout the movie and unfortunately, Hades is defeated in less than 3 seconds. Medusa takes the longest to defeat and bares an ability much like the basilisk in Chamber of Secrets.<br/><br/>Now, the clincher of the film's mediocrity is the amount of CGI. It's an overuse of CGI on nearly every scene with nearly every character. The over hype of the kraken and it's a simple battle and the creature itself is all CGI. The sword fighting choreography is the only decent part of the film but even that wasn't given much time and it's not frequent enough.<br/><br/>I'd say this movie should be forgotten in the next ten years because it is surely one of the worst of this decade. Thus far, it's the worst film of the year, but I'm sure being so early...there are a number of ""worst movies of the year"" potential still. I have a feeling Saw VII might get that label or perhaps Harry Potter or maybe Kick-Ass. We'll have to wait and see if Clash takes the cake. Happy viewing folks, skip Clash and see something worth your buck."
"cpbadgeman","6","1","2","12 April 2010"," Big Silly Fun
","When one considers the epic sweep of Greek mythology it is clear that it was the closest the ancients could come to the effects-laden blockbusters that delight audiences today. In this spirit, ""Clash of the Titans"" is exactly what it should be- a big, spectacular, effects-laden blockbuster with an undemanding plot and a good helping of eye candy. The story centers on a young man named Perseus, who steps up to save the city of Argos from the monstrous Kraken. In order to do this, he and a small band of soldiers have to face all sorts of perils so that he can get the only weapon that can defeat the aforementioned beast. His efforts are both helped and hindered by the gods themselves who cannot decide whether mankind should be taught love or fear.<br/><br/>This film is a whole lot of fun. The plot moves at a good pace and the running time passes quickly. The monsters are imaginatively designed and skilfully brought to life by CGI. Also, the numerous battle scenes are exciting and well-filmed. Another nice touch is the inclusion of elements from Norse and Arabian mythology. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are obviously enjoying themselves as Zeus and Hades- the lords of Olympus and the Underworld respectively. Sam Worthington is decent as Perseus but he is really a bit dour, a little bit of humor would have gone a long way. However, overall it is very clear that nobody is supposed to take this film too seriously. This is a very successful update of the 1981 original and provides it's audience with a highly enjoyable night out."
"FlashCallahan","5","1","2","12 April 2010"," Death should be afraid of us.....
","""The Clash of the Titans"" is set in the Greek city of Argos where a war is about to explode between man and the gods. Perseus raised as a fisherman, but is actually a demi-god. <br/><br/>Perseus is the son of Zeus who is about to take on the gods after the death of his family. Zeus' brother Hades was the one who killed his family, and Perseus wants to kill him. <br/><br/>However, it is Perseus's destiny to rescue the city of Argos from the ruthless rage of Hades and his Kraken monster. <br/><br/>With nothing to lose, Perseus leads a band of soldiers on a quest to defeat the Kraken. In doing this, Perseus will prevent Hades from overthrowing Zeus and in turn destroying mankind...<br/><br/>The original movie, had a camp classic feel to it, we had the gods, at regular intervals deciding the fate of the mortals vs ceramic figures. This time round, we have have Sam 'average movie' Star as the hero, who doesn't do much, but threaten certain people, and that the story.<br/><br/>Fair dues his surrogate family were killed by Hades, but the way that Leterrier handles the film is abysmal. The effects are undeniably good, but to have the 3D element is rather pointless, as none of the film appears 3D when you watch it in the theatres.<br/><br/>The fondly remembered parts of the film are wasted (Medusa is the one thing i was looking forward too) but they are handled hep handedly, you cannot but help yearn for the original.<br/><br/>Worthington is not a good lead, and the supporting cast prove this, and while there are some really good set pieces, they are not executed in the way you would think a multi million dollar remake would handle.<br/><br/>The best thing tin the film is Fiennes, he oozes evil from every pore and steals the film from everyone in it. Neeson is okay, but one feels that he just prepares himself to say 'release the Kraken' from the start.<br/><br/>It's not bad by any accounts, but they could have put so much more into this to make it one of the more worthwhile releases of the year."
"j-jameson","5","1","2","12 April 2010"," Pointless
","Clash of the titans is indeed an action packed adventure and it definitely has its moments. Too bad those moments were all about the visual looks and nothing else in this movie is surprising. I went to see the 3D version and to be honest I wasn't really impressed by it. Only 3D flick I've seen before this was Avatar and I think the 3D technique in Clash of the Titans was very poor compared to that one.<br/><br/>Acting was poor too. However, Ralph Fiennes is quite impressive as Hades, he did a nice job and his role had much potential (too bad the movie didn't use it). Liam Neeson was quite good too like always, but also had too weak/small role to demonstrate his skills. Characters of Zeus and Hades were definitely the strongest ones in this movie so the movie should have focused more on those two.<br/><br/>The plot was boring and way too predictable from the beginning till the end. The plot is so old it wouldn't get a ten year old surprised. Maybe thats the main reason why people will find this movie really boring."

Firstly the story line went so fast that I couldn't catch the pace in the movie, second the movie is much more smaller than the original one made in 1981. Thirdly the acting was horrible and the dialogues were not up to the mark. Either the movie has a fault in itself or the director just made it to his own way just to fill the box office rush. This movie can be much better if given a bigger length, means up to 2 and a half hours with complete description of characters and origins of Greek Gods. anyway, the graphics were cool and for that I have rated it 2 out of 10."
"Othy59","2","1","2","7 April 2010"," Knowing what to expect...
","... and I've never been so bored. Already seeing the Harryhausen original I had low expectation for this remake (I didn't favour the original as much as Jason and the Argonauts) as you can't really replace the effects maestro himself with just bland CGI. Yes I understand we live in a digital age but they can at least make the monsters seem like characters (like Harryhausen did) and not just a computerised shiny thing to wow idiots with. And the 3D. Thankfully I saw this film in 2D and not 3D as many people have said how god-awful the 3D is. 3D is just a pointless fad in general and seeing Clash of the Titans in 2D saves you a lot of money...<br/><br/>... but, in the end it's not the effects and 3D that makes a film, it's the story.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes it's not really different to the original and so brings nothing new to the table. The characters are one-dimensional, and anyone with any knowledge of films such as King Kong or the Sinbad films, knows that whoever follows our hero around in the film is but a lamb to the slaughter. But the supporting cast was pointless! They had no depth, Mads Mikkelsen's character just seemed more like an arse, than a gruff, tough teacher with nothing remotely wise or helpful to say (except for slapping Sam Worthington around). The two guys -- I think they were warrior merchants -- who follow Perseus added nothing, except their presence. And there was zero chemistry between Worthington and Arterton's character Io (and I won't even mention the crap her character keeps talking about).<br/><br/>Either way a lot of you will be saying I'm reading too much into a film such as this, well, maybe... but even for an action film, there's nothing there and it comes off as boring! When watching the action I felt bored, when watching the characters interact I felt bored, when magic and monsters were flying about the place I felt... well, you know where I'm going with this.<br/><br/>In the end, at least with the original, it wasn't the best sure, but it was entertaining none-the-less. The remake wasn't awful... it was just vacuous and boring!"
"The-Struman-Show","5","1","2","7 April 2010"," Its just a blockbuster
","This is the first film I've seen in a while that I would fully describe as okay. Usually I pick at a film and try and make more of a positive or negative overall view out of it but I really can't.<br/><br/>As hopefully you all know this is another Hollywood remake using the new powers of CGI and 3D technology. If you didn't look it up, I can't be bothered telling you more. The CGI is pretty decent, the giant scorpions looked good as did most other monsters even if the rest of the monsters did look a bit boring, particularly you Kraken. Sadly the 3D was actually the worst I've seen in a film only using it as a gimmick for the title sequence and credits to fly at you. I would feel cheated out of my money had my parents not bought me the ticket along with an excellent curry.<br/><br/>The cast is as you expect, Sam Worthington is Sam Worthington. A hero with little personality but a good heart who fights for good and smurf cats. Liam Neeson plays wise old man who says ""I planned this all along lolololol."" Ralph Fiennes who plays Voldamort in Harry Potter uses the exact same voice so feels like Voldamort, with a beard. Along with the rest of the cast all the female actresses are bland, but thankfully are something better to look at than the CGI. Also a special mention for young British actor Nicholas Hoult and his co-starring sister from Skins Kaya Scodelario (aka Effie).<br/><br/>The story is simple, Sam was happily with his parents in a boat. Voldamort with a beard kills his parents, Sam wants revenge. Sam and miscellaneous crew fight some monsters, fight some more monsters. Beat the big bad boss monster and then the story is left open for a sequel. I'll add spoilers here just in case someone is sensitive about me giving it all away.<br/><br/>Did you really expect much else from this film? Honestly? For all the reviews writing it was a terrible film are just pointing out the obvious and probably wouldn't have gone to see the film had they thought they could actually write something nice about it on here. Personally I'm using this time to distract myself from studying. I'm guessing you're doing the same because this review is exactly what you'd expect from the film in the first place."

"calm","7","1","2","6 April 2010"," Where was the love?
","I just returned from seeing Clash of the Titans. I really expected a great movie. So much effort was put into 3D and special effects but not enough into the direction of the characters. Everyone was so emotionally detached from each other. The only emotional connection was between Liam Neeson and Perseus near the end and the semi-quasi relationship between Gemma Arterton and Sam Worthington.<br/><br/>Additionally, the movie just didn't flow, scenes literally jumped from one to another. The marching soldiers seemed too mechanical. The Kraken was upstaged by the first beast they fought in the dessert (there was little difference). Perseus didn't seem to be a very good fighter, Poseidon was completely absent from the story and Pegasus was black (historically, incorrect).<br/><br/>I'm sought of sick of the whole 3D thing. It didn't do much for this movie and it's not exciting any more. It's never been as well done as Avatar. I've seen Avatar, Alice in Wonderland, How to train a Dragon and Clash of the Titans in Real D 3D. With the exception of Avatar, it's not worth the extra money. We shelled out $22 bucks for 2 seniors at the matinée showing for Titans and I really felt it was not worth it. I didn't hate the movie, I just felt emotionally disconnection from it. I and my husband kept looking at our watches -- we live at the movies but couldn't wait for Titans to end. I usually feel like I've been on an adventure after seeing a movie the likes of Titans but not this time. I gave it a 7 out of 10."

Other then that i think the story was terrible, they didn't make Andromeda as a big a part as they should have, hades was never trying to take over Olympus in the true story of Perseus and the gifts the gods gave Perseus weren't at all correct either.<br/><br/>This director focused on his fight scenes and special effects rather then telling a true story that would draw the audiences in. just a hint buddy, this isn't a marvel comic book story this is Greek mythology. make sure you can tell the difference before you make another movie or try to make a sequel.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing this movie just for the reason to go to the movies and contribute to the 100million dollars they spent to make it, if you catch my humor in that statement. if you are into Greek mythology like I am then don't waste your money, wait for it to come out on fx."

","Congratulations Hollywood. You've payed homage to yet another older film by sucking out all of the charm and entertainment value that made the film worth remaking in the first place.<br/><br/>The original ""Clash of the Titans"" from 1981 had a sense of whimsical adventure. Those involved knew just how seriously to take it all, which wasn't very seriously, and the effects served the story rather than seeming to exist for their own sake. The remake is a smörgåsbord of same-old same-old CGI that we've already seen a hundred times in other films, and the whole thing is too dogged and earnest to be much fun. The cast is lacklustre, even big deal actors like Liam Neesona and Ralph Fiennes, and can't inject the film with the campy sensibility that great actors like Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith and Burgess Meredith brought to the original. This version also removes the love story that brews between Perseus and Andromeda, which gave the first film a sense romantic and heroic adventure.<br/><br/>The first boring and unmemorable action film of 2010.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

The Characters in the film just lost their way and had nothing to do with it at times. The running time of the film felt so short that i just wanted more out of it. I did not know what was going on.<br/><br/>Now, i am being as honest as i can and i've never seen a movie that close to being good, it is that bad.

","The opening imagery of this movie, showing Greek gods in the constellations of the universe was very nice. After that, the movie failed miserably.

"benball_cv","6","1","2","4 April 2010"," It is what it says on the tin.
","Don't expect much more quality than an old ""B"" movie with a bigger budget. Dialogue poor, Steve McQueen would have had problems minimalising it. Storyline pretty basic without much intrigue or twist, but not surprising really considering it is a remake. The acting surprisingly below par considering the cast, and I don't think it does Sam Worthington any favours. Only surprise was the comedy input during the quest. Some very strange 3D effects, eg in close up the heads seem to have an incredible depth to them, quite unnatural! Much of the action so quick you can't see what's happening. Overall the visual effect of the film satisfactory and enhanced by the 3D, but not as good as Avatar. Interestingly one of the trailers for a new animation used 3D better! Would be good as a rainy Sunday afternoon film on the box!"
"dvc5159","4","1","2","2 April 2010"," Terrific special effects; rushed story and action; waste of money watching it in 3D.
","Don't watch it in 3D. Why? Well because there's nothing special about it. A few moments of pop-ups here and there but that's it. Not even the magnificent Kraken or the giant scorpions can save this. As a reminder, this film was shot in traditional 2D and was about to be released when all of a sudden a little movie called ""Avatar"" broke box-office records with its groundbreaking 3D effects. So in any studio head's mind, 3D = big bucks at the box office. So they decided to up-convert this movie into 3D for the masses. Big mistake.<br/><br/>Why? Because it underwhelms the movie. Anyone expecting something remotely similar to ""Avatar"" or the recent ""Alice In Wonderland"" or ""How To Train Your Dragon"" will simply be disappointed. These three films were made with 3D technology, ""Clash"" simply wasn't. Therefore all you get is just depth of perspective, or dimensions behind certain objects and characters. That's it. The 3D version is a great disappointment.<br/><br/>This review is mostly to warn people not to watch it in 3D. Now having said that I have to admit the movie itself was good, solid popcorn entertainment. Oscar guarantee may not be found here, save for the special effects, which are simply dazzling and terrific, and may just be the best thing about the movie that makes it worth seeing. The CGI is extremely well-rendered and well-amounted, delivering just the right amount without feeling extremely overused. Some notable scenes are the giant scorpion battle scenes and the final scene involving the Kraken. It (effects) is simply mesmerizing.<br/><br/>The acting, while not reaching the heights of say, Pacino or Day-Lewis, is still adequate in my books. The larger-than-life San Worthington portrays the larger-than-life Perseus, a role that seems to suit Worthington well. Our boy Sam will definitely be in the Hollywood spotlight, and while this one is not that great compared to his efforts in ""Avatar"" and ""Terminator Salvation"", it is still Worthington that makes the movie as he has the most screen time than any other actor in the movie. The other actors are OK, with the exception of Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, who chew the scenery when they're in it and they look like they're having a blast playing the two Gods.<br/><br/>In technical aspects, Louis Leterrier's kinetic direction ups the film above it's choppy editing and action scenes, rushed story and unimaginative story outline. Yes I am aware it is a remake of a film, and like most remakes, this one is not that good as the original; it just have special effects. The characterization in the original is gone here, leaving only mostly two-dimensional characters trying to save the day in a limited two-hour time constraint. The editing does not help either, rushing from one character's fight to another's in about half a second. The action, while solid, concludes all too soon. And the music score by Ramin Djawadi is a little bit too modern for this sword and sandal fantasy. On a positive note the cinematography is sweeping and the costume and production design and value are top- notch, pulling you into the past and getting immersed in the setting.<br/><br/>Despite some flaws, this new ""Clash of the Titans"" is not the great blockbuster many hope to be, mostly due to the great underwhelming 3D effects, but it is still grand, fine Hollywood entertainment at its finest. Watch it on the big screen in 2D, and enjoy this fine offering of CGI dessert after a year of Oscar nutrition.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 6.5/10 (Above average)"
"sean-ellis-1","4","2","7","2 April 2010"," Appalling script
","Nice look. Nice CGI. OK 3D. Good Start. Almost pointless script. Way too short to get any feeling into the characters. Bad accents for so many of the characters, they are Greek, the English accents jar so much. Ralph Fiennes croaky voice sounds so put on, which is disappointing for such a fine actor. Sam had nothing much to say. Mads fitted perfectly, but was the only one. I think the actors will think they have been mugged by the editing team. Percy Jackson was better but aimed at too young an audience for me but I still enjoyed it allot more. I watched the original C.O.T.T not so long ago and still find it entertaining. If they had kept the same script and scenes and just updated the visuals it would have been way better."

","(Synopsis) ""The Clash of the Titans"" is set in the Greek city of Argos where a war is about to explode between man and the gods. Persesus (Sam Worthington) raised as a fisherman, but is actually a demi-god, because he is the bastard son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) is about to take on the gods after the death of his family at the hands of Hades (Ralph Fiennes). It is Persesus' destiny to rescue the city of Argos from the ruthless rage of Hades and his Kraken monster. With nothing to lose, Persesus leads a band of soldiers on a quest to defeat the Kraken, which in turn prevents Hades from overthrowing his brother Zeus and destroying mankind.<br/><br/>(My Comment) This movie is the ultimate struggle for power that pits man against creatures (giant scorpions, snake-haired Medusa, and the Kraken), a king against gods, and gods against themselves, and the victor wins the earth. The film was not shot using 3D technology, but converted to the 3D format at the last minute to be trendy, and it really shows. The 3D creatures are not improved at all, and the background scenery only looks like it is in HD format. I did not see anything that came flying out from the screen as a real 3D movie would have, except for the credits. Now I did like the CGI special effects, especially, the scene with Medusa. There are some good fight scenes with Sam Worthington playing Persesus. The other actors were just so so. You can wait to see this movie, and better yet, see it in HD on TV.

"roguefire28","9","2","8","3 April 2010"," /NOT/ a nod to nostalgia . . . and okay with that.
","Although this remake has some marked differences from the original, I have the humble opinion that far too many are making their compare and contrast list a little too detailed. Technological advances in the film making industry since Desmond Davis' glory days allow for the monsters to be far more realistic in their appearance. Die hard fans of the original that kicked down doors in the F/X field might complain that it's too ""fancy"" and the original had more personality but I believe those people fail to see this remake for what it truly aims to be. This is not the movie to put on your rosy colored reminiscing glasses in order to see -- you need to go in without expectations based off the original. Though lacking in major character development and story telling drive if you set aside your expectations for a deep and moving plot Clash of the Titans because exactly what it set out to be -- a fun hack and slash with great visuals. It is unapologetic in its brash visualizations and unerring attempt to grab onto the skirt tails of hack and slash fantasy movies. I feel that the remake included some improvements from the original and paid homage to its predecessor with a polite nod and tip of the hat. It does not strive to outdo Davis' work but seeks to give us what a tale of a burgeoning hero with a sword and an uncertain destiny should. In short, put your nostalgia on the shelf if you have it, set aside your expectations for a duplicated salute to the original and go to see it as it was meant to be seen . . . an engaging action flick with more spunk than Bubo the Owl."
"sovietunion1","10","3","15","4 April 2010"," Quite Good, but blinded by the bad 3-D
","Reading many other reviews on this film i feel a sense of injustice has been done to it by Hollywood. True the plot is at times loosely held together through rushed story lines and warped mythology, and the 3-D effects are just terrible, i think all in all this was a satisfying film. HOWEVER, the flaws lie in the film's promotive points. The portrayal of the gods is wonderful and Liam Neeson as Zeus is just how i always imagined the God. Ralph Fiennes is arguably even better and an easily believable villain as Hades. But despite this cast their time is brief and shortlived on camera. Apart from this, there are no other Gods who should really be in this ""Great War"" between Zeus and Hades. The film has very exciting action scenes and the CGI effects are top of the range. The film doesn't have the ""epic"" that i always imagined it having from the trailer. The opening is rushed and there's no major cause for Sam Worthington (Perseus) to go off on a quest with some bearded strangers and kill some monsters, other than Hades accidentally killed his family. DO NOT PAY THE EXTRA £4 OR SOMETHING FOR THE 3-D EFFECTS. They are completely pointless and just another attempt of producers trying to make some quick cash. They're quite as shame really, because they distract the audience from the main plot line and generally suck. All in all it's a fun little romp, but really for me it's quite a shame, because looking from the trailers it had such potentional to be epic and exceptional. Oh well, i expect i'll probably enjoy it more on BLU-RAY when it comes out."
"rockinkettles-1","7","2","9","3 April 2010"," Clash is a Thrilling Adventure
","I didn't expect too much when I went to see the new Clash of the Titans. The original is a classic with it's stop motion effects by the legendary Ray Harryhausen. The new CGI effects are very good and often thrilling. The acting isn't all that bad as some reviewers have said. Even the original didn't have the best acting. The effects were the best part. One thing that was left out was the mechanical owl Bubo who was a sort of sidekick to Perseus, the son of the mythical God Zeus. Bubo is shown briefly but given the brush off this time around. He was a little silly in the original so I guess he didn't fit in with the new vision which is a bit darker. The story basically is that you don't mess around with the Gods or you will be sorry if you're human. In the case of Perseus, he is part God and man and soon finds himself joining on an adventure to save the humans from destruction. The scene with the scorpions is action packed and thrilling. My favorite scene was with Medusa the snake head woman who turns man into stone if they look at her. The new Medusa is awesome but the face of the original Medusa was scarier looking. The Kraken of the sea that is unleashed by the Gods upon the humans is rather incredible but it's wrath is no match upon the gaze of Medusa. All in all without comparing the two films too much against each other, I had a good time with this remake. It is after all a whole new vision of the story and an exciting one at that."

","As a child the 1981 film was a favorite. It is still in the rotation for when I am feeling blue. When I first saw this update I thought it was awful. The script adds a whole bunch of needless plot complications (Jinn? That's Islamic not Greek!) about the war between man and Gods. The dialog is a bad mixture of blunt machismo and crappy Shakespearean prose. The acting-Sam Worthington especially-is quite stiff and unconvincing. The 3d effects in the theater were very bad and made the film way too dark. Yet for all that I thought the film had its heart in the right place.<br/><br/>Having re-watched it a few days ago it struck me that really it is quite like the original. It is mostly interested in spectacle. The visual effects look so much better at home that I found them quite enjoyable this time around. It doesn't treat itself too seriously. The action set pieces in the remake all have an analog in the original and yet they are shuffled enough to be fresh. Bubo even gets a nice little cameo. It is pretty obvious the filmmakers love the original film.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the film for what it is. A fantasy actioner that is fun. Even Worthington was much more enjoyable on this viewing. Don't get me wrong he is still quite stiff but what sword and sandal hero isn't?"

Louis Leterrier directs an all-star cast from Avatar's Sam Worthington to Harry Potter's Ralph Fiennes to Liam Neeson, this movie proves its worth among the race of man.

Today I say: Not that bad. The acting was good, The CGI effects were superb and the adaptation was correct. What pulls back is that some of the parts seemed rushed, like ""hey guys, we are running out of money so...we need to finish it"".What makes a movie a ""Good Movie""? For me not only The Special effects but The Script, that in this case its already there, A good Director, which I think Its one of the loose points of the film, the Photography and the ambientation, which i think its pretty good, but it could have been better.

I still was a little disappointed after watching this film, and many of the negative comments about the film were right. Though, some of the action sequences were pretty nice and exciting. But there really wasn't much action. Aside from that, the story was lacking and not that great. Also somewhat a little confusing to follow. The story didn't really stay true to Greek Mythology, and it should have been much better. The film wasn't as bad as many people have been describing it, but it was still pretty bad and disappointing. Hopefully the sequel will be much better.

","I was desperately hoping that this version of the film would improve upon the original by remaining faithful to the myths it used as its source materials and focusing more on the inner struggle of Perseus, a quintessentially conflicted Greek hero who initially refuses the call to adventure but ultimately triumphs over adversity to benefit his community. But rarely have I seen such monumental talent—Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Sam Worthington—so monumentally squandered. The CGI special effects are definitely impressive, but the story is muddled (what the heck is a djinn doing in the middle of this movie?), the action sequences are almost impossible to follow, and the dialogue is weak. In fact, the most entertaining aspect of this film is its one sly reference to one of the silliest parts of the original version—that ridiculous mechanical owl. Unfortunately, if anyone should be brave enough—or stupid enough—to remake this film yet again at some point in the future, this flawed version will also provide many opportunities for mockery."

"Sjhm","3","1","3","27 July 2010"," A confused mess
","I have to admit that I saw the original in the cinema when it was first released. I had high hopes for this when I saw that they were going to make another film. <br/><br/>When the trailers were released however, I was disappointed. I decided to wait to rent a DVD. I am glad I did. For an adventure story it is curiously devoid of drama. There's no passion, no real soul to it. Perseus' motivation to save Andromeda seems non-existent. They barely spoke. No chemistry, no connection between them. Yet in mythology Perseus and Andromeda are husband and wife.<br/><br/>Bubo's miniscule cameo appearance was a shame, the mechanical owl was the charm and light relief of the original. And this film sadly needed some light relief.<br/><br/>I was also curious as to the addition of the Djinn, as other commentators have pointed out, they are not part of Graeco-Roman Mythology. Beyond providing the ridden scorpions (which did not make a great deal of sense, the scorpions grew from Calabos' spilled blood), they didn't seem to have any real purpose. It was unfortunate that the scorpion sequence also seemed to have been lifted directly from Michael Bey's original Transformers movie.<br/><br/>I was confused as to why Pegasus was black, that really didn't make a great deal of sense, virtually every depiction and description I have seen and read states that Pegasus was white.<br/><br/>I found it very difficult to connect with the human characters. Perseus was grumpy. The soldiers who accompany him on his quest were interchangeable, lacking in distinct character. <br/><br/>The gods were worse. Liam Neeson really had nothing to do other than pose in some rather crummy-looking armour and look miserably- uncomfortable doing it. Ralph Fiennes reprised his role of Voldemort with a very hammy turn as Hades.<br/><br/>On the upside, the Kraken (from Norse mythology but at least he was in the original film) was suitably scary, and the climatic scene was intense, but this does not make up for the po-faced trudge to get to that point."

","Well, I have seen both now and I must say. The original was better. It seemed that this one wanted to just get the movie over with as soon as possible. Everything happened so fast and (with the exception of the names and title) it certainly did not follow the first version AT ALL. If you have seen the first movie you would not want to see this one. It lacks style and a story line, it seemed that the director and or the writer just wanted to say I got the job as director and I am just wanting to get this over with. Great actors but the movie stunk. I gave it a 3 out of 10 because I liked the first so much more. I would call this movie not Clash of the Titans, but ""I have my own ideas and I just want to make a movie and collect the cash from idiots who pay $10 a ticket at the movie theaters's"". Do not even rent this one just borrow it from a friend who was stupid enough to rent or buy it. What crap. Hey Hollywood ""Really""!!!!!!!!!

","Clash of the Titans is not a great movie but it is a lot of fun and you can enjoy it if you just turn off your brain and watch. If you over think this movie you will notice plot holes and stiff acting and overuse of CGI but if you just watch and don't think for 1hr and 45 minutes you can enjoy it. The acting like I said is stiff from number of people but Liam Neeson and Mads Mikkelsen are in my opinion stand-out performers in the movie and hold it up, well the acting part but Sam Worthington doesn't do bad he is just average and so is Gemma Anderton. The use of CGI is very high and almost every scene has a CGI shot like many movies in this era and the CGI looks good for the most part. So just turn off your brain for this movie and just enjoy yourself."
"paul_haakonsen","5","1","3","8 July 2010"," Spectacular, but...
","I sort of had my hopes way up for this movie, especially because the trailers looked freaking awesome.<br/><br/>Well, I must admit that this movie was a feast for the eyes. There were so many cool effects, and so many really nice small details. They had seriously put lots of work into the small details. Just take Charon and his Stygian ferry, for instance, wow! Lots of cool details here, to a character and his boat that had only a very little part to play in the movie. And it was like that throughout the entire movie, lots of cool details in mundane settings. So pay attention to the backgrounds, the scenery and such, not just the main characters.<br/><br/>As for the story? Well, it was alright. Pretty straight forward and easy to follow, but it was lacking depth, and it seemed sort of too staged at times. But none the less, it proved interesting enough throughout the entire length.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie was nice, although I would say nothing award winning to be seen here. But people did well enough with the roles they had been given, even though most of the roles were very superficial and the actors/actresses had no chance to delve into the roles and have the characters grow.<br/><br/>The CGI effects in the movie were awesome and nice to look at.<br/><br/>What was most impressive to me was seeing the creatures of mythology come to life on the screen. Especially as I have been playing Dungeons & Dragons for like 23 years, give or take. So seeing these mythological beings on the screen and in this believable CGI blast, that was amazing.<br/><br/>The scene with the Kraken was very nice at the beginning, lots of suspense and having you wanting to get to see the being as it rose from the water. Then when the actual showdown took place, it was so very anti-climatic. That was horrible, and the movie went downhill from there. Of course, being a Hollywood movie, it have to have a sassy ending.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a good action movie, lots of nice fighting scenes and a good, constant flow to the movie. You are in for a feast of CGI effects, and will be thoroughly entertained. The movie had some flaws, but nothing that you can't live with. If you haven't seen this movie yet, and you like movies such as ""300"", ""Dragonheart"", and similar fantasy movies, you definitely have to give ""Clash of the Titans"" a chance.<br/><br/>I would have rated the movie higher, had it had a deeper meaning to it and a better put together story, but this wasn't to be. Would be unfair to give it a high rating just because of the nice CGI effects and the fact that I like mythology."
"daryavaush","9","1","3","25 April 2010"," Not bad for a remake
","Initially I was hesitant about seeing this remake, having seen the original when it first came out in 1981. As good as CGI effects are - and they don't get any better than in this movie - I still respect the old school Harryhausen stop-motion technique. ""Clash of the Titans"" is best suited for those who enjoy fantasy and Greek myth rolled into one. One element that stood out of place was the mechanical owl, who is Athena's patron in the original film. Also unlike the original, the majority of the Olympic deities do not have much interaction with Zeus save for Hades, well performed by Ralph Fiennes. Having a RADA actor in a modern fantasy film does make all the difference in the world. My only animadversion about the film is that Sam Worthington was made up to look like he was better suited for Marine fatigues and not a tunic. All in all, a great family movie to enjoy on a Sunday night."

","I liked this film a lot. even the quickly done 3d conversion was decent, though no Avatar, of course.<br/><br/>The film itself did not disappoint. Its much more fun than for instance Pirates of the Caribbean 3 (a.w.e.). It does not drag, the action is fast and furious, the cgi effects are very good indeed. I liked the kraken, nice and massive. the giant scorpions are great too. so is medusa. <br/><br/>a good thing about this film is, that it is NOT too long. <br/><br/>all in all, i give it an 8/10. <br/><br/>go see this film in the cinema in 3d!"
"thekilon","8","1","3","15 April 2010"," Clash of the Titan vs Clash of the Titans
","I wont bore you rewriting things that have been told by other 100 times. Here is what I add to the previous reviews.<br/><br/>Yes I am a Greek, in love with our mythology.<br/><br/>In short this movie is the total opposite of the original. The original movie , had mediocre actors, very good scenario, very good plot, not so good directing, very good fighting scenes and rather so and so special effects .<br/><br/>This movies has excellent and very good actors, a rather dull scenario, very predictable plot, excellent directing , not so good fighting scenes and some of the most amazing effects.<br/><br/>Yes I do believe that Hollywood tends to rape Greek myths. But then on the other hand a raped myth is better than no myth at all.<br/><br/>Why Hollywood believe that today Christian people love and deeply care about God , but in ancient times when thing were a lot tougher than they are now , ancient Greeks hated their gods ? I don't think Hollywood understand ancient Greek religion and mythology at all.<br/><br/>However the defense of the movie is that it had some big parts of the original myth.<br/><br/>I saw it on 3d, I agree, it could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>But overall I cannot say this movie was crap. The reason is simple, good acting by almost all actors involved that put in the shadow the original movie and AMAZING special effects. I also love the photography of the movie, it has a rather unique vibe, but overall because I also do 3d graphics as a hobby and paint digital, I loved it.<br/><br/>People are quick it dismiss a movie that is largely based on graphics to succeed , but then they may think that good graphics are easy and anyone can do it. But that is they are dead wrong. Good graphics require , talent, huge commitment and loads of money.<br/><br/>I wont remember this movie as a movie with a great scenario, but it really nailed the graphical content of myth to the bone and I hugely respect it for that and on that grounds I gave it a 8/10.<br/><br/>Lastly the one thing that hugely annoys me is the title. ""CLASH OF THE TITANS"" or probably ""WAR OF THE TITAN"" named in Greek ""TITANOMACHIA"" is huge Greek myth that put to shame Lord of the Rings, its the fight of the Greek Gods against the old order of Titans, which are far more powerful than a Cracken or a Medusa, which of course none of the two are Titans in any way.<br/><br/>I really hope one day a daring director and produces makes ""TITANOMACHIA"" a movie because it is going to be huge and expose people to the real beauty of ancient Greek mythology.<br/><br/>Overall, I can say I really enjoyed the movie, very good acting, excellent special effects and a very good soundtrack as well. I went to the movie hearing before that the movie was crap and I exit the theater asking myself ""What people expected to see from it more than it delivered ?"" , ""Have they not seen the trailer ?"". Sure it could have been better in several areas but overall THIS NOT CRAPISH AT ALL.<br/><br/>Its an action movie to the bone and it succeeds."

","I am a big fan of fantasy films and as a kid I loved watching the old films which Ray Harryhausen worked on. The effects he created were great for the time and had a charm about them but i think the CGI effects of today are better, things look more realistic.<br/><br/>The new Clash of the Titans incorporates some good visuals and has nice cinematography. I never felt bored watching the movie and found it entertaining and fun. It's not a deep movie and does not set out to be. Performances by the cast are fine.<br/><br/>Maybe i am easy to please or i just go to watch movies like Clash for a bit of escapist fun. I can watch these kind of movies without the need to pick them apart or be over critical and because of that i found Clash enjoyable. Not the greatest film ever made but certainly not bad."
"youngsheri","6","1","3","11 April 2010"," Sigh... not again
","Why oh why do film makers not believe in the power of original Greek Mythology? In 1981 - while the story had a good basis of Greek Myth they made it cheesy. Bubo the mechanical owl was the biggest one to knock out the suspended believe a movie is supposed to give to movie goers. Don't get me wrong I was in line to see it in the theaters when I was 10 and I loved it. I had been reading Greek Myths and loved the story of Perseus and Andromeda.<br/><br/>That's a spoiler right there - the story is SUPPOSED to be of Perseus and Andromeda. Not Perseus and Io - who is in another Greek Myth altogether (with Zeus in case you didn't know).<br/><br/>Yes, they took liberties in 1981 and they took even more in 2010. Personally, I'm awaiting the latest Romeo and Juliet flick where Romeo kills himself and Hamlet comes in and saves Juliet and whisks her off to Denmark to be his queen. This is about like that.<br/><br/>Some people will say, just watch the movie and enjoy it, sheesh, stop being a spoilsport. However, I had to listen to five guys bemoan and gnash their teeth when we saw the last Batman film with Bane in it where he was just some stupid peon to Poison Ivy. Even today (what 10 years later or something like that) if it's brought up they freak out! I say I have the right to be disgusted with these film makers for changing a classic story into something else.<br/><br/>Sigh... okay, off the soap box on that.<br/><br/>As for the film itself.<br/><br/>Pros - <br/><br/>This is a good action flick and even for my rant above I would watch it again, it was enjoyable.<br/><br/>The FX were awesome! Medusa, the Kraken, Pegasus, and the FX's for Hades were brilliant, the scorpions were well done too.<br/><br/>Good acting, enjoyed watching all of them. And the sets were well done.<br/><br/>The end was the grand flourish that was awesome! (btw, there's nothing after the credits, you can leave when they start to roll).<br/><br/>Cons - <br/><br/>Gods in full European armor? Why? They're gods, they don't need armor let alone a kind that isn't even going to be created for a thousand years or so.<br/><br/>Perseus' batman looking chest plate armor. Were they out of actual metal armor or did Sam lose the draw to get real looking armor? <br/><br/>The haircut... everyone but Perseus has long hair, even his fisherman dad. It was a little odd with his military do.<br/><br/>Adding in beings that have nothing to do with Greek Myth - Jinn. WTF? Hades is the villain - again. Hades is rarely the villain in Greek Myth - that would be Zeus job.<br/><br/>They kill off almost everyone. Queen Cassopeia for starters. They make Calibos (from the first movie, he's not a myth) Perseus' real grandfather. Danae is dead from the start, which was odd.<br/><br/>Overall, suspend your belief about this being a Greek Myth and pretend it's not. You'll do much better."

"zombie134","6","1","3","5 April 2010"," Nothing wrong with this film 6/10
","I'm a devout follower of the original movie and from reading these user reviews I almost didn't go to the theater, I'm glad I did though. I took my 5 year old son with me and we both loved it. All I can say is wow you reviewers are harsh. I thought this movie was fine. If your trying to compare it to a faithful re-telling of the original or are expecting Gladiator then think again. This is a Clash of the Titans for the next milennia. First you have to get one thing straight. The story has been completely re-written from the original. I mean totally re-written. But it works, at least for me. All the characters have different motivations and are brand new. For example, Perseus fights the Kraken but it is to seek revenge and save a city. Calibo's character is totally different too. Then some new characters are added, most notably a love interest for Perseus named Io.<br/><br/>This movie is entertaining period action. It's fast paced and full of effects. I think it delivers what the message that the directors intends. I was entertained until the very end. The acting was good, sets and costumes were excellent, dialogue was action movie grade, monsters were good, the action flowed nicely.<br/><br/>The Medusa was not as scary as I would have expected. The movie could have run a little longer too. This would have accommodated improved character development. But I tried not to be too harsh on this film. As I recall the some of my favorite sword and magic films were very cheesy. Movies like Beastmaster, Dragonslayer, Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger, The Sword and the Socerer, Conan the Barbarian to name a few. None of these movies were close to an Academy Award and neither was the original Clash of the Titans, it was entertaining and thats what this film was. I you don't expect a faithful epic remake then you won't be let down. If your expecting Lord of the Rings then wait for DVD."
"amarv","6","1","3","3 April 2010"," An opportunity wasted
","The first thought that came to mind after watching Clash of the Titans was What an opportunity wasted!<br/><br/>Now the movie isn't bad by any means & is an easy one time watch. But it could have been so much more.<br/><br/>The Greek mythology is as rich as the Hindu mythology. Titan is the term for god in Greek mythology. Although the Greek gods are nothing more than a myth now, it would be wise to know that once upon a time they were thought to be real & a great civilization has worshipped them for centuries. There are many wonderful stories in Greek mythology & the story of Perseus, son of Zeus (Zeus like our Indra is the head of gods) is one of them.<br/><br/>Based on the heroics of Perseus, Clash of the Titans was first made in 1981. With the current advances in visual effects, it's a nobrainer to remake it & so we have the current movie directed by Louis Leterrier starring Sam Worthington (Avatar fame) as Perseus, Liam Neeson as Zeus, Ralph Fiennes as Hades (god of underworld & brother of Zeus), beautiful Gemma Arterton as Io (kind of guardian angel to Perseus), Alexa Davalos as Andromeda (princess of Argos) among others.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a brief intro of current Titans & the rescue of baby Perseus floating in a coffin by a fisherman. How & why the son of a god was floating in the sea was narrated later in the movie. For now he grows as a simple man. When soldiers of the city Argos destroy a statue of Zeus thus declaring war on gods, Hades kills most of them & the family of Perseus who were just passing by. Remaining soldiers capture Perseus & take him to Argos. Hades appears at Argos & warns that if they don't sacrifice princess Andromeda in 10 days he will release Kraken (kind of huge monster with tentacles) on to the city. Although initially perceived as an enemy, Perseus was released by the king of Argos seeing his anger towards the gods & realising that they need him to defeat Kraken. Io who has been watching Perseus all his life advises Perseus to defeat Kraken. So Perseus & a small group of soldiers start their adventurous journey in which they face a lot of CGI enemies including the snake haired Medusa which finally ends with the defeat of Kraken & Hades being sent into the underworld.<br/><br/>By the way, I always thought that Pegasus was white. Is it really black or white? Any Greek scholars reading this, clarification would be much appreciated. And why is Worthington having a military haircut? It suits well for Avatar or Terminator. But it is awkward with the skirts that he wears in the movie.<br/><br/>Louis Leterrier's previous movie was The Incredible Hulk which I enjoyed immensely. Unfortunately he could not replicate the same here. At the end of it, Clash of the Titans is nothing more than a few action set pieces. If you only concentrate on the action sequences leaving aside proper story & character development, you can't have a die-hard or an incredible hulk. 300 was an exception but it was very stylish & it works once. Perhaps Clash of the Titans should have been made by a better suited director for fantasy genre.<br/><br/>This is the 3rd heavy budget action flick in the last 2 years for Worthington after Terminator & Avatar. He is alright as Perseus. Liam Neeson in that silver costume & beard was highly misfit in the role of Zeus. But I think he would superbly fit into the role of Lincoln which by all means Spielberg is going to direct in future. Ralph Fiennes is perfect as Hades & I guess his experience as Voldemort has helped him. I couldn't stop thinking about Deathly Hallows. I have a thing for British actresses & Gemma is very beautiful in the role of Io.<br/><br/>All the technical aspects including cinematography & visual effects are very good. The action pieces are good & you will get your money's worth if you see this in 2D.<br/><br/>I saw the movie in 2D although it is also released in 3D. There are 2 types of 3D movies. The 1st type are the ones which are actually shot using 3D technology. Avatar or Up or The Final Destination falls into this category. The 2nd type are the ones which are shot normally but are converted into 3D in post processing at the last minute by the greedy studios in order to increase the collections as 3D tickets cost more. Clash of the Titans falls into this category. So 3D viewing is unnecessary & you are not going to miss anything if you watch this in 2D. An extra benefit is that you will save money.<br/><br/>It feels a little painful when what could have been a potential classic was made into an average popcorn flick. If you like action movies see Clash of the Titans but I don't expect you to remember the movie after a while.<br/><br/>See more of my reviews at http://amarsmoviejournal.blogspot.com/"
"kosmasp","3","1","4","4 October 2010"," Why so serious?
","It was one of the main goals and one of the main distinctions to the Original from the 80s, that this movie tried to be more earnest and not as camp as the other Clash. Why they choose to ""update"" and make it 3-D, when it wasn't supposed to be (and never really looks any good in 3-D), that's another question.<br/><br/>If you didn't like the original, you might be in for a treat, because Sam Worthington does play it as straight as possible. But was it necessary to do that? I don't think so. The comic relief characters in this almost never works and the level of seriousness reaches a point where it get ridiculous (to me).<br/><br/>The CG looks good, the fight scenes are nice too and everyone tries their best. But it would have been a lot better if it knew what it is, instead of trying to be more dramatic than the story can handle. Inconstincies and plot holes, a short journey and some sudden mood changes are the final nails in the coffin."
"avi_abz","7","1","4","5 July 2010"," Why the brickbats ?? it's fun!!
","*******1/2 I just don't understand what people wanted to see in this movie. It doesn't claim to be an accurate mythological account...not at all! It's a fun upgrade of an earlier movie of the same name telling the tale of Perseus,the son of Zeus. It is chock a bloc filled with action involving demi-gods , monsters, mystical creatures,eternal beauties, jinns et al!! Awesome C.G.I.adds to the thrill ride! I myself do not like pretentious movies, and expected this to be one...but it isn't. Right from the beginning it rarely takes itself too seriously, so you know it's not trying to be another Troy or even a 300 for that matter!!!And for its entire running time it never dragged. Such mythological movies do not get made as often as in the 60's or 70's and it was really wonderful to see a quality cast and some great acting( of course the performances are a tad melodramatic, but that's how it was intended to be!!)! Sam Worthington is good as Perseus(though he always seems to be limited in his repertoire of expressions) Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes as Zeus and Hades are great as usual, Mads Mikkelsen is slowly becoming one of my favorites (watch him here as Draco and watch him in Valhalla Rising and then go see him in Adam's Aebler!) Gemma Arterton looks stunning... much better than her recent act in Prince of Persia, the rest of the cast also gives great support!! This is a good movie with wholesome clean entertainment for everyone and has enough thrills to give one one's moneys worth!! so do see it only on the big screen, but be sure to know what to expect.... a made for fun action adventure epic... and not an accurate mythological drama!"

","Though I have not seen the original Clash of the Titans (1981), I thought this movie was really good! In my opinion, I think that most original movies are usually always better than their remakes. But in this case, I haven't seen the original so I can't be the judge of that for this. But my dad has and he said it was good so I'm guessing it must be, if it comes from him. :) Some people rate this movie around 2 or 3 star because they are most always comparing it to the original movie. As said above, I don't think remakes are better than the originals. This is a great movie to watch if you have and open mind and aren't expecting much. When I say 'aren't expecting much', I mean that people shouldn't be expecting this remake to compare to the 1981 original version. Also, some reviews I've read compared Sam Worthington's acting to the movie Avatar. Avatar was an excellent movie and I agree that his acting wasn't as good in Clash of the Titans as it was in Avatar (I don't think anything can be compared to it). Some of the scenes, like the scene with the discussion about mechanical bird, was, in some ways, pointless. They could have left that part out of the movie. I liked the way they portrayed the Gods, like Zeus, in his gleaming armour etc. Overall, I think that is movie is excellent! This is the kind of movie that is good for people not expecting it to compare to the 1981 version. It had a good plot and some actors that I recognized. It's always good to have recognizable actors so the movie isn't too boring. For me, this movie wasn't boring and I found it great to watch. I watched it with my boyfriend and he said it was great movie too. Good amount of action, romance and suspense. In my book, it was GREAT!"

","Apparently i'm the minority here, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoyed this film. After poor reviews and my own assumption that this would be a typical Hollywood cookie cutter blockbuster, I hadn't planned on watching the movie at all. Boredom eventually led me to watch it. What hit me most were the plot changes that set up a darker and more emotional film than the original, which is more fitting in my opinion, given the daliance and intrigue of meddlesome gods and of course the defiance of the disobedient humans. The original was a lighthearted adventure set to a prancy soundtrack and Harry Hamlin was a bereft and bumbling hero whose only motivation seemed to be curiosity and wonder... boring! So therein lies the secret to enjoying this movie..

","Formulaic, cookie-cutter turd with unmotivated action, weak dialogue, awful writing, leaning wholly on CGI. The trailer was better than the whole movie. Why won't writers take a risk anymore? This is every action movie element squeezed into a new setting, relying on heavy CGI and Sam Worthington's name to get one good weekend of box office. The problem is, the sheeple support this kind of movie and perpetuate the Hollywood crap-fest. The news is out. Every movie ever made can now be remade (if not already) as a modern action flick complete with shallow philosophies, lame speeches and bad clichÃ©s. The dragon was the best part, but only came out for about three minutes at the very end. What's with that? I'm now just filling lines to get to 10. If you like this movie, you're feeding the Hollywood Kraken and more will be birthed."
"Dance96","5","1","4","4 April 2010"," OK, But Not Great
","Before I start this review, I must say that I hate action movies. Sorry, correction: I despise action movies. The fight scenes are always dragged out and takes up the majority of the movie. I wasn't initially pleased to be dragged to see this movie, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. The movie itself was shorter than the average Hollywood blockbuster, at roughly 107 minutes long. The action scenes weren't as long as I'd thought them to be and in fact were very short. I was happy with this but some hardcore action fans may find a problem with this. So why am I only giving this a 5/10? The reason for that is because the acting is very wooden here. Sam Worthington will hardly score an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Perseus and Liam Neeson's Zeus leaves much to be desired ( although his wife did die before filming this movie, so it must have been hard on him ). The script was also weak here too, with not a lot of characters getting much dialogue. By the way, before I finish up here, I noticed something interesting: I noticed that there was a hint of atheism during some of the scenes in Argos. I don't know was it intended but I thought it actually made the movie a bit more interesting. In conclusion: it's an OK movie to watch for passing time, but not if you want high quality acting."
"lennybird91","6","1","4","4 April 2010"," Action sequences linked together by mediocre dialogue.
","For these types of movies, where the trailer has more to do with showing off visual effects rather than hooking your interest on the story itself, I go into the theater with fairly low expectations. That mindset did not help me this time.<br/><br/>Some characters could act better than others, which made the movie seem... Unbalanced. Terrible character development and chemistry. Certain characters would seemingly die at random, impossible turn of events/action sequences - even within the context of a mythological movie with gods and titans were far too fake and extreme. <br/><br/>Towards the end, the producers decided that they needed to wrap up the movie's plot very quickly - and they did, but the speedy ending shows. At certain moments during the movie, it seems the editor would cut an entire dialogue section out and then stitch the beginning and end together. <br/><br/>If you want to be visually entertained and have little else to do, it may be worth seeing; this movie, however, is purely trailer driven."

The special effects and somewhat decent imagination of the crew which created the nice monsters is just about the only thing this movie got going for it - requires theater screen.<br/><br/>Hollow and shallow are also good words to describe it - no plot twists, no sophistication. It's as if the director borrowed piece of the journey through the mountains from Lord of The Rings, added few short battle scenes from Gladiator and stole the idea of how to defeat the main enemy from Percy Jackson - The Lightning Thief movie. Throughout the whole movie you get that Deja Vu feeling ""been there, seen that"". I gave it 6 out of 10 only because in 3D on big screen the special effects looked nice. Take those out - and it's a 4 at best."
"ssunzhong","6","1","4","3 April 2010"," Could have been so much better..
","This movie had great moments, no doubt about it. Its source material also had great potential. Its set pieces, visuals, and overall artistic direction were all fantastic. Most of the cast are also well-chosen actors with good ability. The problem here truly is the writing. Not that it's bad, it's just...well...lacking. Lacking in focus, lacking in rhythm, and lacking in character development. Perhaps the greatest flaw is in the fact that all the supporting characters are far more interesting and textured than the main character. <br/><br/>Truthfully, I don't know if it's Sam Worthington's acting, Leterrier's directing or just the material; but Perseus is just a flat, boring character for most of the movie. I mean yes, he makes decisions, he moves around and he fights but there's little to no emotional investment in this. I can't tell what he's feeling at any given moment, no matter how earth-shattering the events are around him. Consequently, I can sympathize or empathize with him as a human being. His characters opinions and decisions also very often seem out of the blue.<br/><br/>And then there's Andromeda, I mean jeez talk about wasted opportunity. This girl is hardly in the movie! Alexa Davalos can act, and the character had huge amounts of dramatic potential. A kingdom falling apart, parents who dared challenge the Gods, and the duty to end it all by sacrificing herself. There's great stuff here, but sadly either the writers or the director decided it wasn't important enough to show us.<br/><br/>Time management seemed to have been a really big issue here. Or just focus. They had two hours to set up the players, build up to climaxes, and tell us a story. In my opinion they spent far too much of it showing us inconsequential things. I don't want to spoil anything, but really the entire twenty-minute opening of the movie could've been shortened by half and/or merged into the next twenty minutes with nothing lost. Because the didn't do this, I had a feeling they were forced to wrap up the climax and conclusion in far too sloppy a manner.<br/><br/>Great action, good atmosphere, just wish they did the main character more justice. Hell of a supporting cast though."
"MatthewCobb7","5","1","4","3 April 2010"," Mediocre Film - Useless 3D
","Let's hope that Clash of the Titans is not an indication of the quality of this year's summer movie season. This film was such a disappointment. The pacing seemed to be totally opposite from what one would expect from a big budget action film. The plot moved at a snails pace at times, where as the action seemed to move lightning fast. Anyone seeking a fun action romp for the weekend should definitely look elsewhere. The plot is super predictable and there is no doubt about what will happen in any given situation. I'm trying to avoid spoilers so you will have to excuse me if i'm being vague.<br/><br/>It is unavoidable not to talk about the 3D in this movie. There has been massive controversy in Hollywood and online about post processing films into 3D. After Avatar the Money Machine swept the world it is not surprising that big studios would want to ride its coat tails to some quick bucks. Even after hearing all the negative things about post processing 3D i figured i ought to give it a shot and see for myself. It couldn't be that bad, right? WRONG. I feel cheated. Not because the movie was bad (though it was). i feel cheated because i paid an extra six dollars to watch three quarters of a movie with no 3D and a quarter of a movie with cardboard cutouts dancing around in the foreground. Something about the crap-D made all of the CG characters look extremely fake. Listen, Hollywood, i will not be seeing another 3D movie unless it was originally shot in 3D. Period.<br/><br/>The more i think about it the worse Clash of the Titans seems to me. The acting is horrible (and i like Sam Worthington). The plot is mundane. The directing and cinematography are boring. An overall failure. Do yourself a favor and save your money for Iron Man 2 next month."
"DarkVulcan29","5","1","4","2 April 2010"," Although the special effects where incredible , it just didn't measure up the original.
","Now I loved the original Clash of the Titans(1981), that starred Harry Hamlin, Burgess Meredith, Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith and Judi Bowker. I didn't think this timeless classic needed to be remade, but some producers did not share my way of thinking.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington who seems to be in a lot of films with effects like Terminator Salvation and Avatar, plays Perseus, unlike Harry Hamlin, never really sticks out as a character, he's so bland and never really makes an impression, And so goes with the other characters, like Andromeda(Alexa Davalos) who had a big part in the original, which was played Judi Bowker, but in this version, she was downsized. I loved some characters like Io(Gemma Arterton, who you may remember from Quantum of Solice(2008) is quite memorable in her role.<br/><br/>But I loved the effects, they where incredible.

"black-dragon112","5","1","4","2 April 2010"," Eh?
","I hated Sam Worthington. I thought he insisted on himself. I preferred, yes PREFERRED, the stiff acting of Harry Hamlin. I liked the unwilling hero who uses his gifts from the gods. I don't like the ""I'll do it like a man because the Gods say I can't"" Worthington character. Guess what, you couldn't so you used the gifts anyway. I loved the special effects, they are what made the movie watchable along with fantastic fight scenes. I especially liked the updated Medusa fight. The story was a little confusing in the beginning with flashbacks. Though it didn't hurt the film, I thought a video version of how Medusa got turned into a Gorgon would've been cool. But, I digress. The acting, other than Sam Worthington, was pretty good. A lot of the characters weren't given enough screen time to shine. A few that do are Liam Neeson as Zeus, Ralph Fiennes as Hades, and Jason Flemyng as Calibos. Andromeda isn't on screen enough to really develop an opinion. Io, who was absent in the original, was a great character. I felt her acting was sincere and I felt for her. The guy that was like the crazy religious one wasn't anything special. Actually, the one character that I thought stole the show (not really but she was a lot better than I ever thought she would be) was Polly Walker as Cassiopeia. I thought the look on her face when Hades tells her to ""kneel"" was amazing. She looked disgusted that she was doing it. She took the little tiny role she was given and really acted her butt off. The Gods, aside from the aforementioned Zeus and Hades don't really do anything, but they didn't in the original anyway. The one with the most screen time has the worst acting skill. Pegasus read his lines better (in case you can't guess, he doesn't have any). Sam Worthington said that Bubo (who has a cameo) had no place in the film. I think he needed him to guide him on how to act. In case you haven't guessed, I really wasn't impressed with his acting. The guys that are in the troupe with Perseus are good and add some comic relief. All in all, I'm kind of wish wash about the film. I liked the fighting and special effects, but the character that has the most lines and is on screen the most was the worst actor."

","I personally didn't think this movie was as bad as everyone is saying it is. But I'm also a sucker for cool visual effects, of which there were plenty in this movie, so I was happy. The pegasus looked awesome, and left me wondering where they managed to find pretty horses who'd grown wings to act in this movie :) Other highlights included the kraken scene, and many other cool-looking mythical beings... plenty of great action and great-looking effects. Unfortunately, this movie really does have no other substance to it. It would've been great to see maybe a little more story, maybe some more romance... something. So ""Titans"" definitely fell short in that department. Also, the 3D is not as terrible as I've heard some people say. While it's true that it was converted last minute, to me, it looked just like your average 3D movie, and I'd put it in the same category as ""Up"" or ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" in 3D: I was not a huge fan of either of those in 3D and I don't think it added anything to the movie since it didn't look all that great. So even though the 3D wasn't ""horrible"", I still wouldn't really recommend it unless you're really into the whole 3D thing.<br/><br/>Overall, a decent cool-looking action movie with no plot substance. If that's your thing, go for it. 8/10"

It does keep you interested when the group goes on their journey. Action is great and the Kraken at the end was VERY unpredictable.

The only bright side was when there actually was an action seen they weren't bad at all, but not great either.

"Cody2310","5","1","5","3 April 2010"," Needed a lot more of everything
","I went to see this movie opening night and I was... disappointed to say the least. Quite frankly, I was expecting a rich story with engaging, dynamic characters, with realistic and yet thrilling action sequences. All I got was: simplistic, archetypal story; flat and plain boring characters; over exaggerated action scenes and poor acting.<br/><br/>Let me first say: I wish just once, that Hollywood would abandon the principle of telling inaccurate stories for the sake of theatrical amusement. This ALWAYS happens with films that involve history and mythology. I realize it's fiction, but I would have liked this film more, had they told the actual myth of Perseus, and not this hyped up, false version. Being a student of Greek mythology, I found the inaccuracies in this film to really bug me. But that aside, the story is totally unoriginal. Just another man of noble birth learning about his heritage and potential and completing some great quest to fulfill his destiny, stop the bad guy, save the world, get the girl. It's Star Wars in ancient times. DO NOT go into this movie expecting the greatest story and writing ever made because you'll simply walk out in the first 30 seconds.<br/><br/>The characters were SO boring and stereotypical. All of them were: overly aggressive, warmongering, manly men. EVERY one of them. Not one different, mildly interesting character. They all had long hair, lots of scars and BAD costumes. The acting all around was average/bad, even by great actors like Liam Nieson and Ralph Fiennes. I was SO disappointed with them. Sam Worthington I expected to be average, which he was.<br/><br/>Not enough action and the action the film did have, was totally overdone. I can't even describe how disappointed I was with the action in this movie. The Kraken only appears on screen for about 2 minutes so don't expect a fantastic, climactic final battle like in LOTR: Return of the King.<br/><br/>On the good side, it is an alright movie. It does entertain you if you don't care about story and acting etc. Good flick to see with your friends but I wouldn't recommend it, by any means, to fans of great cinema. You'll want your money back.<br/><br/>Final score: 5/10"

"Jackpollins","4","1","5","2 April 2010"," For better or for worse
","Clash Of The Titans is the remake of the 1981 film with the same name that starred Laurence Olivier. In the remake, the story changes in certain aspects, and stays the same in others. The differences & similarities are for better or for worse. Some differences are good, such as the less hideous version of Medusa. Some differences are bad, such as the choice to make almost everything CGI. The similarities are mostly all for better, it's more the differences that make me need to add on the for worse part. The film's very loud, which did not help me enjoy the film. This is a mostly very bland and dull remake. If you want to see a good Hollywood remake, skip this and watch The Wolfman remake. The film's actors such as Liam Neeson and Sam Worthington are alright, but could be better considering what talented people they are. I would not advise you to see this film, but if you have to, see it at a cheap morning show on the big screen. Even then, though, this film is not worth your time or money. This film had so much potential, and I was excited to tell everyone how good this film is, but unfortunately, I have to tell my honest opinion, and my honest opinion is this movie was 85% bad, 5% good, 10% passable. Overall, the film's hard to get into and it's not worth the time or money you will have to invest to see this film."
"lastzezima","10","1","6","2 January 2011"," A shame to Mythology
","When I first heard of the movie I thought it would be really interesting. I was excited to see it, but when I finally watched it, the only thing the only good thing I found about it was the effects.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't represent Greek mythology at all. First of all what's with the scorpions? There is no giant scorpions in Greek mythology. It's just Hollywood trying to make it interesting, but to me it just looked plain ridiculous. In the movie the people had completely changed the story to the original plot line. Why is the movie is going on about the gods getting revenge? Instead of showing just basing the movie on hate, why don't you bring some other emotions? Not to say they don't, they are weak and it makes me sad.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie are weak and weird as well. When I heard Sam Worthington was in it I thought, Oh Avatar right? This must be good, but when I saw it. It was almost like he was just a big tough meat head. His costar Gemma Arterton played the role of Io. Like who is that? Now there adding random unnecessary characters? What's the point? The gods in the movie focused on Zeus and Hades. I was disappointed they only other god that got to have *one* line was Ares (I think it was him). I wanted to see a variety of gods and goddess's.<br/><br/>Well, the last thing I got to say is that the effects were amazing and saved the movie from being completely terrible. This is my opinion of the movie and honestly I suppose it isn't that bad, but it could be a billion times better."
"jt_robertson","8","1","6","9 April 2010"," Good story but it could have been titled something else. (Spoiler alert!)
","Well I went to go see Clash of the titans and it was very good. Unlike Avatar, which a lot of movies are compared to now, it's story was in front and the center of the movie, and the highlight of the film and the effects were the backbone. <br/><br/>But it had it's flaws and only a couple but those are the ones that I'm going to address. 1. Perseus: Perseus is not supposed to be orphaned boy found in a casket that was guided by some guardian angel, he was supposed to be raised by his mom after Argos was destroyed after the king ordered the death of both of them. In this movie it is not Joppa that is going to be destroyed it is Argos that is going to be destroyed and Joppa was destroyed by the Kraken. It really blows my mind in thinking that. 2. Love interest: This movie completely changed this. In the original Clash, Princess Andromeda was the love interest but in this clash the Guardian angel is the love interest and it totally my mind completely away from the original Clash to this Clash which remakes sometimes do but this didn't do as well in my opinion. But there are many things that this Clash gave that the original didn't. 1. Main Villain: The original clash didn't really have a main Villain but this happens to have one and it is Hades, God of the underworld. This was very well done and it is probably my favorite part of this whole Movie. 2. Stuck with Andromeda/Kraken deal: This is also very well done, at least they didn't make Andromeda some complete snobby princess that deserved to be eaten by the Kraken, no they made her sympathetic and you didn't want her to be eaten by the Kraken. And the Kraken was still there although you didn't know what it looked like and it stuck with the original and re-imagined it from Greek mythology. 3. Overall story.... great! It may have it's flaws but this movie in it's own right rivals the original, but in my personal opinion the original will always be the best adventure/fantasy film of all time(yes better than Jason and the Argonauts). 4th and final reason: Special effects didn't overshadow the story: The special effects did not overshadow the the story unlike in James Cameron's Avatar which is a prime example of this crime. James Cameron is one of my favorite directors of all time but in Avatar the special effects overshadowed the story but in this case in my opinion this Clash's story overshadowed the special effects. The story was not as complex as the original's but in it's own right like i've said in this review it rivals the original in that department. But thank you all for reading this review and i hope you all have a great day!"

","In comparison to the original from the 1980s (as dated as it is with stop-motions effects), this remake's special effects are a titanic improvement. Another improvement is Sam Worthington's Gladiator-esquire hero rather than Harry Hamlin's campy Perseus.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, can Worthington act? No proof of it here.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson appears to be not even trying.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes forgot he was in Clash of the Titans and not another Harry Potter movie, so similar was his Hades to Voldemort.<br/><br/>Mads Mikkelson was the only non-CGI actor who actually did any work. Although, the gorgeous Gemma Arterton kept me watching the screen.<br/><br/>A bunch of Djinn and a couple of weird hunters are thoroughly pointless and redundant characters, obviously thrown in to try to jazz up an old concept.<br/><br/>A nice gag referencing the original movie when Perseus is told to 'leave it' when he asks about a clockwork owl kept in a chest in the armoury.<br/><br/>In short, wait until it's on video-on-demand or in the DVD cheap bin."
"galensaysyes","7","1","8","29 September 2010"," 'way cooler than the original
","I'm glad somebody finally made a cool movie of this. It delivers what the posters for the original promised but audiences didn't get: magic, heroism, and thrills. It's absorbing and exciting--The Scorpion King done like Lord of the Rings--with the most awesome flying horse ever, giant scorpions to make you check under your bed, a Medusa that's both gorgeous and creepy, and classy English actors giving heaps of panache to stirring swashbuckler and Biblical-movie lines. The 11-year-old boy in me, who had wriggled with boredom through the clunky first movie, was glued to the screen for this one (the TV screen, I mean: he and I watched it on DVD), and as far as he was concerned it blew its predecessor out of the water.<br/><br/>But even he got that although it actually is cool it's also trying hard to be cool, which makes it not as cool as if it weren't, and that almost as many things in it don't work as do; notably the Olympian gods, with their extremely peculiar costuming. And he didn't get why it had to be such a mishmash. The director of it did the Transporter movies, which were no deathless classics but were professionally put together; this one looks in places as if it had been run through a food processor. Voiceovers set up the back story at unnecessary and confusing length, yet some of the simplest incidents are never explained. Like, suddenly the whole court of Argos knows that Perseus is Zeus's son, when he doesn't know it himself: why doesn't he, and why do they? The script of the original took considerable liberties with the myth; this one is a free-form improvisation on those liberties, without credit to their author. So whereas movie #1, for once following the myth, ends with Perseus and Andromeda getting together--which is kind of the point of the story--in the remake he goes off with someone else, brought in from another myth. Anything can happen at any time, and often does. (One of the unexpected events is that somewhere during his quest Perseus picks up an Australian accent.) <br/><br/>However, the bottom line is, it works. It's like a party that got out of control: it's a huge mess, and something somebody probably should have put a stop to, but that doesn't make it any less fun."

","I grew up on the old early 80's version of ""Clash of the Titans"" & that was a great film with a terrifying Medusa that is an iconic creature design so i wasn't sure about giving this a watch for a long time but I'm so glad i decided to watch it as a double bill of Monster movies with ""Kong: Skull Island"" & really enjoyed both films!!!
This version of the Classic tale & remake of the old school Classic is excellent, i TOTALLY enjoyed the look & effort put into the amazing production design & incredible creatures put on screen.
Now Medusa didn't look as scary as the old version but obviously with todays special fx she moved & looked real enough to still be very sinister, i prefer Sam Worthington in the main lead role as he's a tougher looking hero as Perseus, he was much more Manly & harder in this more grittier & darker version BUT although Sam Worthington looked the part he didn't have much else about him, he's obviously a good looking guy so he probably got picked for a ""Handsome lead"" but anyone really could've played the part & much better as its not a big ""Acting"" role but yeah ""Worthington"" is a bland lead actor really but he was ok for a moody scowling angry looking Australian guy lol & he seemed tough.
I would've preferred the excellent Barry Pepper in the lead role or even Tom Hardy.
The different creatures are Awesome & look Amazing thanks to a nice big budget & the ancient Greek Mythological world is created fully & looks Fantastic.
The always excellent Liam Neeson is good here too as the god ""Zues"" & Ralph Fiennes is very sinister as the evil god ""Hades"" so there's a great solid cast of excellent actors here along with some beautiful ladies like Gemma Arterton & Alexa Devalos & Polly Walker & more stunning faces along with the tough manly warriors.<br/><br/>The huge Scorpions look Amazing & it's an Awesome battle scene & the Medusa scene is exciting & creepy & there's plenty more great monster scenes & battles in this huge Exciting Fantasy fun big creature feature adventure.

","This movie does a great job. It does not try to be too much at any one time. Sam Worthington does a fantastic job, even though not much from the role is expected from him. He makes a convincing hero. If you are a fan of all things Western Civilization, then this will give you enough red meat to be satisfied. The SFX are likewise not overdone, but also not too sloppy. Perseus is the half-son of Zeus, raised by common fishermen, and the family gets killed early on.
Perseus must stop the destruction of man at the hands of the rebellious Pantheon. In case you were wondering, at the end, he confronts Medusa by using the Shield of Aegis, and seeing the reflection on the shield, closes his eyes, does a backwards spin, and beheads Medusa. He then, with eyes closed, places the head in a bag, goes to Rhodes, and then, eyes closed again, pulls the head out of the bag and shows the giant, turning the him into stone.

There is only so much fair set design, costume, and practical prosthetics can do to hide an otherwise shallow film. Especially when it's normally A list cast seem board and listless throughout. If there is one saving grace to the cast it is Gemma Arteron, in that she alone seemed to relish her role as Io, the human cursed with immortal life for refusing the advances of Zeus.<br/><br/>This picture has swords, it has sandals, it has revenge arcs that kind of make sense, and mythical creatures that add up if you don't ask too many questions. What it doesn't have is the grand sense of adventure that classics so normally thrive on. Large blocks of dialogue and crude plot advancement hang between set-piece action segments that frankly are un-inspired. Often we are pulled out of blade flashing fury, that is the film's meat, in an attempt to reaffirm the motivations and morals of characters, that frankly, we couldn't really care about. Too many of the the journeying ensemble just seem from the start to be plot-fodder, and every twist and turn seemed to be blatantly telegraphed.<br/><br/>If anything, of all the films on this site, this title probably least requires of a review. The characters are insipid, the story mundane, and the performances lacklustre. Its only surprise (other than its box office takings) is that it wasn't directed by Uwe Boll. But when all said and done; if you're home of a rainy Sunday, and this movie is on, it will while away the two hours between dinner and a sneaky pint. And whiling away time is exactly what this film was designed to do. So good in fact is this movie at whiling away time that it might just convince you to head to the pub early.

The CGI is simply no match for the delicate, stop motion animation of Ray Harryhausen either. There is still plenty of action and the film keeps an even tempo (though this is set as much by the music as it is by the acting) as they all search for a way to defeat the evil Kraken and save Argos. This makes for a good enough, if forgettable, afternoon adventure film. Nothing more, though, sadly. Keep an eye out for Luke Treadaway hamming it up superbly as the soothsayer."

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","6","0","4","24 February 2019"," Entertaining but only light fluff
","Remakes in general have a pretty big hill to overcome. Whether producers, actors and studios alike think they're doing the fans a service, it is still very likely approval will be low. A remake of an original work can't have tributes alone to satisfy viewers. But this is also the problem, a remake has to do something different from the original but also not completely alter everything, or it will alienate its base. The only way a remake can truly have success is if the original was either not that good to begin with or it manages to step up its game. Most of the time, these kinds of opportunities are far and few between. For this remake, competing with the original Clash of the Titans (1981) was already a tough call. With so many aspects of the original enjoyed by many, this film had to meet some high expectations. And while it wasn't as well received, it did manage to still produce some popcorn fluff. Just not in all the right places.<br/><br/>With Travis Beacham (who would later work on Pacific Rim (2013)), Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (Æon Flux (2005)) as writers to this film, it is apparent that they tried to make it similar to the original. When a man named Perseus (Sam Worthington) witnesses his family's death to a god, he sets it his mission to fight back. This motivation is only reinforced when the city of Argos, a rebellious city is threatened by Zeus (Liam Neeson) to be destroyed. With Hades (Ralph Fiennes) being granted permission to let the kraken loose on the city thanks to the queen (Polly Walker), Perseus and Argos' strongest men seek the answer on defeating it. Directed by Louis Leterrier, a guy with many action films tied to his name like Transporter (2002) and Transporter 2 (2005), certainly has what is needed for a film that needs lively energy. The biggest issue though is the script and Sam Worthington as the lead.<br/><br/>While Worthington can grimace, yell and move athletically, his emotional range needs some work. Being that the script relies more on the loss of his family and less about romance, there lacks an emotional balance in the story. There's barely a time where Perseus even cracks a smile or wise remark. As a result, the lead feels less charismatic and more just a pawn in the story. With the writers' screenplay failing to incorporate more of this, it feels as though they forgot the heart of the story. Yet somehow they did remember to include charming and more favorable dialog for the supporting actors like Mads Mikkelsen, Liam Cunningham, Hans Matheson, Ashraf Barhom, Mouloud Achour and Nicholas Hoult who play Argos' top warriors. So, not sure how that works. Even Ian Whyte who plays some mysterious humanoid scorpion creature is more interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Aside from this, the writers do include some other references to the original like Jason Flemyng who plays the cursed Calibos. Even Bubo the mechanical Owl appears for a cameo. Action sequences are by far the strongest this film has to offer. Whether the fighters are fending off other human attackers, human sized creatures or giant monstrosities, the action is lively and engaging. The best set piece is when Perseus and company come across super-sized scorpions. Even the battle between Perseus and Medusa (Natalia Vodianova) is fairly entertaining even though it won't ever top the original. The weakest was probably the one between Perseus and Calibos. All this is most likely due to Louis Leterrier's experience working with action set pieces. Believe it or not though the graphic content is turned down. Although that's probably just to attract a wider audience.<br/><br/>Visuals to the film are an unfortunate mixed bag. While the imagery, makeup effects and creature designs are creative, their CGI counterparts tend to suffer. Although watching movies can be used as an escapist activity, to watch actors walking around and interacting with various settings that are CGI ruins the whole experience. There's barely a place that feels like it is physically tangible. The cinematography by Peter Menzies Jr. (The 13th Warrior (1999) and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)) was adequate, it was just the CGI scenes that felt the least credible. Producing the music was composer Ramin Djawadi, who had worked on Blade: Trinity (2004) and Iron Man (2008). Relying heavily on strings and electric guitar, Djawadi makes an interesting interpreter for the film. Sadly, it has very little resemblance to that of the upbeat and adventurous sounding score from the original.<br/><br/>The supporting components to this remake are probably the best thing it has to give. From the supporting cast, to the music, cinematography and action. Yet the fault in the foundation are the CGI effects, a less than charismatic lead and rather unemotional screenplay revolving around the lead. It's fun but not for frequent revisiting."

Sadly, there is little else for this film to fall back on. Some gorgeous thespians, perhaps. That's it. Potential subplots are left in the dust as the film charges from poorly-judged fight scene to poorly-judged fight-scene, generally justified only by an 'us versus them trope' or by monumentally clunky exposition. It doesn't even give a new perspective on the old story.<br/><br/>Its only saving grace is that it's only a little over 3 hours long. Or at least, that's what it felt like..."

"filipemanuelneto","5","0","1","24 June 2017"," Entertaining, visually amazing, but very insipid.
","This is yet another remake of an old movie that, for some reason, has fallen by the wayside. I've never seen the original so I'm not the best person to compare. The film essentially tells the Greek myth of Perseus. The cast is led by Sam Worthington, who did a satisfying job in the action scenes but was unable to concede some psychological depth to his character. Much better on that was Liam Neeson, who played Zeus, or even Ralph Fiennes, who gave life to the grudging Hades in a way that makes clear that he was uncomfortable with his character. In fact, I was wondering if any resemblance between this Hades and Lord Voldemort was mere coincidence or whether Fiennes recycled into the mythical character the voice and manners of the villain of the Harry Potter franchise. But this can even be forgiven when we observe the performance of Gemma Arterton, unable to move a muscle of the face. Her character looks like a dead doll.<br/><br/>I think the actors are not to blame. Its the fault of Louis Leterrier, who decided to make a film that is visually incredible but without any emotion, feeling or depth. When will filmmakers finally understand that a lot of CGI is not enough to make a good movie? Even if it's good CGI, that's never enough! The screenwriters also failed, as the script is absolutely saltless and made the movie insipid. Nothing that is insipid tastes good. It takes salt, seasoning, and this is done, at least in the movies, with emotion and depth. This movie can even entertain us well, it really manages to do it. But it had everything to be even better if the director and writers had worked harder."

"bowmanblue","7","0","1","27 April 2015"," Well it could have been so much worse
","I'm one of those people who watched (and therefore loved!) the original 'Clash of the Titans' movies when I was a child back in the eighties. And, as any cynical adult, I was sceptical about a remake of one of my childhood favourites. The result – in my opinion – it could have been worse.<br/><br/>In case you never sat through the charming Harry Hamlin version, Clash of the Titans is one of those 'sword and sorcery' epics that's a bit like Lord of the Rings, only with Gods added for good measure. Naturally an 'updated version' needs more than a few people in sandals and plastercine monsters and the remake does just that. There is a fair amount of computer-generated special effects, but they're not the problem. One of the main complaints against the new version is that it was filmed in NON-3D and then converted into 3D in post-production, therefore creating a slightly blurred and grainy effect overall.<br/><br/>And there are some other problems with the finished product, but many of those are cosmetic. Take the lead actor's (Sam Worthington) hair. It's supposed to be ancient Greece and yet he's the only man without long flowing hair – choosing instead for a crewcut. Then of course you have a largely British cast (or at least actors putting on 'British' accents) while Worthington's natural Australian accent does tend to slip through occasionally. And maybe the most petty gripe I can think of is naming the Greek town Worthington's trying to save after a popular British 'catelogue store' – it always amused me when they're desperate to save 'Argos.'<br/><br/>When it comes to the (all important) monsters, some of them are good and some do look a little too CGI-ish. The Kraken looked a bit much like the 'Rancor' from Return of the Jedi for my liking, but it's Medusa who steals the show. She was a tough act to follow after her portrayal in the original and, even though she is now fully CGI, she's actually pretty nasty! For some reason though the director felt the need to add too many lens flares (in my opinion) in all the scenes where the Gods were present in Olympus!<br/><br/>But, despite all its flaws, it's actually not that bad. Yes, those of us who were brought up on the original will always prefer that version, but I imagine that there are plenty of kids (young boys I'm guessing) who will love watching Perseus slay one computer generated monster after the next. My main gripe was that I found Perseus' 'love interest' a little wooden. Yes, I see the reason the film-makers shoe-horned in a woman to go on the adventure, but she just kind of delivered her lines like she was reading them from an autocue. I don't know whether this is a fault with the director, not getting the best out of her, as I've seen Gemma Arterton in plenty of other films and she's always turned in a better performance.<br/><br/>So, if you're not too hung up on the original and you're in a forgiving mood when it comes to remakes, you should enjoy this pretty harmless remake of a classic. The only thing I really couldn't forgive was the scorn displayed from the on-screen characters when 'Boo-boo' the clockwork owl from the original made a cameo appearance!"
"ryhill2012","7","0","1","10 January 2015"," good film
","I thought this was a solid, good film, I don't know why it got lower ratings on IMDb.com then ""Pacific Rim"", which in my opinion had sub par performances. The follow up movie ""Wrath of the Titans"" in my opinion was worse, but to each his own i guess. Don't watch this movie in 3-D. Most movies are better once you get over the hype of the retro 3-D experience. Especially if you already wear glasses, having to wear the special 3-d glasses over top makes it very annoying. And for non glasses wearer who aren't use to them, it makes your field of vision blocked off and the whole point of going to the big screen pointless. 3-D isn't for every movie, in my opinion outer space works best.But Seriously why would you watch this film in 3-D? Regardless of all that the film would have gotten higher ratings were it just normal in non 3-D."
"politehere","8","0","1","29 July 2014"," Very Good for What it is
","I read a lot of bad reviews about this movie saying it had nothing to offer but CGI. Then I read a few reviews praising this and I thought they came from people who were part of the movie production team; however, after watching it I realized that a 5.8 rating does not do this movie justice. It easily deserves a 7 on IMDb. I think some aspects of the movie could be compared to Thor. Thor was definitely much more enjoyable than this. I reckon the main reason this movie is not rated as highly as Thor is that unlike Thor, the characters in this movie are rather one dimensional and you never really get to know or care about them much. The entire movie is like you're watching it from a third person perspective, which is not as engaging as it could have been had the characters been given more screen time and a richer back story. There is plenty of CGI action and grand scenes here. The CGI is passable, but it had the potential to be much better than this, considering the fact that it constitutes a major part of this movie.<br/><br/>I would say people, who are not too critical, enjoy Greek mythology in general, have a penchant for a storyline that is straightforward and easy to follow, and of course love to see lots of action, well designed CGI creatures, fantastic vast CGI landscapes, and do not mind seeing one dimensional characters and a predictable ending and look for entertainment and pure fun rather than an intelligent plot, will definitely enjoy this movie a lot, as did I. I have to admit the monsters in this movie were some of the strangest looking and creatively designed I have seen in a long time. I am considering getting the 3D version. A movie with so much fantastic CGI is bound to look great in 3D even if I am to see it in my 40 inch 3D Sony Bravia TV and not in a theater.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who want to be highly entertained. Final verdict: 8"
"OllieSuave-007","7","0","1","2 May 2014"," Remake of Clash wasn't bad.
","This is a remake of 1981's Clash of the Titans, where Hades, God of the Underworld (Ralph Fiennes), demands that Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is offered as a sacrifice or he will unleash the Kraken against the Greek City of Argos. Perseus (Sam Worthington), mortal son of Zeus, it asked to defeat the Kraken, resulting in exciting adventures as Perseus and his fellow warriors battle the creatures of the underworld left and right while on a journey to retrieve the head of the stone-turning goron, Medusa (Natalia Vodianova), to use against the Kraken.<br/><br/>Like the original film, Perseus sets off in an incredible quest to find Medusa, filmed in non-stop adventure and action showing the son of Zeus battling hordes of men and creatures that attempt to get in his way. I thought the CGI effects were pretty good and the overall acting wasn't bad.<br/><br/>Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Hades were the most emphasized gods in the movie, leaving other noted gods such as Poseidon, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Athena, Aries and Apollo on the sidelines. They actually had more screen time filmed and it would have been nice if the director left them in the picture rather than cutting them from the final print, for I thought their roles contributed to the story and the overall mythology element of the movie.<br/><br/>This film, though, does lack the magnificent countryside and renaissance-style scenery you see in the original film, and it does not have that overall classic feel to it. But overall, it is still a nice movie to watch for some decent action and adventure.<br/><br/>Grade B-"

The effects in this version are up to date, but there are moments where you can clearly see it is computer generated.<br/><br/>I loved the giant scorpions and I loved the Kraken, but my favourite characters from this story is Medusa. They all looked amazing, but Medusa was awesome! I loved the snake hair and the face when she stares at people is really spooky.<br/><br/>The movie stars Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Jason Flemyng, Gemma Arterton & Mads Mikkelsen.

","As much as I like movies that are connected to the great Greek mythology, this is certainly not one of them. I can't compare it to the original version, because as of today I haven't seen it yet. But I definitely can say that Clash of the Titans (3D) is a barbaric carnage on the group of films that are set in the times of gods, heroic warriors, and ancient empires.<br/><br/>The storyline is childish, but what more can you expect from a typical popcorn flick brought to life in order to please the masses, right? Right. <br/><br/>The demigod Perseus, son of Zeus, has to stop Hades from releasing the Kraken, which will destroy the town of Argos. He gathers a team of brave, strong and handsome soldiers, who will accompany him on his nearly impossible mission. At first, there seem to be no chances of stopping the beast. However, as the time passes the team realizes that there is one way to defeat the monster, but it requires a trip into the deepest parts of the underworld, namely the palace of Medusa, and cutting her head off. As expected, at the end of the journey only a few men survive; just to make the tale look more dramatic. I think I don't have to mention how the whole story ends, as it clearly speaks for itself.<br/><br/>Actually, from the whole movie the only scene that I was really able to call enjoyable, was the one, where Perseus's entourage had to fight with the nasty Medusa, and one by one got turned into stones. Simple, yet somehow very entertaining while one watches it in 3D.<br/><br/>Oh yes, as for the special effects. The CGI crew did a pretty decent job of creating all the monsters and beasts for this feature. They aren't too simple and as of first sight, they don't look too computer-ish. <br/><br/>The battle sequences would have been boring if it wasn't for the third dimension's visual experience. They look very spectacular sometimes. This is one of a few positive aspects of the movie, for sure.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington as a demigod? Who knew? He actually has the ability to make his character credible, with all the fantastic combat skills and mighty words that he speaks. But Ralph Fiennes was seriously better off playing Voldemort.<br/><br/>As of now, you aren't probably able to see the movie in the cinemas anymore. So the 3D opportunity is gone. If you have a TV compatible with 3D glasses, and are in the mood for some brainless action movie, than I say go watch it, just for fun. Otherwise, I say don't, it isn't worth your time."

This angers the Gods especially Hades. Hades persuaded Zeus to empower him to convince the people of Argos to start praying again through the death of their most beautiful princess. The dilemma Hades put the people of Argos was that they needed to kill their princess or he would release the Kraken.

"kevinxirau","7","0","1","9 April 2012"," A good mythological remake that stands on its own.
","This fantasy adventure turned mythological mayhem was once the proud and final work of special effects master Ray Harryhausen. His work on the original film left such an impression on the world that it can be safe to say that it was one of the greatest old fantasy films ever made, mainly through the creatures Ray portrayed such as Medusa and the Kraken. To me, it was kinda a surprised that it has been remade, so naturally, being a fan of Ray, I checked this action out. Does it live up to the original classic? To me, it basically does.<br/><br/>Many elements from the original film are still around such as most of the creatures and the basic story. With remakes, there's always new elements besides updated special effects, namely new characters and the direction the filmmakers went with this one. The new characters are sorta hit and miss, many of them are pretty interesting and sometimes humorous while a few others not so much. One new character whose performance I really enjoyed was Hades, God of the Underworld. He's so creepy, complex, and awesome that while humanity mocks the gods, he puts them in their place. Nice! Sam Worthington's portrayal of Persius is nicely done as he does as much as he can without much help to prove that he's more man than god, though this somewhat stubborn outlook does backfire on him a little, making things a little more interesting. Plus, Liam Neeson makes a great Zeus.<br/><br/>Now for the creatures, which are a big part of the story. I like how they made Pegasus black instead of the traditional white, making the flying horse a bit more eye-catching. The scorpions are noticeably bigger and badder than back in the old movie and they have a more prominent role. Medusa is absolutely great as while she has the same basic look as before, her improved design combines both her once great beauty with her serpentine lethality. This makes her both sexy and deadly. The Kraken is by far the most awesome as not only does he look cool, but he is also a terrifying and destructive force of nature, which is enough for the gods to we themselves with fear. The rest of the creatures are good in my book.<br/><br/>Other aspects of the movie, like the action scenes and music, are great to behold. There are some things to nitpick like certain characters that are either a little bland or annoying as well as are particular bits of dialog. Overall, a remake that's nicely done and may actually be better than the original. Worth a watch so check it out. RELEASE THE KRAKEN!"
"neighborlee","7","0","1","3 April 2012"," Entertaining flick about Greek mythology
","Hearing about the movie, as relates to 'wrath of the titans', I decided to see this, and I'm glad I did. I went into it , expecting what I got; pure adrenaline and entertainment. If you go into it looking for precise mythological representation, you may be disappointed, but then aren't most people disappointed when they see a movie after reading the book, - and given the small time period for a movie, why are you ? ;) I knew this going in, I sat there looking for entertainment, as most of us do when we goto the movies, and was most certainly not disappointed. The acting seemed a tad stiff in places as if a given actor was trying to find a reason to be excited about their role, but that's a very small nit, as overall the acting is wonderful, by a stellar cast.<br/><br/>The plot is as you would expect from such a movie, as it does not delve too far into the mythos, yet gives you enough information, along with stunning visuals , to be clearly entertained for the entire 1.5 hours. The Greek mythos adage about gods not feeling loved enough is clear, is simple in its comprehension yet is great content for a action experience. I never felt like I wanted to leave the room, nor did anyone else. I remembered the original quite well, and while in some ways it was better than this remake, what's clear is the attempt to yet again, entertain and in that it achieved that quite well.<br/><br/>I do think the snarky comment about the poor metal owl, though honestly semi humorous, was I thought a bit misplaced and in a way slightly ruined the energy the movie had going up to that point. It's not even close to a deal breaker, but having seen the 1981 original at least twice, felt like the owl omission was unfortunate, but I do understand that they were concentrating on other plot points and do not fault them for that per se. The owl, for me at least, gave the movie a distinct feeling of empathy, as I, like I imagine many others, were rooting for the owl, as the stalwart companion. We all love our animal companions after all, which brings us further into a position of empathy as movie goers, yet no matter, as they more than make up for it in other respects.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing this if you liked the original, are okay with something unique regarding plot twists, and love special effects as they lend a hand to magical mythological portrayals."

","As a fan of the original ""Clash of the Titans"" from Harryhausen in 1981, I dreaded the idea of a remake that would crush the magical fantasy land that he created with the first version. And lo and behold, my fears were confirmed.<br/><br/>This film tears to shreds the ""Perseus vs. Medusa"" myth and replaces it with mindless power chord progressions, endless action sequences, and a trivialized view of the Greek gods. Sam Worthington has proved himself to be a competent actor recently, but his performance is just nauseating with his embarrassed delivery of wooden dialogue. The script is awful, and the overblown spectacle of the entire thing is so self-indulgent that I was bored within the first 15 minutes.<br/><br/>I will say however that the only redeeming factor is the film's action sequences. Though they do tend to drag on for nearly 10 minutes too long in every case, they are well shot, and the hand-held camera adds to the effect of the battle's intensity.<br/><br/>Slightly below average action film. Don't go expecting a faithful adaptation of the original myth or even a quality remake of Harryhausen's classic film.<br/><br/>6/10"

The special effects are murky, the acting boring, and the plot about as uneven as Nicolas Cage's recent acting record as compared to ten years ago. Now that's pretty uneven. I wanted to care when a character would get impaled on a scorpion's stinger, but I found myself incapable of feeling for characters we had no relation to or understanding of. The only reason I would ever care if some Greek dude got obliterated would be if he had a cool hairdo. Rewrite the screenplay so as to be free of campyness (to an extent of course) and give me a character that I can be sympathetic for, not some snotty demigod. Get a grip. If you have a Friday night to kill, try ""Gladiator"", ""300"", or Lord of the Rings. Skip this mess."

It is certainly true that Sam Worthington could have made a far more convincing Perseus, and that this film did not really stay true to the strangely touching qualities of Greek Mythology, but as for actors, I have certainly seen worse. <br/><br/>Although wooden, it certainly tried to be historically accurate, and, to a reasonable extent, succeeded. The supporting cast were also impressive, and the soundtrack, while not exceptional, was suitably 'epic'. Liam Neeson and Gemma Arterton should both be proud of excellent performances.<br/><br/>This was certainly not a great film, but neither was it as bad as most critics seem to think it was.

"byrann_gowan","Null","0","1","12 November 2011"," Yeah, it could have been better...
","...but I take what I can get.<br/><br/>This movie... what can I say? It's just worth it. Nothing more. It has some good things for it, but there are also some bad things going for it as well.<br/><br/>The good: First of all, the acting. I know people are going to disagree with me on this, but I think that the reason why the acting wasn't the best was because the script wasn't the best. I mean, come on! The script was really cheesy, and plus, we've got Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in this, both of whom starred in ""Schindler's List!"" They clearly know how to act, and to tell you the truth, they are the stars of the show. That being said, I think the entire cast did with what they could.<br/><br/>Secondly, the CGI. Let me warn you that this is CGI-fest. You see giant scorpions, Medusa, and of course, the Kraken. And, I got to say, they look pretty decent in this movie. So, yeah, the cgi is great here, nothing to complain about that! Thirdly, Gemma Arteton. Need I say more? She does know how to act, and quite frankly... I thought I was going to faint when I first saw her on screen. She is drop-dead gorgeous! When you have beauty and acting skills, like she has, then you've got a dangerous weapon at your side.<br/><br/>Now, the bad: I will start off with the worst problem of the movie: the script. The dialogue was quite weak, and like I said before, I think that was the reason why everybody could not give their 100%. This was the main reason why the film didn't do so well with critics, from what I've read.<br/><br/>Also, there were so many inaccuracies with Greek myth. The first one I heard was when Io said that Zeus tricked Hades to become god of the Underworld. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but in Greek myth, didn't Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon cast lots to see who would become god of what? Secondly, when they speak about how Medusa came to be: they mentioned that she apparently didn't want to make love with Poseidon. Not only do I not remember that in Greek myth, but I don't think they mentioned that the reason why Athena never helped her was because they had sex in Athena's temple. Yeah, it may be a film, but there were so many mythological inaccuracies. That being said, I'm glad that they at least remembered Zeus' animal.<br/><br/>All in all, it's just worth it. If you have anything else to do for your evening, then please do it. But, if you go into this movie, just keep in mind of everything that I have told you. I was able to enjoy it enough as a popcorn flick, like most action movies, but in this case, I could not get over the script and the inaccuracies. 6/10 for me."
"Tweekums","6","0","1","7 November 2011"," Silly but fun; better than I expected
","Before watching this film I'd heard some fairly negative reviews but tried to view it with an open mind and must say it was better than I had expected. The story was pretty silly; I have no idea what the Kraken, a creature of Norse mythology was doing here amongst the gods of Greek Myth for a start! The story follows Perseus, a demigod who was found by a fisherman as a baby. When this stepfather is killed by Hades Perseus agrees to help the king after Hades threatens that he will set the Kraken on the city if his daughter isn't sacrificed. In order to defeat the Kraken Perseus and the soldiers assisting him must consult a group of witches and fight against several enemies including giant scorpions and the snake-haired Medusa who will turn any man who gazes upon her into stone.<br/><br/>If you can suspend your disbelief this film is fairly entertaining and as the action is fairly constant that isn't too hard. The special effects were impressive; in some cases if one didn't know better one might think some of the mythical creatures were real at least that was the case when watching on a fairly small television. The acting wasn't bad with Sam Worthington being a decent lead in the role of Perseus the biggest disappointment was with the late Pete Poselthwaite not because he was bad but because his character only lasted for ten minutes I was hoping to see more of this fine actor. I'm not sure that I'd go out of my way to watch this but it is worth watching if it is on television or if somebody lends you the DVD."
"Mikel3","Null","0","1","16 August 2011"," Clash of the Titans vs the 1981 Version
","We finally saw the 2010 remake of 'Clash of the Titans'. Overall I liked it better than the original. The original was always a bit to cutesy for me with that mechanical owl and all. BTW, he did do a short cameo in the remake. The effects on the climactic scene with the Kraken were more realistic in the new version, but lacked the charm of the Ray Harryhausen creation for me. I preferred the 1981 Kraken design. The remake's Kraken looked like a giant creature from 'Aliens' more than a creature from Greek mythology IMO.<br/><br/>I did like Sam Worthington's Perseus better than Harry Hamlin's. But Hamlin's looked more like my idea of a Greek hero. For instance the new Perseus' hair was too short and he seemed more like a Roman Gladiator. The English accents didn't help. Yeah, I know, who's to say an American accent is better for the parts. For me it took away from the film. But, I still preferred the new Perseus anyway. He seemed tougher and less boyish.<br/><br/>I also preferred Liam Neeson's Zeus to Laurence Olivier's interpretation. For me Olivier's was too over the top and Shakespearean. Like he thought he was on stage again. I felt like Olivier was given free reign with the role and nobody dared direct him otherwise. He also seemed too feeble for the all powerful king of the Gods. Liam played the part nicely and had the presence. But even so I have a hard time deciding whose delivery of the famous line ""RELEASE The KRAKEN !!!"" was better. They were both fun to hear in different ways.<br/><br/>The Gorgon in the 2010 version was better. Giving her a pretty face with snake hair was a good idea. The movie story says she was once a great beauty. Her appearance gave a hint of what she once was.<br/><br/>I also liked the twist on the ending and who the woman would be that Perseus loved and would find happiness with.<br/><br/>BTW-I'm happy to see there is a 'Clash of the Titans 2' in post production with most of the cast returning. I do wonder why Gemma Arterton as Io is not listed. Especially the way the first one ended."

","The original version of ""Clash of the Titans"" was an infinitely entertaining - and still fondly remembered - piece of early '80s kitsch comprised of one part corn to two parts cheese. It was further distinguished by having a number of acting legends of both stage and screen (i.e., Lawrence Olivier, Maggie Smith) slumming their way through the project - and obviously having the time of their professional lives doing so.<br/><br/>The 2010 version, directed by Louis Leterrier, trades in star power and campiness for improved special effects and a more straightforward action-movie approach to the material (though Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes do appear as Zeus and Hades, respectively).<br/><br/>Sam Worthington stars as Persius, the demi-god son of Zeus, who leads the humans in a war against the gods, whom he blames for the deaths of his adoptive parents and little sister. Persius also must face-down and defeat the mighty Kracken, a terrifying, indestructible beast that serves as the gods' ultimate weapon against the people.<br/><br/>It's all very Saturday-matinée juvenilia in spirit and tone, but the pacing is swift, the special effects impressive, and the various and sundry monsters and creatures sufficiently imaginative and larger-than-life to make us suspend our disbelief, if only for the duration.<br/><br/>Good fun."

","Well it's 6:30 PM on May 21st, 2011 and the world hasn't ended as predicted by Family Radio Evangelical preacher Harold Camping. Quite coincidentally, Argos is still standing too, as the Kraken unleashed by the underworld god Hades failed to destroy the city. I'm not sure how the legend of Medusa's gaze turning humans to stone translates to evil sea monsters, but I'll go with it. After all, Perseus and his fellow travelers went to a lot of trouble to put that head in a duffel bag. Oh wait, different movie.<br/><br/>Actually, while I like to pan certain films with a bit of levity, I didn't think this one was too bad. It's been some time since I saw the original Harry Hamlin version, but catching this one today gives me some incentive to get hold of it for the sake of comparison. I do recall some of the cheesy effects from two decades ago, but that had to do with the available technology. The CGI involved here is pretty skillful, the one that caught my interest the most was the aforesaid Medusa with that slither thing going on. The Kraken sequence was pretty amazing too, but gee, wasn't the monster defeated just a little too easily? Perseus (Sam Worthington) didn't have to do much more than stretch his arm out to make the save for Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). Takes some of the fun out of being the hero.<br/><br/>Except for the drawing power of actors Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson, I didn't see much reason for them to be in this one. Their characters are fairly one dimensional considering they were Greek gods after all. I got a kick out of some of the dialog, like the line in my summary above from Perseus's fight instructor Draco (Mads Millelsen). That and the occasional lapses into British accent, especially by Worthington.<br/><br/>Now you're going to hate me for this one, but I just can't help it. When Perseus' guardian Io (Gemma Arterton) was killed by Calibos (Jason Flemyng) and dematerialized into the heavens, I was pretty certain she wasn't gone for good. Sure enough, Zeus (Neeson) makes amends with his demigod son by bringing her back to life to close out the picture. For Perseus, it had to feel like cashing in an IO-U."

The movie contains just some scenes from the written myth and his journey to the Medusa. The actors provided an impressive acting, especially Ralph Fiennes who played Hades.

","Clash of The Titans is by no means a bad movie, but it ain't great either. The biggest most entertaining part of the film was the art direction.

Most of the plot points are pretty contrived and it sort of feels less like a journey and more like random events strung together.

The characters simply do what they do and we are given little reason for why. Zeus is especially frustrating in this manner. <br/><br/>In terms of performance, it is a mixed bag.Liam Neeson is wonderful as always and he is pretty much the ideal Zeus. Sam Worthington on the other hand sucks it up once again, that guy cannot keep an accent straight to save his life.

","I watched the original 1980's version of the Greek based story starring Lord Sir Laurence Olivier, Dame Maggie Smith and Ursula Andress many times when I was a kid, I wasn't surprised I saw there was a remake coming out, from director Louis Letterier (The Transporter, The Incredible Hulk). Basically Hades (Ralph Fiennes) was tricked into running the Underworld by King of the Gods and his brother Zeus (Liam Neeson), but he is still powerful enough to make demands and get some revenge. On Mount Olympus, he argues that there is some kind of uprising happening, and he needs permission to destroy the Earth city of Argos (not to be confused with British retail stores), and he plans to do this by having the Kraken released. Meanwhile on Earth, fisherman Spyros (Pete Postlethwaite, in one of his final film roles before his tragic death) adopts little Perseus, but he dies from drowning and leaves grown up Perseus (Avatar's Sam Worthington) to fend for himself. Perseus finds out that he is actually the son of Zeus, who made love to his birth mother on Earth, and he is destined to stop Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) from being sacrificed to the Kraken. The three blind witches, with one crystal eye ball to see, tell him that the only way to kill the giant monster is to use the head of the Gorgon Medusa (Natalia Vodianova). Before Perseus, with fellow warriors Draco (Mads Mikkelsen) and Eusebios (Nicholas Hoult), get to the cave of the evil serpent haired creature, they go against a bunch of giant scorpions sent by one of the servants to Hades, obviously they survive. Of course everyone knows that Medusa can kill anyone that gazes into her eyes by turning them into stone, so no-one has come out of her cave alive, most of the men die, but Perseus manages to take her head off. In the end, the people of Argos look like they are giving in and sacrificing Princess Andromeda to the Kraken, but Perseus uses the Gorgon's head to turn it to stone, and manages to get rid of Hades as well. Also starring Quantum of Solace's Gemma Arterton as Io, Danny Huston as Poseidon and Jason Flemyng as Acrisius. The original used mostly stop-motion animation to create the Greek monsters that have become legendary, this remake is more advanced with CGI special effects, the story is pretty much the same, with only one or two small differences and maybe a reference to the original (the mechanical owl), it is not a bad fantasy action adventure.

"monkeyjb1988","7","0","1","3 August 2010"," Not terrible (Comparisons with the 1981 version will, obviously, be included)
","***Spoilers*** This is not a perfect film. This film does not have the same heart as most, better, films have, like the original version. Perseus is definitely a brooding hero, and the gods are almost villains in this film, especially Zeus. (and that's saying something, because Zeus wasn't the most likable character in the 1981 film). Perseus got Pegasus way too easily. It was better when they had to bond like the 1981 version Also, Perseus' journey carried more weight when his love was also the female in danger, the case of the 1981 film but not the 2010 film. As a result, we don't feel the same for Andromeda of the 2010 film like we do for the love interest/Kraken snack Andromeda of the 1981 film. Finally, some characters seemed to not serve that big a purpose, like the two hunters or the Djinn. Finally, Bubo is missing except for a cameo. It's a minor complaint and doesn't factor that much into what I don't like about the film, but Bubo is still awesome.<br/><br/>However, the film does have a lot going for it. First off, they remade the film while making it different enough that it's not the same film with updated effects. Plus, it's fun watching people fighting big monsters, simple as that. Also, this film still has heart. Perseus does care about his love interest, as does Liam Neeson's Zeus for his mortal sun (at least he does it without bullying his fellow gods, which I can't say for Laurence Olivier's Zeus from the 1981 counterpart). Heck, Calibos, the monstrous villain from both versions has a redemption moment. It's probably helped by the fact that Calibos' story is tied directly into Perseus', instead of just being thrown in because they liked the same girl. I also liked how mostly everyone in Perseus' party in this version are expanded. You feel the growing of their relationship with Perseus and it's more believable them following Perseus into danger. There's also humor, including references to the scorpion fight while they travel and Bubo's cameo. There's also a feeling that Perseus is fighting for Argo and mankind in this version and not just to save Andromeda like in 1981. Sure, he's brooding, but he feels like a true hero. Finally, and I say this believing Ray Harryhausen's effects work is equally awesome, the effects work is pretty awesome. While the Kraken design isn't as awesome as Harryhausen, I like the designs for Medusa and the scorpions. The Pegasus from 2010 is perfect and even trounces Harryhausen's Pegasus, which is something since I thought his was epic. There were times when Harryhausen's work blends in with the live action better than this version (and he did it with far fewer people), but mostly the effects here are spot on.<br/><br/>All in all, I consider this film only slightly inferior to the 1981 film, which has its own serious story problems (I would give the 1981 film a 7, just like this version). If you like Harryhausen's swan song, you should give this film a fair shake. At least rent it and watch it while remembering that, even if this film was exactly the same as the original, it's still not 1981 film. It's a retelling that pays tribute to the original and becomes its own film. You don't have to watch the 1981 film to appreciate this one. (Although watching and enjoying the 1981 film make the Bubo scene that much better)"

","In the old days of Hollywood, the spectacle was a grand, rousing story filled with enormous battles, a dastardly villain and a hero that everyone could get behind. Nowadays, it's grand and enormous, but it fails to really be rousing and draw us into the story because there's no one to really care about.<br/><br/>""Clash of the Titans"" takes place in a time of gods and man, of heroes and myths. Zeus (Liam Neeson) created man so their continued prayers could give the gods immortality. The problem is that the gods are screwing the humans over, and they're sick of it. When the citizens of Argos destroy a statue of Zeus, Zeus allows his brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) to get the humans respecting them again by any means he sees fit. Hades gives the King of Argos an ultimatum: either sacrifice his daughter Andromeda (Alexa Davalos), or have his city destroyed by the Kraken. But while Hades has his own plans set it motion, the gods watch nervously as Perseus (Sam Worthington), the mortal son of Zeus, journeys to find a way to defeat the Kraken and save both Argos and Andromeda.<br/><br/>The film, an update of the notoriously cheesy 1981 original, is loaded with special effects. For that part of the film, it works. Visually, the film is meticulously detailed and always cool to look at. Even better is the fact that we can actually see the action scenes. Louis Leterrier does not use the shaky cam to obscure what happens in the fight scenes, and apart from a few minor missteps in the beginning, the action scenes are clear and easy to follow.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the acting department is where it fails. It's not that the actors are bad, it's just they're all the same: gruff, growly and brooding. Had there been a little time for character development, this could have been a worthy successor to ""Lord of the Rings"" (in fact, there are scenes where it is trying to be). Alas, it's just all glitz and flashy visuals.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me, but I think if a human being is ripped in half or decapitated (regardless of the amount of blood shown), I think that deserves an automatic R rating. Had the roughly 10 seconds of footage been edited out or redone, this would be a bona-fide PG-13 movie. But as it is, it should have been rated R. Likewise, the images of some of the breasted creatures were covered up, despite being uncovered in the drawings from Ancient Greece.

","My wife and I rented this film on DVD yesterday and watched it with one of our good friends. Each one of us was expecting something a little different than what we actually saw. I will not say anything specific about the movie so as not to ""spoil"" it, but I will say that it is a CGI masterpiece with a pathetic script and terrible acting (other than Gemma Arterton as Io) added simply to move it along to the next cool special effect. If anything else, the three of us enjoyed it because it was so easy to tear it apart and mock it for its campy feel. If you actually enjoyed the movie Reign of Fire, this is right up your alley.

"dead_man_inc98","5","0","1","30 July 2010"," What I think is wrong with this movie
","This movie is what you get when you crap on the script of the original movie, rewrite it while keeping maybe 5% of it, and seemingly mixing it with the God of War games. I loved and still love the original movie and I even like better than this one. I think the original movie was more developed and that with the changes they made to the script, they shouldn't have even called if Clash of the Titans. In the original movie Percius went on the quest to rescue the princess who he wanted to marry. In this one he goes on the quest to kill the gods. In the original the giant scorpions were made when Calibus stabbed a hole in the bag holding Medusa'a dead, not when his hand got cut off and he bleed on the ground. Percius never refused to use the weapons the gods gave him unlike in this one where he only uses the sword out of desperation. The Gen of what ever they were called I don't believe were even in the original movie and they girl who follows Percius wasn't either or certainly not to follow him around. This one also had elements of Lord of the Rings I thought which didn't help the movie out at all. I actually laughed at parts of this movie because it was so ridicules. Even for a fantasy adventure mythology movie. The best thing about this movie was the CGI items. Funny they designed Medusa from a Russian model.<br/><br/>Even after talking about all that I disliked about this movie I still kind of like it. I just can't take it to serious or the stupidity of the people who made it will surely make my head explode."

","The Plot: Apparently, we humans have insulted and basically abandoned the Gods. In retaliation, the god Hades(Ralph Fiennes) will destroy the city of Argos(it destroyed the statue of Zeus) in 10 days, unless Princess Andromeda(Alexa Davalos) is sacrificed to his beast, the Kraken. To stop the Kraken, demigod Perseus(Sam Worthington) reluctantly joins a batch of soldiers led by Draco(Mads Mikkelsen) to kill Medusa, as her stare will turn any man or creature to stone. Along the way they run into Stygian Witches and giant scorpions, and Perseus starts developing a relationship with Io(Gemma Arterton), who knows more about Perseus than he does. Meanwhile, Hades is really planning to overthrow the king of the Gods, Zeus(Liam Neeson) for his own brand of ruling.<br/><br/>Okay, let's get one thing straight: seeing this in 3D SUCKED!! It was a cheap last minute decision that to me was just a way to grab more cash.<br/><br/>Glad I got that out of the way. In all, this movie isn't terrible, but then again, it isn't that fun cheesiness found in the 1981 original. First is the acting. Everyone sounds so bored. Even Neeson, a tough guy from the likes of Batman Begins and Taken, falls quite short. Worthington is hammed up to the max, and some of the others sound like they're reading from a mythology textbook. The only above average performance goes to Fiennes as the evil Hades. And what's with the gods wearing suits of armor? It's like a clash of Mythology and the Renaissance. I also thought the Kraken deserved more screen time. The way they were promoting this, you'd think the Kraken would have showed up for at least 15 minutes. It just felt too short.<br/><br/>Now to the goodies. The action, though there's isn't too much, is pretty fun. I even think the Medusa battle is a little better and improved. The effects and setting are pretty good, though the great Ray Harryhausen's work will always remain king. I also kind of enjoyed the score by Ramin Djawadi(Iron Man, Prison Break), which I later bought on Itunes.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a decently done film that, if casted and thought of better, would have been a nice Spring blockbuster. Instead we're left with only glimpses of that.<br/><br/>The Verdict: 5 for the cruddy 3D and I actually give the traditional 2D a 6. The Good: Nice effects and battles. The Bad: A terribly cheap 3D conversion and wooden performances to almost every character."

","I've just watched it today (on 2D fortunately) and I have to tell you... this is a very good film: very good action scenes, good acting, nice music, great production design, CGI for a 60 - 80 million film (stunning). Overall, very entertaining. But it lacked something: the script and dialog are very rushed focusing only on action scenes (or chopped off by producers like always, converting a promising film into an above average action flick)... Louis Leterrier does his best with the give material. I had high hopes when I read Lawrence Kasdan was attached to the project... but evidently he isn't. Anyway, far superior than Percy Jackson... though very entertaining.<br/><br/>But overall is a pretty good action film. I saw the original film about ten years ago (I will not make comparisons because I barely remember it) and made me a fan of Greek mythology.

"Ryan_MYeah","4","0","1","25 May 2010"," Sam Worthington goes from great Avatar, to Titan sized bland.
","The film is based on the original 1981 film directed by Desmond Davis. The film centers on Perseus (Played by Sam Worthington), the mortal son of the Greek god Zeus (Played by Liam Neeson). Perseus is raised as a fisherman, but years later, his family is killed by Zeus' nefarious brother, the god of the underworld, Hades (Played by Ralph Fiennes). Perseus discovers that it is his destiny to defeat Hades, and prevent him from destroying mankind by unleashing the Kraken. He takes a band of soldiers on a journey to defeat the Kraken, and prevent Hades from overthrowing Zeus, and destroying mankind.<br/><br/>So, what did I think of the film you may ask? My answer: Mediocre.<br/><br/>The story is one that has potential, but came across as cheesy, and sloppily done. You'd think an action movie based on Greek mythology, filled with tons of visual effects, and huge ass monsters would manage to hold one's interest for almost two hours. But the way the editing just went from sluggish to rushed, sluggish to rushed, had me wanting this movie to end after 45 minutes.<br/><br/>The inconsistent pacing, and unspecial screenplay with cringe-worthy dialogue aside, what really made me drowsy was the characters. The performers just didn't seem to really care, or try. Sam Worthington, who was great in Avatar, is almost completely bland in this one. It doesn't seem like he's traveling across Greece defeating monsters. It's like he's walking down an aisle of Whole Foods looking for soy chips. However, Fiennes and Neeson were great, as usual, and the only two cast members who didn't seem bored.<br/><br/>The movie itself made me want them to just rush to Neeson saying ""Release the Kraken!"" or see the next action sequence. The action is lacking through the first three quarters in the movie. But, there is a fight scene later in the movie with Medusa which was awesome. It's fast paced, and never loses interest. And the Kraken sequence was absolutely astonishing. The action and visuals in that scene were magnificent.<br/><br/>Howver, the rest of the visuals in the movie aren't THAT creative, and aren't that special. Any monsters or settings in the movie that aren't Medusa, and the Kraken, are poorly realized by sub par effects animation.<br/><br/>If the movie could have been on equal quality to those two awesome action sequences I mentioned earlier, I definitely think it would have been better. But, that's not the case.<br/><br/>I give it ** out of ****"

Not that I don't like him. I hate him. They are trying to make him into the new Russell Crowe(not that i'm obsessed with him either). He's no Russell Crowe. <br/><br/>Hollywood is running put of ideas, so they are remaking everything they can get their hands on. But no film screamed a remake more than Clash of the titans, the cheese-filled original with probably the most shameful special effects i've ever laid eyes on. <br/><br/>I am not going into the plot. I'm not the right person to do that. A mythology freak is the right person to do that. And I know some too. I guess I can do my best. Clash of the Titans is the story of a guy named Perseus(played by Sam Worthington), who happens to be the son of Zeus(played by Liam Neeson). <br/><br/>Zeus is in a rivalry with his brother Hades(played by Ralph Feinnes, who reunites with Neeson after Schindler's list).

","First, let's get the good stuff out of the way. Liam Neeson is lots of fun displaying his talent in a bit part as Zeus in this Computer-Generated Image (CGI) fest. Ralph Fiennes is somewhat less entertaining as the underworld lord Hades, in a portrayal that seems to borrow a lot from Ron Moody's Fagen in the musical Oliver! The Kraken, a sea creature described by Norwegian fishermen probably based on sightings of giant squid, is transformed into something out of H.P. Lovecraft and is at least inventive. The Medusa in this update is a clever combination of the seductive and the horrifying. Unfortunately, to get to these bits, the viewer has to wade through a tiresome ""quest"" plot, struggle to make sense out of badly-edited CGI combat, and suffer through endless stoic scowling by Sam Worthington. The heroic part of this version of Clash of the Titans was the effort to keep awake. Sure, the old Harryhausen version is limited to stop-motion special effects and a woefully miscast Harry Hamlin as Perseus, but it was thoroughly entertaining, cleverly written, and had a engrossing plot (and Judi Bowker as Andromeda was a turn-on). My suggestion: watch the original for fun and rent this one if you have insomnia."
"musings-morsels","2","0","1","13 May 2010"," Cr*p of the Titans
","I haven't had the chance to see the original 1981 Clash of the Titans but I believe even with the lack of technological special effects, it couldn't have been as bad as the cr*p that was churned out this year. The re-make had such promise with the all-star cast ensemble, the foundations of the original film and the intriguing Greek mythology that can fuel the plot. But instead of doing a little research and actually closely following the myths that were well thought out for hundreds of years. Producer/writers/directors decide to cheapen the project by turning it into another Hollywood action pack block-buster with no plot and wooden actors... WHHYYY????? <br/><br/>The first scene already got me rolling my eyes when a baby was found alive and well floating in a coffin that just rose from deep under the sea. The kid was taken in by a sweet fisherman's family who brought him up to become the brooding, handsome hunk of muscle Perseus played by Sam Worthington. I'm always supporting rising Australian actors in Hollywood with full force. But Worthington's losing me as a fan with his wooden facial expressions, monotones dialog (with a very heavy Aussie accent that made me cringe) and awkward demeanor. Perseus then gets swept into the battle between the gods and the people when his family became casualties of war. He stumbles into the royal court where his demigod status is discovered which forces him into the journey to save the princess, destroy the gods to avenge his family. Typical plot that could've been substantial if done well, unfortunately in this Clash of the Titans (COTT) it wasn't. COTT lacked story-telling, character development and explanations in focal scenes that left the audience hanging with no satisfaction.<br/><br/>The lonesome fisherman (who's never picked up a battle sword in his life), single handedly fought off a hoard of soldiers with years of training. WTF!?!? I know you're a demigod and all but that's way too much BS one can handle, either that or the soldiers were all shite. In which case don't wage war with the gods if you don't have the goods!! The film was then followed by a series of eye-rolling, scoffing and choke worthy bullshite that I just was not able to accept. The heroes journey seemed irrelevant after the long sequence of heavily laden CGI fight action scenes & the laughable dialog didn't help bring the audience back onto the journey's path at all. And was it me or did Zeus have a serious case of multiple personality disorder? One minute he appears to his son Perseus giving advice and offers help. The next he's telling Hades to carry out the human slaughter with no mercy!?!? If I were Hera I would've advised my husband – the god of gods to seek psychological help. The one thing I thought didn't make my head shake in disbelief was Hades (Ralph Fiennes) acting, his eerily cold appearance made me shiver at times and I have to say was a breath of fresh air in a film that had nothing else going for it.<br/><br/>One last thing I want to vent about. I'm sick of every movie becoming 3D just because it can. And I was stupid enough to follow the hype and go see COTT with those horrible glasses that fell off my nose every 3 seconds. It made the scenes blurry, darker and I didn't see one bit of impressive eye popping 3D activity at all?!?! That was a big fat waste of money and headache inducing experience.<br/><br/>I'll end it with my all time favorite scene/line that made me laugh out loud inappropriately. This time it was the all mighty Zeus who's guilty. In one of the final crucial scenes, he tells all the gods at the conference to leave him and Hades alone in the room. He slowly walks up the stairs and dramatically turns! and instead of having a private meaningful conversation that required the other gods to leave he utters 'Release the Kraken!' (oh no! it's not a giant octopus it's elephant man's f**ked up twin!) - WTF WTF WTF!?!?!<br/><br/>http://musingsandmorsels.weebly.com/"

","Terrible film. Waste of my time. Pathetic excuse for cinema. I must say the trailer intrigued me. Whereas most people seem to be against remaking films, I actually enjoy seeing remakes and adaptations. I think it's a cool idea. But, this film did a terrible job of adapting. Right from the beginning the whole movie seemed rushed. Not to mention they try to explain way too much. Right from the beginning, a female voice explains exactly what you are about to see. And throughout the movie, the characters are so obvious in explaining what will happen in the future events of the plot it seems like a down syndrome patient wrote the dialogue. Persiuss' guardian angel explains what he needs to do the entire time. Everyone likes seeing it when the protagonist solves the riddle by dilligence and investigation, not being guided by somebody. I don't care if he's a demi-god, he seems too catered too throughout the plot. Take for instance in the end when the Kraken is about to munch that girl. All he does is show it Medusa's face and it turns to stone (a suggestion that his guardian angel gave him way earlier in the plot so we knew it was gonna happen). There's no conflict, he doesn't struggle against the climactic enemy. The characters are so surfaced that we wanna call the characters by their real-life names rather than their characters names. The special effects looked like sci-fi's low-budget films and the humor was so not funny it was actually sad. Halfway through my friend and I considered walking out but were so anxious to see the kraken scene which turned out to be a whopping two minutes. All in all the movie seemed like an excuse to destroy a couple buildings, remake a movie, and put Sam Worthington in a skirt. Whatever happened to the witch's prophecy that he was gonna die. That mighta made the movie worth seeing. . . if he died at the beginning."

","When I tell my classes about constellations, I tell the Andromeda myth, since much of the autumn evening sky is filled with constellations from this myth - even the Kraken (the constellation Cetus). So it was amusing that I had just told a class the story before seeing the movie. To say the movie is loosely based on the myth is being generous. Jake Sully, sorry, Sam Worthington, is Perseus, but he's indistinguishable from Jake Sully, even down to the Marine haircut. One character not in the Perseus myth is Io (Gemma Arterton). Io was one of Jupiter's lovers and is commemorated as a satellite of Jupiter. So Gemma Arterton is a heavenly body? No argument here. She's a feast for the eyes in this film. Visuals are impressive and the action is exciting. Andromeda is dignified, brave, and beautiful, even if she doesn't get the hero in the end (unlike the actual myth). As for the 3-D, I avoided Avatar for fear of eyestrain and headaches, but tried it here. I had no problems, but I have a very dominant left eye and, apart from a few exaggerated effects in the trailers, the 3-D had no effect at all on my eyes."
"bastiaanvon","2","0","1","8 May 2010"," A disappointment rather than anything else
","As well as the predictable acting, both the plot and script could have been made much better. The film follows the traditional three-act structure to the letter and tries to build up to an awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping climax. What has been conceived,however, is one of the dullest fight scenes ever put to film. The problem is with the scripting, as it is flagged up early on in the film that the mythical monster the Kraken will be summoned to destroy Argos. Later on in the film, it is clearly explained how the Kraken can be defeated. And to no-one's surprise, the Kraken is defeated in exactly the way described, without any of the characters being put in any particular danger. There is no excitement or suspense, and there doesn't seem to have been any exertion from the characters, which makes the film the more unsatisfying. Director Louis Leterrier said that he wanted to remake the 1981 film because he enjoyed it so much in his youth. Instead of improving on the stop-motion classic, Leterrier has created a boring, plodding film despite of the talent at his disposal."

So much so that I saw it two weeks ago and can't recall the name of a single character. Visually, the film was stunning, but in every other way it was extremely underwhelming. Therewas some business about Greek myths and Liam Neeson is in it (although why he'd stoop so low, I cannot imagine), as is the actor who play Voldemort in the Harry Potter films. But anyway, the plot is equally terrible in 3-D or 2-D and the special effect are good enough in 2-D that there's really no need to spend your money on those dorky glasses. The fight scenes are kind of exciting, I suppose, but I was disappointed with the romantic end.

","To be fair, the movie wasn't at all what I expected. In the original movie I definitely saw some room for improvement with the visual effects, although for the times, I thought Ray Harryhausen did a fantastic job! The only problem I had with the effects with this remake was Pegasus; it's too bad that he couldn't have stayed as the mythical white stallion. The original storyline beat this one as well, the Gods played more of a role and the gifts were part of what separated Persius from mortals. Pegasus was meant to be caught and Poseidon was the original creator of the Kraken. Medusa was cursed by Aphrodite, not Athena. The basic mythological stories of the Gods should have remained. Hades has his own stories that could have been used for another movie. Overall, I think this movie was generated mostly for the visual effects, like the first one, but to the extreme, I can image the visual artists may have all thrown their cards on the table and the director took bits and pieces from whatever was offered, that he thought would be best for the audiences, which, by the way, the new Kraken was worth it! But it was apparent that storyline was sacrificed for visual effect. And as a shout out to the ladies that are crushing on Sam W. like myself, what's a girl gotta do to get a kiss from that guy, huh?"

"vip_ebriega","7","0","1","20 April 2010"," Lower your expectations... and see it on 2-D instead.
","With the right expectations, CLASH OF THE TITANS is a pretty enjoyable update of the 1981 minor fantasy classic if you can forgive some of the absurdities of the script. I loved the original CLASH OF THE TITANS but I don't see anything wrong about remaking it, and when I saw the trailers I knew what to expect: A bone-headed, old school adventure movie with lots of action despite only having half a plot. I went in with little expectations and got out just fine, and provided that you don't expect anything else, you will too. And oh yeah, take everyone's advice and see it on 2-D. I took the advice to not see it on 3-D and seeing that the movie is not as bad as everyone has said it was, I think you should to.<br/><br/>Turns out director Louis Leterrier and writers Travis Beacham, Phil May, and Matt Manfredi have done more than update Ray Harryhausen's vintage claymation monsters. Other than amping up the action, they have also added and changed several elements in the script. But despite a few decent additions, none of them really add much. The whole plot about mortals doing war with the gods might have been intriguing, but it's all played rather silly here. How do the brave warriors of Argos plan to fight the gods with only swords and spears? These, along with a few other inconsistencies just make the story a little confusing. And typical to any modern action/adventure movie, our hero Perseus (played by Sam Worthington) has to have a tragic background so he can hate the gods throughout the whole movie and get the job done the dirtiest way possibly. Does every action hero today have no other motive than a vendetta? Despite their best efforts, none of the performances really connected with me (Gemma Atherton's Io came close, but whatever she had with Perseus wasn't deeply ventured and therefore utterly forgettable). However, I enjoyed big-time actors like Liam Neeson (who performs his now-famous 3-word line immortally) and Ralph Fiennes (who does another sneering Lord Voldemort impression) who had a ball as some of the immortals.<br/><br/>But other than these several alternations, the movie is fairly faithful to the original, only 10 times bigger. You thought a fight with giant scorpions was cool? How about one with giant scorpions 10 times bigger? You think the Kraken is huge? This one makes the one in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN 2 look camera-shy. But this gives and takes from the experience. The action sequences are quite exciting, even without the use of distracting 3-D. But on the other hand, it's as if Leterrier wants every moment of the movie to be loud and amped-up. Even the encounter with the Stygian Witches (who looked like they came out from PAN'S LABYRINTH) isn't devoid of a shaky action sequence. Nevertheless, the many special effects are pretty good and some of the action sequences they're in are some of the film's highlights. The aforementioned scorpion duel has to stand as my favorite, but there's also the battle in Medusa's lair (surprisingly enjoyable, but lacking the suspense from the one in the original) and the final stand-off with the Kraken.<br/><br/>It won't be another fantasy film favorite like the original, but if you don't expect nothing more than a popcorn-movie that does what it's supposed to do, CLASH OF THE TITANS ain't have bad. Perhaps just for Neeson's delivery of his immortal ""Release the Kraken!"" in all its glory, this movie is worth seeing.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."

This is the third Leterrier(who, I understand, is a fan of the 1981 version) creation I catch(The Transporter and The Incredible Hulk), and other than Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, I've largely liked his choices. He always delivers plenty of awesome, exciting and effective action, and this is no exception. The same goes for it being engaging and fun. Production values are high, and the designs(other than the silly-looking beard they hid Huston behind) are usually very good. The plot moves along nicely, and I was never bored. Characters are fine, if more development, personality and a greater amount of ones that get to be fleshed out and play a genuine role in the story would be quite welcome. There is essentially no poor comic relief. The Gods are in it relatively little. This is largely well-cast, if the acting talent is basically wasted. With that said, they do add to the experience. A few performances are over the top, most noticeably Flemyng(is it me, or is that his thing?). Dialog is marvelous, with the occasional hiccup. The editing and cinematography are well-done, apart from brief instances here and there. Visually, it's attractive enough, though you can tell that it wasn't meant to be 3D from the start(in fact, one can barely see that it is, at all... in the bad way). The CGI is excellent(and smoothly and nearly seamlessly integrated; also, the locations and stunts help immensely at selling the illusion), with strong exceptions, such as the soulless Medusa and the obvious horses(honestly, just stay away from animating anything that is alive and exists in the real world). Score is fitting and cool, by the man who also did the music for Iron Man. This communicates its themes pretty well. There is a lot of mild-ish(if bordering on brutal) violence and brief moderate language in this. I recommend this to fans of the genre and of epic popcorn flicks. Nothing too challenging, and certainly not the best of its kind, if entertaining. 7/10"

","After ""Avatar"", I'm crazy over 3 Dimensional movies and my eyes were always expecting the arrival of one such! Before a month, I got a glimpse of ""Clash of the titans"" in the form of trailer in a Famous Movie Channel. I have 'mind marked' that movie and awaited for its release.<br/><br/>Many of us may not be aware of the ancient history of Greek's and its a drawback on the storyline. So, as expected we will not be able to understand many sequences and characters throughout the film. Added to the burning oil, the dialog's are much unpleasant and leaves us in chaos.Director LouisLetterier has previously made chart busters like The Incredible Hulk & Transporter Series. So there was a decent expectation on him, has he fulfilled it ? I would rather say, partially ""YES"" and a small ""no"".<br/><br/>Let me prove with some detailing. ""The first half of the movie was filled with mindless dialog's and very few acting skills (I thought total money waste!) and before 15 minutes on to interval ""the real clash begins!"". Itz the time for us to watch astonishing 3D and breath taking visual actions! I told into my heart, there is something ""beyond expectation"" in this movie rather considering the flaws. The total movie was 1hr 40 mints excluding the credits. You will be stunned for at least 1 hour and ""Yes"" it gives the worth for money spent. (I spent 100 rs with provided HQ 3D glass - Guru Theatre, Madurai). You will visualize never seen ""Gigantic"" (I mean it!) Poisonous Black Scorpions with faultless graphics and flawless action. You will fear them... and imagine ""WOW - I'm watching it in 3D! It hasn't just stopped with the scorpions.<br/><br/>After interval, its full of eye catching visuals and high-end graphical treat. Just role Ur memories back to the monstrous Hollywood movies... which is the biggest ""Boa"" u have ever watched in a HW flick? i guess, u may predict ""Anaconda"". But, here is a record breaking animation of a snake, which is in unimaginable size and structure, again i will highlight the ""3D WOW""! In addition,You see a flying Black horse, Baddie appearing in the form of dark smoke in air, falling palaces, giant statues, rising ocean waters...... etc; all happening closer to your forehead! My Heartful Kudos!!! to the visual effects and 3D animators. Some Scenes remind's us of Avatar and even much better than avatar, where poor creature creation(Monster animation) is eliminated here, thereby providing much closer to realness scenario.<br/><br/>On the lagging side, as I have mentioned earlier, ""Boring ancient dialog's"",""Unmatched dialog sync with movie pace"" and very bad acting throughout by many important characters (Including our Hero). The sets of few scenes look crappy. Very big minus point is the ""gods"" & ""angels"" looking so 'damn like a human' and their dressings are made with glittering silver foils(Spl. mention - The God Zeus), looks like a third class stage artist. The sets of heaven is as poor as a drama set. Many of the characters look modern in their hair style and actions - like Software & Business Professionals! (keep in mind the story is all about an Epic Greek mythology).<br/><br/>But, these things are negligible & doesn't leave us behind. In climax ""KRAKEN"" a monstrous(!!!) creature rises from the underneath of hell below the ocean and believe me, ""I cant shut my open mouth for few minutes!"". The size of that creature hypnotized me and i can hardly move my eyes off the screen. I could easily bet no Hollywood flick has shown such an enormously sized creature in a 'micron crisper' graphical detail, that too in 3D. At this point, I was justified for the money spent. (For watching this movie, as well as their production cost)<br/><br/>In the end, did SAM victor over all these dangerous monsters & devils...? How did he do that...? Whether he uses his semi-God power...? Did his Love succeed? For all other questions that rise in Ur mind, i will give a very simple answer... <br/><br/>""GO TO A SOPHISTICATED 3D THEATRE! ENJOY THE WEEKEND WITH UR LOVED ONE'S!""<br/><br/>HAT'S OFF : EYE DAZZLING GRAPHICS & VISUAL EFFECTS, FEW MIND BLOWING 3D & BG MUSIC, HEART STOPPING ACTION SEQUENCES BY MONSTERS & WORTHINGTON!<br/><br/>BRAIN'S OFF : POOR DIALOGUES, FEW WORST SETS, WORTHLESS COSTUMES & OLD MYTHOLOGICAL STORYLINE. <br/><br/>FINISHING TOUCH : ""IF SOME OF THE ABOVE THINGS, THAT TURN OUR BRAIN'S OFF, WOULD HAVE BEEN CORRECTED B4 THE RELEASE.... THEN, SURELY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A REMARKABLE 3D FLICK!""<br/><br/>(Kind Note: Since 3D conversion was made in a very short time few scenes are not quite appealing - But I will put it as a short time ""BEST"", Plz cheer-up for the hard-work done, rather discouraging on speaking only about the minors!)"

Especially noticeable are scenes, where the object spreads to cover the left or right edge of the screen. (Thanks Wil!) The 3D image isn't quite so good. James Cameron, was obviously aware of this when he made Avatar. It had no 3D hiccups.<br/><br/>Despite that, Clash is an excellent film for the emerging 3D industry. The special effects were expected, and they were well done.<br/><br/>One wonders what Ray Harryhausen (retired) could do with these toys, which didn't exist 30 years ago?"

I dearly love Mads Mikkelsen and Polly Walker. For the spend, I think they could have done a much better job.<br/><br/>I'd have liked it better if I'd seen it in the ""flat"", but what can you do when such a bone shaking monster of sheer terror as the Kraken, is portrayed as being rather cute calamari. Personally I'd have fed him the silly girl without any inducement, and tickled him under the chin afterward.My enjoyment of the film was enhanced when I was the only person in the theatre who understood the nod to Harryhausen; well I was the only one who laughed, anyway.Plenty of ""done before"", comic scenes and gags, that do not detract, especially when done by such a lovely cast. Loved the Djinn, and Medusa, but found myself wishing that the bad guys would win... quite bored with the whole ""I'll do it as a man"" thing.<br/><br/>Liam's shining armour made we want to leap out of the seat crying ""EXCALIBUR!!!"", lucky there were other patrons present, or I would have.

","Seeing as the original Clash of the Titans was the very first movie to capture my imagination and offer my childhood a lead to conquer and vanquish any villain my games could conjure, my expectations might have slightly jaded my impressions before the e-transaction for a couple of tickets to this 3-D remake had been processed. <br/><br/>Then again, this is not the making of a book into a movie where one can always expect a depreciation of the plot and running thoughts in favour of action sequences or musical montages. This is the remake of a movie and if it's only purpose had been to revamp and modernize the effects from the original, it could have indeed been what some critics are labelling as ""epic"". <br/><br/>The truth is that, they took the plot from the 1981 version, mulched it to a fine paste and steamrolled-it flat to make it easier to digest. By offering it in 3-D (which clearly came as an after-thought), my guess is they had figured this would bring back some depth to the classic <br/><br/>Total miss. <br/><br/>In sum, this movie is hardly worth seeing but if you are going to, don't bother seeing it in 3-D."

","Every major holiday period usually involves a big blockbuster movie, in an unashamed attempt to rake in as much money as possible. 'Avatar' was the big film over the Christmas period. Come Easter 2010, and it's 'Clash of the Titans' taking blockbuster billing. COTT (a remake of an 80s film of the same name)takes its inspiration from Greek mythology.<br/><br/>While there's plenty of big action set-pieces and 3D elements (though they don't have much impact aside from a more aesthetic appeal), the story is fairly simple. The people of Argos have turned their backs on the gods, so Zeus (Liam Neeson) in concert with his brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes), decides to give them some tough love, thereby forcing the mortals to embrace the gods again. Zeus' son, Perseus, is the only one capable of stopping the gods, though he is reluctant to use his demi-god abilities.<br/><br/>'Titans' is an unashamedly blockbuster film; the back story is dealt with early, without getting too complicated, and the film probably won't be remembered for its acting (especially Worthington retaining his Australian accent amongst the British accents) and there's some corny dialogue and little attempt at humour. <br/><br/>It's the action where 'Titans' flourishes. The battle scenes, especially the ones with Medusa, are suitably spectacular and make the two hour duration fly by, something the bloated 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' failed to achieve.<br/><br/>While 'Clash of the Titans' is unlikely to receive as much acclaim as 'Avatar', it still manages to entertain with its big, bold action set pieces, even if the 3D element doesn't add anything more than an extra gimmick."
"dark_death732","6","0","2","4 April 2010"," ""Decent"" = Disappointment
","To label a movie like this as being ""not bad"" is in itself an oxymoron. If you had to call it 'not bad' to cleverly avoid calling it 'not good', than the movie didn't live up to it's hype, and left you disappointed. You should instead think about it for a second and say 'Could I have spent my money on something better?' Sadly in my case the answer is yes. This movie had plenty tense action scenes and some awkwardly placed humor (which was hilarious) for me to call it decent but to be 100% honest, let me get to the point. Redbox it. If you've got money to blow, and you insist on seeing every popular title for yourself, than have at it! Make sure it's in 3D, and I hope you enjoy! But if you're on a tighter budget and would enjoy a more satisfying theater experience, save this title for the Redbox - rent it for a few nights, hell even let the dog get a hold of it and drag it under the couch, and return it a few days later. Whatever suits your fancy. But if you are on a tight budget, don't spend more than 5 dollars total on seeing Clash of the Titans. We spent 30 for two 3D tickets. Shamefully, this turned out to be a waste of money. I never check IMDb for fear of being misled but in this case I must say, the current rating of 6.8 is about right. Don't expect an epic phenomenon, the movie is simply Decent. Impressive CGI can sometimes glorify mediocre movies, so take that into account when reading some of the more Grand 10-star reviews. Movies like Avatar or Lord of the Rings (plenty others. dare I mention Titanic?) would have still been amazing movies even if made in 1990 with minimum use of CGI. But astonishingly realistic CGI is what takes them from 'Amazing' to 'EPIC'. Again, sadly this remake would flop horribly if it were made in 1990 with more basic CGI."

This is mythology after all and there are tons of Gods you can mention, include in the story, then why sticking with only a couple of? Besides, the story doesn't go too deep. There could be much more developed scenario.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the leading actor is OK and acted pretty well. Regarding Liam Neeson, his presence is always a +1 to any movie. So I can say, acting is quite well in this movie.<br/><br/>Instead of watching it in 3D, I recommend you to watch it in 2D. Saving is a saving after all!!"

","I no longer post messages on IMDb because of some bizarre process they make you undergo, but I still write reviews. I have read criticisms of the COTT remake for having way too much and very poor CGI. I would say this was readily evident from the trailer. Also, I read a posting where the writer complained about how quickly the Kraken was turned into stone. Well, if you go back to the original version, the Kraken (which was much more majestic-looking than the Kraken in the remake)) is also rather quickly turned into stone, almost as if animator Ray Harryhausen was in a rush to wrap things up. He delays the big moment for a few seconds by having the beast swat Perseus and Pegasus into the ocean, but they bounce right back and quickly take care of business. I have no plans to see the remake, as I am too old for such nonsense (and the truth is, the original movie was nothing to write home about, as Harryhausen was well past his prime). But I would be curious to see the new Medusa. Harryhausen's Medusa was truly frightening and the highlight of the original movie."
"apuleius15","Null","0","1","4 April 2010"," bizarre retake on an old classic
","I loved the 1981 original as a kid and I still remember seeing it in the theater. I didn't expect much from this remake except some enjoyable special effects, and some are indeed there. The battle with the scorpions was fun to watch, and the Kraken was suitably frightening (although its face and mouth resembled the monster in the pit in Tatooine in ""Return of the Jedi""). And Medusa's movements were more serpentine, in a very Dante-esquire underworld. My biggest problem with the film, however, was its divergence from the spirit of Greek mythology in favor of a more Judeo-Christian take on the story. The original did a much better job of capturing the ""humans as playthings of the gods"" angle. In this film, however, Zeus ""loves"" humans and they are supposed to ""love"" him back. His anger at this lack of love resembles that of Yahweh in the Old Testament. Hades now takes on the role of Satan. And Perseus is now Christlike- at one point Io tells him ""you are part god and part man- but the best of both."" Sheesh... Some other minor gripes- the djinn (from Arab mythology) made no sense at all in the course of the story. If some were riding scorpions, why did others have to ride camels (was that the ""bitch seat"" on their expedition?). And the one that talked sounded like Jabba the Hutt. All in all, some entertainment there, but as lousy an introduction to Greek mythology as ""300"" was to Greek history."

","Clash of the Titans (3-D, 1:46, PG-13) — 5 — Fantasy: Sword & Sorcery, 2nd string, remake<br/><br/>My standard for what it takes to justify a remake has always been that the original movie has to have had lots of potential but been poorly executed. To that I must now add a codicil: The remake must aspire to doing better, not just the same thing with different faces and technology.<br/><br/>Yes, the new Clash of the Titans features CGI instead of Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion animation, 3-D instead of 2-D, and Sam Worthington instead of Harry Hamlin as Jake Sully, er, Perseus. But it's still a superficial version of one of the greatest adventure stories ever told. The dialog is stilted and fakey, but (perhaps fortuitously) there's not much of it, and for variety it comes in several different accents. We find out what's going on mainly thru voiceovers (such as the entire cosmology of ancient Greece condensed into a quick minute or 2 of astronomical establishing shots) and exposition provided by characters — mainly Perseus's immortal guardian Io (Gemma Arterton) — who conveniently turn up just when their information is needed.<br/><br/>It's a bad sign when the movie fails to engage you to the extent that you devote your leftover attention to comparing it to other films. In this case, the one that kept popping into my mind was Percy Jackson and the Olympians, which featured much the same cast of characters. Wasn't it just a couple of months ago that Medusa had her head lopped off by someone else? Didn't this Mount Olympus look grander, even while its gods looked smaller? Does Sam's barber have a contractual commitment to follow him to each new movie? Was that really Dr. Bashir who zipped fleetingly across the screen (as one would expect of Hermes)?<br/><br/>I suppose nobody will really be any more disappointed than they were back in 1981 at the false advertising of the title. There are no titans in this film. Those creators of the universe were all killed off long ago by their children, the gods. And the gods themselves don't clash, either, except for a certain snotty one-uppery. No, this is about humans rebelling against the gods. Zeus (Liam Neeson) created the humans because the gods needed to feed on their worship (no word on what they ate beforehand), and he's been indulgent of them to the extent that they've developed an independent streak and dialed back on the adulation. This saddens Zeus, but it really pisses off his brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes), who'd rather have humans' fear than their respect.<br/><br/>So, just as with The Lightning Thief, there's a completely arbitrary deadline imposed (in this case an upcoming solar eclipse) for the protagonist to produce the mcguffin (here a sacrificial princess instead of the purloined thunderbolt) lest calamity befall everyone.<br/><br/>The movie was visually dark (probably a byproduct of the Real-D projection technique), and it was hard to follow the action sequences due to all the quick cutting between viewpoints. I rolled my eyes at the generous dungeon master among the screenwriters who thot ""Hey, let's have the hero walk across a meadow and just stumble across a +2 magic sword. Everybody will believe that!"". OTOH, the critter work was terrific: the giant scorpions, the gorgon's snaky body and hair, the pegasi, and especially the kraken were extremely well realized.<br/><br/>And, as I said above (but it bears repeating), the source material has survived for thousands of years for a very good reason — it's just a crackerjack good story. Perhaps some day a film will come along that will do it justice. 3rd time's the charm, they say. (For the record, this was #2.)"
"phileeguy9","6","0","2","3 April 2010"," It's as if I've seen this movie before...
","...Probably it's because I have. That's why they call these things re-makes, this one being re-made from the 1981 version. Still, I found it a bit sad that the writers didn't come up with many new ideas when they could have. Yes, they had to follow the same plot path in Perseus asking the 3 witches how to defeat the Kraken, taking Medusa's head, and speeding back upon Pegasus to turn the monster to stone. But there are so many minor scenes and plot points that didn't need to be recreated basically identical to the 1981 film.<br/><br/>For example, in this movie Perseus fights giant scorpions that spawn from venomous blood. Yeah, that was in the original. In this movie Perseus is given a sword from Zeus himself and has a mighty shield with a mirror on the inside in which he uses to defeat Medusa. Yeah, that was in the original. This time around Perseus engages in battle with Calibos, and Calibos loses his arm. Yeah, that was in the original. Heck, even the mechanical owl Bubo was here for a scene. (Actually, that was probably just an homage gag that I rather enjoyed seeing) These are just a few examples of many points of re-using the same ideas instead of coming up with something more original. Couldn't the giant scorpions have spawned some way else, and did they have to be giant scorpions? Couldn't Perseus have defeated Medusa in a more original way? <br/><br/>Apart from stealing ideas from the original, this version has characters that are either ham-handed into the story or are altogether superfluous. For example, Calibos - a.k.a. King Acrisius - really wasn't needed other than in the scene where he kills his wife and attempts to kill infant Perseus for his wife sleeping with Zeus. And by the way, if you're going to kill your wife for having an affair why wait 9 months? Why not just kill her immediately? But I digress. In the original movie, Perseus loves Andromeda and you can see why he would risk life and limb to find a way to defeat the Kraken. Andromeda is an afterthought in this movie. And though I can't complain here about the writers' attempts to differ from the original, I think they put the idea of Killing the Kraken to weaken Hades for Perseus to get revenge was a bit of a stretch.<br/><br/>Most of the characters in this movie were also expendable, so there wasn't much character development apart from Perseus himself. As for the actors portraying their respective roles, most were forgettable. Sam Worthington was decent enough as Perseus, Mads Mikkelsen was serviceable as Draco, Ralph Fiennes was underused as Hades, and Liam Neeson's Zeus... well let's just say he was no Sir Laurence Olivier.<br/><br/>As for the special effects, I thought they were good, not mind-blowing great. Light years better than the original's stop-motion technique, for sure. Most scenes were pleasing to the eye. But I will remark that I think the CGI guys here may have taken a few ideas from Lord of the Rings and mish-mashed them into this movie. Here we have mysterious robed people controlling and riding atop giant scorpions of their own from little enclosures that reminded me a lot of the Oliphants. And the Kraken itself reminded me a lot of just a super-sized Cave Troll with tentacles. As for the 3-D effect, I cannot comment positive or negative as I wasn't able to see it in a 3-D showing.<br/><br/>Music was nothing to write home about. In fact I'd say it was also forgettable as I can't for the life of me describe the music as I've already forgotten it not 5 hours from seeing the film. And they used pretty much your basic battle scene smashing and clanking noises. So, not great, but not horrible sound effects.<br/><br/>Okay so that's pretty much my in-depth review for this movie, sorry about the spoilers. But I did click the ""contains spoilers"" box, so you were warned. If you may be wondering why I rated this 6/10 instead of a lower score after 6 paragraphs of pointing out its flaws or average nature, it's because I still thought it was a somewhat decent movie. Perhaps not one you need to run out to the theaters to see, but it's good enough to rent. I don't know, maybe I'm being too kind because I'm a little nostalgic due to the fact that I rather enjoyed the 1981 version of ""Clash of the Titans,"" campy nature and all. In fact I prefer the original to this, but that's just my opinion. Feel free to watch both and compare for yourself."
"d_art","5","0","2","2 April 2010"," The new 'Clash of the Titans' makes a poor case for 3-D and remakes.
","Sam Worthington stars as Perseus, the half-human son of Zeus, in this 2010 remake of the 1981 classic, Clash of the Titans. In this version, Zeus is offended by man's lack of deference to them and, along with Hades (Ralph Feinnes), allows the Kraken to attack the city of Argos. The only way to satiate the Kraken's wrath is if princess Andromeda is sacrificed. Perseus and a band of warriors go in search of the head of Medusa which will defeat the Kraken, thus saving Andromeda.<br/><br/>Now, I grew up with the original and have loved its creature-creator Ray Harryhausen's work in the film and other classics he did. If anyone made a remake, the bar had already been set by the original. Well, I was disappointed when the remake's trailer came out (see my article). Sorry to say, I'm now equally disappointed with the remake itself (and I wasn't even expecting much).<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this movie is the 3-D, especially in light of the fact that the 3-D glasses have been the reason we've been paying more for films these days. Many scenes here looked concave (when they shouldn't) or like cardboard cut-outs, much like those children's pop-up books. Some scenes (in the beginning) gave me headaches (a problem I've never had before). A note to future 3-D filmmakers: Don't do short quick-cutsbut if you do, make sure they're less stereoscopic (or just make it 2-D in those scenes)—it's a strain on your eyes. I'm willing to bet that this aspect clouded my enjoyment of this film, which might've been okay otherwise. <br/><br/>Sam Worthington felt miscast as Perseus. A bit on the emotionally stiff side, it didn't help that his character was written like a two-dimensional character. Most of the time, he wasn't given much to do (or love) but fight, and well, his Australian accent just didn't sound Greek enough. The warriors that come along with him are generally cookie cutouts from other films. Liam Neeson does fine in the role of Zeus, even if he didn't get to do much—he manages to sound quite majestic. I loved Ralph Feinnes' version of Hades—it was original and he embodied a more subtle, lonely kind of menace. He was simply the best thing about this film. I'll add that I did like some of the sets and I felt the film's musical score helped give some drama in some scenes.<br/><br/>The story of this new version is loosely based on the original, which was loosely based on Greek mythology. It would've been better if they had went straight to the source, but...oh well (a laziness on the filmmakers' part). Some characters and story arcs have been omitted, familiar elements from other movies have been added in (eg. Gladiator, Hero), and this film is now pretty much an action film. One of the aspects I didn't like (and this isn't a spoiler since she appears only for a bit) is that Andromeda is now no longer Perseus' love interest—which pretty much means we don't care if she gets sacrificed on not (in fact, her sacrifice might've saved a lot of trouble and many dead soldiers). A pity, really, because Perseus is quite two-dimensional enough as it is, and could've used more motivation for his mission. <br/><br/>The creatures in this version are mostly CGI unlike the original's stop-motion, which was designed and hand-animated by auteur Ray Harryhausen. His creatures had personality and looked cool—the original's Medusa scene was freaky and atmospheric, and her beheading scene was gruesomely cool. In this version, many of the creatures felt generic, were overly CG-looking (where's the dirt?), and there was little tension, including the Medusa scene. Pegasus appears only briefly. There's no Bubo (except for two seconds). Kraken has a newer design now and a bigger sense of scale, but he wasn't particularly engaging as a monster, either. <br/><br/>Overall, as a remake, as a 3-D film, and for the possible potential for the material, this film is disappointing. As an action film, it's not bad, even though there's nothing new. There's a mixture of many sources, ""dramatic speeches"" we're familiar with, yet very little of the actual good parts were lifted from the original film. It doesn't help that it shares the same title, which would invite comparisons that would make this film seem much worse than it probably is. Had it been a film based or named after a video game—let's say God of War (Playstation)—I might've liked it more. The presentation is helped even less by the 3-D (which I've heard was added later in filming), which is a shame. I strongly suggest watching it in 2-D. Or, better yet, watch the original. Based on the overall experience, I give it * ½ out of **** stars. <br/><br/>For more of my article updates, you can follow me on Twitter at http://twitter.com/d_art"
"lain_alphard","5","0","3","2 April 2010"," Missing Emotion
","There is something very important missing from this movie; and that is emotion. I don't feel any. In some scene which was supposed to be tragic (... I think), I found myself simply knitting my brow and let out a flat ""Oh"". It had to be one of the worst screenplay ever. Besides the missing emotion, the plot was also ridiculous, and the dialogs were corny. To name the few: <br/><br/>1) When Perseus was taken to the palace by the soldiers. Why did they even do that? They could have simply asked what he was doing. <br/><br/>Soldier: ""Who are you and what were you doing there when we were destroying Zeus's statue and then Hades came to kill us all?""<br/><br/>Perseus: ""I'm Perseus. I'm a fisherman. I was there with my family. Hades saw us, and I guess somehow he felt that he should kill us too. So he killed my family. I'm the only survivor."" <br/><br/>Then, the soldier could release him to wherever he wished to go. But of course, if this were to happen, they would have no reason to drag him to the palace, which was kind of essential to the plot (... I think). <br/><br/>2) Zeus was informed that he had a half human son. The way he responded (or, to be precise, the dialog which was written) felt like he didn't care about it. You cannot help thinking that probably it was part of his daily routine that someone informed him he had a half human son. But then suddenly he sent Perseus a sword and a Pegasus, and appeared in front of him to act like a nice dad. <br/><br/>3) Acrisius disposed of his queen and baby Perseus to the sea. He accepted Hades's offer and attempted to kill adult Perseus. And suddenly, in the verge of death he said to Perseus, ""Don't be like them (gods)""?! <br/><br/>The best thing about this movie was the acting performances. I give special notes to Ralph Fiennes (well, he is always amazing) and Mads Mikkelsen. Liam Neeson's character, unfortunately, had limited range of emotion. And then Sam Worthington. I could not state him as a great actor. Occasionally, his expression was rather stiff. But from all his three movies I have seen, he always manages to give me different impressions; from Marcus Wright (Terminator Salvation), Jake Sully (Avatar) to Perseus. I always enjoy his performance. I don't know what word to describe it. It's just... there's something about him.<br/><br/>The action sequences were great. But still it couldn't cover the bad and no emotion story. If you insist watching this, I suggest you to not think much about it. Just enjoy it for its action and the actors. So when you're leaving the theaters you could just move on, instead of complaining about it all the way home (like I did)."
