","I've been an Andy Kaufman fan for quite a while now. True, I was around six when Andy died. But somehow this strange man was able to affect both my work and outlook. So needless to say I was looking forward to this film. And I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Critics complain that while engaging, this film does not let the viewer in on who exactly Kaufman was. It's simple: there was no real Andy Kaufman. He was socially inept, utterly brilliant, and a strange and distant individual. His sense of humor (if he even had one) was not for everyone to understand. THAT WAS THE POINT. So why should a film spoil the mystery? MAN ON THE MOON was as an homage to Andy, NOT an explanation, and far better than those dull, lifeless documentaries on E! or comedy central in which uninteresting comedians try to explain why Andy was brilliant. It's common knowledge that explaining a joke renders it humorous (a notion that Andy toyed with in his Foreign Man routine, remember?)<br/><br/>True, some facts were altered for dramatic purposes (though the truth is just as interesting), or maybe just necessity, but the base story is still pretty accurate. Some of the more humorous moments in Kaufman's career were not mentioned (i.e. his stints on Johnny Carson and David Letterman, his work with performance artist Laurie Anderson, his street corner preaching). But lets face it, everything couldn't and didn't need to be included. The film is capable of capturing the essence of Kaufman's world. If you want to see everything Kaufman did, find a recording of it and watch that.<br/><br/>Carrey is brilliant as Kaufman. Some call it an imitation, though that seems overly simplified and absurd. That was an imitation along the lines of Geoffrey Rush in SHINE, or Hilary Swank in BOYS DON'T CRY, or Richard Farnsworth in THE STRAIGHT STORY. Sure, Carrey observes and uses the many Kaufman quirks without a fault, but his observation goes far beyond what any other actor seems capable of. Carrey is Andy Kaufman. So many seem unwilling to admit that Carrey can act.<br/><br/>Taken on it's own, MAN ON THE MOON is a magical, funny, and wonderful film. Taken with the rest of the sources currently available on Andy Kaufman, this is just another facet to a complex career and an homage to a brilliant man."
"jaycer1","8","126","149","2 March 2000"," Man on The Moon, indeed.
","""Man on The Moon"", indeed. I remember seeing Andy Kaufman's act on TV as a teenager, and I admit, I wrote him off as another comedian, with an incredibly expressive face and a flair for silliness. Years later, I'm watching him on ""Taxi"" reruns. I admired the easiness where he could go from loving Latka to malicious Vic with ease, and I thought, ""Wow, this guy really loves what he does"". And then I watch ""Man on The Moon"". Reality check.<br/><br/>This picture, I believe, redeems Andy Kaufman. He endured five grueling years in ""Taxi"" just so he could get some laughs out of people. He did wrestling stints just for the heck of it. He came real close of hitting rock bottom just to save himself at the end. He died of cancer at the age of 35, ridiculously young, and even then his own family didn't buy it. He lived misunderstood, and died misunderstood. And years later, he gets a biopic. Just what he deserves. It is sad that many people will know Andy's talent and understand him only after watching this film. But still, let's face it, at the end he did get the last laugh.<br/><br/>The true cornerstone in this film is Jim Carrey. Yes, you've heard endless reviews about him immersing himself into Andy, not just playing him. But this is acting beyond your dreams, trust me. Especially when he plays Andy's foreign character, Carrey lived and breathed Kaufman air. This is the movie where his silly-putty face comes handy, as it seems to help Jim turn into Andy. (If only we could do something about those teeth...) NEWSFLASH FOR THE ACADEMY: Jim Carrey can act!!! I remember Tom Hanks beginning with the same kind of movies that Jim did: loud, colorful, goofy and silly (films like ""Bachelor Party"" come to mind). Then he did ""Big"", then came ""Philadelphia"". When is Carrey's ""Philadelphia"" coming along? I can't wait to see him at the Academy Awards this year.<br/><br/>Man on the moon, indeed."
"I Live 4 Movies","Null","171","205","5 January 2000"," This is a story about a man who lived and died without being understood.
","It is truly sad that we have to wait until a person is dead and gone to give him or her the honor they should have received while alive.  Andy Kaufman was a man of many talents, and I saw him only as this funny little man on a TV show called, ""Taxi"" with a cute accent.  Who could not fall in love with that person he was on ""Taxi""?  He was cute, honest, kind, and funny!  Who knew that while we were all at home laughing, he was crying on the inside because that wasn't who he was, nor wanted to be.  I went to see this movie about a person who was famous for his ""Elvis"" personation, and his little record player, doing the ""Mighty Mouse"" skit on Saturday Night Live, never to forget ""Latka"" on ""Taxi.""  He was a man of many talents, so many that the world never knew about, so many that only Andy knew who he really was.  Jim Carrey allowed us to come into Andy Kaufman's mind, and realize that this grown man lived in another place, another time, an entire other world where Andy was free, and there was peace, and where everyone never grew up, they stayed children playing ""pretend"" forever.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey put himself into this part, he lived this role...  He was Andy Kaufman.  Carrey was able to show me a whole new light on this man I thought I knew.  This funny man who could make you laugh just by walking on stage.  Jim Carrey showed us that who we saw, was not the man we thought we knew.  And it took his death to show the world that Andy Kaufman was in fact a human being, who just needed a hug, and a chance at what he did best.<br/><br/>This sadness me to realize that our joy brought this man pain, who we wanted was not who he wanted to be, and I think everyone should be able to live the dream they choose. I never cry at movies, because I am able to pull myself back and remind myself that it is just a movie, and those are just actors.  Jim was Andy, and what I saw was too true for me to tell myself, ""It's only a movie.""<br/><br/>This is a story about a man who lived and died without being understood.  I cry for the person Carrey brought us into, the life he showed us that was hidden for too long.  No one could have given Andy such a life as Carrey did.  This movie is not a normal movie, it is art in the most beautiful form imaginable.  To sit in a theater and be at aw... for two hours is amazing! I only wish we had known Andy Kaufman when he was truly alive.  Now it is too late, the curtain has gone down..."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","56","64","15 March 2006"," Fascinating Bio Of A Strange, Strange Man
","Biographies of strange people have always fascinated me, and this is no exception. And ""strange"" doesn't really seem to adequately describe real-life comedian Andy Kauffman. He was REALLY different, many times very offensive, sometimes very unfunny....but always extremely interesting and certainly unique.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey shows us once again how comedians can be such good dramatic actors. Carrey is outstanding in this role, and perfect for it. The rest of the cast is good, too, from Danny DeVito to Paul Giamatti to Courtney Love.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning of this movie one sees how original it is, and how original Kaufman was as a comedian. His routines, antics and put-ons are so realistically done that no thinks they are just that. Unfortunately, his ""jokes"" don't always go over so well, aren't appreciated by most audiences and he is not always the most likable entertainer you will ever see. That means - be forewarned - that there are a number of unpleasant scenes in this film. You have to really appreciate Kauffman's absurd humor and to appreciate Carrey's great portrait of this man.<br/><br/>On multiple viewings (I've seen it four times) I liked this film even more than the first time, even though I knew the surprises. I don't know of any comedian - to this day - who deliberately tried to annoy his audience or truly liked it when his audience hated him. I cannot believe he had the nerve to do the things he did. In summary, this is a fascinating biography, to say the least."

","Having liked the contrived Latka Gravas, but never really knowing much more about Andy Kaufman than the Headlines, Man on the Moon offered some incredible depictions of this one of a kind enigma.<br/><br/>I was never a big fan of his off-Taxi antics, but then again, Man on the Moon made it clear that I simply did not understand them.  I'm not any more of a Kaufman fan than I've been, but Man on the Moon has left me with an incredible appreciation for his genius.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey's performance is chilling.  His normal on-screen presence has often made it hard for me to see him as the characters he's played.  This time, I forgot that I was watching an actor portraying Andy Kaufman.  It was frighteningly good.  The entire supporting cast was just as stellar.<br/><br/>Though interesting throughout, mostly because it explained so much that I never knew about events that were so highly publicized, Man on the Moon's amazing insight into the ""why"" behind the ""what"" of his antics completely left out the ""why"" behind the ""what"" of the person.  I now know a lot about what he did, but I still know very little about who he was.<br/><br/>If the creators' intent was to let the world get to know Andy Kaufman the man, then I think the film missed its mark.  However, that has nothing to do with the fact that it was an outstanding film in every way.  It would be as unfair to detract from the film for this as it would be to call a hammer useless because it doesn't drill holes.  A film isn't about what I expect, it's about what it is.  In this case, it's astounding from beginning to end."
"williamdejager","10","41","47","27 December 2005"," Just great
","Jim Carrey delivers on of the greatest acting achievements of the nineties in this stunning biopic about the legendary comedian Andy Kaufman (the man on the moon, according to REM). For me as a European citizen, Andy Kaufman is a complete mystery. I've never seen any of his performances in Saturday Night Live nor have I ever seen any of his live shows. After seeing the movie five times, I as a Dutch not-knowing citizen who had never heard of Kaufman before, can make an image of the man and his brilliance. This is all thanks to Milos Forman and a stunning Jim Carrey, who really becomes Andy Kaufman. According to me, this movie is where Jim Carrey proves that he is just more than a funny guy, and after seeing him in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) Carrey has really proved that he is in fact a character actor."
"mjlavoie","10","74","96","22 December 1999"," A stunning film, with an equally stunning performance by Jim Carrey
","I saw a special sneak preview of ""Man on the Moon"" last week in Boston. Quite simply, the film is magnificent, and truly provides the audience with a glimpse into the genius of Andy Kaufman.  There are moments of true hilarity, and moments that will break your heart.<br/><br/>Of course, this film would be nothing without the inspired performance by Jim Carrey.  Within the first moments of the film, you completely forget that it is Jim Carrey on screen.  Rarely have I seen an actor truly transform into the persona that he is portraying.  Jim Carrey was Andy Kaufman.<br/><br/>At the very least, Mr. Carrey is deserving of every honor that is given in acting. No other performance this year comes even close to this.  Without question, this is a film for the ages, and gives everyone a look into the mind of a genius."
"Buddy-51","Null","74","98","10 June 2000"," great Carrey performance in an uneven film
","Your fondness for `Man on the Moon' may well be predicated on your feelings for Andy Kaufman, both as comic performer and offstage human being.  And, as this film suggests, there was not, ultimately, a very wide gap between the two.  Indeed, the point of the film seems to be that, with Kaufman, the many characters he showed to us on stage and T.V. pretty much reflected the man who existed in real life.<br/><br/>This may be both the strength and the weakness of the movie itself. Kaufman's purported genius has always eluded me.  Ostensibly, it lay, I imagine, in his metaphorically giving the finger to his audience while entertaining them at the same time.  That audience, ultimately discovering that it was the butt of the joke, then was able to go a step further and become a willing part of the act, allowing them all to feel superior to the uninitiated masses still deluded enough to be on the outside looking in. Kaufman's act became, then, a kind of exclusive comic club, a collective act of defiance against the social norms of theatrical convention and good taste.  Thus, we see him in the film reading the entire novel `The Great Gatsby' verbatim to a stunned and ultimately hostile college audience; we see him wrestling women while spouting inflammatory chauvinistic rhetoric and deliberately muffing his lines on live national television in a brilliant blurring of the line between reality and theatricality.  The problem, however, is that iconoclasm has never been a source of humor in itself, and much of Kaufman's act and persona came across as heavy-handed, smug and self-conscious, particularly in his grating Lithuanian `Taxi' character.  In short, Kaufman always seemed too full of himself and so dazzled by his own cleverness and cuteness to ever be truly funny.  It was like he was always pointing his thumbs back at himself saying, `Look how funny I am.'  Such unctiousness inspires us not to laugh.<br/><br/>The film itself is an uneven study of the man.   The first half is particularly shaky.  After a clever 5-minute view of Kaufman as a performance-obsessed child, we move to his young adulthood where we see him bombing in a local nightclub with an act so aggressively unfunny that we cannot even imagine that it could possibly be real.  Then, virtually in the blink of an eye, he is discovered by his future manager, again, in a scene of staggering incredibility, in which Kaufman somehow manages to reduce his audience to helpless laughter with material that couldn't possibly evoke even titters let alone room-shaking guffaws.  Before we know it, Kaufman has somehow landed a hosting job on `Saturday Night Live' (yet another bad performance) and has become so much in demand that he not only secures a role in a new sitcom, `Taxi,' but is allowed to make all sorts of demands from the producers in exchange for his services.  The chronicle of his meteoric rise to fame simply lacks the detail necessary to make it credible.<br/><br/>
The movie finds surer footing as it moves ahead in time.  If anything, the gross lack of humor of many of his performances recreated for the film simply underlines the overrated comic gifts of Kaufman himself.  Although the writers, Scott Alexander and Larry Karasczewski, and director, Milos Forman, convey an obvious attitude of affection towards Kaufman, they do not shy away from portraying the self-centered petulance that governed many of his actions both in his professional and personal life.   The most poignant moments come when he discovers he has lung cancer, yet cannot convince many of the people who are closest to him that he is really sick, so skeptical has his life of duplicity made them.  Though Courtney Love is very good indeed as the woman who learns to love Kauffman, the portrayals of her character and their relationship as a whole remain sketchy and superficial throughout.  We never really sense much chemistry between them since they never seem to experience much in the way of revelatory conflict.  She simply loves him unconditionally, and she is given little to do but beam pleasantly at him or look perpetually concerned for his health and well being.<br/><br/>
`Man on the Moon's one element of undeniable brilliance lies in the triumphant performance of Jim Carrey in the starring role.  In physical appearance, in mannerisms, in comic stylings, he, quite literally, becomes Andy Kaufman!  Whether on stage or behind-the-scenes, Carrey never hits a false note, displaying his uncanny ability to bring out the humanity that might easily have been lost in a portrayal of a very eccentric comic artist. Indeed, Carrey lends some much needed depth to a screenplay that, in its bare-bone plotting, often seems undernourished and underfed.  `Man on the Moon' becomes, ultimately then, more compelling as a steppingstone in Carrey's development as an artist than as an elegy for the artist who once was."
"tdunlevy","10","49","63","16 November 1999"," Man on the Moon is a strong film with an excellent performance by Jim Carrey
","Man on the Moon is one of the most heart-felt endeavors I've ever seen on film.  With each frame, you can feel how much the project means personally to all involved, especially to star Jim Carrey and producer Bob Zmuda. Although personal adoration for the subject of one's movie does not always translate into a film that audience members will identify with, Man on the Moon succeeds brilliantly.  Between Milos Forman's unique directing style, the actors' performances, and Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski's writing, the film is able to simultaneously make you a member in one of Andy Kaufman's audiences, experiencing both joy and frustration at his antics, and a close friend who sees, or thinks they see, the Andy Kaufman behind the masks. Just as Karaszewski and Alexander did with the Ed Wood or Larry Flint biopicks, they challenge our concept of what it means to be successful by giving dignity to to the seeming misfits of our society.  However, a biopick like Man on the Moon succeeds or fails mainly on the grounds of the lead performance.  Jim Carrey proved his dramatic talent last year with a performance in The Truman Show that should have translated into an Oscar, and this year he again gives what will likely be the best performance of the year.  Carrey approaches the role of Kaufman with a level of professionalism and enthusiasm far greater than that displayed by many of today's acclaimed actors.  Carrey adopts Kaufman's mannerisms flawlessly and becomes Kaufman so convincingly that you forget Carrey is acting.  The film's other stars, in particular Paul Giamatti, Courtney Love, and Danny DeVito, all turn in excellent performances as well.<br/><br/>Man on the Moon is both inspiring and thought provoking - a must see."
"Xophianic","6","10","13","2 February 2000"," Fair movie, but poor biography
","I watched this movie already knowing quite a bit about Andy Kaufman and the things that he has done in the past. I was hoping to learn more about him after watching this movie. Unfortunately, I knew more about Andy Kaufman than this movie told me. As a biography, this movie wasn't so great. It didn't go into much about Andy's childhood or what he was like outside of work. Rather, it showed most of the skits and performances that Andy has done throughout his life, most of which you could learn about on MTV specials.<br/><br/>The acting was well done, especially by the star Jim Carrey. Carrey played Andy Kaufman. This was by far the best acting job I have ever seen Jim Carrey perform. One could argue he did a better job at Andy Kaufman's skits than Andy Kaufman himself did.<br/><br/>The plot and storyline, if not looking from a biography point of view, was very interesting. The best thing, in my opinion about the movie is learning more about how Andy Kaufman met his girlfriend, the scenes from Taxi and his wrestling career. I didn't care much for Tony Clifton but, as the movie states, he is a different person from Andy Kaufman all together.<br/><br/>I'd say this movie is worth a rent, don't go to theaters to see it. Jim Carrey deserves an Academy Award for his performance."
"clawpack","1","62","114","10 December 2004"," Why?
","For all the attention he got, Andy Kaufman didn't leave much of a comic legacy. Mostly just his part on Taxi, where his Latka character could be amusing in small doses. So why make a movie about a secondary sitcom actor? Unfortunately, you'll still be asking that question when the movie is over.<br/><br/>What Kaufman was famous for is stunts involving feigned anger or outright verbal abuse that were designed to entertain only himself. People who watched him hoping to see something funny often just saw shouting and threats. He was called a comedian but he preferred being unfunny.<br/><br/>Man on the Moon carefully recreates these episodes. Makeup artists make Jim Carrey look exactly like Kaufman, and Carrey meticulously reenacts all of Kaufman's mannerisms. The producers even cast many of Kaufman's actual accomplices, like wrestler Jerry Lawler. The problem is, when you carefully, painstakingly recreate an unfunny event, you get a careful, painstaking unfunny event. This isn't a failed movie in the sense it doesn't achieve its goal; it's a failed movie in the sense that the goal was never worth achieving."

","Man on the Moon is a terrific film with a very well developed plot and a spectacular cast. It is a truly interesting, unconventional biography film that follows the life of complicated, eccentric comedian Andy Kaufman. It does not hold back on showcasing who this man truly was as both a performer and in real life, the film matches up the tone to who he was as a person in a way that I think would have made Kaufman proud had he been around to see this. <br/><br/>The only real gripe I had with this movie is that it did not really manage to pull me in at the more emotional moments because of how absurd and over the top it is, for the most part. When they tried to showcase real humanity for Kaufman, it just felt a little too forced and on the nose. <br/><br/>The performances are magnificent, Danny DeVito, Paul Giamatti and Courtney Love all truly embody their characters in larger than life performances, but it is without a doubt the remarkable Carrey who really takes us away from beginning to end. He is mesmerizing as Kaufman, funny and emphatic, you will forget you are watching him and just get absorbed in to his portrayal. <br/><br/>A great watch. Funny and fascinating, Man on the Moon is a truly unique movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good biography or comedy. <br/><br/>Follows the life and career of eccentric comedian Andy Kaufman. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Jim Carrey"
"neil-476","6","3","3","19 April 2011"," Carrey - great. Kaufman - ??
","Let me say at the start that Jim Carrey's portrait of Andy Kaufman is quite brilliant.<br/><br/>Let us now turn to Kaufman, best known for his amusing portrayal of Latka Gravas in the sitcom Taxi.<br/><br/>Kaufman also did other stuff. He called it comedy. My guess is that very, very few other people would call it comedy since it didn't involve laughter, amusement, or any of the other things people associate with comedy. It was equivalent to putting bits of glass, metal, wood and similar on a plate, and saying you're a chef. Kaufman's material was aggressive, in your face, provocative, and not even slightly funny.<br/><br/>This deeply unfunny and unpleasant man (if Carrey's portrayal of the rest of him is as accurate as the Taxi part) had nothing worthwhile to say, and one can only speculate as to why he chose to say it in that fashion.<br/><br/>The film involves spending a lot of time in the company of someone whose company is not pleasant. So, while granting Carrey the kudos he merits, I have to say that I did not like this film."
"lasttimeisaw","8","5","6","26 January 2015"," Carrey's best performance so far
","I enter the film while being literally oblivious of who is Andy Kaufman, as far as I know, the film is mostly famed because it hitherto has been Jim Carrey's most Oscar-worthy performance, yet being blatantly snubbed again after his drama venture in Peter Weir's THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998, 8/10). <br/><br/>So in my case, the film is a dedicative portrait of an eccentric entertainer whose ideology of performance is all about entertaining himself and treat his audience as a receptacle of his sensational idiosyncrasy and excruciatingly manipulative fabrications disguised as parody or mockery. Yet, during his short life-span (Andy passed away in 1984 at the age of 35), this methodology makes him a unique figure in the canvas of American comedians (although he would never condescend himself as a ""comedian"").<br/><br/>Apart from his best remembered role as Latka Gravas in ABC's sitcom TAXI (1978-1982), Andy's strikingly unorthodox gambits include the Foreign Man persona, Might Mouse lip- syncing, and singularly his alter-ego Tony Clifton, an audience-abusing lounge singer with off-key boorishness, all farcically re-enacted by the-one-and-only Jim Carrey, more hinges on visual gags than fusillading well-conceived punchlines, he vigorously pulls off a studious impersonation rather than reveling in his usual elastic facial stunts, in a way, Andy is much more closer to a performance artist than a funny man, staging appealing sensations to exploiting genuine emotions from audience, his motto is to always stay distinctively in advance of your audience, instead of pandering, he surprises them, especially in a provocative way (e.g. the inter-sexual wrestling sham), Carrey nails his psychology to the marrow in his transcendent effort. The rest of the cast is playing it safe around him mainly because most of the prototypes are still alive (some of them make cameos and others are simply playing themselves in a not-so-faraway time-frame), DeVito and Giamatti take a lion's share of their screen-time in comically constructing a layer of authenticity as Andy's agent George Shapiro and his creative parter Bob Zmuda, whereas Courtney Love is Lynne, Andy's romantic interest, instead, submerges herself as a subtler spectator to offer gravitas when the film needs in the second half as the ultimate death is looming large. <br/><br/>Surely it is also a refreshing maneuver to start the film with sheer Black & White sequences of Andy breaking-the-four-wall and kidding about this picture with his comical bent. The two-times Academy winning director Milo Forman steadily segues one skit after another, confidently concocts a mesmerizing montages of Andy's career highlights, and maintains an enigmatic aura of Andy's personal facet, in the final scenes, when an Andy impostor performs Gloria Gaynor's I WILL SURVIVE as Tony Clifton, at one time, we are all being tricked into believe the real Andy is still breathing the same air of ours, then the frame majestically pans through Lynne, George and Bob, suggests otherwise without unmasking the subject, such a class act ending. <br/><br/>Despite that some of the farces are too passé to appreciate nowadays, the film doesn't feel far-fetched in its nitty-gritty and it does arouse some stinging thoughts about how we perceive to be entertained from the showbiz, if only Andy could have lived longer to stand the test of time, is he a true legend in modulating the general taste of the mass or a shooting-star cannot prevent his ego from wearing out his routine antics."
"maxcellus46","7","8","11","3 November 2006"," This is the story of a man who lived and died...without really being funny.
","I gave this film a rather high rating if for no other reason except that it's an excellent story about someone who was apparently totally psychotic and self absorbed. Andy Kaufmann was someone who should have been pitied and institutionalized in order to seek a cure. It's almost like the story of the Elephant Man who was put on exhibit in sideshows so people could gawk at his gross deformity. Same is the case with Kaufmann. His legacy is that of being a mildly humorous ""one joke"" comic with a very obvious dead end in show business. He's not the first though. There have been many who thought what they did was hysterically funny and clever but eventually it was proved to be nothing at all. Joe Penner in the 1930's-40's with his ""Wanna buy a duck?"" played itself out very fast and he ended in total oblivion. Or another was Parkyakarkus with his ""How DO you do!"" These people and Kaufmann have proved continually that they are of limited intellect and creativity when it comes to attempting to being funny. Lionel Barrymore was rumored to have said on his death bed, ""There's only one thing harder to do than die, and that's comedy."" As for this mish mash of a story about a mish mash of a ""comdeian"", it's only entertaining to the morbid curious and clinical minded. Otherwise it's a definite ""pass""."
"Linda-22","1","28","51","25 December 1999"," What an unpleasant way to spend an evening!!!!
","About the only positive thing I can say is that Andy Kaufman would have loved this.  Apparently he enjoyed producing a negative effect in his audience far more than he cared about entertaining them, so this certainly is the film he would have wanted to make.  Mr. Kaufman was capable of being incredibly funny and incredibly unfunny, but he was incapable of telling the difference."

Man on the moon is definitely a drama and you need to search very hard to find any comedy in it.<br/><br/>However from what i understood, Andy Kaufman wasn't very funny himself. Which does mean that it is, at the very least a realistic movie.

Unfortunately, it wasn't particularly funny, nor was it particularly introspective or touching.  The cast was good - although Courtney Love's character was never developed to any degree.  Devito was impressive as usual.<br/><br/>As for Jim Carey - he had Kaufman's mannerisms down pat.  But whenever they went for a closeup, I never thought I was watching Andy Kaufman... Carey's face is just too well known - especially during the ""Mighty Mouse"" bit... very Carey-esque expressions.  Part of what made Andy so recognizable was his cherubic quality - something Carey does not have.  Tony Clifton was dead on, however... It wouldn't surprise me if that was really the actual Bob Zmuda playing that part.<br/><br/>Carey is a good actor, no doubt.  But nothing he has done (including The Truman Show and Man on the Moon) has justified his $20 million paycheck, IMO.<br/><br/>Overall a good movie, but falls flat on too many fronts.

","The early depth of character and inventive fun that this film promised in the opening scenes faded away only a third into the picture as Jim Carrey's own alter-ego tossed aside Andy Kaufman's so it looked like a Carrey biopic on Viagra, with lacklustre and bewildered support  from the ensemble actors and the badly cast Danny de Vito. As in life, compulsive practical jokers become incredibly irritating and tiresome, and the joke wore thin way before the end. A film made by Americans for Americans  most of whom seem oblivious to the shortcomings of their own over-rated and over-paid celebrities and the tackiness of most of their tv shows, which have sadly become a universal dumping ground for the rest of us."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","4","5","16 January 2007"," Entertaining, though shallow.
","This is a perfectly good and entertaining movie to watch. However as a biopic the movie remains pretty shallow and we never fully get to understand the character, though that also would had been virtually impossible, considering who's the subject of the movie.<br/><br/>Not really Milos Forman's fault that the movie remains too shallow, since he's obviously capable of making an unsympathetic and unpredictable character accessible and likable (watch ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"", for instance). This movie doesn't ever really gives us an impression of the real Andy Kaufman. It's hard to tell in the movie when he's trying to be serious and when he's joking around. This is also due to Jim Carrey's acting. If you look at footage of the real Andy Kaufman you'll notice how incredibly natural and subtle his humor is He's not ever acting, he's just natural. Jim Carrey, no matter how great he is in his role, is clearly acting and playing a character. Guess that Andy Kaufman just wasn't the right subject to pick. He was too complex and unpredictable to make a fascinating and engaging biopic about. It has always been hard to define Andy Kaufman, since he was not your ordinary comedian and never referred to himself as being one.Having watched this movie, I still have no idea of who the real Kaufman was and what drove him and went on in his head. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Carrey is great, I mean he gets really absorbed by its character but he just isn't Kaufman. It perhaps makes his performance- as the entire movie a bit overrated.<br/><br/>It's fun to see that lots of persons involving Kaufman's life and career play themselves in this movie such as most of the ""Taxi"" cast, Jerry Lawler and David Letterman. But the movie also features some other great 'real' actors such as Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli, Paul Giamatti and Courtney Love.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on Kaufman's entire career as a comedian (and wrestler!). Obviously a lot to put in a merely 2 hour movie but the movie manages very well to put the interesting and groundbreaking legendary things of his career into the movie. It also makes sure that the movie always keeps pace, though its not always for the best of the movie. Basically in a 15 minutes time-span we go from the beginning illness, to Kaufman's Carnegie Hall performance and his death. The movie doesn't leave much room for thinking. Perhaps also a reason why the movie remains pretty shallow, though the movie still has some good emotions in it.<br/><br/>So the story-flow is a little offbeat at times and things happen to fast and are forgotten in the next sequence again. It's perhaps the only flow in the otherwise great directing (though the audience reaction in the movie were also distractingly overdone at times with lots of over-the-top laughing and standing ovations, as if Kaufman was some sort of God to everyone.) and entertainingly written story.<br/><br/>It's definitely true that the movie focuses on the more merry aspects of Kaufman's life. For instance the birth of his give up for adoption child with his only 17 year old girlfriend is not mentioned at all in any form in the movie. The movie focuses on the humorous side of life and is made in the same style as Kaufman's kind of humor. Guess that the movie is pretty much like Kaufman himself would had liked it <br/><br/>But even if you weren't a Kaufman fan, I think this movie would be still one worth watching. It's greatly directed with good productions values and a solid cast.<br/><br/>More entertaining than engaging or interesting really.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","I saw Andy Kaufman open for a long forgotten rock band in the late 70's and he was absolutely horrible. Of course 15,000 heavy metal fans didn't wan't to sit through an opening act let alone a comedian but this guy was awful and was booed for thirty minutes. I admire Foreman and Carrey so I thought I'd learn something in ""Man on the Moon"", find out why some people thought Kaufman a genius. I learned nothing from this film - especially why all these talented people found this story worth telling. Celebrities have always been quick to drop the label ""genius"" on each other rendering the word meaningless in America today. I'm so sick of hearing what a ""genius"" Kaufman was and how people like me just didn't ""get"" him, tired of hearing how he ""bombed on purpose"". Kaufman died too early and that is the only compelling part of his story. He wasn't a genius. He wasn't funny. This movie didn't convince me nor explain the reverence. 20 years later I feel exactly the same way I did at that concert - ""get off the stage."""

","...in other words, everything a biopic about Andy Kaufman should be.<br/><br/>While it has plenty of faults, Milos Forman's heartbreaking and humorous tribute to the great comedic performance artist Andy Kaufman is simply astounding. Jim Carrey's performance is no less than astonishing and may be the best among his widely varying comedy career. He impersonates Kaufman in a way that captures both the legend and fantasy of Kaufman's character, as well as the soul that hid behind the act. The rest of the cast is jam packed with recognizable faces and they all perform splendidly.<br/><br/>As a fan of the pioneering Kaufman, I found this film to be thoroughly entertaining, and those who have never heard of the man will likely also find much to be astonished here. The film is not flawless, and some sequences were over exaggerated pointlessly, although the film itself is quite faithful to the true story."

","Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey) is a misunderstood child and a misunderstood comic. He loves to play WITH the audience more than play TO the audience. Talent agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito) signs him up despite thinking that he's a foreigner who speaks broken English. He gets the role on Taxi and develops the character Tony Clifton with his writing partner Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti). Andy starts wrestling women planting actresses like Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love) who ends up being his girlfriend. He gets into a fight with professional wrestler Jerry Lawler. Then he gets cancer but people aren't sure if it's actually a joke.<br/><br/>Firstly, there is a surreal quality to this starting with Andy Kaufman at the beginning of the movie stating that things have been changed up. The other thing is that so many people are playing themselves in the movie. It's like an alternate universe. There's also the fact that Jim Carrey does a lot of crazy stuff on stage. Carrey puts it all on the line in this movie and it shows. I wouldn't put too much stock in the accuracy debate. I don't usual care that much about that and this movie can be seen as another Tony Clifton production anyways."

Given his comedy style on the show, I would never have guessed what a different approach he took to most of his comedy in real life.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey, a fan of Andy Kaufman, is great as Andy, and Andy's alternate persona Tony Clifton. The script is written by Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski, writers of biopics Ed Wood and The People vs. Larry Flynt. Like in Ed Wood, humor is used as often as possible as the story moves forward. Danny DeVito (Kaufman's co-star on Taxi) plays Kaufman's manager George Shapiro, and also produced the film. With the exception of Tony Danza (who had a rather strong dislike for Kaufman and felt it would be disingenuous to appear in a film about him), all of the cast members of Taxi make appearances.<br/><br/>This is far from a perfectly factual movie, many events and circumstances portrayed in the film are highly fictionalized and sometimes appear out of order. But while the events portrayed aren't entirely accurate, they aren't meant to be, and the film remains quite true to the spirit of Andy Kaufman.<br/><br/>I recommend this film quite a bit, for both fans and non-fans of Andy Kaufman."

","I first saw this movie when it came out, and have just watched it again. Admittedly, I marveled at the unique comic genius of Andy Kaufman, and sadly we have seen no one like him since he left us. Andy was the absolute king of the put-on -- no entertainer has has ever done it better. And this movie says it in the comedic, sometimes raw and unnerving, manner in which it took place and as performed. Jim Carrey, an actor who delivers inconsistent performances, is simply outstanding in his dead-on portrayal of the physical and mental comedic genius Andy Kaufman. This movie beautifully exemplifies the two classic masks of good drama, which are Comedy and Tragedy. The fact that many actors in this movie depiction actually did know and work with Andy is also a testament to a unique comedic talent who left us too early. And thanks do Danny DeVito who worked with and knew Andy, for not only appearing in the movie but producing it as well. For those who never had the experience of seeing, when it was first aired, or who didn't appreciate his SNL performance of 'Mighty Mouse', for those who never saw or who didn't appreciate Kaufman's Elvis, for those who never saw or didn't appreciate Kaufman and Michael Richards on ""Fridays"", and for those who cannot appreciate the show biz put-on that professional wresting is, you probably need not see this movie as you may never be able to comprehend all of it or appreciate it."

","""They say, 'Oh wow, Andy Kaufman, he's a really funny guy.' But I'm not trying to be funny. I just want to play with their heads.""<br/><br/> - Andy Kaufman<br/><br/> Was Andy Kaufman a brilliant comedian far ahead of his time, or a disgraceful, unfunny, mentally unbalanced individual who had a sick desire to confuse people? This is the topic at the center of Milos Forman's screen biopic, but the movie never really reveals anything remotely interesting - or enlightening - about Kaufman. He's more of an implacable human being after the movie ends than he was before.<br/><br/> To be fair, Carrey does a commendable job of portraying Kaufman, the man who was present for the launch of ""SNL"" on October 11th, 1975, and was later voted off of the show by callers, after producer Lorne Michaels asked his audience to decide for themselves. What's most bizarre about Kaufman, however, is that he admittedly never actually revealed himself to anyone. He was never in touch with himself, and relied on multiple personalities for amusement. Back then, he was regarded as a different sort of comedic talent, but to be blunt and honest, as much as I love the television show ""Taxi,"" I think Kaufman really did have mental problems. As a child he used to stare at his wall, pretend there were cameras and put on shows.<br/><br/> This is where the film opens. Then it skips ahead. If there's one movie that needs more flashbacks of childhood, it is ""Man on the Moon,"" a film that should have revealed Kaufman's past, rather then present us with a fairly mediocre timeline of events that we're already aware of. What has never been explained is Kaufman's past. Which leads to a startling conclusion, and one that the filmmakers may have stumbled upon (and which may explain the reason some twenty years are cut out of the movie): Kaufman has no past.<br/><br/> He's a man who left behind a legacy of mysteries and loose ends that were never settled. After the release of ""Man on the Moon,"" there were rumors that perhaps Jim Carrey really was Kaufman, who he bore a startling resemblance to, and one that could have easily been altered with facial surgery. Yes, Carrey was born on the same day as Kaufman (January 17th), was almost as tall, had the same distinctive features, same lanky body, same sort of wacky, bizarre humor. And many of Carrey's films contain references to things Kaufman loved. But I'm not sure I buy this. The real question:<br/><br/> Did Kaufman stage his death?<br/><br/> To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if he did. It sounds far-fetched, but everything Kaufman did was a hoax, from the David Letterman sequence to the ""Fridays"" disaster to showing up on the set of ""Taxi"" dressed as Tony Clifton.<br/><br/> Lots of people mimic his style, but after a while they usually let up and break character. Andy never broke character. When he was in character, he was in character, and that leads to another interesting possibility that has been oft discussed by his fans: Was Andy Kaufman actually a valid persona? Where did this man come from? One day he was a nobody, then he was famous, then soon infamous for his awkward behavior on and off the screen. (During filming of ""Taxi,"" his manager found him in the kitchen of a restaurant, cooking fries for people and telling them he was not Andy Kaufman, despite the similarities he was always noted for.) Andy unarguably received pleasure from confusing his audience. He fit into personalities and never let go. Is it too unreasonable to suggest that Andy Kaufman was another persona he created one day? And one he eventually grew tired of and abandoned like he had with so many others? If so, then why would he do this to his family? Why would he not resurface after his adopted daughter traced her origins to Kaufman?<br/><br/> We don't know much about Kaufman's parents, and he introduced them only once on David Letterman's shows. To be fair, they could have been paid to pose as parents, and this is exactly the type of bizarre stunt that Kaufman would be capable of pulling. Also, as a child, he reportedly liked to run away and hide and scare his parents into thinking he had gone missing.<br/><br/> ""Man on the Moon"" tackles none of these subjects. It's a straightforward timeline of Kaufman's life, sloppily constructed and quite poorly directed on the whole. This could have been a controversial, epic biopic, and it also could have been a lot funnier and insightful. Even if Forman and Carrey decided not to delve into any ""conspiracy theories"" regarding Kaufman and his origins and his ""death,"" it still would have been nice to explore his background more.<br/><br/>Was Kaufman an utter nut case or an under appreciated comic genius? We'll probably never truly know. And that's the primary fault of ""Man on the Moon."" By the end of the movie, Kaufman is completely unexplained. We're not able to truly sympathize with him, because the movie portrays him a freak of nature. Kaufman told the press once that he never cracked a single joke. It's true. So was he funny or just a sick, demented human being who liked pulling tricks on people, and possibly pulled a final one before disappearing into the middle of nowhere, leaving behind little traces? ""Man on the Moon"" doesn't know, and it doesn't try to offer any clearer resolutions. It's about as muddled and confusing as Kaufman was. And like Kaufman, it doesn't tell us a single joke, which is really a shame.<br/><br/> 2.5/5 stars."

","The first time I saw Andy Kaufman was on the Saturday Night Live 15th anniversary show.  In the clips from the first 5 years, they showed a few seconds of his Mighty Mouse thing, and I found it strange and funny.  Since then, I've seen him on old Saturday Night Live shows, and comedian specials, and seen a few old Taxi episodes(though I was never a big fan), and found him to be quite strange, but also quite funny.  So I was really looking forward to this movie, and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>I agree with the person who said to try and find out the mystery behind Kaufman would have undoubtedly gotten it wrong.  Instead, we get a look inside his art, and if you don't find him funny, you're not going to like this movie(and I have no problem with those who don't like the movie for that reason).  Viewers may also be thrown by the fact that the movie, as demonstrated in the opening scene, is a series of ""is that real or just a put on?"" episodes(in a way, this reminded me of PENN AND TELLER GET KILLED, which is similarly constructed).  But it stays true to Kaufman and his performance style, and I found it offbeat and, yes, funny.<br/><br/>I do have a couple of minor quibbles.  I don't know the entire story, but there are a couple of facts fudged.  For example, the way Kaufman left Saturday Night Live is not quite true(if they had done the true story, it would have been even funnier).  Also, Courtney Love is not as good as she was in THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT, though she does have moments.  But, as I said, those are minor quibbles.  Particularly high among the virtues is, of course, Jim Carrey as Kaufman.  It took me awhile for him to ""disappear"" into the role, as so many people said he did, but he is amazing and constantly keeps us off balance and laughing, as does the entire movie."

SO WHY IN THE NAME OF ANYTHING HOLY WOULD THEY WANT TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT HIM????????!!!!!!!!! Apparently, they thought that everyone on earth really admired the guy.

","I have always appreciated Andy Kaufman for his dadaisticly irrational performances and that's why I had been looking forward to this movie long time before its release. I will give two main reasons why it is desirable to see it.<br/><br/>First is very simple - life of Andy Kaufman is full of absurdity (which was exactly what he wanted). In a totally serious way he shows us that it is not always needed to take life too seriously. His shows still make people think about the border between irrationality, imagination and reality and also about what makes the joke to be funny.<br/><br/>Second main reason is Jim Carrey. I must admit I was shocked when I first heard about Jim Carrey being the one to represent Andy Kaufman. I knew Carrey was a great comedian acceptable for movies such as Ace Ventura, but how could he cope with role of man, whose performances stunned many people all over the world, but who never considered himself to be a real comedian. Would he not turn it into another crazy comedy? Fortunatly he did not, contrary - his performance was absolutely brilliant and in cooperation with the director Milos Forman he created deathly authentic picture of Andy Kaufman. I know there has been written countless number of pages about Jim Carreys act, but in this case it is always worth it to emphasize Carrey's superiority - despite my initiatory doubts it might have been the best performance I have ever seen. Not getting an Oscar for an actor in main role is totally beyond all understanding for me. Some might find it as an audacious statement, but in comparison with actors in different biographical movies as ""Ray"" or ""Walk the line"" (Jamie Foxx and Joaquin Phoenix) Carrey's part was much more complicated and the result was even better than in two above mentioned Oscar awarded movies (however i do not mean to down performances of Foxx or Phoenix).<br/><br/>To me this movie is a real masterpiece..."
"policy134","2","4","7","24 March 2005"," Carrey in his best role but what was the point?
","Jim Carrey can be the most funny person alive and the most scary. His high-octane performances are something that you just can't ignore and I'm talking of both his comic and dramatic performances.<br/><br/>Like so many have commented on here is that Carrey is Andy Kauffman here, not just playing him. If you read my commentary on Taxi I was one of the people who didn't get Kauffman at all. He took risks of course but if you are to judge him from this movie you would come up empty. I know, that some would say that was the whole point but if you just wanna make a superficial examination of a person's character then you'd better make it a lot more entertaining than this. His start at the comedy clubs as it is shown here are highly suspect of course but why would any agent sign him on the spot without much to go on. His act can only be described as juvenile and maybe I'm wrong but agents are not that undiscriminating. There had to be more to him.<br/><br/>The decision to play out Kauffman's acts as simply elaborate hoaxes may be brilliant but it gets rather tiresome after you have seen it two or three times and it is done to death in this movie. It's not that I mind being tricked but it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth to see that Kauffman cared more about himself than his audience and we are supposed to think that he was great because of that. The Bob Zmuda character is also a big problem. Many times I think of him as just a figment of the imagination, much like Kauffman's alter ego Tony Clifton. He doesn't seem to be that important to Kauffman, neither as a friend or a co-conspirator. Then we have Courtney Love's character, Lynne. Total disappointment after her performance in The people vs. Larry Flynt. Maybe she just did this as a favor to Forman.<br/><br/>The death of Andy Kauffman was the most realistic part of the movie and the rather touching scene between De Vito and Carrey at the end is Oscar material. But doing a series of skits that are supposed to be a biography of any man's life is not what I would have preferred to see. Maybe someday they will finally give us a worthy biopic of say another actor like Bogart but even a mediocre one would be much more entertaining than this one."

","This uninspired biopic of the infamous oddball performance artist/comedian Andy Kaufman misfires on almost all counts. To begin with, there are millions of people who have never heard of Andy Kaufman, so there's a entire demographic that would need to be taught about the late auteur. Right away, when you have to convince a large portion of the population that the subject of your movie is worthy of your cinematic paintbrush, you're in a hole that most moviemakers can't dig out of. <br/><br/>But that's only the people who weren't aware of Andy Kaufman when he was alive. What about those of us who were? Those who closely followed the television series Taxi remember the character of Latka Gravas, but how many people paid any attention to Kaufman's offscreen antics? Those who did notice generally seem to fall into one of two categories: those who loved Kaufman and believed him to be an unsung comic genius, and those who despised him and saw him as a relentlessly weird pathological  liar.<br/><br/>
Those who loved Kaufman and his work might find something of value in this film. As a straight biography, there are inspired, original moments - such as the beginning acting as an end, or some of Kaufman's bits (including the legendary Saturday Night Live ""Mighty Mouse"" skit) - but most of the movie is rather pedestrian, given that it's directed by Milos Forman, who brought One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to the big screen. Our Hero struggles against People Who Don't Understand Him (parents, audiences) until he is saved by a Nice Agent With a Heart of Gold who shows him the way to superstardom. Ho-hum. The viewer, instead of being enticed by this purportedly unique, larger-than-life character, finds that it's really just an exercise in somnolence. The script is smarmy and self-satisfied, as if it's telling it's damn funny and if you want to be hip, you'll think it's funny, too.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey, as Andy, turns in some remarkable work, but thanks to a rather standard script doesn't really get to show off his acting chops (which we saw in The Truman Show). As Andy, Carrey turns in a good impersonation, but not a full characterization. Courtney Love as Andy's girlfriend Lynne isn't exceptional, but the character lacks depth. She's no more or less important than Adrian from Rocky, cheering her man on through thick and thin, leaving him at one point but - surprise - coming back to him when he needs her the most. Danny DeVito is his agent, George, and he's likeable in a thankless role (remember Edward Norton in The People Versus Larry Flynt?).<br/><br/>
Like Oliver Stone's The Doors, we come away from this movie not knowing much more about the lead character than we did before the movie. There are no deep insights, no real secrets revealed. The result is a slipshod, lackadaisical film, a movie that promises to bring the story of a 'misunderstood' man to light but winds up being a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing."

Kaufmann was terrible in Taxi and Jim Carrey is good at showing how much Kaufman did in fact suck. I guess that's one positive thing about this movie. I had to turn it off after an hour or so to ease the pain. It's more fun to be castrated without anaesthetics than watching this film.<br/><br/>I give it 1/10.

","This was a movie i was longing to see. It was greatly promoted by comedians everywhere who purported Andy Kaufman to be their rolemodel into comedy. I as an Andy Kaufman fan know his story, and understand his revolutionary brand of comedy. I know his stageact also, but that is like after the fact. What i expected and didn't get from this movie was a backstory. I didn't want to watch Jim Carrey pulling Andy's stageact and his legendary pranks. I expected his passion articulated on screen.  If you like E! entertainment story type bio pics, you'd enjoy man on the moon, but it's a clunger for anyone expecting to understand the real Andy Kaufman.

","Is Carrey good in this role?  Yes.  Just as he was in Truman Show.  But there is something separating him from the great actors.  He is trying to hard, he is acting too much.  Too many exaggerated expressions, and not enough of a real breathing human being.  Granted, Kaufman was aloof, but when the gaurd went down, he was closer to normal, a little shy and awkward, but normal.  It was a great task for Carrey to master the vocal tones of Kaufman, and he is much toned down from that mug fest Liar Liar, but he's still not there yet.  I think he'll get there, but not yet.<br/><br/>As for the movie, I thought it was good.  I'd say wait to video.  I think a lot of people will hate this movie, because it's not a laugh fest.

","Milos Forman's ""Man on the Moon"" is a biopic of famed entertainer Andy Kaufman, who was a unique individual to say the least. Usually classified as a comedian, Kaufman's antics were the sort that defy easy categorization. He pushed the boundaries of comedy, often challenging audiences with material that was just as likely to result in jeers, boredom and/or discomfort rather than laughter.<br/><br/>In the movie, Jim Carrey plays Andy with total commitment, which is amply demonstrated in this year's feature length documentary ""Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond"". He was denied an Oscar nomination for his efforts but he did snag his second consecutive Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy (having won the previous year for ""The Truman Show""). Leaving aside awards recognition, Carrey seemed to capture the spirit of Kaufman's inspired lunacy in what is probably one of his best (semi-) dramatic performances. The supporting cast is also quite intriguing, not the least for including several individuals playing themselves, such as wrestler Jerry Lawler, talk show host David Letterman, ""Saturday Night Live"" creator Lorne Michaels and most of the cast of ""Taxi"". Other notables (not playing themselves) include Danny DeVito, Paul Giamatti and Courtney Love. Overall, it's a nicely assembled cast that did Andy proud.<br/><br/>Being based on a true story, the movie's plot probably won't hold too many surprises for die-hard Kaufman fans but others should find it quite interesting. Some of it seems hard to believe but from what I've read it seems that the movie hewed fairly close to the actual events. In fact, even the staging of some scenes closely matches the original television broadcasts. Credit is undoubtedly due to Milos Forman and his crew for bringing the movie to life with keen attention to detail in its period setting. Naturally, with two-time Oscar-winner Forman at the helm, the movie is in good hands from a visual standpoint but the audio department also benefits from a soundtrack that was largely composed by Rock and Roll Hall of Famers R.E.M. This of course includes their classic song that supplied the film with its title.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, ""Man in the Moon"" is, like its subject, unlikely to appeal to everyone. Kaufman's antics could sometimes stretch the definition of 'entertainment' but that's what made him so unique. I can see why he didn't consider himself a comedian, which might be a bit of a problem for viewers checking out this movie with an expectation of something resembling mainstream comedy. Personally, I find the movie to be entertaining and memorable both because of and despite its eccentricities."

","While Jim Carrey does a remarkable job of imitating Andy Kaufman, and the movie is somewhat enjoyable (in a formulaic, hero-worshiping manner), it is majorly affected by the facts about the person it concerns. In the end, the biggest flaw of ""Man on the Moon"" is its subject matter.<br/><br/>The fact is, Andy Kaufman was not funny or particularly talented. His entire repertoire consisted of insulting his audience, making fun of people who don't speak English, and being rude. Mr. Kaufman professed that he was an ""alternative entertainer"" - as Andy Dick observed, that means he didn't entertain.<br/><br/>The best quote in the movie is when the Kaufman character says, ""I'm not going to get up on stage and tell jokes!"" Well, guess what, Mr. Kaufman - that's what a comedian does. That's rather like a doctor saying, ""I'm not going to go in there and practice medicine! I think they'd much prefer it if I insulted them and tried to get them in a headlock!""<br/><br/>Mr. Kaufman's lack of talent led to his expulsion from the normal haven for the talent-challenged: Saturday Night Live. Mr. Kaufman's lack of talent kept him from being able to get lucrative gigs after the novelty of his particular form of inanity had worn off. There are those who say, ""He made me laugh with the Mighty Mouse bit"", or ""I chuckled at his performances on Taxi"". Well, Uncle Fred might make you giggle by making noises with his hand and armpit, but that doesn't mean he's a great entertainer.<br/><br/>As a biopic, this movie is extremely slanted - it takes the few moments where Mr. Kaufman actually made an audience laugh (generally out of nervous confusion rather than actual enjoyment), inflates them to gross proportions as sappy music swells in the background, and the viewer is left with the belief that Mr. Kaufman was a great entertainer. But if you watch any of the many tapes of his ""performances"", or listen to any of the people who worked with him or saw him perform, you'll get the true picture of what this man was - a hack.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey said he took the role because Kaufman was an ""inspiration"" to him. As entertainment-seekers, we can only hope that's not true."

He is portrayed as an egocentric, meglomaniac with delusions of grandeur.  Devito's line ""Who are you trying to entertain, yourself or the audience"" was how I saw the whole movie.

","I wasn't able to get my head around Andy Kaufman and who he was supposed to be, and after watching ""Man on the Moon"", I'm still not. I believe that's the point. Kaufman wasn't a comedian or even an actor as much as he was a practical joker. It wasn't enough for him to become another person: he wanted people to believe that person was completely separate from him, insisting on separate acting credits for his creations, and going as far as getting other actors to play the role right when everyone thought they had it pegged as Kaufman in a suit.<br/><br/>He was such a consummate joker that rumours persist he faked his own death. The movie leaves this ambiguous, as everything you have seen leading up to it makes you wonder if conspiracy theorists might be right for a change.<br/><br/>Carrey's performance is a thing of beauty. He doesn't look much like Kaufman did, but that doesn't matter. You forget it's him you're watching early on and he becomes the character, or characters. You don't know if the character is Kaufman, or Kaufman playing someone else, or someone else playing Kaufman, which is about right. I believe that's the point."
"Horror-yo","8","1","1","18 May 2016"," Very strong Biography starring Jim Carrey
","As the title of this review says. This is a very strongly written and directed biography about the life of Andy Kaufman, a very, very, VERY strange comedian who had the most unique sense of humor, and as you can judge yourselves by looking up some of his real life sketches online, was at very least part genius, if I can say so. Jim Carrey comes in. Possibly the best human being, if not 'the only', on the planet to play this role. It's one of these roles that are just tailor-made for a very specific individual. The film, up until the very last scene, is a tribute to Kaufman for how incredibly ahead of his time he was and the utterly unique sense of humor and creativity he possessed, completely detached from anything else that existed at the time and even for now. The film is very direct, vivid. It somewhat feels like a sequence of newspaper articles depicting Kaufman's life events put together in a coherent way. Jim Carrey is an amazing human being, and this film matches that special, unique quality he's always Carried with him (get it ? 'Carried' ?.. eh, awful...). A very nice film, and eye-opening for many who may've never heard of this contemporary genius portrayed here by another contemporary genius."

","I'm sure this review will be shorter than the last- or so I say now. I thought I'd do a review about this movie because its another film that I think has been really underrated. I've also seen this one three times and I loved it. So here I go! The first time I saw this, it was with someone that had already watched it so I remember feeling that I was pressured to catch all the details and to like it. You know that feeling? I usually just make sure its a movie that me and my company haven't seen. For this movie it actually turned out okay First of all the storyline is just amazing. Wait SN: I'm realizing that I may just run out of positive adjectives to use to explain how much I liked this movie, this story, these characters I'm just so in awe that I may not be varied in my articulation. So just imagine a girl sitting at her computer bright eyed heart beating quickly, jaw dropped and mind so active that what comes onto this blog is merely the few snip bits of wonder that she is able to snatch and type. This is my new favorite movie. I have so much to say about it. You'll just have to trust that I know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>OK i'm back. Its just so fresh. Yeah, FRESH, that a good way to describe it! Like the last review I did, I think this movie is another one that requires a sharp mind to appreciate it. But Man on the Moon is not just a movie. What I say will speak to this whole phenomenon as it were There's tons of unorthodox and very smart things that take a open and patient lover of comedy to enjoy. There that's all i'll say for that.<br/><br/>Jim Carey stars as Andy: Now any level of ""film buff"" knows that Jim Carey is one of the most successful comedians in the business. I'm not the biggest Jim Carey fan so I haven't seen all of his work or know his story, but as someone who loves comedy and at least likes him, I was very satisfied with his acting in this film. In my opinion, Jim only solidifies his talent in this movie. The truth is this movie is not nearly as popular as his other films, and he plays a role that's on an entirely different scoring field. But the result is absolutely incredible. Also this movie rates pretty high on this site alongside his other movies: 7.5/10 compared to 6.8/10 for The Mask or 6/10 for The cable guy. I think that the reason for this is the storyline.<br/><br/>Danny DeVito's role in the film touched me because he was manager and mentor to this special guy. I found myself wishing I myself could have played this role. What a wonderful place to be.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti took on a similar role. He instead, was like a side kick or understudy. Also a wonderful place to be.<br/><br/>There is also a lot of stars in this film but someone my age wouldn't really be able to speak on them.<br/><br/>This movie was just magical. If I wasn't cracking up, I was sitting on the edge of my seat with my mind constantly active and overwhelmingly entertained. You will NEVER see a movie like this, as you will NEVER hear a story quite like this. I've never been so happy after seeing a movie. It was so satisfying and fun and sad andI just thought it was brilliant. What this character did was all so very groundbreaking and brilliant that he just makes such a strong impact.<br/><br/>Now in order to do this review, I had to do some research. Remember when I described Man on the Moon as a phenomenon? Here's why: I remember hearing that this was based on a true story, but today as I'm writing this review I was moved once again. First, I went to Google to search for Andy. And there it was. The first link : Andy Kaufman on Wikipedia. I skimmed the article and was surprised to see what things in his life were held true in the movie. What a treat! Its hard to believe that Andy really didn't consider himself to be a comedian. Then, I went to YouTube and watched a video of him in an interview on David Letterman. Again I was just amazed. I liked thinking of how the audiences must have been so affected by him. It would have been such a big thing to experience first hand. Lastly, I watched an interview with Danny DeVito about working with Andy Kaufman on Taxi. This interview just brought back for me all of the feelings I saw while watching the movie because he talks about a scene from the film as it happened in real life. Simply irresistible.<br/><br/>Andy Quotes: They say, ""Oh wow, Andy Kaufman, he's a really funny guy."" But I'm not trying to be funny. I just want to play with their heads.<br/><br/>I just want real reactions. I want people to laugh from the gut, be sad from the gut, or get angry from the gut.<br/><br/>Andy Kaufman is among the greats. He was the one who brought the people through every emotion at maximum intensity. He was the one who's brilliance is haunting. If you don't know of the man I suggest that you watch Man On the Moon. Then, learn about the true character that simply could not have been created for film."
"creativevivian","10","1","1","15 November 2014"," B-e-a-utiful
","My all time absolute favorite film for a million reasons. First off, I'm a huge fan of Jim Carrey, and nobody could've nailed the role of comedian Andy Kaufman better than him. Andy was very interesting and nobody ever knew what was truly going on and what is going to happen next in his life. He could make a crowd laugh without saying a word. And who else can do that? Jim Carrey. They both started out as impressionists, and they were creative and forever entertaining to watch. Better yet, Jim was a big fan of Andy, in fact, he made everybody on set call him Andy Kaufman so he could stay in character all through filming. <br/><br/>The best quality of this film is it's ability to surprise you. Comedy can easily be predictable, but this one is different. Just like Andy Kaufman, it surprises you in such creative ways you're still scratching your head to the last joke when a new one appears. It also maintains it's comical humor while you cry and cradle your pet pug. I can't explain how beautiful it is while you still say ""haha"" and ""wow omg"". <br/><br/>Especially fun to watch as a Jim fan because it highlights all of Jim's best acting qualities. Absolutely touching and b-e-a-utiful, have a huge box of tissues ready and get ready to laugh. There is action, drama, comedy, and more. Every turn is full of surprises and Jim Carrey knows how to cover every side of Andy's confusing life. He truly deserved his golden globe for this film, it is a work of art and definitely his best performance. <br/><br/>It's very hard to explain how amazing and special this film is, but it is absolutely worth the watch because it is absolutely amazing."

Normaly I simply happen upon them, but this one I actively sought out and I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>As a child I loved Taxi and Andy Kaufman.  As an adult I can appreciate more of what he was and did.  So I was looking forward to seeing what this film was about. Although not 100% accurate, it has been considered close enough by those involved for them to appear in the movie as either themselves or as other characters.  Danny DeVito, who gained his fame from Taxi which was made popular (and possible) by Kaufman plays George Shapiro, who in turn plays a club owner.  Many others appear as themselves, and it is just a shame that some of his contemporaries from SNL are now too old to play themselves as they were when the show first started, or have passed on also.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey, as first proven conclusively in The Truman Show, is a fantastic actor and deserved an Oscar.

"suze-4","8","1","1","22 December 1999"," Andy Kaufman's gift is rediscovered for a new generation
","Many moviegoers today would not have seen Andy Kaufman's first startling appearances on Saturday Night Live, where he would do the shy, awkward European immigrant and then go into an amazing Elvis impression. When he burst on the scene there was no one like him and the world wasn't sure how to react to his humour sometimes. We would get used to the cute immigrant character, and then he'd be someone else.<br/><br/>He never wanted to stand still in his career, going from one stunt to the next, and like Rick Nelson's lament in ""Garden Party"", irritated at those who only wanted him to be Latka. He didn't want to do the show Taxi and agreed to do it only to get his own special - which the network balked at even airing as it wasn't mainstream enough. Now his kind of originality is more appreciated and so the time was right for making a movie celebrating this misunderstood and previously almost forgotten comic.<br/><br/>
Andy's later stage act of wrestling women, and the limited role in ""Taxi"", did not make him into a superstar like Jim Carrey is now. He did not play by the rules and so showbiz did not reward him, nor was his range as broad or appealing as Carrey's, but he had a gentle and quirky vision of wanting to affect his audiences. It is fitting that Carrey recognized Andy's genius and chose to play this role, as they both started out with dreams of being famous entertainers, and one of them didn't quite reach the heights, but left a puzzling body of work that this film attempts to explore.<br/><br/>
As a true homage to Andy, Jim Carrey brings him to life for a whole new generation. And those who did follow Andy Kaufman during his career will shed a tear at the behind-the-scenes look at how hard it was for him to maintain artistic integrity in a business that wanted him to be like everyone else.<br/><br/>Because this movie just came out today, I will not discuss anything that might spoil the experience for moviegoers. Thus my remarks must remain incomplete and I am chiefly here to say: please see this movie if you like biographies of strong-willed but misunderstood people, or if you love Jim Carrey, or are at all interested, even mildly, in Andy Kaufman and what he was all about. You will laugh and cry, and be uncomfortable. It will not leave you unmoved.<br/><br/>I also want to call your attention to director Milos Forman's other movie ""Hair""; if you loved it you will appreciate Man on the Moon . Hair was a very personal retelling of the famous stage play, and Forman brought his own grace and style to it.<br/><br/>Man on the Moon makes sparing but careful use of REM's beautiful song, which is featured in the TV ads. It is touching to reflect that this song was written about Andy years ago by someone who wanted to keep his name alive, and only now on seeing the movie will the song take on its full meaning to listeners who didn't know who Andy was.<br/><br/>Like Hair, It is an amazingly executed movie. I fear that Jim Carrey's performance may not win an Oscar nod because they generally turn up their noses at impersonations (although Ben Kingsley was rewarded for his impression of Gandhi). But Carrey deserves a nomination because he truly captures Andy Kaufman, the driven man in motion. The material never drags; rather it is a tale respectfully told of a life lived like a meteorite. It might have been filmed in a number of ways - more comic, more tragic, but Forman shows all the complexities of the human being behind the public persona. <br/><br/>A beauty, well worth seeing, and if there are flaws in the telling, as in Titanic, they don't matter because it's a real charmer."

","I went to see this movie knowing very little of Andy Kaufman, and I came out knowing little more.  While structured in a semi-interesting way, the movie worked too hard to be entertaining and not hard enough at making Andy a believable person--it was impossible to get to know or like Andy. Whatever you thought going in was the only thing you could think when you left. Jim Carrey's performance seemed barely adequate for the task, and he was not able to cover up for his lack of acting ability here any more than in his previous big screen ""triumph,"" The Truman Show.  While the sequences involving the cast of Taxi reprising their roles from the show (with Danny DeVito, the producer and another actor in this movie, conspicuously absent), very little of the rest of the movie displayed the same life or energy. In the future, I hope filmmakers who would like to create biopics of complex (or perhaps misunderstood?) figures will take a lesson from the failures of Man on the Moon and make sure the movie reveals something about its subject that goes beyond common knowledge."

Avid Kaufman fans who know every details of his life, complain about inaccuracies and lack of details in this movie. But for the rest of us who have barely heard of Kaufman, the movie is powerful, entertaining and touching. <br/><br/>Jim Carrey presents a magnificent performance as Andy Kaufman, proving again that he acts better in dramatic movies than comedy. His portrayal of Kaufman is close to heart, and in words of his colleagues, it appeared as if Andy Kaufman had invaded his soul.<br/><br/>Few people mentioned it here, but both Danny DeVito (as George Shapiro, Andy's manager) and Courtney Love (as Lynn Margulies, Andy's girlfriend) do a great job. The audience relate to them easily, admire their loyalty to Andy Kaufman and follow their emotional up and downs. Paul Giamatti does a decent job in portraying Bob Zmuda, Andy's writer and best friend.<br/><br/>I was particularly touched by the last fifteen minutes of the movie, especially the funeral scene; laughed and cried with Shapiro, Margulies and Zmuda through the whole time. And if a movie could stir up emotions in the right way, who cares if a few historical details are inaccurate?<br/><br/>Rated R for brief nudity, brief scenes of wrestling, and one scene with obscene language.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","This movie is difficult viewing. It is reasonably well-acted by Jim Carrey, at least enough so to add some three-dimensional fullness to the character of Andy Kaufman. But I never have been able to shake the conviction that Kaufman was purely a fraud who made up for lack of acting talent and comic ability with massive loads of baloney to make people THINK he was a genius. This movie only reinforced that belief.<br/><br/>Other than the brief television career he had on ""Taxi"", where he played the lovable foreign guy, Latka, who routinely butchered the English language, Kaufman was essentially a total loser who couldn't honestly act or make people laugh, so he had to resort to horrible excesses of fakery and deception and ""plants"" just to make certain gags work. (Even his arch-nemesis in the ring, pro-wrestler Jerry Lawler, was a plant.)<br/><br/>I've found that people by and large are willing to forgive bad acting, but not dishonest acting. I have always thought that Kaufman was guilty of both. Hey, it wasn't for nothing that the viewing public voted him off ""Saturday Night Live"". <br/><br/>If you see this movie, you should, if you ever get the chance, also see the E! True Hollywood story on Kaufman for a little added balance and perspective."

","I have mixed feelings about Carrey. Blessed with an amazing talent, there was a period just before his career went into orbit when his 3-letter agency was essentially supporting him, providing the cash flow until his career found traction. That does not happen very often, and Carrey was very stressed in this period. But, with hindsight, the bet was a good one and the agency got their money back ... in spades. Carrey's early films (of which this is one, and possibly his best) show a true acting genius on top of a comic genius. To this reviewer, the biggest problem with Carrey's outrageous success (and I used the word ""outrageous"" after some deliberation) is that it priced him out of even most of the A films. (For example, one reason there was no sequel to THE MASK which, let's face facts, was a brilliant film, as was Carrey in it) is that even the sequel to a ""known hit"" could not guarantee for the suits enough box office to cover Carrey's new super-fee. And now let's talk about Kaufman. Decades later, there are things about the man we still don't know. (Trivia fact -- Kaufman had an unnatural fear of cancer, and used to eat a handful of almonds a day based on advice from a mystic who himself lived 100 years ago. Ironically, the thing he most feared got him ... anyway.) With the exception of the Golden Globes, every other nomination Carrey received for this, arguably one of the greatest performances of the last century, came back snake eyes. There was even gossip to the effect that Carrey's performance was so pitch perfect, so dead-on, that it actually scared the judges. Too bad. What you have here, aside from one of the most entertaining biopics of all time (makes Spacey's take on Bobby Darin look like a comic book in comparison) is one astonishing man portraying another astonishing man. If that does not deserve a ""10,"" then nothing does..."

","Man on the Moon is a biographical comedy-drama film about the American entertainer Andy Kaufman, starring Jim Carrey.

Other members of that show's cast, including Marilu Henner, Judd Hirsch, Christopher Lloyd and Jeff Conaway, make cameo appearances in the film, playing themselves.<br/><br/>The story traces Kaufman's steps from childhood through the comedy clubs, and television appearances that made him famous, including his memorable appearances on Saturday Night Live, Late Night with David Letterman, Fridays, and his role as ""Latka Gravas"" on the Taxi sitcom, which was popular for viewers but disruptive for Kaufman's co-stars. The film pays particular attention to the various inside jokes, scams, put- ons, and happenings for which Kaufman was famous, most significantly his long-running ""feud"" with wrestler Jerry ""The King"" Lawler and his portrayal of the bawdy lounge singer Tony Clifton.<br/><br/>Carrey received critical acclaim for his chameleon performance and won a Golden Globe—his second win in a row.With this recognition,it was obvious that he played Kaufman wonderfully which was simply brilliant and with an almost terrifying impersonation that leaves the viewer mesmerized and entertained.Watching this movie,the audience would leave the theater talking about the character he portrayed.Aside from that, the film remains true to Kaufman's stubborn vision.<br/><br/>Finally,this is absolutely the best performance of Carrey's career."
"classicalsteve","9","2","4","21 November 2007"," Honest Bio of the Strangest American Comedian -- Carey's Best Performance
","Andy Kaufman reminds me a bit of Mozart, an enigmatic man with amazing talents but bizarre psychology. However, while Mozart's music has a transcendent quality to it that does not necessarily bespeak of the strange creature behind it, Kaufman's crazy antics and wacky routines ran a parallel course with their mad creator. His performances were as contradictory as himself, some being inspirational while others were mean-spirited and vicious. Kaufman gave new meaning to the definition of ""human being"". Not that comedians are ever normal, but Kaufman was probably the closest to a space alien on earth, with due apologies to Robin Williams. And probably the only actor space alien enough to attempt to play Kaufman was Jim Carey.<br/><br/>Kaufman burst on the Saturday Night Live scene in the 1970's with bits so improbable and spontaneous that he was a breath of fresh air for those tiring of Chevy Chase falling off ladders. His ""Jimmy Carter"" and ""Might Mouse"" bits have become classics in the annals of the show. And he had the best Elvis imitation in the industry. Maybe not quite like Rich Little, but an entirely different take.<br/><br/>He then got the opportunity to play Latka, a half-witted car repairman from an unknown eastern-block country, on the television show Taxi. Kaufman played Latka to the hilt, apparently creating Latka's ""language"" and improvising some of his scenes. When Taxi became a hit so did Kaufman and his character Latka. The movie reunited much of the cast of Taxi to re-shoot scenes with Carey as Kaufman playing Latka, and several of the actors believed that Kaufman had returned. Which is another point I want to make in this review: not for one moment did I think I was seeing Jim Carey. For two hours I thought I was seeing Andy Kaufman.<br/><br/>One of the most outlandish stunts Kaufman pulled (but certainly not the last) was the appearance of Tony Clifton. Kaufman required in his contract that Clifton appear on an episode or two of Taxi. Tony Clifton was essentially the ultimate Las Vegas loser from a bygone era, a cigar-smoking no-talent yowler (I hesitate to call him a singer) replete with smelly cigar, unkempt facial hair, and disgusting ruffled shirt. The kind of guy that maybe had his way with the ladies 49 years earlier but now needs more than a makeover. When Clifton arrives on the set of Taxi, heads do more than roll... But this was not the end of Kaufman's crazy stunts, which are chronicled throughout the movie, including wrestling women.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, Kaufman apparently was interested in transcendental meditation. And some of his live presentations had a gentler warmer rhetoric in which humor and laughter heal and enlighten audiences. However, his other stunts that provoked and angered other viewers received far more press. Unfortunately, it seems Kaufman could not decide which side of his contradictory personalities was really him and upon which he wanted to focus his energy. Late in the film, his agent, played by former Taxi cast member Danny DeVito asks Kaufman if he is really trying to entertain people or if he is just entertaining himself.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film begs more questions than it answers, as it should be. Kaufman cannot be neatly categorized. Was he comedian? Yes, but not in the traditional Bob Hope sense. He was also a performance artist. Was he suffering from psychosis? Probably. But he was also into meditation. Kaufman will never be fully understood, maybe because he probably never truly understood himself either, and that's at the heart of Carey's portrayal."
"bob the moo","Null","2","4","13 April 2004"," Lacks insight but is still very entertaining thanks to a great Carrey
","Andy Kaufman is a song and dance man who struggles to really be successful as a stand up in nightclubs as the audience are never really sure what the joke actually is.  When he is spotted by agent George Shapio, it allows him to get one of his characters onto a new sitcom.  With the success of the show he is given a stage to try different things - an opportunity that the studio regrets giving him when he varies wildly from a lounge lizard alter ego to a major show where he wrestles female audience members to the ground.<br/><br/>As with many within the UK audience for this film, I only know Kaufman from his character in Taxi.  One thing I do know is that he was clearly a mystery with no-one, maybe not even himself, really knowing who he was or when he was being serious.  And that is what the film remembers - an enigma.  This is not the place to come for understanding, explanation or background; in fact the film skips from a brief flashback of Andy's childhood to 20 years later as a stand-up! In that regard, the film is a success because it nicely captures a man who it must have been hard to laugh at simply because he appeared to be more about having a laugh on his audience rather than at his audience.  On the strength of this film I quite like his style but am surprised he became so famous when it must have been quite hard to actually laugh at his work.<br/><br/>The film may not do enough for those who know a lot about Kaufman's career simply because it doesn't cast light on anything - it only records some key events.  As I said, the film seems to be holding it's hands up and saying `look - we know about as much as you do' - it isn't even sure if Kaufman died for real or not.  I found it very funny though and it was an entertaining way of informing me about his career.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of an Oscar nomination, it is Carrey who makes this film work so well - his performance is great, capturing Kaufman's routines as well as providing us with some tender moments.  DeVito is good in support even though it confused me as to who he was playing at first (Shapio or himself).  Love is not as bad as I feared she might be, although she has no character and she is still one of the weakest aspects of the film. Giamatti is as reliable as ever and is sterling in support.  Appearances from others as themselves are great and add class to the film - particularly Lawler, the cast of Taxi and several others.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this film but it engaged me because I knew so little about him.  For those who are familiar with him this film may not bring enough for them to justify seeing but even then it is lively, funny and centred on a great performance from Carrey."
"scifiguy-2","2","2","4","16 March 2003"," The joke is on you, Kaufman is alive and well.
","A lousy movie...a brilliant film...poorly directed with style...written ineptly, yet true to life...a terrific bio-pic about a mediocre comic. Kaufman's idea of comedy was based on contradictions and deceptions. When sticking to straight comedy he was amusing, but too often his goals were strictly a pursuit of controversy and publicity. Apparently the strategy worked to a certain extent, because he is so well remembered. Back in the days when he started his wrestling routine, I thought he had gone insane. The decision to scream obscenities on Letterman's show was clearly poor judgment, and most people (including myself) believed the performance was not an act. This was the only Jim Carrey film I haven't see in the theatre, because Kaufman lost his appeal after those shenanigans. I honestly think Carrey is the greatest comedic actor of our age, with the exception of this movie. The film is only fair, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but staunch fans of Andy Kaufman."
"Spleen","8","2","4","23 September 2000"," Enigma, my foot
","Andy Kaufman's motivation isn't at all hard to understand.  We've all had the desire to play practical jokes.  We've all had the urge to say and do things that are, objectively speaking, funny, even though, and often because, we know that the humour will be invisible to everyone but ourselves.  And it's obvious us all what a good practical joke requires: it requires that we shut up and let others work out for themselves what the joke is, whatever the cost of our silence.  Andy Kaufman - the character portrayed in this film, at any rate - was simply someone who loved a certain kind of humour more than anything else in the world.  You've heard stories about people who love, say, music, more than anything else in the world...? Well, this is no different; certainly no more mysterious.<br/><br/>Remember the moment when his agent says, ""You have to ask yourself this question: who are you trying to entertain?  The audience, or yourself?"" Andy doesn't answer.  But the answer he would have given, had he been in a mood to be honest, would have been, ""Neither.  I'm interested in creating situations that are, objectively speaking, amusing - even if audiences are unable to laugh at them - even if I MYSELF am unable to laugh at them.""<br/><br/>That's why it was worthwhile for Milos Forman to come along, after the dust had settled, and make Kaufman's life into a movie.  Some of the jokes are only visible to a God's-eye view.<br/><br/>I walked into the film pretty much prepared to loathe Kaufman (whose stuff I've never seen).  Okay, the man probably had talent.  He was a skilled artist, of a kind.  Still: a skilled artist of almost any other kind would be more worthy of admiration.  But Forman keeps his distance, and simply asks us to see a genuinely tragic story of a human being who is somehow easy to like and - to us, if not to the other characters in the film - perfectly transparent.  (So much so that we have to wonder how it was possible for Kaufman's contemporary audiences not to know what was going on.  Are Americans REALLY as dense as legend says they are?  Maybe not; and anyway, Forman's frequent cut-away shots to the audience show a variety of different responses.)<br/><br/>I could have done without that postscript with Tony Clifton; but the Philippines stint, and the funeral sequence it dissolved into, were marvellous.  Forman's best work since ""Amadeus""."
"Don-102","8","2","4","27 December 1999"," Andy, We Hardly Knew Ye...
","Andy Kaufman was an original, no doubt about it.  His biting, often strange humor infuriated people to the point of hating him.  Those who got the joke saw through it all and chuckled at how the butt of his antics (the audience) became annoyed and distraught .  Ultimately and sadly, the joke was on Kaufman himself.  MAN ON THE MOON arrives at this conclusion after a series of episodic Andy moments, most of which fans have seen over and over again throughout the years.<br/><br/>You sure wish you could get to know this flawed man and what made his outlandish mind work.  As David Letterman once said, ""sometimes, you look at Andy, and you are not sure who is behind the wheel.""  You never do get a real sense of who he was in Milos Forman's strong, but nearsighted film.<br/><br/>There are fabulous moments sprinkled throughout, however.  The first 5 minutes of the picture may have some of those same Andy haters leaving the theater, a further testament to his misunderstood humor.  Forman and his screenwriters have created a brilliant and ingenious method of beginning a Kaufman biopic.  Jim Carrey plays the erratic comedian masterfully in what is by far his best performance to date.  There are times when we see Carrey playing him as a goof off-stage, lying, demanding, and acting just flat out bizarre.  I ask myself whether or not this is the real thing.  Certainly, the many people involved in the production of the film (in particular Bob Zmuda and Danny DeVito) knew Kaufman well as a pro and a friend, but the joke may still be on us as far as finding out what he was really all about.<br/><br/>Forman's direction and the screenplay basically play off the hopes that most audiences will be unfamiliar with Kaufman's work.  This is fine, however, there are times when a true fan can mimic what is happening on screen.  MAN ON THE MOON is merely a succession of scenes showcasing his talent, or lack of, leading to a mildly emotional climax.<br/><br/>The question of whether or not Kaufman faked his own death is not really touched upon, but some subtle glimpses at film's end could keep you guessing.  R.E.M.'s classic tune fittingly ends what turns out to be a loving tribute to the guy.  Andy's antics did p*** a lot of people off. The film shows how he was able to create the illusion of what could be authentically unbelievable.  Were the wrestling injuries real?  Did Jerry Lawler really slap him on Letterman?  This is mostly left to your imagination for some time, but it is amusing to see who was in on some of the madness with him.<br/><br/>The sickly humor of the piggish lounge singer ""Tony Clifton"" creates some huge laughs.  Clifton was Zmuda and Kaufman's favorite creation.  I think Forman and company with the help of Andy's pals use the Clifton character, who was the alter ego of Kaufman you could say, to show the tragedy of his comedy and his untimely death.  Clifton was the ultimate Kaufman fake-out, but he was able to live on while Andy was only mortal.<br/><br/>What a curious man he was and who better than Carrey to play him (I mean really, WHO better).  His performance is the glue that holds MAN ON THE MOON together, barely.  I just wish I got to know Andy Kaufman much more over the course of the 2 hour film.<br/><br/>RATING: ***"

Spectator can hence follow the aging processess of those actors and that is why Forman-movies have that peculiar feeling of ""formanian"".
Hitchcock, Tarantino and Lynch have used same method with great success.<br/><br/>Secondly, the name of the movie can be interpreted as a comment to Stanley Kubrick's faked moon landing conspiracy theory. Did US had technology to send a man on the moon? The event was a complete joke, directed by Kubrick. That explains why Forman chose Courtney Love to this movie, because Courtney allegedly whacked his husband Kurt Cobain and never got caught.

On that basis, I can't say how much justice the movie did to Andy Kaufman, but one thing is sure - he probably was the most annoyingly interesting artist out there. And he seemed truly to be out there. By the time 'Man on the Moon' came out, Jim Carrey's serious acting talents weren't that big surprise anymore. And in here he proved again that he's much more capable than being Ace Ventura.<br/><br/>The film itself is quite a classical story about rising to fame, and about artistic integrity. The wide audience has always been the same - demanding the same funny skit over and over again, while the artist has something new to say.

"christianolivarez-78828","8","0","0","13 April 2019"," Here I Come To Save The Day
","Alright guys, we're talking about Man on the Moon starring Jim Carrey. He was awarded a Golden Globe for his role of Andy Kaufman. In case you're unfamiliar (I was because this is way before my time), Kaufman was born in 1949 and died in May 1984. He was an American entertainer, actor, writer and performance artist. While often being called a comedian, Kaufman said ""I am not a comic, I have never told a joke. ... The comedian's promise is that he will go out there and make you laugh with him... My only promise is that I will try to entertain you as best I can.""<br/><br/>So, I wouldn't normally do a spoiler alert on a biopic, but given the timeframe this movie was made I'm giving a small one. To begin, Jim Carrey's performance was absolutely outstanding. I'm not surprised at all he received the 2000 Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. You're intrigued right from the beginning with a small monologue. You can definitely tell Jim Carrey was fully immersed in the character (as he consistently does) and that is exemplified in the Netflix Documentary ""Jim and Andy"" which I would definitely recommend watching afterwards. But back to the movie. At first, you feel kind of bad for Kaufman because as a young boy, he was playing in his room for an audience in the walls. His father wasn't too enthusiastic about this quality in his son and made it a point that he'd play with friends or perform in front of an audience. I'm sure this would hit home for a lot of people.<br/><br/>Fast forward to adult Kaufman. He performs at a comedy club and let me tell you, it's rough to watch. However, you got to remember that this is the beginning and you'll learn that this ""cringe"" has a purpose.<br/><br/>Things begin to pick up when Kaufman is faced with an ultimatum to either get the crowd going or being fired by his boss. In comes the foreign man and Elvis Presley impersonations. Amazing. The simplicity is pure genius. I'd explain it but i wouldn't do it justice. At least YouTube it if you don't watch the film. The movie takes off and you honestly almost forget that this is Jim Carrey. This act of The Foreign Man and Elvis Presley impersonations eventually leads him to a role in the show Taxi and steps in the limelight. There are many lessons in this movie. Again, he said he never told jokes and it's clear in this movie. I tell you that because although he was loved and well known, he also had moments and characters (Tony Clifton) that people did not love. Kaufman's self-determination to pursue his dream and not let others perceptions of him discourage him is very admirable. After all, you can also fail at the things you don't love. So why not fail at something you do love?<br/><br/>The movie continues to follow Kaufman's journey as he stars in Taxi and eventually begins to stray off into his own specials. Around this time comes Kaufman's partner, Bob Zmuda (played by Paul Giamatti). At this point of the movie you're bought in. You're in for the long haul. You're going to finish this movie. Kaufman and Zmuda bring a sense of chaos to film. You know that person who you connect with on a weird level? When you are laughing and everyone is kinda looking at you? Yeah. Kaufman and Zmuda often had staged scenes where only they knew it was a bit and often never told the crowd. This is great, but it's great to an extent. As you're watching, things begin to almost spiral downward in a ""The boy who cried wolf"" kinda way.<br/><br/>Kaufman begins pushing it further and further with his character Tony Clifton and ""edging the crowd on""to the point where he loses his fan base. Kaufman was great at getting a reaction out of people and even if the crowd didn't enjoy it, it was entertaining. It's east to grasp the logic but feel bad for him about how people are viewing him. For example, depending on where you start the movie, you might call Kaufman an asshole, but if you watch the whole movie, you understand this is him. Kaufman does what Kaufman wishes. The heartbreaking moment is when Kaufman is diagnosed with a deadly cancer but his own manager doesn't believe him due to his previous antics. This holds true for the fan base as well. I'll leave the ending to you. I don't want to spoil the entire movie as I believe you should see it for yourself if you consider yourself a Jim Carrey fan. Also, this review is pretty long.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Jim Carrey did an outstanding job in portraying Andy Kaufman. It's a story of believing in who you are and what you're doing despite other people's perceptions. It's a unique comedy that is unlike any other. I personally give this movie a 7.9. I'll likely purchase my own copy. Happy watching!"

","This film is uniquely entertaining and redefines the words hoax and optical illusion. Jim is so close to what I imagine Andy to be like, even that itself is an illusion. Yet somehow Andy Kaufman lives on in what can only be described in my opinion as Jim Carrey's stand out best performance. The song and dance man, anti humour improvisational comedic, doesn't tell jokes. He is more interested in making himself and his friend Bob laugh at their own genius than entertaining his audience or so it appears. Danny DeVito plays George his stage manager/agent and appears not entirely sure at first what to make of Andy Kaufmans act himself. He may be crazy with surreal gimmicks and untimely motions but George is willing to take the risk with his out of the world man on a moon act. With bizarre alter ego character Tony Clifton and controversial anti women should be in the kitchen act. From the Taxi sitcom to wrestling to appearing on David Letterman, Andy has everyone guessing what's next? Not even George is in the loop with who is in on each act. Andy created a world where the audience were always second guessing and he wanted to stay one step ahead. But when tragedy strikes not even Andys own family can take him seriously."

","The more time that passes by, the more it seems like Andy Kaufman was a fictional character. I never did warm up to Kaufman as a performer, although I did enjoy his character Latka Gravas on 'Taxi'. One of the impressive things about this movie is that all of the cast members of that show lent their talents in telling the story of his life, or at least the highlights of that story. The only one missing from the set of the 'Taxi' cast was Danny DeVito, who appears in the picture as talent agent and Kaufman's handler, George Shapiro. It was striking for me to remember most of what appears in the story since I got it all piecemeal throughout the late Seventies and early Eighties when Kaufman was making his mark in the entertainment world. Oddly, I recall seeing Kaufman on his Saturday Night Live debut and thought his Mighty Mouse sketch was hilarious. And even while it was happening, I knew all that business about the 'intergender wrestlling' had to be a 'work', to use the profession's own terminology. The infamous Jerry Lawler slap that sent Andy sprawling on the set of the Letterman Show caught me off guard and looked so realistic that for a moment I had my doubts whether there was any acting involved, but that was put to rest in the movie. Portraying Kaufman, Jim Carrey does a splendid job and if you never saw Kaufman live, Carrey would pass as a reasonable substitute. The only thing the film doesn't do is give one any kind of sense of whether the real Andy Kaufman ever came across as an average human being. But maybe that's a moot point, as his entire life seemed to be a kind of 'work' that made normalcy something out of the ordinary."

","A bibliographic film that tells the story of a comedian who did not care for the public, but a man who had a humorous belief, and persecuted it faithfully, mixed the impolitically incorrect with a kind of abstract humor, Andy Kaufman was a different comedian , with a unique sense of humor, his story is worthy of film, a film that falls into the hands of the competent Milos Forman, who adapts his life and work in an absurdly consistent way. Andy Kaufman is Jim Carrey, and this is not just a catch phrase to put on the poster, Jim's acting is spectacular, and for me, his best acting career, Jim does not do an identical interpretation of how Andy was, he does a very similar performance but puts a lot of his personality to the character, which gives us an absurdly funny movie, making the viewer delirious every second. The screenplay is not perfect, but it's very good, it's from childhood context and familiar to Andy, and highlights his already famous life and his controversies, which are not few, and cause much confusion in the viewer in being able to interpret who is who and what is false what is real - although in this aspect the film uses a lot of poetic liberty - but that was always part of Andy's mood. The screenplay sends a somewhat depressing and hopeful message, something like ""Life is a Big Joke"", and this is exposed once in a scene, which to me is the most striking of the film, which is when Andy discovers that your greatest hope is a fraud, and find grace in it. Technically the film is all well directed, mixing a gray photograph of the 80s with something hotter than the 90s, as well as creating ambiences and great extras, not to mention the fluidity of the film, because even the film repeats itself at different times, never the same you lose the rhythm. Finally, the film is far above the level, it just fails to develop Andy's character, just to show his deeds, with an avant-garde and unique humor, Kaufman charmed audiences and even dying at age 35, is still considered one of the greatest comedians of the American scene."

","I just finished watching ""Man on the Moon"" for the first time, and it's already one of my favorites. I had a tiny amount of knowledge on Andy Kaufman before now, and I'm sure not everything in the film is 100% accurate, but as a film, this really really holds up. Kaufmans whole character, and Jim Carey's portrayal of him is absolutely fantastic, wildly funny and brilliant. I really appreciated how many of the people in this film were portrayed by the people who actually were there at the time (Loren Michaels, Christopher Lloyd, Richard Belzer, and ESPECIALLY THE MAN THE MYTH THE LEGEND JERRY THE KING LAWLER) Paul Giamatti and Danny Devito are class acts as always, and really lend a great weight to the film, balancing Carey out wonderfully. Carey in comedic/serious roles strikes me in all the right ways. Everything about this movie strikes me. I love entertainers like this (both Kaufman and Carey's portrayal of him) and this film just really played my emotions in all the right ways. The only time I ever was slightly disappointed with this film was during the milk and cookie scene, as the closeup on Carey's face and the music swell was a little too intentionally sappy and ""redeeming"" for my taste, but it's a nitpick really. Usually I don't bend backwards for ""feel good"" stories, but the way that this story is depicted before it gets to that point really had me, and it's one of the only times that the ending of a film made me emotional: I highly recommend this film. 10/10"

","In ""Man on the Moon"", Jim Carrey dishes it his elastic-like energy to a different direction in his portrayal of the legendary comedian and master manipulator Andy Kaufman (1949-1984). Director Milos Forman gives us a full-depth look into the eyes of this unpredictable genius who rose to super-stardom, raising eyebrows and creating controversy wherever he went. In his short time on Earth, Kaufman accomplished a lot more than we could only dream about. The track by R.E.M. can be heard in our heads the entire time as we follow Kaufman in his weird world that he lives in and Jim Carrey brings us along for the zany, crazy ride. Carrey shows us why he was the perfect casting choice to play the part of Andy Kaufman because like Kaufman, Carrey is a master when it comes to impersonation. Every quirky event comes here; from portraying the wide-eyed Foreign Man to wrestling women, to reading of ""The Great Gatsby"" and to lip-syncing the theme song to ""Mighty Mouse"", it all comes to life and Carrey just nails his scenes perfectly.<br/><br/>Even though Kaufman's memorable moments were brought to life here, we still feel left with several curious questions that are still left unanswered that will for the rest of our lives remain privately kept and unknown. We never full understand why he turned out the way he did or what makes him tick, because we're only given emphasis based on the things the mainstream knows about and very little on his life outside the limelight. Because of this flaw, the mystery of who Andy Kaufman is remains in the dark. From my personal observations, this movie is left to give us the impression that Andy was more weightless to his audiences than he was to himself. <br/><br/>""Man on the Moon"" is another big extravagant picture which collaborates Milos Forman along with his screen writing partners Scott Alexander and Larry Karazewski brought vibrancy and passion to the 1996 film ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" which was rich in its characters and situations. ""Man in the Moon"" we are treated to the events that we already know about, but in the end we know very little about him, which makes everything rather opaque. Maybe because Kaufman himself was self-conscious of his life, or maybe I just wanted more than what we know. <br/><br/>In spite of this major faux pas, ""Man on the Moon"" is able to trace back the important moments in Kaufman's life successfully and Jim Carrey channels in his inner Kaufman very convincingly. <br/><br/>Under great artistic structuring, Kaufman's moments are played out straightforward but also faithfully as he wows the packed audiences with his clever but quirky mind games while Carrey adds touches of his own comedy style to make things all the more brighter. <br/><br/>Make no doubts about it, Kaufman came a long way with the eternal belief that life's a stage and we all have our parts. From his early years growing up in Great Neck, New York to success as a comedian, TV star master of the manipulation, it was shame that a lot of the people in Andy's life wasn't given that same amount of attention as the man himself. The only one closest was Danny Devito (who was a co-star of his on the show ""Taxi"") playing the sole true friend of his as agent George Shapiro and cared about this eccentric comedian the whole way through. <br/><br/>The other honourable mention is the performance by versatile actor Paul Giamatti as another close associate to Mr. Kaufman's Bob Zmuda who was Kaufman's co-writer and conspirator who was behind the creation of one of Kaufman's infamous alter-ego, Tony Clifton. Clifton made several appearances time and time again even on the show ""Taxi"" often appeared at his comedy club delivering aggressive humour, along with pudgy cheeks, black moustache and a thick Brooklyn New York accent. Like Kaufman, Clifton was also fascinated with wrestling women. And even that is only seen in fragments.<br/><br/>It's a biopic that explores the memorable moments of Andy Kaufman's life and Jim Carrey does an excellent job of recreating the comedian who entertained us in the 1970's and 1980's and the events that take place are all very involving and energetic. The movie itself shows only small fragments of these events and the characters in Andy's life are only just there for the moment leaving very little in development. It's still funny and very exciting watch about an unpredictable man going to great lengths to tease its audience."

","Jim Carrey had a reputation of showcasing his rubbery face and goofy personality which endeared himself to many audiences. Although very popular throughout his career, others found him to be one dimensional and it was another case of asking ""Can Jim Carrey do anything else?"" While The Truman Show (1998) was the start of Jim Carrey proving he can branch out, I felt his role as the ill-fated Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon suited him perfectly to the ground. Although the movie netted a lot of critical acclaim as well as a well deserved Golden Globe for Jim Carrey, sadly it was quite an underrated movie which flopped at the box office.<br/><br/>Man on the Moon squarely focuses on the biography of legendary comedian Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey) right up to his untimely death in 1984 at aged 35 from lung cancer. The movie explores his early days through childhood and showcasing his comedic talents in comedy clubs and television appearances, including his memorable appearances on Saturday Night Live (which saw him banned), Late Night with David Letterman, Fridays, and his role in the popular TV show Taxi. There is special mention of the inside jokes and scams including his long-running feud with wrestler Jerry ""The King"" Lawler and his portrayal of the bawdy lounge singer Tony Clifton. Kaufman's personal life is also explored including his romantic relationship with Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love in a good role), and his friendships with Tony Shaprio (Danny DeVito) and creative partner Bob Zmunda (Paul Giamatti).<br/><br/>Jim Carrey was a real pleasure to watch as Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon and I'm sorry that the movie was not a hit in 1999. Director Milos Forman (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, The People vs Larry Flynt) proves he is still a quality director with Man on the Moon by bringing out the best of Jim Carrey.<br/><br/>Sorely underrated, Man on the Moon is a quality movie showcasing that Jim Carrey can, in fact, act is not just a pretty (rubbery) face.<br/><br/>8/10."
"Lechuguilla","7","0","0","25 November 2013"," The Unique And Chaotic Andy Kaufman
","Even as an adult, Andy Kaufman had a child-like personality. He liked to play elaborate, childish pranks and hoaxes on his unsuspecting audience. A big part of the plot details some of those pranks. He was also well known for doing a very good impersonation of Elvis. And of course his ""Latka"" was a major character in the 1970s sitcom ""Taxi"".<br/><br/>Kaufman had a unique outward persona that made him easily recognizable. In ""Man On The Moon"", Jim Carrey captures that persona well. Carrey's performance is probably the best element of the film.<br/><br/>But there are a couple of problems with the movie. First, too much time is spent on these pranks and hoaxes. Just a little of the nasal and obnoxious ""Tony Clifton"" goes a long way. I would have preferred more emphasis on Andy's personal life rather than so much time on his various ""acts"", such as Clifton and the TV wrestling bits. Which leads to the second problem.<br/><br/>It's true that Kaufman's relationship with his audience was significant. But in this film there are way too many camera shots of the audience. Even worse is their hyped-up expressions. Many of Kaufman's performances are neither funny nor bad; they do not evoke much response of any kind. Yet people in these irksome audiences gush with animation every time Kaufman does so much as move his eyes back and forth or pauses in silence. Audience over-reaction is one strike against the film's Director. <br/><br/>Though Kaufman could be humorous, and many people regard him as a comedian, I would not put this film in the comedy genre. Indeed, there's an undercurrent of sadness throughout, owing mostly to Kaufman's death at an early age. The film has a poignant ending.<br/><br/>Although somewhat superficial, ""Man On The Moon"" is a reasonably interesting biography of an enigmatic entertainer who died too young. I admired Kaufman's uniqueness. And he came along at just the right time, in the late 70s and early 80s, a chaotic time culturally, a perfect historical fit for a chaotic personality."

But after being captured by Jim Carey's dead-on portrayal and the moments in the film that made me both laugh out loud and brought a tear to my eye, I did my fair share of research and discovered many facts and quirks that I never knew belonged to Andy.<br/><br/>Definitely watch this film: no matter how much of an Andy Kaufman fan you are, or even if you absolutely hated the man, the film is engaging on another level that seems to delve behind the comedy to the man underneath, and may even make you want to find out just a little bit more about the real Andy Kaufman."

"Gideon24","7","0","0","21 July 2013"," Carrey's remarkable performance makes this one work
","The late Andy Kaufman was a tortured soul who wanted fame on his own terms and didn't care if others were in on the joke or not. This seems to be the permeating theme of MAN ON THE MOON, director Milos Foreman's rambling 1999 biopic about the comedian, who would achieve his greatest fame as mechanic Latka Gravas on the ABC series TAXI during the 1970's. <br/><br/>This film explores Kaufman's humble beginnings in dingy comedy clubs to his unnerving appearance on the premiere episode of Saturday NIGHT LIVE, his tenure on TAXI and his invasion of the WWF, which ballooned into a full blown feud with WWF wrestler Jerry Lawler. <br/><br/>The film shows Andy's consistent discontent with his success and how no matter what he achieved, it wasn't enough. This purely evidenced in Kaufman's obnoxious alter ego, Tony Clifton, who Kaufman tirelessly worked at creating a separate career for, despite the fact that no one was interested. <br/><br/>The film aggravates as we watch Kaufman constantly put up roadblocks to his own success, but also fascinates due to the mesmerizing performance by Jim Carrey in the title role. Carrey channels Kaufman flawlessly, in a performance that's positively spooky in its accuracy and should have earned Carrey an Oscar nomination. <br/><br/>Kaufman, I mean Carrey, gets solid support from Danny DeVito, who plays George Shapiro, Kaufman's agent and Paul Giamatti, who plays Bob Zmuda, Kaufman's co-writer and co-parter in conspiracy and the only one in all of Kaufman's jokes. Courtney Love's performance as the leading lady is a matter of taste, but it really doesn't matter because this is Jim <br/><br/>Carrey's show all the way and he makes the film worth watching. The film also features appearances by Jerry Lawler, Peter Bonerz as TAXI producer Ed Weinberger and TAXI cast members Judd Hirsch, Jeff Conaway, Marilu Henner, Christopher Lloyd, and Carol Kane. A long but involving look at one of show business' most tragic figures and I'm not completely sure that it's over."

","This is a film I have seen three times now and I must admit I love it! Apart from his portrayal of Ladka (hope I spelt that right) on the TV show 'Taxi', I knew very little about Andy Kaufman. Of course much of his work was focused on the US and so we didn't really hear much about it here in the UK. He was quite a character who had a very controversial career, some of it worked and was brilliant and some of it was a bit too wide of the mark for many. Either way, I found it a very interesting and entertaining film with a stand-out performance from Jim Carrey. I will tell you more after this brief summary.<br/><br/>We begin with a very young Andy Kaufman putting on shows for his kid sister. Moving on, he's doing stand-up in a club when an agent, George Shapiro, sees him and offers to represent him. This leads to him landing the role of Ladka in 'Taxi', a role which, we are lead to believe, he didn't really want to do. Another character, Tony Clifton, puts in an appearance at this point. He is a cabaret singer and a very good friend of Andy's; in fact, Andy would only agree to play the part of Ladka if Tony could also appear in the show. Moving on, Andy and his writing partner, Bob Zmuda, turn their attention to wrestling and Andy begins to play the bad guy, wrestling women. One of the top wrestlers in the country, Jerry Lawler, doesn't like it and challenges Kaufman to a fight! It all comes to a head when they come to blows live on the David Letterman chat show. Little did people realise, but it was all staged and Kaufman and Lawler were really good friends. Andy eventually meets Lynne Marguiles who becomes his partner and they move in together. Sadly, it's not long after that he is diagnosed with cancer. Whilst fighting it he fulfils his lifetime ambition and puts on a show at Carnegie Hall in New York. I will leave it there or the Spoiler Police (Biopics Division) will be making my biopic a little shorter.<br/><br/>A well made film with many people playing themselves which is either a testament to Andy KaufmanÂ… or they needed the work (that's a joke by the way). For me, the stand-out performance came from Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman; his best performance to date (IMO)! Danny DeVito did a great job as George Shapiro, as did Courtney Love as Lynne Marguiles and Paul Giamatti as Bob Zmuda. But, for me, a film that can bring together the likes of; Marilu Henner from 'Taxi', Judd Hirsch from 'Taxi', Carol Kane from 'Taxi', David Letterman and Christopher Lloyd from 'Taxi' has to have something special.<br/><br/>I think the reason I like Jim Carrey in this so much is that it gives him the opportunity to play the crazy zany stuff he's famous for while at the same time giving him the chance to show the audience what a fine dramatic actor he is as well. The title comes from the REM song about Andy of the same name, refrains of which can be heard throughout the film, which I thought was a nice touch. As I said at the beginning this is the third time I've watched this film and it's the third time it's touched me emotionally. Not many films do that these days and so I have no problem in giving it a higher score than many and also deeming it 'highly recommended'.<br/><br/>My score: 8.6/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 7.4/10 (based on 59,843 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 62/100 (based on 117 reviews counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 74/100 (based on 89,423 user ratings counted at the time of going to press)."
"ElMaruecan82","7","0","0","26 September 2011"," A movie that interestingly works 'despite itself' ...
","When it comes to misunderstood geniuses or irreverent entertainers, Milos Forman is not the least interesting director for the biopic genre. So, when he's the one who handles the film relating the life and death of one of the most brilliant and misunderstood comedians of his generation: Andy Kauffman, portrayed by THE greatest comic star of his generation : Jim Carrey, it can't get more promising than that. The result turns out to be a very good film, with a little something that could have made it better.<br/><br/>I think that ""little something"" is easily diagnosable and is to blame on the director, because basically, the movie lacked a direction. It's interesting that Milos Forman, an international film-maker -well, at least in his sensitivity- decided to make a film about an American TV and stage icon, someone whom a majority of people, even American, wouldn't be automatically familiar with. Think about this, Mozart was an artist with an undeniable universal appeal, and even to those who didn't necessarily love classical music, ""Amadeus"" worked as an extraordinary depiction of the poisoning effect of jealousy in the envious mind. ""The People vs Larry Flynt"" involves a universe even more marginal but despite its sleaziest undertones, the films worked as an inspired pamphlet against censorship and any form of closed-minded bigotry.<br/><br/>And this is how a biopic should work, in my humble opinion, you don't necessarily need a famous character, but you cleverly use his life, his personality as an excuse to speak much larger statement about human nature, I mentioned ""Larry Flynt"" when I could have evoked ""Chariots of Fire"" or ""Gandhi"". OR the movie should plunge us in the darkest depths of human nature, and enlighten us on the soul's mechanism that can inspire a particular behavior that would influence a certain field, ""Amadeus"" is one of them, but also ""Ed Wood"". And there is a virtuous effect on these two distinct approaches: when you transcend your character, you invite the viewer to question his own sensitivity and when you dig into your character's sensitivity, you invite the viewer to transcend his own perception of life. These are the two directions of a good biopic, higher or deeper. I'm afraid the direction of ""Man of the Moon"" is too 'linear'.<br/><br/>Exactly what is Andy Kaufman's appeal for someone who's never heard of him or never seen any of his skits even knowing his name? In its essence, ""Man on the Moon"" is trapped in its own concept. I didn't watch the film as a fan of Kaufman, which I can't be, because I've never seen any of his acts, not even as a fan of Carrey, but as a fan of Forman whom I was sure, was going to make either a great film about the inner mechanisms of humor or a much greater depiction of the world of entertainment, like Bob Fosse's masterpiece ""Lenny"" who was also about a comedian I wasn't familiar with. But it turned out to really be about Kaufman, well, I wasn't cheated but I felt a little deceived. The film is still good, but could it have really been bad since it recreates a succession of life's episodes that are funny or intriguing indeed, with a documentary-like realism? Hence the question, what did I learn exactly that I couldn't have learned from a documentary? <br/><br/>I feel guilty by writing these lines because overall, I enjoyed the film, hell, I can't even get the great drums moment and the catchy 'Abudabi' song off my head, the film needed more moments like the one in the Carnegie Hall, if not more intellectual, something more entertaining or appealing. But it seemed like it only tried to please people who knew about Kaufman and wanted to revive his short but brilliant career, a sort of sympathetic tribute from the buddies. Okay, but the material had so much potential, Jim Carrey's performance was full of energy and poignant vulnerability and I appreciated Danny De Vito as Shapiro, his manager, and Paul Giamatti as his buddy and co-writer. The style, if we could even speak of style, of Andy Kaufman was an excellent demonstration of the power of humor, and how you can develop some comic avant-guardism out of it. And the more I got used to the awkwardness of Kaufman, the more I expected hints if not answers, why did he do that? Why did people relate or not to that form of humor? <br/><br/>Maybe the film's alibi is that it tried to play as a self-reflexive portrayal of Kaufman's style. Why should I expect some deep meaning from a film about a comic who didn't even expect laughs. Sure. But Kaufman, from what I understood, loathed indifference, and wanted to be either loved or hated, at least inspire a specific reaction from his audience, ""boos"" or ""cheers"" but never silence or ""meh?"". And what made the character so interesting is the way he seemed to be also insecure with compliments and cheers, as if he felt that the path to reach the comedic talent, never passed by cheap laughs, or classic styles, another reason why he detested sitcoms, with its prefabricated laughs. He was indeed ahead of his time.<br/><br/>Buy why was he like this? We'll never know, and we all have to take his personality for granted. I'm not quite sure about the self-reflexive approach, because the film is not that subtle, I wouldn't have minded if it was longer enough to avoid the brutal ellipse from his childhood to his first act on stage, or show how Courtney fell in Love with him. Nor would I have minded if the film avoided some unnecessary gory parts that really didn't belong to the film.<br/><br/>The strength of ""Man on the Moon"" is that there is an inner fascinating charisma inhabiting the main character, and in a way the movie succeeded thanks to Kaufman's aura and despite the direction."
"kinslerz","10","0","0","22 June 2011"," He was so much more than an entertainer.
","In this 99' Milos Forman film, audiences get to experience a more peaceful character portrayed by Carrey, but equally(or more so) as colorful. Carrey plays Andy Kaufman, who throughout the film is constantly acting on his distinctive ideas to entertain the people around him. At the time the idea of being so clueless that you're making people laugh, was unheard of. People didn't usually like to be put into awkward positions, however Andy had this almost childlike trait that made people feel as if he was in fact a child at heart, at times. Andy is constantly putting peoples emotions at risk to get a real reaction and in some cases give people emotion that(even if it's a gloomy emotion) these 'victims' needed to feel to achieve a greater sense of humor or a more manifest view on what is important and what is needed to successfully execute your own life. He was so much more than an entertainer."

","The truth is that I should not have enjoyed this movie. First, I'm not really that interested in Andy Kaufman. To be honest I don't think I ever watched even a single episode of ""Taxi."" Second, I'm not a big fan of Jim Carrey. He has talent, but he usually overacts and goes way overboard rather than letting his talent shine through. Third, I honestly didn't think this movie was great, although based on the content and what it tells us about Andy Kaufman my reaction to it may have been what he would have wanted - I just found that after the first little while it became too much. My gut was telling me that this movie (and the guy portrayed in it) was plain irritating. So why did I keep watching? Because, for some inexplicable reason and in spite of all that, this movie worked somehow. Maybe it's because of how Andy was described by his girlfriend Lynne Margulies (played by Courtney Love) - he was ""a complicated person."" The complicated nature of Andy Kaufman creates interest, even if the movie itself isn't all that great. His life - portrayed here from his childhood to his death - was a complicated one. You wonder having seen it whether there really was an Andy Kaufman - by which I mean, did he actually have an identity of his own or was his identity completely caught up in and submerged by the characters he created and played? I found myself admiring his take on comedy - not going for the easy laughs but instead going for the gut reaction of the audience, whether that gut reaction was positive or negative; whether it caused laughter or anger. I can imagine that one would not walk away from one of his routines feeling neutral about him.<br/><br/>The other redeeming thing about the movie - my opening comments notwithstanding - is Jim Carrey. If ever there was a part that Jim Carrey was born to play I would have to say that it was Andy Kaufman. All of Carrey's excesses that usually bother me so much were on display here in abundance, but they seemed to be a perfect fit with what we were being told about Andy Kaufman. I've seen a fair number of Jim Carrey's movies over the years but now that I've seen this one I'd have to say that this is his signature part - in my mind anyway. It was a stunning piece of casting.<br/><br/>It's strange to say this about a movie that I can't say I liked all that much - but in spite of not really ""liking"" it I enjoyed it. I think Andy Kaufman might understand that reaction. Both he and the movie were ""complicated."" (7/10)"

","Director Milos Forman(One flew over the cuckoo's nest, Amadeus) has done some fine,gripping, funny dramas. I loved everyone of his films. Well, I haven't seen all of them. Just the ones that everyone's heard of. Like Man on the moon for instance.<br/><br/>Man on the moon is Forman trying something different. He's doing a biography(as he usually does), but this time he's aiming mainly for comedy. He's made comedy about a comedian, with a hint of drama. But the truth is, the film is hilarious. Thanks to the comic relief of Jim Carrey(Who unshamefully is my favorite actor), who gives the best performance of his career.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey plays real life comedian Andy Kaufman, who had a short run back in the late 70's and early 80's. I didn't know much about him. Telling from the film, everything to him was a joke. Like sexism, wrestling,fights, even death.<br/><br/>You see Kaufman go on the cheap sitcom Taxi. You see him go through his professional wrestling phase. You see him rise, you see him fall, like in all Forman films. And you see his life,and his death,portrayed very well.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey is amazing. Seeing him play both Kaufman and his alter ego, Tony Clifton, is awesome. He's in almost every scene,and we feel it. The film kept me laughing and in awe the whole way. Until the end, which I read about before I saw it. It gives you a little depression, until it turns around brings that smile back on your face.<br/><br/>Andy Kaufman was a man of vision and dare. He always kept you guessing. He still has me guessing now. As to what, I won't reveal. I loved this movie. It's not my favorite Jim Carrey film, or Forman film,, but it'sa severely underrated.<br/><br/>I think that the film is nearly flawless. I was so delighted by the whole thing. I did find one flaw. In The people vs. Larry Flynt, my favorite film, there are 3 actors. Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, and Edward Norton. It showed how great they could be. To me especially Courtney Love. She was fantastic. In Man on the moon, she plays Kaufman's lover. Here she doesn't get the same amount of screen time.<br/><br/>A lot of actors don't get a lot of screen time. Christopher Lloyd, Judd Hirsch, Carol Kane. I forgot to mention Danny Devito's role as George Shapiro. Shapiro discovered Jerry Seinfeld. And he discovered Kaufman. I can't blame the flaw that I gave as a flaw. It's just I wish Courtney Love had more of a role event today. She's great. And so is this movie.<br/><br/>A"

","Man on the Moon is a biographical depiction of the life of Andy Kauffman - An entertainer and stage/sitcom artist who took objection to people calling him a 'comedian'. He introduced himself as a 'song and dance man'. A truly multi-faceted performer who was loved and hated at the same time by people in his prime, he also was an inter-gender wrestling champion. Famous for his on stage set-ups, pranks and creation of fictitious characters, he evolved from a club performer to a man watched by 40 million people worldwide. This movie tries to shed some light on the personal ups and downs of Kauffman and the effects of his public life on his shaping up as a human. Even a premature death due to lung cancer did not mellow down the aura this man had. Man on the Moon looks at Kauffman's life as a chapter - Starting from childhood, to his prime days and ends with a question lingering in the minds of the viewer.<br/><br/>On the acting front, Jim Carrey lives the character of Kauffman. People will agree with me that no other actor could have given this movie and character the justice that Carrey gave. Danny Devito in his supporting act is great. There are innumerable characters in the movie (Some people playing themselves such as David Letterman, Jerry Lawler etc), But the power of Carrey's performance is such that we only remember him throughout and after the movie. Why not an Oscar Nomination for Carrey I ask? The movie has it's happy and sad moments which will leave a smile on the face or a tear in the eye of the viewer. I personally had goosebumps while watching some scenes namely :<br/><br/>1) The Christmas Act of Kauffman and appearance of Santa Claus . 2) The Philliphines Miracle healing hoax and the reaction of Carrey. 3) The Final Scene which I will not mention here.<br/><br/>Overall, surely one of the best biographical movies I have seen ever. Highly Recommended.<br/><br/>Rating : 8/10"
"rooprect","8","0","0","9 February 2010"," Andy Kaufman was the P.T. Barnum of our time
","I was in high school during the Taxi years & heyday of Andy Kaufman, and all I remember are the sensational rumors about how he developed a split personality, became obsessed with wrestling women (jello wrestling, as I heard it), and publicly self-destructed before disappearing into obscurity (I never even knew he died). Of course, that's not how it happened, but that was the chatter you'd hear in the hallways between classes.<br/><br/>This film is like the quintessential dispelling of a myth. Santa Claus is revealed, the Easter Bunny unmasked. Oddly enough, what we find beneath the shticky exterior is even more shticky than before. And we learn that the man was successful at what he did because he truly lived it.<br/><br/>Doubtlessly, you've heard Kaufman admirers refer to him as a genius, ahead of his time, and all the other obligatory accolades that are heaped on a misunderstood artist. But for the first time, I now understand why all these things are true, and if you watch this movie--whether you love him or hate him--you too will understand why he the outrageous things that he did.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this film may help give you an understanding of other bizarre artists. I'm beginning to appreciate what drives other avant-garde artists like Picasso, Godard & the Sex Pistols. But this is a lesson you'll never get in any documentary or art appreciation class. Here through comedy--the most un-pretentious art form--we can truly enjoy the madness without all the highbrow beard-stroking that often clouds the subject. Here we have it plain & simple, the cartoon version: the story of an artist who led a revolution.<br/><br/>Watch this movie. Then go to YouTube and watch the original clips of Andy Kaufman ...his wrestling exploits, his bizarre appearances on Letterman, his strange but true reading of The Great Gatsby before a confused and peevish crowd. This movie is the long-awaited explanation of all the madness.<br/><br/>I was expecting to see a depressing, tragic film about a young man's spiral into insanity and oblivion. Instead, I found the story of Andy Kaufman to be the ultimate victory, and I find myself strangely energized by the whole experience. The whole thing comes down to one laugh (in that powerful scene in the Philippines near the end). Laugh and the world laughs with you; cry ...and the world laughs with you :D"
"Isaac5855","7","0","0","15 December 2009"," Carrey's Remarkable Performance Makes this film work...
","The late Andy Kaufman was a tortured soul who wanted fame on his own terms and didn't care if others were in on the joke or not. This seems to be the permeating theme of MAN ON THE MOON, director Milos Foreman's rambling 1999 biopic about the comedian, who would achieve his greatest fame as mechanic Latka Gravas on the ABC series TAXI during the 1970's. This film explores Kaufman's humble beginnings in dingy comedy clubs to his unnerving appearance on the premiere episode of Saturday NIGHT LIVE, his tenure on TAXI and his invasion of the WWF, which ballooned into a full blown feud with WWF wrestler Jerry Lawler. The film shows Andy's consistent discontent with his success and how no matter what he achieved, it wasn't enough. This purely evidenced in Kaufman's obnoxious alter ego, Tony Clifton, who Kaufman tirelessly worked at creating a separate career for, despite the fact that no one was interested. The film aggravates as we watch Kaufman constantly put up roadblocks to his own success, but also fascinates due to the mesmerizing performance by Jim Carrey in the title role. Carrey channels Kaufman flawlessly, in a performance that's positively spooky in its accuracy and should have earned Carrey an Oscar nomination. Kaufman, I mean Carrey, gets solid support from Danny DeVito, who plays George Shapiro, Kaufman's agent and Paul Giamatti, who plays Bob Zmuda, Kaufman's co-writer and co-parter in conspiracy and the only one in all of Kaufman's jokes. Courtney Love's performance as the leading lady is a matter of taste, but it really doesn't matter because this is Jim Carrey's show all the way and he makes the film worth watching. The film also features appearances by Jerry Lawler, Peter Bonerz as TAXI producer Ed Weinberger and TAXI cast members Judd Hirsch, Jeff Conaway, Marilu Henner, Christopher Lloyd, and Carol Kane. A long but involving look at one of show business' most tragic figures and Im not completely sure that it's over."
"TRRkey","9","0","0","24 November 2009"," Great movie about Quixotic subject..
","Andy Kaufman was indeed very strange. I never thought too much of his shtick, ""Latka"" after all was a very pandering character who succeeded very well at precisely what it was supposed to do, namely appealing to warm and fuzzy instinctive maternality on a banal level, a television staple. His stage routines are also just vignettes of the fantasies of a lonely boy who grew up to be a textbook neurotic nebbish. Nothing very original, mostly just an updated riff on Cab Calloway, more pandering with ""Elvis"" and some lip-syncing interspersed with again, the puerile ""Foreign Man/Latka"" providing some schizoid emceeing. What gets my attention, is the negative (and in my opinion hilarious) energy exuded by his bits as ""Tony Clifton"". This is truly a hoot and is some of the best show business satire around though I think even this was derived from Bill Kirchenbauer's hilarious turn as ""Tony Rolletti"" on ""Fernwood 2-Nite"". It is also a tribute to the old borscht belt tradition of the ""tummler"" whose job it was to disquiet an audience in advance of a headliner (think Jack E. Leonard, Don Rickles etc.) This is where it all gets quite weird with Kaufman insisting on two plane tickets when he traveled etc. Kaufman was merely thumbing his nose at everyone (mostly the establishment, I hope). He even got away with it for a time until people wised up and voted him off SNL. As for Jim Carrey, you won't see any better acting, and the Milos Forman film is wonderful with many of the victims and co-conspirators in the cast. It seems the last laugh was on Andy because few people went to see a great movie about a man who did little to hide his contempt for the audience, milk and cookies notwithstanding."

","What is most important about the effect of this film is that it stays faithful to Andy Kaufman's intractable conception. Oh, it polishes things up slightly. Indeed, ""all the most important things in my life are changed around and mixed up for dramatic purposes,"" Kaufman tells us directly at the ingenious beginning, which is a brilliant tone-setter. Yet fundamentally it remains allegiant to his personage: A guy who would try you, lie to you and orchestrate laborious tricks and facades. The movie doesn't manufacture him into a tender, misread guy. And it doesn't grovel for laughs. When something is not working in Kaufman's act, it's not working in the movie, either, and it's not funny but excruciating.<br/><br/>Written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karascewski, the same writing team who penned Tim Burton's similarly visceral biopic of another obsessively off-kilter aspiring artisan, Ed Wood, this nuanced film has a monumental performance from Jim Carrey, who auspiciously vanishes within the character of Andy Kaufman. Carrey is as big a star as Hollywood has, and still rather early in Milos Forman's eighth American movie, we forget who is playing Kaufman and become enmeshed in what is happening to him. Carrey is himself an obsessive performer who will do anything to get a laugh, who wants to amuse, whose veneer is zany and saccharine. That he can extract the intricacies of Kaufman's comedic misery is quite awe- inspiring. That he can quench his own compulsion to kowtow takes a sort of maturity nobody expected out of Ace Ventura. Not only is he working without his own buffer, he's playing a guy who didn't know what that even was.<br/><br/>The film, written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, begins with Kaufman as a vexatious child in his room, declining to go out and play, preferring to host his own TV variety program for the cameras he perceived to be concealed in his bedroom walls. His material was compelled by poor nightclub and lounge acts. He understood that a live performance is seldom more intriguing than when it is going wrong.<br/><br/>This highly creative, admirably relentless movie, which because people are stupid ended the then nearly decade-long succession of Jim Carrey movies that had very successful opening nights, follows Kaufman into the L.A. standup circuit, where a talent manager played by real- life former Kaufman co-star Danny DeVito, sees something in his act and signs him. Kaufman is soon a sitcom star, a regular on Taxi. He presses for ""guest bookings'' for his ""protege,'' a hilariously repugnant lounge act named Tony Clifton, who is played behind seamless makeup by Kaufman and sometimes by his accomplice Bob Zmuda. Kaufman steadfastly refuses to admit he is Clifton, and in a way, he isn't."

","Watching Jim Carrey's 'Man on the Moon', I got a feeling that to entirely like the movie and feel for the character, you had to have been a fan of Andy Kaufmannn, the stand up comedian on who the biopic was based. As such, I did not know anything about him, and I left the movie with a strange feeling of detachment with the movie and the character it portrays. Unfortunately, it does not do a good job of endearing a newcomer to Kaufmann as an individual. This would have been fine, if we could identify to Kaufmann as an entertainer. Again, unfortunately here, Kaufmann's antics hardly seemed appealing to everyone. I, for one, did not find his stage performances depicted in the movie to be too funny. Neither did I think the World Wrestling antics with women and Jerry 'the King' Lawler (who makes an extended cameo in the movie) hilarious.<br/><br/>The movie started off on a disjointed note, with a scene of Andy performing in front of the wall in his room, believing that there is a crowd applauding him, before his dad puts an end to it. Then we see a grown up Andy (Carrey) performing in a rundown bar, and the patrons leaving halfway through the show. He is told by the manager at the end of the show that he has to let him go, as his act is just not funny enough. This is where I felt it dropped off for me. After this, Andy's rise as a stand up seemed to happen quick, and I did not see enough background of how and why it happened after the initial setbacks. However, a poignant thing about the film was how Kaufmann seemed to pull so many stunts that no one believed him, even when he mentions that he does actually have a serious condition.<br/><br/>Of the acting, Jim Carrey once again proves he is definitely not a comic wonder, and can do dramatic roles if given more opportunities. Danny DeVito as his manager and Paul Giamatti as his friend/sidekick do great supporting turns as well. Jerry Lawler also puts in an entertaining turn. Ultimately, I guess it depends on what you would consider as funny."

","What struck me about this film was the fact that even though I had not a clue as to who Andy Kaufman was prior to watching this film, I felt as if I had been hearing of him for the past twenty years after seeing it. This film told me about him very, very much and in a very, very realistic, non movie-like way...it did not dramatize every other minute and I felt as if I was actually watching his life story, not a fictional drama or comedy.<br/><br/>Also, I was glad to see that this film did not attempt to explain, nor attempt to find a cause in Andy's way of performing, his way of LIFE. In the end, the audience is left with the same thought with which they began watching this film: ""Why was Andy Kaufman so strange?"" Nonetheless, you do not find yourself disappointed once the ending arrives. What you are left with are joyous thoughts, intense thoughts...which is exactly what Andy would wish you to have.<br/><br/>And Jim Carrey - WOW. Many have said this and I agree with all my heart; Jim Carrey became Andy Kaufman for this role. When I got on the internet and watched a few videos of Andy, scenes which were featured in the film, but acted out by Jim, the resemblance was, at times, even frightening. Jim Carrey, the man who uses his typical facial movements in many films, was something absolutely different in this film. Of course, his ability to change his countenance was imperative, but in a completely new way.<br/><br/>If you are not looking for extreme Hollywood entertainment, but a wonderful film, this will make you smile."

Unless I'm terribly mistaken, this was given to me because I once could not get enough of Carrey. I'm still a fan, but I've realized, possibly due to this and The Truman Show, that not everything he's in is going to be a laugh a minute. I can't claim to ""get"" this release. But I certainly can't deny that it's marvelously done. The plot develops nicely throughout. The performances are pretty much flawless, even by the members of the cast who aren't actually actors. Lawler is not the first wrestler I've been impressed with the screen presence of, and he may not be the last... I don't see myself ever particularly appreciating their profession, but I am going to keep an open mind for seeing them in movies. The music is well-chosen and fits. The technical aspects of this really hold little, if anything, to draw negative attention to. The pacing isn't the most even. I'm not sure if this set out to do more than describe what Andy was like, and show us his life. I did pick up on a thing or two, but beyond that, I don't understand the man, his actions or truly know... him. Maybe that is the point. Perhaps he is, was, and shall remain a mystery. Regardless of whether or not I'm utterly missing what this is, it is a nicely done piece of cinema.

","Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey) has been an odd duck since childhood. Instead of playing outside, he often put on ""shows"" indoors, using puppets and his vibrant imagination. Although his father objected to his spending long hours alone, both parents love their son greatly. Now an adult, Andy does stand up comedy in the Long Island area but his routines are often greeted with stony silence, as the audience does not understand his sense of humor. However, a Hollywood agent (Danny Devito) catches Andy's act one night and senses something unique. He signs Andy on as a client and soon Andy appears on SNL, where he lip-synches the ""Mighty Mouse"" song and gets big laughs. This leads to a stint on a hit sitcom called Taxi, something Andy does not want to do, feeling that ""canned laughter"" television is the lowest of the low. However, as part of his contract, Andy will get his own television special, among other unusual demands. But, away from the show, Andy participates in bizarre wrestling matches and travels to college campuses where he often insults audiences. Just who does this Andy Kaufman think he is? This is a fascinating film about Kaufman, who was certainly one of the strangest ""stars"" Hollywood ever encountered. It is very difficult to say, even now, whether he was mentally ill or just highly unusual. In any case, Carrey is magnificent as Kaufman, leaving the audience to wonder if anyone else could have played this role. The supporting cast, too, of DeVito, Courtney Love, and Paul Giamatti is just terrific. The movie's recreation of the 70's and 80's, through costumes, sets, and art direction, is great as well. But, the story, which alternates between high humor, sadness, and outright disgust is as complex as they come, making the flick a difficult watch. However, if you love Carrey or harbored great affection for Kaufman himself, you MUST see this film. It's ""look-behind-the-scenes"" portrait of an unusual man is fascinating stuff."

","This is one of the greatest roles Jim Carey has ever made, and certainly a role he did enjoy. The story and character of Andy Kaufman, erratic stand-up comedian who refused to be considered as a comedian, who shocked the audiences with his behavior and tricks, and manipulated them up to the point that even his tragic malady and early death were considered a farce by many fit very well Carrey and gave him the opportunity to mix his facial and body expressions with a tint of tragedy and a feeling of permanent search for a more depth truth beyond his clownesque acts. Add to this Danny DeVito's performance - also one of the best in his career and we have all reasons to consider 'Man on the Moon' as good entertainment.<br/><br/>And yet I also had a feeling of exploit watching this movie. I never heard about Andy Kaufman before, but after having made some Internet investigation I got the feeling that the film tries to match quite closely what have been the more spectacular moments in his career, without adding too much information about who really Kaufman was. Sure, Carrey's act is more than efficient, and the story is told fluently as you would expect from a fine director like Forman, but the almost documentary remake of Kaufman's schemes, the involvement of some of the people who were really engaged with Kaufman while alive and the homages and unfit ending gave me the feeling that the authors did not really have something new to say about Kaufman but rather try to play on the same story and characters as twenty years earlier. This feeling did not have the fun one must have had watching Kaufman's real acts."

It really gets you going because the fact is still unknown whether or not Kaufman's death was a hoax or not. Some may believe others will doubt but if he still is alive, it would be the biggest prank the world has ever seen. This truly is a rare film because it handles a lot of delicate subjects but with the utmost care and dignity. Some may think wrestling is fake, others may not and Milos Foreman handled the subject in such a way, he tried to avoid the subject with comedy but he still wanted to convey a sense of reality. That's what this film is all about contradicting is reality. There are many answers to questions unveiled but you go back and you ask yourself, ""Did he just do that?"" or ""Did that just happen?"". I think everyone needs the comfort of this film because it'll definitely make you feel better.

Was he a crazy man? Maybe both? I done some research and discovered that Andy Kaufman was an American 'comedian', or some would say an 'eccentric'. Having downloaded some videos from the internet and done a hell of a lot of reading up on this man, I watched Man On The Moon a second time, and it did make a little more sense to me then. The movie doesn't concentrate much on his childhood, but goes straight into some bizarre performances in various famous comedy clubs, glimpses of his personal life, his sheer eccentricity through to his untimely death from lung cancer. I suppose most would say ""You either love him or hate him."" The truth is I just don't know. Jim Carrey's performance is pretty much spot on and very watchable if this is your sort of thing. Was Andy Kaufman a crazy man? I don't think so. Then again there's his alter-ego Tony Clifton, but that's a whole other story... I just have to summarise that I believe Andy was a very clever, brave and manipulative person. He WASN'T A GENIUS. He was just brave to be as bold as he was with his fame and celebrity.

But anybody will tell you that getting some good laughing will help feeling better.<br/><br/>""Man on the Moon"", a biopic based on the life of Andy Kaufman, acts as a strong message. It shows that annihilating every bit of seriousness can become a threat and not a remedy.<br/><br/>Directing a movie about Kaufman is very complex because the guy himself is very complex. Apart from his name, it was impossible to define Andy Kaufman. He was not an actor, neither a humorist, and especially not a comedian. ""I'm not a comic!"", says Kaufman himself in the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>So, Kaufman is Kaufman. And what about his performances? Easier to categorize? Well, what would you say about an artist who reads Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"" until the audience leaves or falls asleep, play conga drums restlessly and wrestles with women? Jim Carrey is the ideal guy to personify Kaufman. Not only does the physical resemblance is convincing, but Carrey himself is an out-of-ordinary actor who performed many different (and bizarre) roles since the beginning of his career.<br/><br/>Here, Carrey gets the jackpot. He gets profit from his emerging dramatic talent, but he stays in contact with his manic and hilarious manners, especially when he's on stage or on air. Carrey perfectly switches from the childlike Latka to Elvis Presley to the unforgettable Tony Clifton, Kaufman's stage alter-ego, who is also an horrible lounge singer and a dreadful person.<br/><br/>So, the character is bizarre and the actor is bizarre. Could the movie itself be bizarre too? Yes, it could and it is! Especially at the beginning. Frankly, have you ever seen a movie beginning with the end credits? The movie is good, but there's something missing. Or too many things. I think that both statements are true. There's something missing, because Kaufman did many more sketches than those presented here and it doesn't do justice to him. However, the movie performances are some of the most memorable of his career, but there are many, many of them and the movie becomes overloaded.<br/><br/>Apart from Carrey, there are not many important characters. Courtney Love appears as Kaufman's girlfriend but their relationship doesn't look very real. I'd say that the relationship between Kaufman and his manager George Shapiro, played by Danny De Vito, is far more personal and interesting.<br/><br/>""Man on the Moon"" feels more magical and surprising when you watch it for the first time, because there are many unexpected events which don't share the same appeal once you see them for the second time. Those who watched Kaufman performing know these events. There's the famous ""Fridays"" opening show on NBC, the Kaufman-Lawler incident and the 'death' of Eleanor Cody Gould on the Carnegie Hall stage.<br/><br/>""Man on the Moon"" is not a perfect movie, but it has some charm and its unusual content makes it worth a watch. You'll laugh a lot and you'll feel like you're a member of the ""Saturday Night Live"" or ""Taxi"" audiences. So, why should you avoid it?"

De Vito oozes sophistication (as well as pretension) as the typical manager. As usual, his humor is dry and his comedic timing is perfect. He makes up 35% of this film's quality by himself.<br/><br/>Jim's character is manipulated by everyone else in the story. His refined egotism is in spite of his oblivion to this, and he makes up another 45% of the quality by himself. I haven't seen a better performance than this by Carrey.<br/><br/>The other players in this film, while very good, all take a backseat to Carrey and Di Vito.

"ray-280","10","0","0","16 May 2006"," Mr. Fred Blassie And The Breakfast Mess
","The title of ""Man on the Moon"" was taken from REM's musical tribute to Andy Kaufman, a comedian/performance artist from the 1970s and 1980s who dotted the entertainment landscape of that era in many unforgettable ways.<br/><br/>Kaufman (Jim Carrey) is brought to life by Carrey in a way no other actor could have accomplished, and it is clear from the film that Carrey himself, and his over-the-top performances, had been influenced by Andy. One got the impression from the film that Carrey reacted as we might expect a Bishop or a Cardinal to react when told he is to play the Pope. Carrey's reverence for Kaufman shines through in every aspect of an incredibly deep, Oscar-worthy performance.<br/><br/>Carrey overshadows what is actually a very strong cast. Danny DeVito (George Shapiro) plays Andy's agent, and since those two actors worked together for years on Taxi, DeVito's personal history with Andy bolstered his ability to grasp the role. Shapiro is written as a man caught between a one-of-a-kind artist and the establishment attempting to profit from him by fitting him into their little box, a box Andy not only thought, but lived outside of.<br/><br/>Courtney Love (Lynne Margulies) was well-suited for her role as Andy's wife, much as she was suited for People vs. Larry Flynt. Her energy and feistiness made her believable as the one woman who could handle the man no one else ever could. Paul Giamatti (Bob Zmuda) is Andy's best friend and co-conspirator, and has gone on to much bigger and better things after an excellent performance here. Appearances are made by most of the rest of the cast of Taxi (except for Tony Danza), while other figures in the movie have their real-life versions blending in with the crowd, such as George Shapiro as a club owner who fires Andy, Lynne Margulies as one of the mourners at the funeral. Jim Carrey's ex-wife also appears as the waitress in the recreation of ""My Breakfast With Blassie,"" which also includes Jerry Lawler and Fred Blassie.<br/><br/>I never obsessed over Andy's antics as they were occurring, but I was aware of them. His ""Mighty Mouse"" theme performance on SNL's first show was a spoof of the ""musical guest"" concept (and brilliant), while the wrestling incidents, though staged, fooled almost all of the major media, who had grown so weary of pranks from Andy that they just assumed that his announcement that he had cancer was just another trick, but the ""punchline"" was sadly true, and Andy died much too young (35). It is true that Andy continued to bus tables in LA after working on Taxi, to keep his ""independence."" His reply to people who said he looked like Andy Kaufman was honest and brilliant: ""I get that all the time,"" he would say.<br/><br/>Of all of Andy's work, ""My Breakfast With Blassie"" is the one which history will smile upon the most. Of all of Jim Carrey's work, this film is likely to enjoy the same fate. It's a shame that the Academy did not take a grown-up view of a mature comedian giving a mature performance that rivals anything done by any actor of that year, or even historically.<br/><br/>The film captures Andy's brilliance, creativity, and refusal to change himself or his act for his audience, instead choosing to make us come to him and understand what he was saying, without any help or explanation from him."

","i never knew who Kaufman was. now i wish i had. this movie started out pretty slow. it was Jim Carey, doing a stupid voice that sounds like something i would do when i was around 10. then rolls the end credits, and i wonder if this movie is worth watching. 10 seconds of black screen later, i'm left in the dark, and wonder if this will be another 2001: a space odyssey trial of patience where fast forward becomes a blessing. and then things starts to happened. things goes a bit slow at first, but after a while, i'm twisting with laughter! Kaufman's way of building up expectation, and surprise is epical! seeing how he fooled everything around him, weaving them into his web of surreality opens your mind to how humans can fool themselves into believing almost anything. when the scene with his death came along, i did something i haven't done in 10 years with sincerity. i shed 2 tears, knowing that this fantastic person had died, at an age of 35. if you want to put this into perspective, know that i won't shed a single tear when my mother, or grandmother dies."

"Pedro_H","7","0","0","18 January 2006"," Interesting and watchable portrait of a professional dysfunctional
","When Elvis died some wag said ""smart career move"" and the same line can be borrowed for the subject of this film. Andy Kaufmann was half a good comedian -- half a weirdo so you could either laugh at him or with him (or not at all). You could even do a bit of both. His premature death allows him to be remember as a pioneer of alternative comedy rather than a cult performer who believed that simply by reversing expectation you could get a laugh or ""an experience"" -- even if you were the only one laughing or having the experience! <br/><br/>This bio takes the view that the real Andy was a bore and a loon and we spend most of our time looking at the on-stage version. The best and the worst of his gags that seem aimed to alienate any audience other than the doped-out college one (where there was never an empty seat according to this!) When he got voted off Saturday Night Live ""for life"" that was what the US audience really felt about him -- a one joke crank that they were tired of. Not that he thought of himself as a comedian -- he never told jokes per se.<br/><br/>Milos Foreman took on this project as part of his late ""sleeping"" period and just lets the camera run and run from middle distance. Film other material like this and it would look like a TV movie. The technique of looking at members of the audience to underline reaction is overused. Every one of them -- it seems -- wearing a brightly coloured shirt with a big collar! <br/><br/>Jim Carey is a natural for this type of material. He manages to look surprisingly like his target although he is a better and more rounded comedian. He is a first division comedian (he could sell out any venue in the world in minutes!) imitating a second division one. It would have been interesting to see a non comedian try and tackle the role and do all the stage business just to see how they would have coped. Or not.<br/><br/>All comedians think up wild ideas and stunts (indeed we all do) but very few of us act on them. AK did act on those impulses and while some are funny (or interesting) others are gross and simply rude. Andy, death took your life, but it saved your reputation. Your best ever gag."

","Honestly, I didn't know who Andy Kaufman was before watching this movie. Allow me to recreate the scene: I was about to sleep and I was watching TV (I think it was HBO, I don't remember), however, I saw that a movie called ""Man on the moon"" was about to start so I decided I was already tired of watching porn by that time at night and watched it.<br/><br/>OK, now that i think about it, it wasn't necessary to tell all that story,eh whatever. I found out some things after watching this movie, first, it wasn't Neil Amstrong's biography (thanks god), it was Andy Kaufman's, one of the biggest comedians in the world that I got to know better after watching this movie and searching for some taxi episodes.<br/><br/>And I think there's one point in his movie that gives a lot of sense to understanding Kaufman's attitude and that is that Andy worked to entertain himself, not to entertain his public.<br/><br/>That's the reason why he did a lot of crazy stuff that sometimes public didn't like, because he wanted to laugh, that was his priority, sometimes it was good because public laughed also, but that wasn't important for him, he just wanted to be happy like every person.<br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes is when he goes with the guru guy to try to heal his cancer disease and he laughs a lot wen he sees the guru is cheating on people, because that was a joke life played to him, he liked to play jokes for everyone and now it was his time.<br/><br/>And I think that's all I got to say, Andy Kaufman is a man on the moon, because he was different from all people, he didn't forget the meaning of life, do things for you to be happy, not always for the others and I think that's a lesson we all have to learn."

"anne-freaks","10","0","0","4 June 2005"," Andy Kaufman - who never told a joke in his life
","This movie is about a man who had never been understood, and who had never been really known by anyone. Andy Kaufman never considered himself as a comedian, he would rather have been introduced to everyone as a song-dance showman. He didn't want the audience to laugh. His real intent was to share his ideas with people.<br/><br/>Andy Kaufman was the biggest mystery of our world, and he took his real thoughts with him to his grave without telling everyone truly about himself. This movie tells about his extraordinary life... Andy Kaufman was 35 years old when a rare form of lung cancer killed him on the 16th of May in 1984, so he couldn't finish his ""mission"". This film was created to remind people of this strange man who wanted to push the limits of reality.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey's performance in Man on the moon really is stunning. He could give us the feeling that Andy just came back to tell his own life. Some people says that during the film they got the feeling Andy haven't died in reality, he just did the biggest joke in his life: he made his own biography movie. Well yes, this would be a real Andy joke. He was curious about human reactions, I wonder if he's laughing somewhere right now thinking how nicely he could fool us. <br/><br/>Maybe this film is not so entertaining for somebody who haven't a clue who was Andy Kaufman, or rather for somebody who just can't understand his peculiar slant of life, but it's full of thought-provoking ideas about human mind. Andy thought in a totally different way than people usually do, and that's what makes the whole story interesting. It drives you to get more information about him. Because he was special, just as special as this film is.<br/><br/>If you're not in the mood that you would want to think about the mysteries of human mind, about Andy Kaufman's unusual mind, then don't watch this film. Don't misunderstand, you must see this movie, but only if you feel like it. Then it's sure that you will like it."

","Before seeing ""Man on the Moon"" I had never heard before about Andy Kaufman. By reading some comments and plot outlines, I got the impression that this was simply another celebrity guy who projected an aura of eccentricity just to raise his publicity level (like quite many stars do).<br/><br/>However, I have to admit that watching ""Man of the Moon"" was definitely a shock. Portrayed fantastically by Jim Carrey (which gives an Oscar-worthy performance, here), this is a story of a talented man that brings you strong and contradictory emotions: At one point he can make you laugh, at another he can (intentionally) bore you to death; at one point he can make you berserk with his vulgar and rude jokes, at another you can become deeply touched by his strength and willingness to live and entertain his audience despite his grave illness. Andy Kaufman was truly a special man, who did not conform to any norms or rules of society, but whose sole purpose in life was to produce laughter with his own twisted way: Even if the product of his acts was not laughter but boredom, anger, or insult, he still was happy with himself as he thought he was doing the right thing.<br/><br/>The film is neither trying to make a hero out of Kaufman, nor a villain out of him; it depicts him in an objective way, leaving the viewer to decide for himself about what kind of man Kaufman really was. As I noted previously, Carrey does a stunning act as Kaufman; an example that shows how he wanted to identify with his role, is that during the filming he insisted to be called ""Andy Kaufman"" both on and off stage! (I read this in the IMDb trivia).<br/><br/>The rest of the crew are also superb, and the fact that some actors come from Kaufman's real-life circle brings an air of greater authenticity. Forman's direction is also up to the task.<br/><br/>Either you already know about Kaufman, or not (like me), I strongly suggest you see this movie. 8/10."

Yes, he is an unsympathetic character on the surface, but Jim also managed to show the occasional hint of the torture that Andy must have suffered. I was then further surprised by the sheer amount of duplicity that Andy used in his life. Yes, no doubt a comic genius, but one with a serious personality disorder. But show me a comic genius that hasn't. I think he would have loved to see how this film divides opinions. It was this he lived for: Making people wonder (not in awe, but as in 'I wonder what that was all about...') and it's good to see that long after his death people are still wondering.

I had recently watched Comedy Central's 'documentary' on Kaufman's life, released near the time this film came out (for mostly the same reason I first watched the film), so I had some idea what to expect.<br/><br/>What I didn't expect was for Jim Carrey to turn in a competent performance, much less a brilliant impersonation of a very difficult character to duplicate. He managed to give an accurate portrayal of Kaufman without excusing Kaufman's antics or asking the audience to really sympathize with him.<br/><br/>Kaufman himself never was funny, and never tried to be. He was a 'performance artist' (which is Artese for 'insufferable twit') who lived only for a reaction, no matter whether it was good or bad. A very different person from Jim Carrey, who usually strains so hard for any meager laugh that he's completely unwatchable.<br/><br/>I don't consider the film 'moving' - by the end, I STILL didn't care if Kaufman lived or died - but it was engrossing.

This was an excellent portrayal of Andy Kaufman, Jim Carrey is fully believable in this.  If the Academy actually paid any attention to comedies (well, this is more a drama, but being about a comedian, it does have its comedic moments) Jim Carrey likely would have received an Oscar for this.  He did get a Golden Globe at least, though."

"bregund","Null","0","0","23 May 2003"," Jim Carrey impersonates Andy Kaufman and the results aren't pretty
","Andy Kaufman was a one-of-a-kind genius, a man whose comic style transcended his persona.  The undeniable brilliance of Kaufman is that you never knew if he was kidding or serious; he danced on such a thin line that you always expected him to fall off on one side or the other.  There were so many layers to his personality that you never quite knew who or what you were watching:  was he acting or was he serious?  Kaufman was so far ahead of his time that many people simply didn't understand him, that's why he was voted off of Saturday Night Live in a stunt that he probably engineered himself.<br/><br/>Kaufman liked to push things to the limit. One of his bits was reading a book onstage, such as The Great Gatsby, in a dry, boring voice, then tease the audience by giving them a choice between playing a record or to continue reading.  After several minutes of continuously reading, interspersed by booing from the audience, Kaufman finally played the record, which was a recording of Kaufman reading The Great Gatsby.  <br/><br/>Carrey's performance in this film is good, but because Kaufman was such an original, then Carrey is largely relegated to aping Kaufman's television performances.  As everyone knows, impersonating a celebrity is funny for about five minutes, but when the impersonation is stretched into an entire film it becomes tired and pointless.<br/><br/>The secret to Kaufman was that he never publicly revealed who he really was. Like movies about space aliens or ghosts, once you personalize the mystery by identifying with them, you destroy their power to fascinate.  Because of his layered personality, no one could ever personalize Andy Kaufman, and that's why this film fails in his portrayal.  I don't recommend this film."
"dbdumonteil","7","0","0","27 April 2003"," Andy, did you hear about this one?
","Andy Kaufman was definitely a famous actor in the United States. However, in France, he still remains unrecognized. It was nearly normal that American cinema devotes him a movie. This is Milos Forman who took care of relating Andy's life and the result is a fair success. Forman had the good idea by hiring Scott Alexander and Larry Karasweski to write the screenplay. They wrote the screenplay of ""Ed Wood"" by Tim Burton and to write Andy Kaufman's story, they used the same methods as in Tim Burton's movie: they tried to relate Andy's life as precisely as possible and the result works. Besides, you could say that Ed Wood and Andy Kaufman were two characters who had similar points: they wished to impose their talent so as to go down in history, they had weird habits and unfortunately they had an unhappy end of life: they fell badly sick and died.<br/><br/>The less we can say is that Andy Kaufman was an uncommon and unpredictable character which shows had surprises in store. They were great ""trompe l'oeil"" and used to lead the public astray. Behind the dramatic side of the situations, Kaufman's shows turned out to be loaded and completely made-up. But in spite of his absurd performances, Kaufman used generally to reach his goal: make the public laugh and it showed his original talent. Moreover, Forman introduced a lot of liberty and movements during the shows that sometimes are close to the surrealism.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey is rather convincing in his performance and restitutes quite well Andy's personality. He skilfully avoids the third-rate acting. It shows that he's into the hands of a conscientious and serious film-maker who masters his movie. As a conclusion: a fair movie and a quite harsh biography."

","The night I was watching this, `The Thomas Crown Affair' with Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan was on the opposite channel. And now I regret missing the other film. Every 15 minutes I was tempted to change the channel, but I decided to stick with `Man on the Moon' to the end. <br/><br/>The film is disappointing to say the least. While it is an informal and marginally interesting character study, it's not a very likeable or enjoyable one. Partly, because we are presented with a rather unlovely character. Andy Kaufman isn't given much justice here. He's not the kind of person we want to route for, or really care about. Because of the film's accurate but rather gritty portrayal of him, he doesn't get our sympathy, nor do we give a damn about what happens to him.  <br/><br/>The majority of the film is made up of a series of dismally unfunny stand-up acts. We don't know if it's trying to be intentionally unfunny or unintentionally funny, but either way it doesn't work. `Man on the Moon' is deficient of the most basic `easy on the eye' qualities which really bring it down. It opens well with a black and white `credits' sequence but doesn't keep the audience compelled. <br/><br/>Jim Carrey gives a generally good portrayal of Kaufman, but some of the scenes are too far out of his depth. He still hasn't made a satisfying transition to steady drama. Tinseltown throwaway Courtney Love is surprisingly good as Kaufman's down-to-earth girlfriend but is introduced too late into the movie to make much of an impact. The rest of the performances from the likes of Danny De Vito, Paul Giamatti and Vincent Schiavelli are good enough. <br/><br/>It lacks dramatic shape and very basic qualities that are expected of most films. So `Man on the Moon' was an awkward project from day one. I suggest you give this one a miss. 4.2/10."

I know that I probably wouldn't like this movie if I had watched his shows and been an Andy fan for a long time myself.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think this movie is brilliant. The beginning of it is very much like Andy's performance concepts; everyone remotely intelligent realize that this is a joke on the people who are too stupid to understand.<br/><br/>I don't think very many of the viewers turn the movie off after this though - I've heard stories about people watching this movie in their homes and continously heckling it. That's the brilliant part.<br/><br/>Right now, the second last entry in this IMDB comment list is actually also an Andy Kaufman heckle .. it's so brilliant that Andy haters are still out there! Because when ""Man on the moon"" and Andy Kaufman concepts are funny, it is very much on the behalf of the feeble-minded viewers who demand jokes and entertainment(tm)(c).<br/><br/>This movie - a Hollywood production - actually dares to do what Andy did himself - just don't care about the people who don't understand it. I would almost go as far as to say it's a non-commercial film. Even, as the producers probably hoped, a lot more people get this humour now, I don't think Andy Kaufman will become accepted as a mainstream ""legend"" in my lifetime - probably never.<br/><br/>On the surface, you certainly don't see too much of the actual person Andy Kaufman in this movie. Would it have been possible to create a documentary for the Andy fans out there - documentary-style about Andy? I don't think so - I agree so much more with the producer and director's intent - to make the movie an Andy Kaufman performance - and only let glimpses of his life through.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey does an excellent performance - I would almost call him the number one typecast actor - and actually manages to make you forget Ace Ventura and The Mask completely during this movie. His best performance? I think so. I've really come to respect Jim Carrey a lot - to actually make his best performance as an actor a tribute to another comedian, and managing to envelope that comedian's unique style by means of his own acting - wow!<br/><br/>Again, to the people who are Andy Kaufman fans and didn't like this movie - I'm from Norway, I never knew about Andy until I saw this movie. But it spread the message. ;) I personally was instantly fascinated, because I could identify myself so much with him. Throughout my childhood, I liked to play with people's/audiences' heads the exact same way Andy did.

","When I first rented this, I was hoping it would be an explanation of Andy Kaufman's life.  I then discovered it was not.  This has been pointed out by several people who disliked the movie.  The beginning of the film is not very good.  It jumps from time period to time period (from his stand-up days, to SNL, to Taxi) and doesn't give you a chance to get to know the characters.  The first about half-hour to hour is boring.  However, after a while the movie finds its way.  It gets very funny (the humour derived directly from Kaufman's material) and at the same time moving.  By the end I found myself smiling from the very touching last 3 scenes.  But then I got to thinking about what the critics had said.  It really didn't explain Kaufman at all, and in a docu-drama-comedy such as this, that is a bad thing.  But I really enjoyed the film.  Jim Carrey gave an excellent performance (he makes you believe he is actually Andy) but I knew liked it for another reason.  I have finally figured out that the movie is not an explnation of who Andy Kaufman was, but instead a celebration of life.  It chronicles all the very, very strange things he did but it is always external.  We never hear why he did these things, and that is the point. That's probably how Andy wants it.  So if you're looking for a comedy that is also touching, this is a good film.  But don't forget, don't get this movie thinking it will explain Kaufman, because like many other people, you will be disapointed.  I am glad to know that out of the three movies directed by Milos Forman I've seen now, I've liked each one.  One other thing: R.E.M.'s song ""Man On the Moon"" played during the credits rocks!

","This movie will tell the viewer absolutely nothing about Andy Kaufman; all it does is rehash the external accounts of his premeditated self-destruction during the late 70's and 80's.  Carrey's performance is wasted in a useless script by someone who either did as little as possible to research Kaufman's life, or tried to and discovered it was impossible, or more than likely found his real life too boring to write a script about, and so we have this. <br/><br/>The song, Man on the Moon, will tell you more about Andy Kaufman in three minutes than this film will.  He was a performer who seemed fascinated by actors' self-destructive tendencies and seemed to want to recreate them, or just had such anger toward his audience (a common trait in actors) that he wanted to alienate them more and more in his acts.  We will never know, but the big question is, why would we care?<br/><br/>This movie gave me absolutely no insight into Kaufman's life, and whoever gave it glowing reviews read into it whatever they wanted to see.<br/><br/>Kaufman would either have hated this movie or loved it.  My suspicion is that he would have loved it.  He was a man who wanted people to know as little about him as possible, and this movie gives the audience exactly that.  <br/><br/>Two stars.  Carrey gave a great performance, but I'm disappointed in that he had the power to demand and wait for a much better (i.e., real) script, and didn't use it.

"chrisbrown6453","6","0","0","17 June 2002"," I came into Man on the Moon knowing all I knew about Andy Kaufman from watching those specials on Comedy Central shown in the weeks prior to the film's release.
","I left the movie knowing very little more. While the movie was entertaining, and Jim Carrey did a dead on Andy Kaufman, overall I found the movie to be lacking the answer to a very important question: Just who was Andy Kaufman?<br/><br/>
Anyone who watched Comedy Central has seen numerous specials on Andy Kaufman. From his odd stand up routines, to his stint on the highly acclaimed TV show Taxi, to his strange obsession with wrestling women, Andy Kaufman was a mystery to just about everyone. Was he a comic genius or just a nutcase? There is no denying that his strange brand of comedy has influenced many performers today, including the man playing him in this film, Jim Carrey. So when a movie was planned based on Kaufman's life, I was looking forward to finding out more about the man. What I saw instead was a rehashing of the public moments of his life, that I had seen before. Even a lot of those public moments were glossed over without a lot of thought and effort put into it. His entire five years on Taxi was done in a few minutes, and then not brought up again until the show was cancelled. His wrestling fixation, including his feud with Jerry ""The King"" Lawler was over and done with in a matter of moments. I will admit though, I was happy to finally find out the truth about their feud. For years, Lawler refused to say whether their relationship was real or fixed, and finally, the movie answered the question whether they really hated each other, or it was just another one of Andy's comedic moments. <br/><br/>What this movie played out to me as, was the Cliff Notes version of Andy Kaufman's life. He began as a standup, moved into TV, had a few TV specials, wrestled some women, somewhere in there meets this woman named Lynne (Courtney Love), then found out he had cancer and died. In between we saw some extremely funny moments from his public life, including his infamous Carnegie Hall appearance, but what we didn't really see was his personal life. We got to meet his best friend, Bob Zmuda, and his manager George Shapiro, but we didn't really get to see a lot of personal interaction between them. We meet his girl Lynne who he falls in love with, but we never got to see why? All we see is that he wrestles her, and then they fall in love, but for no apparent reason. We see the wrestling, the Mighty Mouse - SNL skit, the reading of the Great Gatsby, all legendary stories and performances. But not a lot else. <br/><br/>Maybe I was hoping for too much, that's happened to me a lot. But I would have liked to have seen more about the life of Andy Kaufman we don't already know. Things that went on behind the public performances; things that we didn't already know. Considering his best friends, and I assume most of his family, are still alive, I think it would have been easy to find out more about the private life of Kaufman, instead of rehashing the same tales we can see for free any Saturday afternoon on TV. Yes, a lot of the moments that were shown in the film were hilarious. And yes the movie was entertaining. But it wasn't as deep and personal as I had hoped it would be. Did Jim Carrey deserve an Oscar nod for this film?  Probably, but it seemed to me more that Jim Carrey was doing an Andy Kaufman impression, rather than becoming the man himself. Like one of my friends once said, when you saw Denzel Washington in Malcolm X you saw Malcolm X. It wasn't Denzel up there anymore, he became Malcolm. Jim Carrey, while delivering a great performance, was still Jim Carrey doing Andy Kaufman, rather than Jim Carrey becoming Andy Kaufman. And I don't really think it was his fault. It's hard to become a person so many people already know and love. Anytime you try and play an historical figure, it's difficult for the audience not to see the actor as playing a role (I think of Anthony Hopkins playing Richard Nixon). I see Andy Kaufman's facial expressions, his movements. I hear his voice and see his mannerisms, but I see Jim Carrey doing them. <br/><br/>So overall, Man on the Moon was an entertaining film, but not very deep. I thought the best part of the film was near the end, when Kaufman goes to the Philippines to try and get a mystical treatment for his cancer. And when he gets there, and is lying on the table, he sees that this ""mystical"" treatment is all a hoax, and for the first time in his life, the joke is on Andy. And as he realizes this, while lying near death, he starts to laugh and I think finally realizes what his audience and his fans thought of him. A man who played with their emotions and tried to get them to believe things that weren't true, who finally had the tables turned on him in the end. But that was the only part of the movie that I felt really showed who Andy Kaufman was. So while the movie was fun, it didn't show me anything new about the man, and I was really hoping to find out the answer to the ultimate question: Just who was Andy Kaufman?"

Although Kauffman is portrayed as a man of little patience and plenty of eccentricity it is not so obvious whether this is due to his complex personality or his simple desire to make it big in show business. There are many occasions where he uses his charm and wit to fool the audience with many on stage pranks. These 'pranks' continue to intrigue him and becomes central to all his shows including the highly publicized wrestling scenes . When Kauffman is reported to be ill, no one believes him and we are left wandering through to the end whether it is real or just another hoax. There were some nice moments in the movie like the trip he makes to Philippines to be cured of his illness but only to find that the treatment is just another scam. Towards the end of the movie the film loses all sense of reality as Kauffman is shown to be deceased but soon after is shown to be performing one of his caricature acts (Tony Clifton) or so we are led to believe.

","Who exactly was Andy Kaufman and was he a genius or just plain crazy (I opt for a talented mental case)?  Well, watching ""Man on the Moon"", the new film about the life of entertainer Andy Kaufman, who died in 1984 at age 35, will not give you any answers to the above questions or much anything else. Somewhat entertaining, this paper-thin film is basically a kaleidoscope of Kufman's famous routines thrown together randomly, a very expensive, but less informative A&E Biography.<br/><br/>""Man on the Moon"" starts off with a great opening credit, briefly touches Andy's childhood and basically shoots straight to his ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Taxi"" gigs and his other famous routines including his very obnoxious and hilarious alter ego Tony Clifton and his wrestling promotion stunts, which practically killed his career.  Director Milos Forman and screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski really make no attempt to explain what made Andy Kaufman tick, it's just one routine after another, with little personal information in between.  Just recently A&E's Biography presented an hour on Andy Kaufman and was much more informative and almost as entertaining showing basically the same skits that were recreated in the film, but instead of seeing Jim Carrey, you had the honor of seeing the original at work.<br/><br/>Speaking of Jim Carrey, he has gotten much press even before the movie was released about how he appeared on the set in character and never stopped until the end of filming.  He is also being mentioned for an Oscar nomination and has even been promoting himself on the talk show circuit.  My opinion, Carrey does a brilliant impression, but that is basically it.  He has all the mannerisms down pat, sounds like Kaufman, even looks like Kaufman, but it is more of an impression than a performance.  I can't really fault Carrey for this, but the screenplay really doesn't give him much to work with except to mimic Andy's routines.  That is a shame, because for the first time, I was able to tolerate Carrey and he was very grounded considering he was playing such a loose cannon.  Danny DeVito, as always, is very good as George Shapiro, the talent manager who discovers Kaufman at a comedy club and eventually managed his career.  Paul Giamatti also does fine work as Bob Zmuda, Andy's friend and writing partner.<br/><br/>""Man on the Moon"" also has some major flaws that should have never happened. Many of the characters such as David Letterman, SNL producer Lorne Michaels and some of the actors for the TV show ""Taxi"" play themselves.  This would have been fine if the film was set in the mid 90's, but they are really pushing the envelope considering that these events took place late 70's, early 80's.  Some of the ""Taxi"" crew look like waxworks, while David Letterman looks like he just walked of his show the other day and said ""Okay, let's shoot this baby, I have to get back to my set"". Come on, this is Hollywood, use some dye, wigs, make-up to make these folks look somewhat younger.  There is also a real cheap shot toward the end of the film.  Andy Kaufman is sick with a rare form of lung cancer and tells George Shapiro that he would like to perform one last huge production, then the film cuts to the extravagant concert that Andy did at Carnegie Hall.  One problem, this concert was done early in Andy's career, years before he had cancer. Talk about playing on the audience's sympathy.  And did we really need over a half hour devoted to Andy's pro-wrestling stunts, they were pretty boring back then, here they almost stop the film dead in it's tracks.<br/><br/>It was great to relive the highlights of Andy Kaufman's career and there is no denying his talents, but ""Man on the Moon"" left me feeling empty and I'm sure wherever Andy is, he is probably saying ""Tank you very much, but no tanks"".

It's a highly conventional movie, totally lacking in Kaufman's flair and style - especially his way of toying with an audience's expectations about what they're going to see.  The movie's opening minutes are clever, and approach a Kaufman-esque level, but just don't quite get there.<br/><br/>On the whole, though, quite a worthy effort from all involved."

","This biopic of the situationist anti-comedian Andy Kaufman isn't much; the unjustly decorated director Milos Forman doesn't appear to have contributed much to it except a bevy of painfully obvious, point-making reaction shots seen against Kaufman's dada stand-up. The great pleasure of the movie, though, is that it's mostly a series of Kaufman bits--he did this routine, then this one, then that one--impersonated and taken to the next level by a career-high Jim Carrey. The kicker is not that Carrey nailed Kaufman's funny-voice personae--you saw that coming--but how beautifully he nails the stony, beatific, bland ""real"" Andy voice. It's the kind of Rich Little performance that kicks the butt of nine out of ten ""transformative"" Method performances. Carrey's bits as Tony Clifton, Kaufman's Vegas-scumbag persona, are the funniest minutes of film seen this year.<br/><br/>The screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, having put the heads of Ed Wood and Larry Flynt on their living-room wall, went once over lightly on Andy Kaufman; their other biopics are screwy, ironic takes on the genre. Perhaps seeing the way Forman steamrollered their brilliant LARRY FLYNT script, turning an NC-17 RAISING ARIZONA into a swollen, Oscar-jerking tract about freedom of expression, they seem to have lazily just given the Czech genius what he wanted--boilerplate biopic stuff. (""You are insane, Andy...but you just might be brilliant!"") And every moment involving the grotesque un-actor Courtney Love as Andy's designated arm candy is deadly dull. But the movie is a Carreython, and it succeeds better at mining his talents--his scrupulous mimicry and his fiendish commitment to the extreme--than any of his more mainstream vehicley movies. How strange that the most attention- and love-demanding movie star of modern times could so well understand a diffident performance artist who never cared whether the audience would walk out. Wags will compare MAN ON THE MOON to the ""pious"" and ""hagiographic"" (and actually quite brilliant) Bob Fosse treatment of Lenny Bruce, but no matter: the movie is an anthology of performance moments, and it has a public-service value as a reminder to a young generation of one of the last moments when it was possible to be both deeply transgressive and a pop-culture figure your mom has heard of at the same time."

","I had very high hopes for MOTM considering Carrey's breakout in The Truman Show and Forman's history. I wanted to like this movie, but instead I was left with a technically superior film that had very little impact.<br/><br/>
Carrey's performance is little more than mimcry. I looked for him to humanize Kauffman or to at least personalize him. Instead, he opts for impersonation. While the impersonation is dead on, I wanted to see more elements of the person inside of his caricatures. I know Carrey can do impressions from his stand up and sketch career, I wanted to see him act and to show naysayers that Truman wasn't a fluke.<br/><br/>The supporting cast particularly Devito and Giamatti grounded the film and gave it a soul. Love's proven her acting prowess before in Forman's People vs Larry Flynt, so I question why the director hamstringed her with a script that left her the most generic love interest since Minnie Driver in Good Will Hunting.<br/><br/>As for the soul searching query that was supposed to be at the heart of the movie: Was Kauffman a genius or a quack? Very little is done to establish this in the first hour of the movie. He's established as a person whose career was never really in his own control and was more a victim of circumstance. Attempts to get to this in the last half of the film fall short because of a lack of establishment.<br/><br/>Production values, cinematography, and the music are excellent as I would expect  in a Forman picture, but they don't cover what I perceived as a lack of heart."

","The major complaint from critics so far on Man On The Moon is that it doesn't really attempt to explain Andy Kauffman.  But looking at director Milos Forman's previous masterpieces One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and Amadeus (1984), it is apparent that the filmmaker isn't so much concerned by the psychological make-up of his characters as he is in celebrating their individual freedom.  Andy is treated in the same vein as R.P MacMurphy and Mozart, a unique and charismatic individual who tries to break through the conventions and rules set before him.  Forman uses him as a symbol of individuality constantly fighting the accepted rules of stand-up comedy (just as Mac fought the rules of Nurse Ratched and Mozart's own flakiness set off Salieri).<br/><br/>Jim Carrey, of course, gives us a dead-on impression of Kauffman.  But Carrey's Kauffman is distant from the audience through most of the film (if Andy could be explained in full, no one would take the time to make a movie about him).  We mostly view Andy through the eyes of George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), Andy's long-time manager.  He is as perplexed as the audience by Andy's behavior, but he also realizes the ""genius"" at work (the sort of cycle Forman expects the audience to experience).<br/><br/>Man On The Moon, like most of Forman's films, is both highly entertaining (especially Jerry Lawler's performance as himself and the bits involving Tony Clifton) and moving (the final sequence).  It doesn't reach the plateau set by Cuckoo's Nest, but it is still one of the best five films of 1999."

""Man on the Moon"" delivers Kaufman act after Kaufman act after Kaufman act again. Jim Carrey executes them flawlessly. The movie has spills, chills, twists, sists, fits, and telephones(you thought I was going to say something that rhymes with fits, huh?). Besides the humor aspect, ""Man on the Moon"" shows a great portrayal of a man slowly loosing his world. If you're a Kaufman fan, you know the ending; all I will say is that it was so wonderfully done, that I was fighting back a tear or two.

Jim Carrey obviously threw himself into the role and gave it everything he had, and did a dead-on impression of him. But I guess I am one of the few people who couldn't forget that I was watching Carrey do a dead-on Kaufman, and also thought from time to time, ""Edward Norton resembled him much more"". Carrey is just too good-looking (he is a really handsome guy, when he's not making some horrible face) though he obviously gained weight, looked as unattractive as possible, etc. There was just the usual problem that biopics have, where you can't help but notice that the person playing them is much better looking ( though there are some exceptions to this rule). That being said, I still had a great time, and am not sorry I went to see it- I was quite entertained. (though I wish they'd included his sobbing-playing-the-bongos routine). A good movie to see on Christmas Eve like we did, with the Carnegie Hall scene and all, and it did actually make me teary. DeVito was great as his frustrated manager. Courtney Love was in it less than I thought, fortunately. SO, to sum up, though I'm not a big fan of Kaufman, (don't dislike him, just can take him or leave him) I recommend it for the performances and filmmaking. Also, it was fun seeing the cast of Taxi back in their old roles-Marilu Henner was the only one who couldn't pull off being 20 years younger (not trying to be catty- I really did think she'd look about the same, but it was obvious she'd lost weight and had some 'work' done on her face). There were some very funny scenes, and some touching ones - not a bad way to spend a few hours. But I don't think it was Oscar-worthy. For a nomination, maybe, but I'd still like to see Spacey get it. Yeah, I know, real bold choice on my part, but that's just my opinion."

While some tout Kaufman's originality this film had the vitality of a Wolfgang Puck tv dinner...yes, we know it's supposed to be gourmet food, so why does it go down like warmed-over meatloaf?<br/><br/>Kaufman, let's face it, was an unhappy guy who used his comedy to work through some deep mental problems and never quite succeeded.  Was he a genius who died at the height of his powers?  No, by this time he was a has been.  Of course it would have been difficult for writers and directors to write close to the bone with the knowledge that those who loved and cared for him would be watching (indeed were part of the production), but how could Foreman, etc., not delve into the self-hatred and contempt for audience which was clearly a part of Kaufman's act?  I say that with respect for the dear departed, I was a fan, but I wasn't fooled, surely we're more sophisticated about these sorts of things.<br/><br/>Watching this film reminded me of the feeling I got during the last few minutes of Truman Show, the directors and writers were opting to cut and run just when the story got good, when Truman was about to face the rest of the world, when the story might have a chance to say something original, nope, that was too risky.

I can only assume that the film seeks to provide insight into the life of Andy Kaufman (Carrey); show something of the man behind the act.  If that's the case, I am also forced to assume that writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski just didn't have much information to work with.<br/><br/>    For example, we learn very little of Kaufman's relationship with girlfriend Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love).  And as for the film's habit of revealing every single one of Kaufman's acts as fakes, mere practical jokes on the viewer, there aren't many people left who don't know that for themselves.<br/><br/>    The main problem with the movie is that much of it is simply recreations of Kaufman's varied acts, from the Saturday Night Live ""Mighty Mouse"" routine, to different clips from ""Taxi,"" to his wrestling performances with Jerry Lawler.  Carrey is an admirable Kaufman, becoming the late comedian so well that one forgets it's Jim Carrey up there.  But so what?  Anyone going to see the movie is probably familiar with Kaufman's act, and if they're not they probably won't find it that funny.<br/><br/>    I don't have much to say about this movie.  The basic plot simply runs through Kaufman's life from the time he gets his big break via George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), through ""Taxi,"" which he never really wanted to do, through his (entirely staged) run-ins with Jerry Lawler, and finally through his death.  The movie's ending is left intentionally ambiguous.  Did Andy Kaufman fake his own death?  Is the king of convincing pranks pulling a huge one on the world?  Probably not.

The recent MSNBC production of Headliners and Legends was much more interesting and delved much deeper into what made Kaufman tick.

","Several hours have passed since I saw ""Man on the Moon,"" and I'm still not quite sure what should be said about it.  It is a peculiar film, to say the least, and it is unique in that it is a comedy with a sad ending, even though it is not really a comedy.  (""American Beauty"" is a similar film in that it is a tragedy with a happy ending, even though it is arguably not really a tragedy.)<br/><br/>I should say first that ""Man on the Moon"" will doubtlessly receive a great deal of critical praise, and the main reason will be Jim Carrey's performance.  As a sort of a low-level movie buff, I can honestly say that I've seen a lot of movies, as well as a lot of great performances.  I do not think it at all presumptuous to say that Jim Carrey's performance as Andy Kaufman is not only the best performance of this year, but one of the best of any year.  I never thought I'd be able to say this, but I think Jim Carrey is one of the finest actors working today, as well as one of the most courageous.  Sure, ""Ace Ventura"" may not have come even close to making the A.F.I. list, but Carrey has grown and matured.  The first sign of this was with ""The Truman Show,"" a fantastic film which set a precedent for Jim Carrey performances yet to come, and ""Man on the Moon"" is certainly up to the standard.  Carrey deserves an Oscar for this role.  As a comic figure he will probably not get it.  The Academy never has taken comedians serious enough, so why should they start now?  In summation, it is unfair to say that Jim Carrey plays Andy Kaufman, because the performance is seamless. Rather, Jim Carrey IS Andy Kaufman.  Despite Carrey's immensely recognizable face, one forgets that it isn't Kaufman himself on the screen.  Perhaps the most amazing thing about Carrey's performance is that we still do not understand Andy Kaufman after seeing it.  If any other actor would have played Kaufman, they would have put their own unique stamp on him, making the audience think they understood Kaufman but in reality only understanding one actor's interpretation of Kaufman.  Here, Carrey steps into Kaufman's shoes and changes nothing.  In other words Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman, not Jim Carrey's version of Andy Kaufman.<br/><br/>Enough about Carrey's performance.  On to the actual film.  A fan of much of Milos Forman's earlier work (particularly ""Amadeus""), I was immensely disappointed with ""Man on the Moon.""  The overall quality of the film is jaunty, disjointed, and rather nonsensical.  Perhaps Forman's real flaw is that he realizes that Andy Kaufman is an unusual character and jumps to the conclusion that a film about him must be unusual as well.  The result is a mass of characters whose motivations and thoughts make no sense to us and a film that is flawed at best.  We should not understand Kaufman, but we should understand (mostly) everybody else, and this simply doesn't happen.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, ""Man on the Moon"" is a half-rate film which benefits immensely from a phenomenal performance by Jim Carrey.  My rating of this film is very high, I know, but this is largely due to Carrey.  If anybody else had played Kaufman I probably would have given the film closer to two stars.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****."

Most reviews I have read said this movie is funny, but there are others that just don't get it.  When I saw the movie, about 3/4 of the theater laughed with me, while others did not.  So let's make it clear.  If you did not like Andy Kaufman, or at least did not find him interesting, you will not like this movie.<br/><br/>However, if you were amongst Group A of Andy viewers, go see this movie. Never before has a star of a movie been more deserving of the phrase ""(Actor) is (Character)"" than Jim Carrey in his incredible portrayal of Andy.  It's just about perfect.  Voices, mannerisms, even eye movements.  A lot of times you see biographies of famous people and you can't get the fact that it isn't the real person on screen out of your head.  Not in ""Man On The Moon.""  After all, Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman.<br/><br/>The rest of the performances are strong, and so is Foreman's direction. Another criticism of the film I've read quite a bit of is that the film does not offer enough insight into Kaufman's head, instead just giving a ""best of"" series of his material.  To that I offer that Kaufman was so insane and obsessed with keeping the audience guessing that what he was ""really"" like is irrelevant; or perhaps that the ""real Andy"" wasn't much more than the sum total of Latka and Tony and who knows who else.<br/><br/>Though it's just my opinion, while watching, I kind of got the feeling that the film was constructed like one big gag that Andy would pull.  You think you're in on it, you laugh, then you think it isn't real, you stop, then you think it's a joke, then you don't know what is what.

He was a man who wrestled women while spouting chauvinist doggerel, who read aloud from ""The Great Gatsby"" to an audience expecting easy laughs, and who gave audiences expecting smiling, sweet Andy a loathsome, abusive lounge lizard named Tony Clifton (who Andy emphatically denied was himself under makeup).<br/><br/>It really hit a personal nerve with me, hearing Andy say that he was not a comedian, that he was not interested in going for ""cheap laughs"".  He wouldn't pander, he wouldn't dumb down, he wouldn't betray his peculiar vision of entertainment, which basically consisted of seeing how much ridiculous, inane, and upsetting stuff he could get away with under the aegis of ""entertainment"".  And he was HATED for it.  I've been in that boat...not on the same immense, national scope as Andy, obviously, but it hurts, even if it's just coming from a room full of twenty drunks.<br/><br/>But he stayed true to himself, to his unusual, idiosyncratic vision of things, to the bitter, painful cancer-ridden end (at least we think it's the end...).  I haven't been onstage in six months, and after seeing the film, it made me want to get back up there more than ever.  So what if they boo? So what if they don't get it?  Do what's yours, make your mark, and fulfill your dreams.  That's the message of ""Man On The Moon"", and it's the heart and soul of the entertainer that Andy Kaufman was with every breath he took."

","This movie does a good job recreating Kauffman bits, but there doesn't seem to be much of a story here. They don't explore the relationship between Love's character and Kauffman. They use creative license in places, so why not go all the way with it and put a movie together that works. Why Danny DeVito is playing Shapiro rather than himself still baffles me. Joining DeVito in producing this movie is Robert Shapiro and Bob Zamuta. I can see why these characters came off so good in the movie. Not an ounce of friction between them and Kauffman. Lawler does a good job. Carey must not have done his homework very well when it comes to Lawler, thinking he had to bait Lawler for real to get a good performance from him. I wish good ole J.R. (Jim Ross) commentated like he did back in the 80s, rather than his 90s style of speaking in soundbites ""Oh my! Oh my!"". Here's an interesting note: Summer 1998 Tony Clifton was at Hugh Hefner's Midnight Summer's Dream party. He was going on and on about being in a Milos Forman movie. So was that Carey, or Paul Giamotti?"

Although I was a bit frustrated with the lack of exploration into Kaufmann's childhood in beginning of the film, I soon realized that the film did not deeply explore certain aspects of his life because nobody (even those closest to him) did not know a whole lot about him.  I then realized this movie was perfectly capturing this enigmatic character.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey's performance is absolutely phenomenal.  He captures the essence of Kaufmann's insanity, while still allowing him to be human when they show Andy with his performance ""hat"" off.  Being completely ripped last year by not receiving an Oscar nod for ""The Truman Show,"" Carrey should gain his long-deserved respect from the Academy this year.  If it does not happen again, it will be an absolute crime.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole is also tremendous, with Milos Forman doing a top-notch directing job with this bioptic.

","In my opinion, Man On The Moon is a great movie.  This movie was released when I was in 8th grade and I remember seeing the trailer for the first time while watching Saturday Night Live's 25th Anniversary special which had been shown on a Sunday in October of 1999.  By the time the film was in theatres in Decemeber, I had seen a lot of reruns of TAXI and some other real life performances by Andy Kaufman.  I became fascinated with his material and acts he put on people.  I was young and I couldn't distinguish what things were real and what things weren't with Andy. When I saw this movie in theatres at age 13 I thought it was great. Jim Carrey, I thought was the best possible actor to play Andy Kaufman.  He did an awesome job imitating Andy Kaufman's alter ego Tony Clifton.  I loved the fact that Milo's Forman decided to bring back the majority of the cast of TAXI to play the roles of themselves 20 years ago.  I didn't like the fact that DeVito didn't take on the role of Louie DePalma in addition to him playing Andy's agent George Shapiro.  I think it was awesome how HollyWood recreated the set of TAXI.  The Man On The Moon soundtrack is just as good as the film itself, it has great songs on it most of which were by R.E.M. I think Man On The Moon has to be the greatest film based on a real life figure.  I liked this movie and I think Andy Kaufman was a genius and one of the best entertainers that ever lived.  A lot of people believe that the man still lives and from what I have seen and read about Andy Kaufman, I would not be suprised if he was still alive and returned in 20-25 years when people least expect it, but I do think if he was still living he would have returned when this film came out.  All in all this is a great movie- 4 out of 4 stars."
"ian willmore","Null","0","0","3 May 2002"," Goofing on Elvis, ABC, Shapiro, You, Me and the Audience ...
","The greatest comedians are those who do not care about being loved. Charlie Chaplin and a legion of lesser lights are exiled from my comic pantheon because they simper at the camera and at the audience. They look arch or hurt or helpless. Quite consciously, they appeal for our affection. They ingratiate; pathos is their effect of choice.<br/><br/>But Tony Hancock, W C Fields, Buster Keaton, Sid Field and other greats either do not care at all about our feelings or positively revel in our disapproval. They snarl at the camera, they sneer at their fellow human beings, they behave appallingly, and as a result they suffer outrage piled upon humiliation. They would die rather than appear pathetic. But they are indomitable and undefeated to the utmost end, and so we love them despite themselves.<br/><br/>Andy Kaufman took this comic insight to hitherto unheard-of extremes. In pursuit of the World Inter-Gender Wrestling Championship he would reduce halls of middle class women to howling hostility. In search of revenge on a college audience that wanted only to see his character from the sitcom ""Taxi"" he  would assume the persona of an English gentleman and read the Great Gatsby from beginning to end without pause or inflection. As louche lounge singer Tony Clifton he would start by demanding that the audience extinguish their smoking materials (""There is an ARTISTE on stage!"") and then light up a particularly smelly cigarette. Often only Andy, his faithful sidekick Bob Zmuda and (if they were lucky) his agent, family and girlfriend would be in on the joke.<br/><br/>""Man on the Moon"" was a commercial flop in the United States and received very mixed reviews. Many Andy Kaufman fans expressed purist disdain for the movie's use of facts, although for a Hollywood movie it is really pretty accurate. Many movie critics thought Kaufman too trivial a subject for Director Milos Forman, whose previous subjects included Mozart (""Amadeus""). Others just won't take Jim Carrey, who plays Kaufman, at any price, and having seen a number of his other films I can sympathise with this position.<br/><br/>But they're all wrong. This is a good movie, with a magnificent central performance. Carrey's portrayal of Kaufman is by far the best film work he has done to date, and shows you just why so many film insiders spotted him as a future star. (Theorists of the decline of Western civilisation should find support in the fact that US audiences neglected this movie but flocked to ""Ace Ventura, Pet Detective"".)<br/><br/>Carrey's impersonation of Kaufman is remarkable - particularly since Carrey's angular features little resemble Kaufman's moon face. Sometimes - heresy as this will seem to Kaufman fans - Carrey is actually superior to the original. His Elvis Presley impersonation, the shock conclusion to the famous ""Foreign Man"" routine, has Kaufman's effort knocked cold. Of course, Kaufman did it first, but I think he would be the first to admit that Carrey does it better.<br/><br/>Sometimes Carrey misfires, but I doubt if any other actor could have done much better. His TV appearance with 50s puppet Howdy Doody appears as dull and pointless as the ABC moguls say it is, despite Danny de Vito's attempt in the role of Kaufman's agent to talk the performance up. But track down Kaufman's original, which is easy to find on the Internet, and you will see just how touching and beautiful it is. Kaufman had the capacity to bring his childhood wonder effortlessly and touchingly the surface, and to make us feel it too. Now we see Howdy Doody not as a lump of wood with strings but as a real and much-loved childhood friend who has been lonely and bored for fifteen years in his box, since his TV series was cancelled. Carrey is too knowing, too arch, to bring this effect off - and there is just that hint of a need to be liked ...<br/><br/>Forman also misses some chances to explore hidden parts of Kaufman's strange personality. At one point it is revealed that he regularly visits prostitutes, apparently in a variety of disguises, but this is never explored. (Andy Kaufman meets Belle de Jour - that would be a scene worth filming!) But Forman has a strong sense of narrative drive, and Kaufman's life is weird and gripping enough to hold the attention throughout. Episodes such as Tony Clifton's magnificent demolition of an episode of ""Taxi"" had me shouting with laughter. (The original cast of ""Taxi"" helps the effect a great deal by sitting as stony-faced through the Clifton outrages as they must have done when Kaufman first unleashed them.)<br/><br/>Supporting performances, particularly by Paul Giamatti as Bob Zmuda, are generally strong. The title song by REM is a delightful celebration of Kaufman, a man who was loved despite all his best efforts. There are some splendid shock comic effects, for example when Tony Clifton is performing on stage and Kaufman appears behind him. There is a pleasantly ironic final scene, which far too many viewers take literally (as you will see from the Frequently Asked Questions part of the Kaufman website). Even Kaufman's funeral, which might have been mawkish in the extreme, works rather well, and in the opening and closing moments Carrey frames the whole film much as Kaufman himself might have done.<br/><br/>I became a fan of Kaufman's after seeing this film. I think that's the best recommendation I could ever give it. Go see it with an open mind and I hope and believe that you'll agree."

","One excellent film that has been criminally overlooked by pretty much everyone. Ask someone in the street if they have have seen man on the moon and they will either mumble something about Neil Armstrong or say they've heard the song (which does appear at the end of the film). The Golden Globes recognised this film as great and awarded it as such.

His involvement with the Farrely Brothers leaves us with quite hopelessly crude and unfunny nonsense. In this film, however, his performance is unflawed as it tells the tale of bizarre artiste Andy Kaufman. Kaufman seems to have been at the very least an aquired taste. The film is gripping from the start as you are taken through some unbelievable scenes of Kaufmans early days to the even more bizarre days of his succesful time. His alter-ego of Lounge Lizard Tony Clifton defies description. Kaufman's aim seemed to be to push boundaries further than they could ever be pushed.  But it's a very moving film as he falls ill and, after getting everyone to realise he really was ill, he shows a childlike naivety and desperation when he goes looking for a miracle cure. Courteney Love is brilliant as his lady and Danny De Vito is outstanding. Whether you knew any of them or not, this film will leave a mark."

","Nothing really to spoil here.<br/><br/>Jim Carey and Andy Kaufman in someways are similar. Both were over the top. And, in some ways, it's dangerous. However, Jim threw himself into Andy's head, and at some times I think he was possessed. At some times, Jim tended to play ""Andy the Character"" as opposed to ""Real Andy"", though who really knows what that was.<br/><br/>I wish they would have had Jim play Andy a bit more straight when he was off-stage in private, though it's quite possible this is not a far stretch from reality. In many ways, Andy's private image has remained an enigma to the public, but I suppose Andy would want it that way, and would rather be portrayed a bit more over the top in ""private"" than he may have been.<br/><br/>Of course, with Kaufman, this eventually backfired on him when he was suffering from cancer and the world thought it was a joke (Jim hasn't blurred the line like Andy did).<br/><br/>Historically, they got a lot out of sequence (again, for dramatic purposes). Still, it was pretty nice, and I was pleased with how it told the story. The acting was solid, and Danny DeVito was interesting to see as his manager (since we see most of the rest of the TAXI cast in it as well as themselves).

","With 'Man On The Moon', director Milos Forman has produced an appropriate tribute to comedian Andy Kaufman in that he has tried, successfully in parts, to blur the lines between Kaufman's twisted imagination and reality. The audience is left questioning sometimes which parts of the film are the reality in Kaufman's life, and which parts are just a stunt created by Kaufman.  The film is slightly frustrating because of that, but it's probably the way the director wanted it.  The opening sequence is superb, accenting the sense of humour owned by Kaufman.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey's performance is outstanding in a part that's perfect for him as it allows him to show both his rubber faced comedy talent as well as his potential for serious acting.<br/><br/>The main fault with the film is the amount of information it tries to get in in too little time.  Trying to fit an entire mans life into 2 hours is difficult and will lead to bits being cut short, and that is exactly what happens in Man on the Moon.  Kaufman's rise to fame is barely documented, although his fall from fame is given a lot more screentime and so I'm guessing that it was decided as more important, which is fair enough. <br/><br/>

"hymanroth","Null","0","0","3 October 2001"," It's not a comedy - that's why it isn't funny
","I've just finished reading most of the 400+ comments on IMDB regarding Man on the Moon. Most people seemed to have missed the point - this film was never supposed to be a comedy, notwithstanding the fact that it stars Jim Carrey (funny guy !) and is about the life of Andy Kaufman (who was regarded by many, if not himself, as a comedian).<br/><br/>Director Foreman attempts within the limited timescale and framework offered by a movie to capture the essence of Andy Kaufman's undeniably unconventional character. As such I would judge the film a great success. You leave with a definite feeling of having 'met' Andy Kaufman. In the end you feel more than a little frustrated with him for not being more funny, for not being more compliant; for basically not chilling out and relaxing a little bit....<br/><br/>He appears to have been a pretty unique and driven character. His unwillingness to conform both onstage or offstage comes across with startling clarity. This creates a definite sense of unease and apprehension in us, the viewing public, since we've been taught\brainwashed to always empathize with the leading character. This is the source of all the negative comments regarding the film....but that's not the point !<br/><br/>Regardless of whether we like Kaufamn or not, Foreman's film gives us a very lucid account of what the man was like. Add to this Jim Carrey's stunning performance, aided by a strong supporting cast, and the film succeeds brilliantly in its primary goal - that of transmitting to us a very basic idea of who Andy Kaufman actually was.<br/><br/>Man on the Moon is an intense, well acted  and ultimately moving biopic. It's not a comedy."

","I've heard mixed reviews about this film. I think the reason many people don't like it is that they just don't get it. Or that is to say they just don't get Andy Kaufman. But for me that was one of the many things that made this movie work. No one really understood Andy Kaufman, you shouldn't try to understand him, it won't work. But you can admire him.<br/><br/>My only reference to Andy Kaufman prior to the release of this film was as Latka Graves in ""Taxi""- apparently the complete opposite of what Andy wanted to do. Normally I can't stand Jim Carey but here he shines in one of his better roles. He won a deserved Golden Globe, something he had done the previous year for The Truman Show. It's a shame he doesn't do more films like these, they bring out the best in him. The supporting cast does well as well, particularly Danny DeVito as George Shapiro.<br/><br/>All around this film is well done, bringing out, as best as possible the true nature of the energetic and enigmatic Andy Kaufman. Those with a black enough sense of humor will laugh too at the dark, bizarre and sometimes so-not-funny-that-it's-funny jokes and pranks that made Andy that very special person he was. Do not expect to see the soft hearted Latka Graves- expect something like you've never seen before. Watching Andy Kaufman (even if played by Jim Carey) for two hours straight may be a little too much for some people but this is an important lesson in humanity, as well as an interesting story of an understated man, to say the least."
"jimmyg67","Null","0","0","3 September 2001"," Carey proves his worth in this superb dark comedy.
","Man On The Moon, produced by Danny Devito and directed by One flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest director, Milos Forman,  deals with the tragic story of Andy Kaufman who's comedy was so real, his close friends couldn't even tell when he was joking. His entire life was a song and dance act and such comedy came to be expected of him. It is how the film and Carey portray Kaufman and Hollywood that is so interesting and highlights a part of American life. In a media obsessed culture, Hollywood films are known to follow a general format. They have a clear beginning where the viewer's attention is usually grabbed dramatically, a clear middle section follows and the film ends with a climax and closure. It was people like Andy Kaufman who exposed this well known method of entertainment, mocked it and generated a great deal of laughter in the process. The film itself manages to stay away from the usual format, partly by the subject nature and Kaufman's erratic behaviour but also by Carey's incredible and realistic performance as the comedian and Forman's unnoticeable and fluid direction. It seems the story almost tells itself. The reality of the film is further strengthened by the appearance of most of the original cast of the sitcom, Taxi, of which Kaufman received great reviews for his part as the almost incoherent yet enigmatic, Latka Gravas. The wrestler Jerry Lawler is also included in the cast as yet another of Kaufman's victims of comedy. The comedian wrestled women wrestlers for a time before challenging Lawler to several matches.  He very cleverly worked Lawler into a rage in front of a live audience on the Late Show with David Letterman and then proceeded to shout obscenities that fitted perfectly with the situation. Had it been anyone else, such as the not so enigmatic Madonna, it would have just appeared childish and rude. The irony of such acts was that Kaufman and Lawler were friends behind the camera, but Kaufman lived out such lies so convincingly on stage and screen. The beauty of the film is that it feels like watching the real Kaufman and his gift for comedy is not lost on Carey who scores another credibilty credit, following his other noteable dark comedy, The Truman Show.  The film also highlights how human nature mocks what it does not understand as Kaufman was thrown off the Saturday Night Live Show and cancelled by many theatres. In capturing the comedian's talent and worth with an excellent supporting cast, Man On The Moon offers an engaging tribute to a still, very under rated comedy figure."
"natedogjr","Null","0","0","3 September 2001"," Maybe there was no ""real"" Andy Kaufman. Maybe he was different. His movie certainly was.
","Andy Kaufman was a complicated individual - that much is certain.  Whether Milos Forman's Man in the Moon is a fitting or even proper tribute to him is not.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey amazes the audience with his portrayal of the late comic who wasn't really a comic at all.  Kaufman believed himself to be a performance artist.  He wasn't trying to make people laugh; he admits in the movie he doesn't know what funny is.  Instead, he simply wanted a reaction from them. Whether he was booed or cheered was a moot point with Kaufman.  ""Every time I go on stage, the audience expects me to shock them,"" he says in the movie. Unfortunately, great movies, regardless of subject matter, make you cheer, and Man on the Moon leaves you puzzled.<br/><br/>Perhaps the filmmakers simply wanted to puzzle; that was really the true essence of Kaufman.  Audiences eventually grew weary of his pranks and shenanigans, and the movie audience does the same.<br/><br/>The movie's first few scenes are well done, leading up to the meat of the film.  You know, the part where the writers explain why Andy Kaufman was the way he was.  Except that never happens.  Midway through the movie, I thought to myself, I am learning a few things about Andy that I didn't know before, but I still don't know why he did them.  The same question perplexed me as I exited the theatre.<br/><br/>Man on the Moon is not a bad movie.  The film succeeds in telling Kaufman's story, somewhat from an objective, third-person point of view.  But that is really the problem: people don't go to movies to brush up on their history, they go to learn about what makes people tick.  They go to meet the real person, but they won't meet him in Man on the Moon.  Says Carrey to his girlfriend, played by Courtney Love, ""You don't know the real me.""  She replies, ""There isn't a real you.""  He replies, ""Oh yeah - I forgot.""<br/><br/>
Is this the writers' excuse for the lack of substance, or is it really true? Of course, most people believe that each person has an ""inner self,"" no matter what they show the world.  Maybe there was no ""real"" Andy Kaufman. Maybe he was different.  His movie certainly was."

","Devito's line about - Who are you trying to entertain? Your audience or yourself? best sums up this movie. It's a pity this is not explored more in the script. Instead we get Carrey, acting as Kauffman, entertaining himself (and annoying his audience - and me!).<br/><br/>That's not to say Carrey's performance isn't brilliant. I could swear he WAS Kauffman, it's just that the subject matter didn't make for a good film. Or at least I think they explored the wrong angles of an interesting if unlikeable subject matter."

","After Foreman's ""the people vs. Larry Flynt"" ,this movie is another excellent example of the director's ability to get the ultimate performance out of his actors. Again the story is about a misunderstood individual who chooses to follow his own ideas rather than limit himself to the standard ideas set by the world that surrounds him. Just like most of Foreman's work he seems to want to make tribunes to people who were really brilliant and suffered for it. Carrey gives an absolutely fantastic performance, and in my eyes is so good that this movie is indeed already a classic."

","As I heard, the film Man on the Moon` tells Andy Kaufman's biography quite authentically. I didn't know the man before but he must have been really hard to handle. He provoked lots of ethic discussions, and the film corresponds to them. For people who haven't taken part in the excitements Kaufman caused at that time, the ethic questions appear during watching the film. Is it funny what Kaufman does? Does he intend anything special with it? How far can he go and when do we start feeling betrayed? Actually, Kaufman himself seems to have had more fun on stage than his audience.<br/><br/>Man on the Moon` is not told like the biography of a man we already know. Maybe Kaufman fans will be bored because there are no surprises for them. But at the end and in the end Forman carries Kaufman's humour one step further and, by doing that, gives him an appropriate reference, I think: the way he directs Kaufman's death is as ambiguous as the way Kaufman would have done it: It outrages one part of the audiences and makes the other part smile sadistically. <br/><br/>Well, I liked it."

","I actually don't know if i'd have liked Kaufman if I 'd got to watch any of his performances, but from what I saw in this movie, he wasn't very funny. Notwithstanding that, I sympathized with him watching him go through all those ups and downs; and that's all due to the excellent direction and acting - mostly, of course, Carrey's acting.  DeVito and Love may do their best in this movie, yet it seems that there's not much space for them and the characters they impersonate end up seeming  a little shallow. Apart from that, though, this is a very good movie, whether we like Kaufman or not; because, in my humble opinion, we're supposed to comment on the movie here, not him.<br/><br/>When he's not making all those weird faces in crap movies, Jim Carrey is a brilliant actor.

It's not really a funny movie.  It's more of a serious movie about a really strange guy's life.

Everyone is selfish at times, but I think his main goal was to entertain other people, no matter how bizzare - how is wanting to entertain others selfish? I think people are just put off by originality and reject the first thing thats different and to me, thats wrong.

","This is a strange kind of biopic, hardly looking at all at Kaufman's life offstage and away from the cameras; while Carrey puts in an adequate performance as the crazy non-comedian, and we learn lots about the kind of things Kaufman thought were funny (though, as Danny DeVito's character frequently points out, only to him, not to his audience), the filmmakers scarcely bother looking into the man behind the loopy stageshows. After a few seconds of one moment of his early childhood, we skip straight to adult Kaufman, already quite weird and with (suggested) compulsive-obsessive disorders aplenty, his odd, not-that-funny act already fairly developed. Though the storytelling is often touching, the performances fine and the ending quite poignant, it is quite a superficial story, with little to interest anyone familiar with Kaufman's antics and wanting to know more about his ideas and motivations. For those (like me) who only know him from vague childhood memories of repeats of Taxi!, it does stir a little interest, only to disappoint by not going deeper. Very average."

","Jim Carrey's sensational performance as Andy Kaufman is at the heart of ""Man on the Moon.""  In fact, it's the whole movie, which doesn't amount to much more than re-creations of Kaufman's greatest hits.  Kaufman's offstage life is not as compellingly presented.  Those who were hoping that the movie would shed some light on this most eccentric of performers will be disappointed.  Still, the movie is well worth seeing for Carrey's uncanny impersonation (some have said ""channeling"") of Kaufman.  When he imitates Elvis, he's not just imitating Elvis -- he's imitating Kaufman imitating Elvis.  And his portrayal of ""Tony Clifton,"" Kaufman's obnoxious alter ego, is a comic masterpiece.

","Based on a real story, the film brings us into a mysterious world of Andy Kaufman, who appeared to be one of the most enigmatic comedians of our time. Andy derides the audience, makes them laugh or amazed, whips up emotions; i.e. he entertains them. But this entertainment is so uncommon that you start thinking whether it is entertainment or just nonsense, a wasting of time. And together with Andy we are involved in exploring the categories of real and unreal. Although Andy was mixing reality with imagination, the film makes us feel that Andy, by his art, has still made distinguishable the borderline between good and evil. The film, despite its immense strangeness, radiates warmth.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey as Andy is brilliant: you can't imagine a better performance of an actor in this role. Excellent are Paul Giamatti, Denny DeVito and Courtney Love. A Carnegie Hall, the Philippine trip, and the funeral scenes are staged and shot masterly. The music is wonderful.<br/><br/>In each Milos Forman film, behind what you watch, on a backstage, there is always a problem, idea or opinion that provokes you to think. Forman's latest film at first glance seems to be simple: it portrays only a showbiz part of Andy Kaufman's life, almost no off-scene life of the comedian is shown as well as the reasons for his so eccentric behavior.<br/><br/>But Andy's life, according to the film, was indivisible from his art: his art was his life and vice versa, mostly feeding on irrationality and imagination. Imagination has no boundaries, all the same as, say, the universe. It forms a whole, the film and its backstage, something without boundaries, something amorphous. Therefore, you don't have to look for something specific or concrete behind the film: there is again the same irrationality and imagination there. All you have to do is to watch and enjoy this multilayer, elevated and refined philosophical film (which, by the way, is not a comedy) on our today's absurd life where the love and kindness are to be praised. And these are the main categories that the movie instigates us to think about."

Andy starts as a child performing in front of his walls and then is on a stage performing his foreign man schtick. Next is SNL and that leads his to Taxi, which he hates. And everything happens like that, from one big scene to another. The movie seems to be designed behind each bit without any real flow.

A lot of people poo-pooed the fact that it doesn't uncover anything we don't know, but for once, we get a good straight biopic about someone. I think it would be too difficult to understand Kaufman's comic styling. Everything is staged beautifully, his performances on SNL, his wrestling, his role on Taxi, and that character who was his alter ego (I forgot). The supporting cast, which includes Danny DeVito and Courtney Love, is solid. I just wonder where they found those unattractive, mustachioed, female smokers in the early scenes.

But there are people who just don´t like Jim Carrey and they don´t give him a chance. His role in Truman Show was the beginning of a career which can present us an actor with an unbelievable tragicomedy. And Man on the moon is in a direct way tragicomically.

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","0","0","14 March 2001"," Forget The Truman Show, THIS is Jim Carrey's best performance.
","I don't know why I've heard so many bad things about Man On The Moon, it was definitely one of the best films of 1999. Jim Carrey once again proves his versatility as an actor, impersonating the enigmatic Andy Kaufman in an endearing biographical comedy. Not only is the subject matter totally unique (largely as a result of the uniqueness of the person whose life it portrays), but there are also some original and effective things about the way that it was presented. In a world where it is strangely disorienting to see the end credits rolling DOWNward (as in Seven), it is equally odd when a movie starts with the main character facing the camera and telling the audience that the movie is over, and then stands nervously next to a record player while the full credits roll by (albeit upward).<br/><br/>
Man On The Moon is a great show. It makes the suggestion that Andy Kaufman was so popular because he was so strange. Early in the film, Danny DeVito's character sits in a comedy club watching Kaufman on stage doing his odd presentation, and despite the strange things that he does, DeVito looks around and notices that everyone in the entire audience is riveted.<br/><br/>
(spoilers) One of the best things about this movie is that it reveals so much about Andy Kaufman, but at the same time, it leaves the audience wondering if they really saw the real Andy, or if he fooled people all the way up until his death. This is emphasized by the fact that in Andy's shows, particularly the ones meant to get a rise out of people, you never know if what's happening is planned or if things have just gone horribly wrong. All of this is made even better by Jim Carrey's awe-inspiring performance, which flawlessly captures the depth and uniqueness of Kaufman's personality. And it was also good to see all of the stars of Taxi back together (or so I'm told  I'm pretty sure that show was cancelled before I was born).<br/><br/>
One of the funniest things about Man On The Moon, however, was not Andy, but Tony Clifton. His hilarious obnoxiousness was even more effective that Andy's multiple personalities, particularly in his first scene, in which he `meets' Bob (`What's your last name, Up And Down In The Water?'), who turns out to be his business partner. Also, Andy's eventual love for Lynne (Courtney Love) develops in much the same way that David's did with his eventual wife in Shine. <br/><br/>Man On The Moon is the story of someone who became famous by doing his own thing, even if that meant manipulating the television companies that hired him. His eventual descent into sickness is very realistic and convincingly portrayed, evoking genuine emotion toward the end of the film, and the fact that Andy wants to continue doing shows perpetuates the mystery as to whether or not the sickness is real and whether or not we're seeing the real Andy, or just another act. When he is lying on the table, receiving a treatment of holistic medicine, there is a strikingly creepy lap dissolve to Andy as he lies in his coffin, but then we see Tony Clifton back on stage a year later. This is a fascinating film about Andy Kaufman, and while it was a fulfilling film, it leaves you wondering if even the cancer was an act, and whether or not Andy is really still out there somewhere, just avoiding the shallowness of the commercial television industry, as well as his own typecast persona as a character on a television show that he hated. It is a very welcome thing when a movie can really make you think like that, and it's a shame that it doesn't happen more often."

","Its a feature film that was Oscar winner material.  If the film had won best picture then it would have been the first time in Oscar history that a movie by the same director won the Best picture award in three straight decades. The previous films were One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest(1975) and Amadeus(1984) by Milos Forman.  The Man on the Moon(1999) is a beautiful tragic comedy about the career and life of controverisal comedian Andy Kaufman.  Jim Carrey gives the performance of his carrer as he plays the late comedy star as if he was Andy Kaufman.  other good performances are given by Danny DeVito, Courtney Love, and Paul Gialmatti.  The movie was like reliving the moments that Andy Kaufman was infamous for.  The Man on the Moon shares a couple of things in common with Milos Forman's Amadeus(1984).  One, the two films were about brilliant artists whose love for their art rubbed people the wrong way.  Two, both films were about artists who brought controversy during their lifetime because of their ability to create something different."

","The film Man on the Moon starring Jim Carrey is one of the best motion pictures I have ever seen. It is a credit to Jim Carrey as an actor and Andy Kaufmann as an artistic genius.<br/><br/>This film is just what Andy would have wanted it to be. It is an emotional roller coaster that was the definition of what Mr Kaufmann's artistry (I don't want to say sense of humor) was all about. There were points in this movie where I laughed hysterically (particularly the ""closing"" credits) There were points where I was balling my eyes out and there were points where I was doing both simultaneously.<br/><br/>Jim Carey does an awesome job, to the point where I thought he was Andy Kaufmann at times. The Academy over looked one of the best actors and films in 1999. Which makes me give more credit to the Golden Globes (who did reward Mr. Carrey)<br/><br/>I have always understood Andy Kaufmann as a ""comedian"". However, even after this movie, I will never understand him as a man. The ending of this movie alone is pure Andy Kaufmann and will leave you as confused as ""The Usual Suspects"" Go out, rent this movie. If you enjoyed it as much as I did buy it. This is a great film for Andy Kaufmann fans, Jim Carrey fans alike. Even if you do not like Jim Carrey, you will in this film. Even if you do not like Andy Kaufmann you will learn more about what he was all about. I urge you again. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!<br/><br/>

"Miguel Fialho","10","0","0","4 January 2001"," What would a man gaze from the Moon?
","I was not fully prepared to understand the character of Andy Kaufman which I thought at the time, was a made-up character. Nonetheless, the shock of knowing that a person like him could exist was becoming more and more overwhelming as I was watching the movie, and one gets the impression that somehow Milos Forman does not excuse or blame him for what he is as a person, rather he makes a portrait-biography of a phenomenon. And what a phenomenon! For once, he doesn't fit in any kind of comedian we know. Second of all, he doesn't fit in ANY kind of human we deal with, every day. What upsets the most is the way that he considers what's funny and laughable at the cost of people's uncomfortness, to say the least, for what he says and does. He is disgusting, shocking, rude and not the kind of person we should have as a friend as he turns your thoughts into garbage. However, the genius of this ""character"" is your pursuing of making believe that being alive is the most extraordinary thing on Earth as he recollects all the bad emotions in human being and shows to the same human beings that want all but look into themselves. And he shows them with a great laugh without even consider where the bounds are, as all emotions take part of the comedy of life. But do we really know where are the bounds? When Kaufman tears apart the polish guy for just being polish or spreads his machismo-like thoughts about women; before we discover that this kind of attitude is actually funny material for his jokes, we feel threatened by him. And we still do afterwards. But he's being a comedian because THOSE SUBJECTS ARE FUNNY for him. The question he asks (as well as Forman) but does not answer is why shouldn't we laugh of our very sacred dogmas as humans, regarding that they can change as people change over centuries in their thoughts and prejudices about relationships. Perhaps we should have a little of Kaufman inside us to expand our emotions to the edge as far as relationships in our lives is concerned. After all, that is the fun: being alive and prepare to laugh at that feeling! The other aspect of this movie is Jim Carrey. Before Truman Show I was in the category of viewers that hated him and consider his performances as hysterical and not funny. After Truman Show, which I didn't see, I was very much surprised of what I read in reviews of his performance and I gave him the benefit of doubt. But when I ""stumped"" in Man of the Moon, I surrendered to him. He is the same Jim Carrey as he is in Mask or Cable Guy, but in so many ways completely different. For once, he is directed and his character knows where to go. On the other hand, he's free to play whatever he likes in portraying this person except that he is, in a way, THIS PERSON! What he gives to Kaufman (note that I don't know the real Andy Kaufman) is genuinely and apparently himself which makes us heart-felted and moved by his generosity in this role. (Why didn't he win an Oscar?) One last word: Somehow extraordinary people are not always the best people in the world but, as Forman shows to us and did in his previews films, are people who expand their views to the infinite possibilities of human life. Like only a Man on the Moon gazing at the earth would view."

","Andy Kaufman fell into the same ""trap"" as did Harry Houdini--having to ""top one's self"" with every performance. It just can't be done.<br/><br/>
Like many excessive talents (Garland and Jolson come immediately to mind) such quests lead to career burnouts and fast trips to the morgue.<br/><br/>
No matter how much the audience may scream and holler for more, the solo performer must hold back. It's a technique and lesson that, unfortunately, some performers are incapable of implementing.  Kaufman was one such performer.<br/><br/>Not only did he give his all onstage, but his outrageous antics were carried over into his real life behavior, so that it became difficult to separate one from the other.  <br/><br/>Jim Carrey does indeed ""become"" Kaufman, so successfully that his work may be held up as a model of the ""Method"" tehcnique.  Alas, the interminable timing and delivery of the late comedian's lines, the quirkiness of his style, and the outlandish behavior of his offstage persona, make for some mighty uneven going in this presentation.<br/><br/>One is never quite sure just what makes this guy ""tick.""  We cut from a brief childhood scene to a fully grown man, with little idea of what's actually going on in that unique brain.  Just what's the driving force and need to make his entire lifestyle an avant guarde ""happening""?<br/><br/>
There's some pieces missing from the scripters' creation here, and it has to do with filling in some of the blanks to the Kaufman legend. Milos Forman's direction is professional enough, yet it too seems to lack insights to help render a fully realized portrait. <br/><br/>We end getting uneven highlights of the late comic's life and work, and an impressive and memorable job of characterization by the very talented Jim Carrey."

"nick69","5","0","0","23 December 1999"," A great movie
","Before I say anything about the movie I want to state I liked it very much. I have a couple of minor complaints but over all it was a great film. First, Jim Carey had better get nominated for his performance. He was brilliant. He captured Andy and it was almost like watching Andy on screen. I defy anyone blindfolded to tell the difference between Andy's foreign man and Jim's. The academy snubbed him for The Truman Show so anything is possible. They may have a hard time getting over the Ace Ventura movies. (Which are very funny) All I can say about that is Jack Nicholson was in the original Little Shop of Horrors, and Tom Hanks starred in Bachelor Party. I have been a fan of Paul Giamanti for a while and he had Zmuda down. This guy has replaced the late J.T. Walsh as my favorite character actor. I felt Danny De Vito came across very well. You could feel how much George Shapiro loved Andy and fought for him. Not many agents would have been able to withstand the Kaufman antics. The beginning of the movie was pure Kaufman. Jim had me right there. Now for my complaints. I know it is a 2-hour movie and you only have a certain amount of time to tell the story. The facts and timeline of this film are all off. Andy did not meet Lynne until 1983. He filmed his Carnegie Hall show in 1979. He meet Lynne on the film My Breakfast with Blassie. None of the Taxi stars attended Andy's funeral. It really glossed over Andy's rise to stardom in his early years. But, I can forgive these things as simply minor and only a Kaufman freak like myself would even care. Milos Forman does a great job making the audience see Andy and appreciate him. He was the master prankster and was willing to do anything for the sake of entertainment. Whether it was his own or the audiences. Sometimes the audience did not get him, and now I hope that we can appreciate where Andy was coming from. At the end of that movie I had even more respect for Andy, which is no small task considering I considered him a genius even before I plunked down my $7.50. Andy was indeed a genius, and as most he was misunderstood when he was alive. Like, Van Gough, one can only hope that he will finally get the recognition he so richly deserves"

I could get over it when the Oscars forgot him for the Truman Show, even though I cheered for him when he won the Golden Globe, for though that was one hell of a performance, it was nothing remarkable. But I could not stand it when they ignored him for this incredible terrific piece of work that, in a year of great leading performances such as given by Denzel Washington, Russel Crowe and Kevin Spacey, still deserved to beat the daylights out of the competition.<br/><br/>The only annoyance I really have with the film is not actually with it but the promotional work for it and the reception it got in that- IT IS NOT A COMEDY!!!!!!!!. This film has moments where it is very funny but it is not a comedy but a drama on a guys life as he strives to be him. American Beauty was sidesplitting at times yet everyone knows it's a drama.

","MAN ON THE MOON<br/><br/>***** See this now! **** Great! *** Quite Good ** Not Horrible, Nor Gid. * Big Mistake!<br/><br/>I had been looking forward to seeing Man on the Moon after finding out Jim Carrey won an Oscar for his performance as Andy Kaufman. I liked this tragicomedy a lot, and even though it could have been improved from good to great, it was still a largely enjoyable and interesting film.<br/><br/>Man on the Moon is based on the incredible true story of Andy Kaufman, a comedic genius who started out with his very own TV show called Taxi. Later in his money-grabbing life, he was inspired by the telly to become a world-famous wrestler. No one ever knew if Andy was doing it all for himself, or for the fame, or was it all just a big act?<br/><br/>
Man on the Moon is one of Carrey's best roles in a long time, and he is well supported by a well-known cast such as Danny DeVito and Courtney Love. Fortunately, it starts out with outstandingly funny moments, but near the end it became overlong and a little stupid. Still, Man on the Moon is recommendable to audiences who want to have a laugh, but also think about what a marvellous life Kaufman had. <br/><br/>*** 1/2"
"redneck-6","Null","0","0","19 October 2000"," Well done, but won't answer many questions.
","I can barely remember Taxi back when it was on television, as my tastes were much younger back in its day.  Also, I never saw anything Andy Kaufman did besides Taxi back when he was still alive.  I did see a Comedy Central special about the enigmatic comic which is really what sparked my interest in Man On the Moon.  The movie is very well done.  It seems to move a bit fast, compressing Andy's rise to fame seemingly into just a few scenes, but that was okay, since I was guessing the director wanted to focus more on Andy's later life and career.  Jim Carrey does an incredibly convincing job of portraying Andy, seeming to get all of his mannerisms and characters pretty much spot on.  The supporting cast is largely made up of people who really did work with Andy, and everyone does a good job.  Even Courtney Love, though admittedly Andy's relationship with his wife wasn't deeply explored.  And that was one of my main complaints with the movie.  It was largely very good re-creations of Andy's bits done on camera, and not enough of the man being himself away from the camera.  This may have been due to the fact that his mode of expression actually left even people close to him wondering what he really was like. So much so that not a lot of material on the man himself was readily available.  And that's a shame.  I can see where his material was easily crass and offensive on one hand,  while being profound on another level.  Was he just wrestling women, or waving a prevailing undercurrent of unspoken attitudes about what women were fit for in society's face?  By making stereotypical remarks about Southerners, was he disparaging them, or trying to make people think about how ridiculous stereotypes can be by forcing them to defend themselves against them?  True, he may have been a very simply motivated man who just liked to draw raw emotion from people and play pranks,  but I would have dearly liked to see some more of what made the man tick, and the movie doesn't deliver much of that.  The ending scenes are quite poignant and touching, and he is obviously loved by many around him,  but the character of the man himself isn't fleshed out quite enough to show why he was able to endear people to him so.  The film focuses just a little on his spiritual beliefs,  but once again gives facts and little else. Man On the Moon is entertaining to watch if you're curious about Andy Kaufman's life, certainly.  And Andy's comedy is perfectly recreated so you'll find it funny at least to the extent you can enjoy what he did.  Just don't expect to get many answers about his deeper motivations for his choice of comedic styling."
"Mr. Tobar","9","0","0","9 October 2000"," Either you get it, or you don't.
","There was a certain angle to Andy Kaufman's humor, just like any other comedian that stands out from the crowd.  The audience that likes that type of humor is not ""hip"" to it, or ""in on the joke"", we just happen to find that kind of thing funny.<br/><br/>Much of the movie is devoted to getting into Kaufman's sense of humor, and its ties to his individuality and refusal to compromise.  He apparently really was one of the few entertainers who performed what he wanted to perform, and wasn't going to be a puppet to his popularity.<br/><br/>If you ever laugh all by yourself, then you may ""get"" his sense of humor. If you do, you will ""get"" this movie, and find it hilarious in the sections where those who did not ""get it"" found it uncomfortable and uneven. ><br/><br/>Of course, if you liked Andy Kaufman, you are likely to like this film.  I'd say that the converse is true, too.  If you don't ""get it"", try watching something without laugh tracks, and see if you know when to laugh.  Jim Carey does a good job of demonstrating that he can actually play a role other than roles that just rehash his old In Living Color comedy bits.<br/><br/>
If you don't like stories that vary from the regular Hollywood plot lines, leave this one alone.  If you're curious, don't mind bypassing some social conventions, and have a healthy respect for the selective use of tact, check out Man on the Moon, there are some nice philosophical angles to it, not unlike American Beauty.  They share a common thread of not being palatable to the people that they make light of.<br/><br/>One of the deeper messages of Man on the Moon is that we should all be able to make fun of ourselves, and have a good time in life.  Of course, to take that message out of the film, you have to agree with that message already."

All of Me and ET out in 1980? I don't think so...) and direction on the level of ""Unsolved Mysteries.""<br/><br/>There is one moment near the end of the movie where Andy realizes he's been conned.  It's the sort of moment where there shouldn't have been a dry-eye left in the house. It completely fizzled.<br/><br/>Forman has made some wonderfully emotional movies - Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus, Valmont and even The People vs. Larry Flynt.

And given the number of people involved in making this movie, who were actually there and knew Andy, I imagine it's quite accurate.<br/><br/>But as someone else here has stated, your reaction to this movie will depend largely on what you thought of Andy Kaufman. If you were fortunate (?) enough to have seen any of his performances (apart from Latka, which was fairly mainstream), you most likely thought, ""What the hell was *that*?"" My high school principal used to tell a joke. It was a really stupid joke. If I told it to you, you would say, ""That's a stupid joke."" And you'd be right -- it's a really stupid joke. But you might also laugh. I always do. I've never understood why this particular joke struck me funny -- it just always has.<br/><br/>Andy Kaufman was like that. Why did I laugh? I don't know. He was stupid! But I laughed when I saw him, and I laughed all through this film, and I cried at the end.<br/><br/>It's obvious people loved Andy in person -- look at the credits!

Carrey fleshes out a touch of the comedian's humanity most people tend to overlook.<br/><br/>The cast also features the multi-talents of Danny DeVito, Courtney Love, Paul Giamatti and Bob Zmuda. <br/><br/>'Tenk you veddy much'."

","I'm not so sure that Andy Kaufman would have gotten away with it in the more cynical and jaded 21st century. In a world of 'Got Talents' and 'X-Factors', a world where people will do anything to be famous, even degrading themselves and selling-out their dignity for life, Andy Kaufman may not have been so notorious. Whatever you think of the man, be he nothing more than a self-sabotaging fool who did whatever he could keep his name in the media, or a comic genius who was well ahead of the curve, there's no denying that Andy Kaufman was unique.<br/><br/>I had no idea who he was until I saw this film, in Las Vegas on December 30th 1999. It the final movie I saw in the 20th century, a reminder of the more innocent, naive times we were gradually slipping away from.<br/><br/>Carrey (a horribly under-rated dramatic actor) completely becomes Kaufman. It's an amazing transformation. It bothers me when people just see him as Ace Ventura. Carrey and Kaufman are symbiotic when it comes to comedy and pathos. It's a role he was born to play (along with the obnoxious Tony Clifton), and it's such a shame that the film didn't perform better at the box office.<br/><br/>But a guess that a 'downer' film of a strange, long-dead, has-been comedian was not really something America wanted during the Xmas season of 1999. It was better than Stuart Little, that's for sure.<br/><br/>The film is loaded with cameos from actors who actually worked and interacted with Kaufman before his unusual premature death including David Letterman, Jerry Lawler, Christoper Lloyd, Carol Kane, and Danny DeVito.<br/><br/>However, I'm one of those people that believe that Andy is still alive."

An excellent director and top grade cast complement a balanced and entertaining plot that has many quality moments, both dramatic and comedic. The plot deals with Kaufmann's public life well, from his early days on Saturday Night Live to his enduring, endearing character on Taxi, to the crude, rude, but hilarious Tony Clifton. But it also brings the human element through, which is credit to Milos Forman, a great director, and to the writers. The ending was a real highlight, original yet very appropriate, I won't reveal it, but ask yourself this question: Did he or didn't he?"" An excellent supporting cast, including Danny DeVito and Courtney Love in a good performance as Kaufmann's wife, add much to the film as a whole, but undoubtedly the star and shining light is Carrey himself. He portrays the troubled genius that was Andy Kaufmann with brilliant ease, transforming himself and showing the undoubted dramatic talents he has in abundance. His versatility through Kaufmann's many personas and life events, from his stand up act to wrestling to Tony Clifton is worthy of Kaufmann himself. How Jim Carrey didn't get an Oscar nomination I'll never know, but he richly deserved the Golden Globe he did get.

I didn't really know how I would feel about this movie as I didn't particularly like Andy Kaufman and although I say that, I loved his Elvis impersonation and then when I saw the Mighty Mouse song I remembered it and thought that was pretty funny and his character on Taxi was sweet, but after that and the wrestling and stuff he got pretty weird.  All that aside, I didn't really expect to like this movie and I loved it.  Not only because of the terrific acting by Jim Carrey and Courtney Love who I don't particularly care for either, but I have to admit she has done some fine acting in this movie and in Larry Flynt.  I thought Milos Foreman did an outstanding job directing this movie which I don't think tried to explain Andy Kaufman or his brand or sense of humor but simply laid it out there like Andy did, showed Andy being funny and Andy being not funny.The directing of this movie and the acting showed that all had done their homework about Andy Kaufman and his acts and followed his lead when telling his story.  The movie was very clever and showcased everyone's talent.

","Andy Kaufman was not the most radical or subversive comic that lived, neither as dangerous as Bill Hicks, as trailblazing as Peter Cook, nor as taboo-challenging as Lenny Bruce. When he died, the public had long forgotten him, having given up on his enigmatic, annoying brand of performance art. The very thing that made him doomed made him brilliant. He annoyed the world to entertain himself, he didn't care whether he was loved or hated. MAN ON THE MOON is faithful to Kaufman's ideology. That is, it is annoying and trying, but ultimately rewarding.<br/><br/>Milos Forman's portrait is that of a genuine anarchist - Kaufman makes reference to admiring the sneering arrogance of punk rock - but beyond that, is curiously alienating. While Carrey delivers his best performance yet - you completely forget who is playing Andy -  his character is distant. When MAN ON THE MOON runs out of gas at the end, it is because, much as we admire him, the exhausted audience finds it hard to care too deeply about what happens next.<br/><br/>A film has to get points for caring enough to alienate its audience, and it's the ultimate tribute to Andy. Certainly, the best way to watch this film is as a series of escalating practical jokes. The narrative, and supporting characters are neglected, and we never get an insight into what makes this fascinating, complex individual tick. But, if you sit back and watch Andy turn his tricks on the world, and turn the audience into the punchline, you will laugh yourself silly. <br/><br/>In the end, it's not a classic to rank alongside Forman's AMADEUS, CUCKOOS NEST, and LARRY FLYNT. But you get the impression Andy would approve, which makes it an incredibly brave biography."

Jim Carrey's portrayal of Kaufman is more than deserving of a Best Actor Oscar win, which he did not get.  Even though I saw Andy Kaufman as the unfunny, off-the-wall performer that he was, I actually cried during the re-creation scene of his funeral, because it was so sad to know that he tried so hard to make people laugh through his ""crying 'wolf'"" sense of humor and few believed that he was actually dying of lung cancer.

Andy was someone who screwed with your mind but this movie, one that was supposed to give you a feel for who he was, didn't do that. I guess it's asking a lot for a studio movie to put the film out of frame during the scene about the v-hold on his TV special but it would have been great.

","Wow. I don't think I could top the front-page review if I wanted to.<br/><br/>
I found the movie entertaining, and definitely worth watching, although I had a bit of a problem with the way Milos Forman handled the re-enactment of scenes from Andy's career. For example, most of the cast of Taxi played themselves, creating a very disjointed effect since most of them look significantly older than they did in the early 1980s when the real show aired. (Okay, so Marilu Henner doesn't appear to have aged a day, but still.)<br/><br/>And the character of Louis De Palma is left out of the ""Taxi"" scenes entirely because Danny DeVito is already in the movie playing Andy's agent George Shapiro. Ummmm, problem.<br/><br/>David Letterman also looks significantly older than he did in 1982 when Andy and Jerry Lawler appeared on Late Night, creating the same ""suspension of disbelief"" problem as the Taxi scenes.<br/><br/>Then we see the infamous Fridays sketch, which instead of being reprised by the original participants as most of the other recreated scenes are, is actually performed by comedic actors (Norm MacDonald, Caroline Rhea) who are famous enough in their own right that a viewer unfamiliar with the Andy Kaufman story could be led to believe that they were really involved in the original incident.<br/><br/>So you end up with Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman at more or less the correct age, playing against a lot of people who look the wrong age for the time because they're playing themselves, one person who should be playing himself actually playing somebody else, and two people who are playing other people but are recognizable enough on their own that it interferes with the veracity of the scene.<br/><br/>I really believe Milos Forman should have stuck to one of two approaches: either *all* the original participants in the recreated scenes should have played themselves, or *all* of them should have been played by other actors. Mixing the two actually detracts from the movie."

There was so much more to Andy then just that guy from Taxi and this movie allows us to love this guy regretfully years after his death.<br/><br/>Now lets get down to Jim Carrey.  They billed this as the role he was born to do.  I cant disagree there.  People either love or hate Jim and those who do love him seem to be hung up for a need of comedy from him.  Where is the next Dumb and Dumber? Where is the next Ace Ventura?  Like a good music band, a good actor cant be backed into a corner and try to keep making the same thing that brought em to superstardom (steve martin, bill murray anyone) This was Jim at his best, convincing me that this person and his alter ego were someone special, someone who matterd.  Jim did a fantastic job in all aspects in this role.  The movie was a bit long winded but i was so wrapped up in the story it didnt matter, i never wanted it to end.  The way it was done reminded me of their other documentary ""The People vs Larry Flint.""  While that movie was just an excuse for excess, Man On The Moon is a touching, brutaly honest, thought provoking, entertaining movie about a guy people over-looked and thats a shame.

","I tried to watch Man on the Moon on DVD tonight with an open mind. I tried to view the film with the expectation that something would happen in the end, but all that occurred was that the central character died, as he did so many time on stage. Man on the Moon is a well-intentioned film about controversial comedian, Andy Kaufman, but the film, like Kaufman's life, meanders through time without any particular purpose. Jim Carrey was excellent in his guise. But it was the portrayal of a mean-spirited individual, with no particular comic genius, who possessed only a desire to inflame and madden the crowd. Hurried over were the Taxi episodes, the only part of Kaufman's life, which really lent any credibility to him as a comedic talent. The rest hangs in mid air too long for too many times, leaving one with the feeling that this is nothing more than a high-budgeted television movie of the week.<br/><br/>The film has its brief moments and one is touched at times by Courtney Love's portrayal of Kaufman's love interest. But beyond that, Man on the Moon is rendered particularly impotent by the insertion of producer, Danny DeVito as Kaufman's agent. DeVito, a strong back to Kaufman's Latka character in Taxi, refuses, by his established presence as Louie De Palma, to allow the viewer to escape into the depths of the film. Perhaps this is for the best, though, for those are depths we had each best avoid.<br/><br/>Man on the Moon is a particularly droll film about a man, who, but for an accident of mirth, would have been legend. No one particularly liked Andy Kaufman as a person. I do not even think he liked himself."

Andy Kaufman was a no-talent hack who became famous because he was willing to make an ass of himself. There is a group of people out there (let's call them Andy's fans) that think they know something that no one else does.  They can see past the ""facade"" to the real genius of Kaufman.  Well, perhaps that is the funniest joke that Kaufman ever pulled off.  There's no facade, the guy was a goof. Unfortunately, Kaufman's death is portrayed as the passing of a great American comic genius.  This is far from the truth.  His death actually is the only thing that prevented Kaufman from inflicting his unfunny brand of humor on a ""wise-to-it"" public. Jim's performance was great and the movie was very interesting.

The movie makes some hints that he was.  It even drops some hints that he might have been beyond normal understanding and in some ways a genius.  On the other hand, it also gives you the option of seeing him as a raving loon.<br/><br/>There is one aspect of this film that is not evident until the very last seconds (no, this is NOT a spoiler) that leads me to believe that a LOT of people saw him as a genius:  many of the people who worked with him had cameos in the film in which they portrayed their shock and dismay, yet they were not listed in the credits.  Was this an homage?<br/><br/>How often do celebrities spurn the scrolling letters at the end of the film? They DO often remove their names if they are disappointed in the movie, but since they were playing themselves, and were showing their shocked reactions, it's hard to see how leaving their names off the credits would be any kind of statement.<br/><br/>You couldn't have paid me to watch Andy Kaufman, but I think that underneath his heavy-handed theatrics he did have some kind of message.

There was no exposition into the personality or life of Andy until the final few minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>
I was also confused by Courntey Love's presence in the movie. We meet her, she hates Andy, then she goes on a date with him, then she is marrying him, then they are going out, and then they move in together. This is representitive of the major problem with the movie, it jumps around from major point in Andy's life to major point, while avoiding specifics.<br/><br/>I thought that there were few minor factual anecdotes that were missing that would have worked nicely. First, when Andy, on Letterman, wearing neck brace and all, apologizes to his parents, and says ""I know I've never said this before, but I love you."" Putting that in would have made the movie a lot better. Also, there was no mention of his daughter that he put up for adoption.<br/><br/>I also thought that since ""Taxi"" was a major part of Andy's life, Foreman could have dedicated more then a short montage to it.<br/><br/>Carrey was good when playing Andy playing someone else, but seemed, when he was playing ""Andy"" Andy, was varying. Danny Devito was good, and seemed to really enjoy his part.<br/><br/>If you are a big fan of Kaufman's work, want to find out about it, or indeed want to find out about what part's of Andy's routine was real or not, then this is the movie for you.

I don't know if that could have been better.  I agree on Jim receiving the Golden Globe.  But would like to ask the ""Academy"" what Jim has to do to get nominated.  This performance was extremely hard.  It is hard becoming a complex character,in which Andy's was way beyond that.  For Jim's performance as Kaufman, out of a 10 (10 being a reproduction of Andy) I would give Carrey a 8 1/2 or 9.  And even with a 6 grade, he should have got nominated.  I mean, COME ON.

","I was really pretty disappointed. I absolutely adore Andy Kaufman. I think that he was a genius and undoubtedly one of the greatest comedians of the century. The problem with this movie was that it didn't show me anything that I didn't see on the ""Tribute to Andy Kaufman"" 1-hour special on Comedy Central. This movie left me with the feeling that Kaufman was a two-dimensional character with no feelings when he was off-stage. I don't know THAT much about the sequence of events that took place in Kaufman's life, but I do know that Forman manipulated the events to tell a much different story than actually occurred. I was disappointed because it just seemed like an hour and a half of Jim Carrey doing an imitation of the stunts that the real Kaufman pulled in real life. It left me with the feeling the Kaufman was just some freak that was impossible to REALLY KNOW, which I don't believe. Yes, Kaufman was a practical joker and mastered the art of tricking us into who he really was and what he really wanted from us. I saw no passion in this direction. When I see a biographical film, I like to at least think that the director is passionate about the main character's life. I just saw this film as a shallow reflection of the stunts that Kaufman pulled, as opposed to a thoughtful exploration of this brilliant man's life."

","Who was Andy Kaufman?  What was he really like?  The answere is, I think, no one really knew, not even himself.  I think that is the point the critics who mention the film doesn't get to the heart of who Andy Kaufman really was.  Man on the moon may not be 100% accurate, but it's a wonderful film. Being a late Kaufman fan, (I was to young to have a clear memory of him when he was alive and in the direct spotlight), I have become a fan through showings of his classic performances and news shows about him.  What I've seen has been recreated very vividly.  Jim Carrey doesn't just play Andy Kaufman, he is wisked away into Andy, he becomes Andy, in a performance that should earn him one of those little golden trophies.  (If it doesn't then I'm convinced the Oscars are rigged.)  I remember two young ladies leaving the theatre half way through the film, they must have been expecting another ""Ace Ventura"", or ""The Mask"", and had no idea who Andy Kaufman was.  The film isn't for everyone...bottom line, but on the other hand, we have my fiance on the other side who went into the film kicking and screaming, and was all misty eyed at the end (I cried to, it didn't help that she started it...), falling in love with Andy Kaufman as I did long ago.  Andy was banished from everyone's memory years ago, now it's about time he got the appreciation he desearves.  This ones for you Andy."

"FlickJunkie-2","8","0","0","2 June 2000"," Tour de force performance by Jim Carrey
","This realistic biographical treatment of the life of Andy Kaufman is a tour de force triumph for Jim Carrey in the starring role.  Carrey portrays Kaufman with such spooky accuracy that one has to wonder whether this was an impersonation or a possession.  Kaufman could not have played Kaufman any better.<br/><br/>Andy Kaufman was an audacious pioneer in the world of shock comedy.  His most popular work in Taxi' was not his most important and was the work he liked the least.  Kaufman was a ruthless manipulator of human emotion.  He didn't care whether people loved him or hated him, laughed or cursed him as long as they were reacting.  He would go to any lengths, no matter how ridiculous or distasteful to shock his audience and put one over on them. Though not the first in this regard (Don Rickles and Don Imus were offending people's sensibilities long before Kaufman emerged) his antics raised the bar for shock comedy, aiding people like of Howard Stern, Sam Kinison and Andrew Dice Clay.  Though I don't personally believe this is a particularly constructive direction, I must concede that Kaufman broke through some major barriers.<br/><br/>The film's biggest shortcoming is its neglect of the inner Kaufman.  Some of the best scenes explaining Kaufman's motivations and reactions to his own behavior ended up in the deleted scenes bonus feature on the DVD.  This relegated the film to becoming an Andy Kaufman greatest hits film without Andy.  While it was entertaining as such, the burning question remains unanswered, namely, `What is this guy thinking as he behaves this way?'<br/><br/>I can't say enough about Jim Carrey's performance.  He totally immersed himself in the character down to the most meticulous detail.  As he explained in the featurette, he didn't just try to impersonate Kaufman, he was intent on becoming him 24 hours a day.  People who knew Kaufman well like Danny DeVito and Kaufman's girlfriend Lynne Margulies said that it was like Andy had taken over Carrey's body.  With each film he makes I gain a new appreciation for Carrey's skills as a comedian and actor.  Though much of his early work was tripe, his range of abilities continues to expand with each new role.  In many ways he reminds me of Jerry Lewis, a brilliant mind behind the face of the village idiot.<br/><br/>I rated this film an 8/10.  It is a must see for Andy Kaufman fans and will still be entertaining for those who missed Kaufman's work.  Unfortunately, it lacked insight and that made it incomplete."

"danielll_rs","8","0","0","18 May 2000"," Carrey makes this great film even better
","Rating: ***1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>""Man on the Moon"" opened in Brazil two weeks ago, together with two other films: ""Down to You"" and ""Hanging Up"". It was released in the biggest number of screens, received the best reviews, but it seems that the audience didn't like it very much. Well, Andy Kaufman is almost unknown here (I confess I had never heard about him before reading about the film). Only the people who watch ""Taxi"" on Sony Entertainment Television may know him. But I'm sure that about 60% of the people who went to the movies to watch ""Man on the Moon"" left disappointed because they were expecting a slapstick comedy- the last thing it is. In the audience I attended to, there was a group of stupid teen girls (whose favorite film is probably ""She's All That"") who didn't seem to get the point of the amazing, hilarious beginning. At the end, I heard one of them complaining: 'This is the worst movie I've ever seen.' And another one said a kind of nonsense thing: 'This is even worse than ""Sleepy Hollow""!'  another great film, I have to say. So I got very angry and thought: 1- They don't know that this is a biography about a REAL person. 2- They've never heard about a genius named Milos Forman; ""Amadeus"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" mean nothing for them. 3- They were expecting ""Dumb and Dumber- Part 2"" or ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective- Part 3"". 4- I'm sure they also didn't like ""The Truman Show"". 5- They are futile, disposable people who should be ignored (I'm sure they would make annoying jokes about the frog rain in ""Magnolia"", like 'Duh! Senseless!').<br/><br/>""Man on the Moon"" is another great creation of Milos Forman. He has been criticized for making an empty film, without telling details about Andy Kaufman's life, showing only his shows, his polemics. But that's how biographies should be. Who cares if Andy lost his puppy dog hit by a car when he was a child? Who cares if his parents used to fight? Who cares if he had problems at school? What is important in the life of a person, more specifically an artist, is how he/she became famous, how he/she faced it etc. And ""Man on the Moon"" shows it perfectly well. Milos Forman had already done masterpieces as ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Amadeus"" (another unusual biography) and, in my opinion, ""Valmont"". ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" was also a different kind of biography and was almost perfect. That's what happens in ""Man on the Moon""- it is almost a masterpiece. As in Carrey's previous picture, ""The Truman Show"", there is a small, almost imperceptible thing missing. Here I guess it's the presence of Courtney Love's character in Kaufman's life. She could have been quite more significant here.<br/><br/>But this small flaw can be left by the side in the middle of so many qualities: an amazing director, a great screenplay (with hilarious moments and some emotional ones) and, above everything, Jim Carrey. It was just prejudice, I think, his snub at the Oscar. This was the Oscar of snubs: ""Magnolia"", Paul Thomas Anderson, ""Eyes Wide Shut"", Stanley Kubrick, ""Being John Malkovich"", Cameron Diaz, Reese Witherspoon and there it goes. But the Academy should have forgotten Carrey's mistakes of the past (hey! Hilary Swank was in ""The Next Karate Kid""!). I guess it's the best performance of his career- by far. God! I don't know almost anything about Andy Kaufman, but Carrey resurrects him. Personification, whatever! HE IS ANDY KAUFMAN!<br/><br/>""Man on the Moon"" is a must-see- specially if you like Forman's style of film-making. There are many memorable scenes: the beginning, the concert in Carnegie Hall, the funeral and the ambiguous ending- ambiguous in a good way. It's superbly directed, acted and written. Even if it can't be between Forman's masterpieces, it is something worthy of much recognition."
"James.S.Davies","Null","0","0","18 May 2000"," Can we believe they put a man on the moon?!
","On the surface Milos Forman's latest biopic, appears to concentrate on the little known yet notoriously anarchic comedian, Andy Kaufman.  However, the retelling of Kaufman's life story seems to stand as a study of what audiences (particularly TV) perceive to be reality, and how such perceptions can be manipulated by media organisations or, as in this case, individuals.<br/><br/>The film is full of metaphors which are symbolic of events where authenticity has been questioned and media manipulation implied.  Wrestling, although originating as a sport, has become popularised as staged entertainment.  Elvis' death has always been the subject of much scrutiny, as we are led to believe, was Kaufman's own.  Even the film's title which derives from the REM song (incidently the band composed the film's entire musical score) which posed the question ""Can you believe they put a man on the moon?"".<br/><br/>Kaufman was a man who recognised the potential anarchy in television.  He had something of a punk ethos, in that he appeared to have no set agenda. Even his closest friends and family were never enitirely sure where his stage persona ended and the real Andy began.  He seemed to welcome such confusion for the most part.  Surely he would have enjoyed this tribute to him.  The film itself serves as a lesson in postmodernity gone mad, with several characters appearing as themselves (all be it 20 years older) and the only cast member from Taxi who doesn't appear is Danny DeVito, who actually plays his agent in this.  If this seems absurd well then surely Kaufman is having the last laugh after all.<br/><br/>Clearly this is Carey's bravest performance to date because it is by no means a mainstream picture.  He's proved once more that he's not just a rubber faced funny man, and more to the point he's proved the same for his subject!"

","Much like the man himself, ""Man on the Moon"" is a biopic on Andy Kaufman that tell you pretty much nothing you dindn't already know. The performances are outstanding, but it plays more like a highlight show that an introspective.<br/><br/>First off, Jim Carrey is great. You get the feeling if there's one person who might get Andy Kaufman, it's Jim Carrey. He seems to hit all the characters just right. Paul Giamatti as Bob Zmuda is the best of the supporting cast, and there are a number of interesting guest cameos of people playing themselves.<br/><br/>The only problem is that all the movie seems to do is show you his various acts in succession. There's no attempt to make Kaufman out to really be anything other than the actor he was, no attempt to see what was behind the characters. Milos Forman fails to make anything out of Kaufman, to suggest anything of his persona. This is strikingly different than his last movie, ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"", and this technique lacks a little. There are a couple of various, really obvious attempts to show everyone's aware he's a little nuts, not no real probe into his physche. There's also a somewhat mysterious ending, something in the true Kaufman spirit.<br/><br/>
The bottom line is basically, if you thought Andy Kaufman was funny, you'll like this movie. Otherwise, it will likely appear a bit hollow, though good for a laugh. Still, it seems the movie could have somehow been a bit better. After all, if the filmmaker's didn't stick to the facts, as the opening suggests, why not take some guesses into his inner thoughts?"

Also, i've never been much of a Jim Carrey fan, finding what i perceived as quasi-Jerry Lewis posturings just a little bit irritating. However, after viewing a couple of films i decided that was a little harsh. After seeing Man on the Moon, i realize he is an awfully gifted artist. Playing someone in a biopic isn't that difficult in itself. All it requires is an adequate enough amount of mimicry- an impersonation almost. For example, Val Kilmer's Jim Morrison comes to mind as a good charcterization, but with no actual life to the character. Carrey, however, one sensed there was a person underneath all those masks of Kaufman. He had splendid support from some actual members of the Taxi cast playing themselves. Courtney Love, in this, her second film for the excellent Milos Forman, shines- herself somewhat of a dramatic surprise in The People vs Larry Flynt. I should like to see Carrey get awards galore for this film, though i somehow think it won't happen. It would be a shame to see his promise unfulfilled, tossed aside for the Ace Ventura kind of films. My one regret was that i was never more aware of the real Andy Kaufman when i was younger.

Forman reunited with the writers of Larry Flynt for this sensational---I hate to call it a biopic because it's so much more--this sensational film about the life of the late entertainer Andy Kaufman. It seems that there is no half-way on this film. Almost everybody I talked to either loved it or hated it. This depended largely on how you felt about Andy Kaufman's humor. I think that those who had never heard of Kaufman, or who had liked him when he was performing, loved the film. Everyone else didn't. To put it simply, Jim Carrey turned in the best performance of the year. Keven Spacey is my favorite actor, but Carrey was simply magnificent here. To use a trite expression, he simply becomes Andy Kaufman. This film wasn't really supposed to cover the entire life of Kaufman, and sure, it had minor innaccuracies, but the sheer movie making magic here is phenomenal.     All of the supporting players were quite good, especially Paul Giamatti as Bob Zmuda. It's nice to see nearly everyone Kaufman ever worked with making a cameo here. Dave Letterman, Paul Shaffer, the cast of Taxi (minus Tony Danza and Danny DeVito who plays Kaufman's manager in the film), Lorne Michaels, the real Bob Zmuda, Jerry Lawler, Lance Russell, Norm MacDonald even appears as Michael Richards. The ending of this movie was totally beautiful. It summed up everything that Kaufman was. Critics blasted this for not probing into who Andy Kaufman was...but that's just it, Andy Kaufman was whoever you wanted him to be. He was a product of your mind.

","First of all, who is this Andy Kaufmann? We havent heard about him in this part of the world. Now, maybe people who know him will like the movie. But as for me and a lot of others, from start to finish, the movie is disappointing. Jim Carrey tries to act and but the face-twitching and related stuff, I think, is not a big stretch for him for he has been doing this all the time. Now I see a lot of people asking why Jim hasnt been nominated for The Academy Awards. I dont see a reason why should he be? Especially when we have unforgettable and better performances by a lot others....Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe and of course, Denzel Washington. I found the start amusing, thought I was going to see a good movie. But when I came out, I had wasted my time watching a silly movie like this. The movie is definitely not funny and not touching at all. Most of the others who watched with me and including myself didnt have a clue as to what the director was trying to say through this movie. Probably, just from what I understood about Andy from the movie, that he entertains himself and all the audience are really not that important. I felt Milos Forman and Jim Carrey thought the same. They really didnt care about what viewers would think, but they rather tried to amuse themselves. Jim, if he has any aspirations for even being in the nominee list for the academy, he has to do a lot, lot more than this. Finally, I would like to emphasize this is a very disappointing movie to the core, I ve seen for quite some time and I wonder why some one would waste time and money in creating this kind of movie."

","When Kaufman was alive I had a sort of love-hate response to his material. As I'm sure many did. Needless to say I also have a love-hate response to this film. We were not in on the joke, those of us who were exposed to the real Andy Kaufman. This movie tries to demystify the perplexity that was Andy Kaufman. It tries to humble his stature while simultaneously praising him as if he were a gift to modern comedy and humanity. He was not. He was a selfish performer with a delinquent obsession for mischief. Any entertainment we got from him was despite his own efforts.<br/><br/>
He was a talented man, but many stand greater than he: Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, George Burns, Jonathan Winters, Bill Cosby, the list goes on. In a way the movie stands almost as an apology: ""He was only kidding, folks!"" and I wonder if that apology should be accepted, or even uttered. It's like trying to explain the joke after the punchline illicits no laughter. It demeans the attempt and makes the joke even worse.<br/><br/>Kaufman was an entertainer interested in the interactions between performer and audience. He wasn't satisfied with just making people laugh. He also wanted to make us cry. He wanted to scare us. He wanted to inspire us to throw things at him and shout obscenities, and he wanted to be able to control his audience on all emotional levels. In that, he was successful.<br/><br/>
He would read The Great Gatsby to a crowd, not to entertain them, but to see how long it would take before they would all get up and leave. He wanted to see how much the audience would take of him. The audience was there to entertain him.<br/><br/>He wanted to be known as a song and dance man. Fine. I'll call him that. However, he was no comedian. Comedians generally focus on trying to make an audience laugh. Kaufman preferred to see his audience as the butt of jokes for his own amusement. We were his entertainment. It was not the other way around.<br/><br/>Should we laud him for it? Should we praise him for it? And should we make expensive movies about him when his corpse is hardly cold? As sincere and heartfelt as this movie wants to be, it is somehow unfitting to speak this way of the dead. And y'know what? That's probably exactly how Andy would have wanted it.<br/><br/>The special guest appearances are enigmatic for me. Surely there's stories behind closed doors with Danny DeVito convincing some of them - stories we will never hear. Perhaps after DeVito is dead we'll see another movie about it.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey's performance was impeccable. Naturally he was completely snubbed by the Academy and was not even nominated for an Oscar. Like Kaufman, Hollywood still doesn't quite know what to do with Carrey. If you like Carrey, this is a mustsee film. If you don't like Carrey, this film might just change your mind.<br/><br/>DeVito's performance is underwhelming. His attention was diverted, and he would have been better suited staying behind the camera and concentrating on looking through the lens. DeVito wore too many hats for this one and it shows in his performance.<br/><br/>I've seen documentaries about Kaufman that were just as entertaining and revealing. I enjoyed it, but I did so despite myself. I think the most powerful moment is the scene just before the funeral. For a film in which I already knew all the major plot points and I knew how it would end, the look on Carrey/Kaufman's face when he realized that the cruelest joke of life was on him, that alone was worth the price of admission."

"Tallgent","8","0","0","19 March 2000"," Who is Andy Kaufman?
","Some called him a genius; others thought him insane.  Myself, I would say unfunny.  Of course, I'm talking about Jim Carrey.  And it's only appropriate, I guess, that Carrey would play the part of Andy Kaufman, who falls under the same criteria.  Milos Forman gives Carrey full rein with the role of Kaufman and Carrey delivers.  The film itself, though, is more of a mixed bag.  You have to be familiar with Kaufman to really appreciate the film.<br/><br/>Things start out in a Kaufmanesqe manner in a great opening that sets up the tone.  Kaufman addresses the crowd directly to tell them a bit what the film is about.  I won't give anything away, but this seemed to divide the audience immediately.  Some found it hilarious, some were puzzled, and some were expecting a Jim Carrey film.  They were unhappy when they didn't get it.<br/><br/>From there we go to Andy's childhood as we see him perform to his bedroom wall.  Eventually, he gets nerve to perform on a stage, though things are lass than ideal for him as the manager tells him he isn't funny.  But Andy's a survivor and he eventually wows a club with his Elvis act.  Robert Shapiro (Danny DeVito) sees him and decides to take him under his wing as manager. Don't say he didn't get warned.<br/><br/>Andy then makes it big on the television show ""Taxi"" as mechanic Latka Gravas.  Andy's experiences on the set are nicely dramatized in a clever montage featuring Judd Hirsch and Marilu Henner in their old roles of Alex Reiger and Elaine Nardo.  Things seem to be going well, that is until Shapiro gets introduced to Andy's protege, the obnoxious Tony Clifton.  To make matters worse for Shapiro (and heavenly for Andy) it seems that Andy Kaufman has found his calling, namely wrestling women.  However, Andy gets more than he bargained for when he crosses paths with professional wrestler Jerry ""The King"" Lawler.<br/><br/>Finally, in the early 80s, Andy gets diagnosed with lung cancer.  Andy tries all sorts of exotic treatments to cure his cancer, and in one painful moment all of his hucksterism and pulling-the-strings comes back to play a cruel joke.  Andy's response?  Laughter.  He appreciates a good joke, even if it is life-or-death.<br/><br/>Forman's biography is not as illuminating into the mind of Kaufman as he makes it out to be.  And I suppose it's just as well, the only one who totally knew Andy was Andy.  Still, this film is a nice introduction to Kaufman and why he was more than just ""Latka on Taxi.""<br/><br/>But will people care?  That I'm not so sure about.  What I found interesting, at least with the audience I saw it with, was that more people were laughing at the ""ordinary"" behavior of Kaufman more than his act.  For instance, many people thought a dinner between Andy and Shapiro was hilarious and a scene where Andy reads ""The Great Gatsby"" from front-to-back was stupid.  One thing that bothered me was the reaction to his belief in transcendental meditation.  Many in the audience got a kick out of seeing Andy with the weirdly dressed gurus.  I was straight-faced because to Andy TM was serious and I respected that.<br/><br/>There is also a kind of fairy tale like feel to the story which I found to be distracting.  But then one could make the argument that Andy saw his life as a fairy tale and that's fine.  Still I had to keep reminding myself that Andy Kaufman did exist, that he did wrestle women, that he stretched performance art to its limits, and that he died of lung cancer.  I wonder if people who went for Jim Carrey and not for Andy Kaufman understood all that.<br/><br/>As for Kaufman's place in stand-up history...let me put it this way, no one currently in stand-up is doing what he did, which says something.  Lenny Bruce, Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor, Albert Brooks have all stuck with anecdotal, observational, and social humor.  Kaufman didn't tell jokes.  In fact, Kaufman did everything possible to not let humor be the end-all be-all of his act.  It was reaction that he sought, whether it be a groan, a curse, applause or laughter.  To him failure was success.  He was basically a behaviorist.  <br/><br/>Now whether non-fans will see all that, I don't know.  In explaining him to one person I know, I used his ""Mighty Mouse"" act where Kaufman just stands there for three minutes, then he puts on the song and mouths the words on ""Here I come to save the day!""  She just looked at me, ""That's just stupid."" On the other hand, I took a guy to see it and he thought Kaufman wasn't funny at all.  After the movie, he looks at me and says, ""I get it now.  I get what he was trying to do.""<br/><br/>Andy would be proud.<br/><br/>Man on the Moon ***"

A story of a genius?<br/><br/>Well, it's all there is. Andy was TOO intelligent for us. It was really more than enough.<br/><br/>Anyway, did we come here to criticize ourselves, or the movie? So, the movie is really touching, but it lacks on laughs alittle. What we have to know before going to see the movie is, that it's not completely a comedy. Well, of course it has its moments, but the real mission is not to make people laugh to tears.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey, one of my all-time favorite actors, in his second drama (with Truman) is awesome as always. You can see that he's living Andy. I think the greatest moment of his performance is when he finds out the secret of the cure in Phillipines:he just laughs. I laughed with him in there.

"ProfDave","9","0","0","10 March 2000"," The movie I've waited for for years.
","Before the making of the film was even conceived, I was remarkably impressed by the impact Andy Kaufman had made in his few short years (the NBC special had reinforced that), and I knew full well that someone was going to make a movie about that man, sooner or later.<br/><br/>To my delight, I heard that it was going to be a definite, and, of all people, Milos Forman was going to direct (a pleasant surprise, on my part). I had a good idea who would try out for the part even before the project had initially materialized, but I never would have guessed that it would've been Jim Carrey.<br/><br/>To me, Nicolas Cage would've been the ideal Kaufman. For one thing, Cage looks and sounds like Kaufman, and at minimal effort, no less. Though Cage often comes off as dry, at least on screen, he has the capacity to be dynamic (e.g. Vampire's Kiss), and if anyone has the reputation for throwing himself into a part, it's him.<br/><br/>I was pleased that he had at least tried out for the part, as had Kevin Spacey (a genuine master of mimicry), John Cusack (a remarkably underestimated actor), and Gary Oldman (one of the most typecast men in the business), and was disappointed that none of these men landed the role. Then I learned who had.<br/><br/>I am not downplaying Carrey's abilities; I believe that every comedic performer needs to diversify, that is, to try out at least one non-dramatic role. Steve Martin did ('The Spanish Prisoner', among others), as did Mike Myers (with '54', establishing himself as this generation's Peter Sellers), and Robin Williams (though, in his case, is often not completely, but that is a separate discussion), all with stunning success. Carrey had amazed me with 'The Truman Show' (though his trademark dynamics had, at times, popped out), as with 'Simon Birch' (although we only received an inkling of it, there). Granted, Kaufman's film is, at the root of things, comedic, so superficially, it may not seem as much of stretch.<br/><br/>Then, after the long wait (and countless shifts of the release date), it came to theatres. Not since Rain Man or Awakenings have I seen more fine a technical performance. The fact that Carrey was resurrecting a person who actually lived and breathed, that was even more impressive. The only harm to the film was that the material had a slight air of deification (e.g. the first dinner with future agent George Shapiro), but despite that, it is a showcase of genuine talent.<br/><br/>It was somewhat startling that Carrey was not included among the five men chosen to be Best Actor nominees by the Academy for 1999, though one must remember that there are so many spaces to fill (and that the five performances that were chosen were not unsatisfactory, themselves; we must also remember that there were several other magnificent performances over the course of the year that were overlooked for that category, including those of Bob Hoskins, Matt Damon, and my personal dark-horse pick, Val Kilmer). Carrey, to his credit, did put more effort than most, and should've at least seen the fruits of his labour. Hopefully, Carrey will not become dis-heartened by the whole thing, and will continue to venture into the dramatic (there is no doubt in my mind that he has the capacity to play a completely serious lead; if 'Man on the Moon' has proven anything, it has proven that there is very little Carrey can't do).<br/><br/>Enough about that, though; back to my review of the film. Overall, it is a well-presented and well-organized (though a few of the details are modified out of convenience for the sake of plot and casting), and the fact that it was the first of its kind, and that it was actually pulled off, that was a feat, in itself, so kudos to the team, that for two hours and ten minutes, made Kaufman live, again."

Jim Carrey does an outstanding performance in this one. He really seems to be this Andy Kaufman with all his freakiness and ingenuity. Also Danny De Vito and Courtney Love (both not on my love-list either) do a great job.<br/><br/>The most surprising thing to me: I was really emotionally touched by the story of Andy Kaufman. Through all the madness and fun there's a underlying feeling of melancholy and sadness.<br/><br/>Despite it's length the movie never gets boring, due to good timing by Foreman and the fact that Kaufman had so many crazy ideas. But I could imagine that Man on the Moon is not so exciting for those who know Andy Kaufman well already and are not fans of him.<br/><br/>For all others: a must see."

","Given the fact that ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is permanently ensconced in my personal Top 10 movies of all time, I was anxiously awaiting Milos Forman's latest directorial work ""Man On The Moon"" starring Jim Carrey. The movie is a bio-pic of the life of former Taxi and Saturday Night Live star Andy Kaufman.  In follow-up to his dazzling performance in ""The Truman Show,"" Carrey is once again excellent in his depiction of the eccentric superstar.  There are many great supporting performances in this film including Danny DeVito as Kaufman's agent George Shapiro, and Paul Giamatti (""Saving Private Ryan,"" "" Private Parts"") as Kaufman's partner in mayhem Bob Zmuda.  The movie is filled with cameos from the cast of Taxi and Saturday Night Live, and even the performance of grunge queen Courtney Love is pretty good.  Given all of these great performances, the movie remains only slightly better than average.  With the exception of the scenes involving Tony Clifton (Carrey) the movie is slow and, much like Kaufman himself,  difficult to figure out.  Andy Kaufman may have been a comic genius and pioneer, but the story of his life itself is not all that interesting.  The audience struggles to try to figure out what Kaufman is all about much like his agent Shapiro does.  Carrey's performance is incredible, but when playing strictly the character of Andy Kaufman, his role is neither exciting nor funny.  The movie will probably garner some Oscar buzz given the track record of Forman (""Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Amadeus""), and in deference to the Academy's overlooking Carrey for the Truman show. However, ""Man On The Moon"" is at best a mildly entertaining biography that is at times hilarious, but at others down-right boring.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 based solely on the great perfomances and the Tony Clifton sightings."

","Man on the Moon is the life story of Andy Kaufman.  There is no question that Kaufman was brilliant, and that when he chose to do so, he could charm and mystify his audience.  The problems that he faced were almost all self-inflicted damage.  At times Kaufman did humor that was acidic and grating.  Any in the audience that took him seriously or did not count themselves in on the joke, turned against him in a rage. <br/><br/>
The wrestling against women issue was the funniest example.  If you looked at it as pure humor and didn't allow yourself to believe that he really felt that way about women, it was very funny.  If you took him seriously, it was as offensive as any thing could be.  Andy was very like Lenny Bruce in that way.  He chose to attack societal norms to inflict shock on his audience. They were two of a kind in that regard.<br/><br/>And Jim Carrey was just brilliant.  It was possible to believe that you were just watching Andy and those around his life.  They also mixed in enough people playing themselves to further that illusion.  They also had a lot of fun hiring actors and others in his life, to play different characters in his life, DeVito playing Shapiro, and Shapiro playing a club owner for example.  <br/><br/>The biggest disappointment for me in the entire film was not getting to see the song `I go mad when I hear a yodel'.  On one of Andy's Saturday Night Live appearances he did that song over the music of a Choir of Conga players.  It was absolutely remarkable.  The yodeling over the top of the extremely funky groove was strange and just hilarious.  I was so hoping to see it includedÂ…<br/><br/>And of course the continuous running gag with the Tony Clifton character was another amazing piece of acting by Carrey.  JC was playing Kaufman, playing Clifton.  It was almost eerie how he could drop in and out of characters. The Clifton character was the ultimate obnoxious lounge singer, taken to the greatest extreme possible.<br/><br/>Kaufman was the consummate prankster or practical joker, and his favorite victim was his audience.  The Tony Clifton character was playing a concert, and Kaufman came out on stage just to try and trick on the audience.  He had his buddy play Clifton to add to the controversy.  He worked together with the pro wrestler in Memphis to create tremendous controversy.  I didn't know until I saw the movie that this was an agreement between those two.  I thought it was real.  Andy had put one over on me for nearly 20 years.  The only problem with this joking was its failure as a marketable commodity.<br/><br/>Then as he was dying, he went to the Philippines to find a miracle cure for his Cancer, and instead he found a showman and grifter.  It was just the kind of show that Andy himself might have done at some point.  When he realized it was fake and how, the joke was on him, that realization was just one of the things that made me cry during this film.  The irony of that moment was impossible to miss.  Also what a horrible time he had convincing every one that he really had cancer.  He had `cried wolf' in a comic sense once too often to be believed.<br/><br/>The funeral scene was another that brought on tears.  Watching everyone who had been in his life singing together and holding hands was the ultimate Kaufman fantasy.  Andy lived to see people just getting happy, and he made his final act and remembrance just such an event.  This movie will move you, twist you and wring you out. It is a must see."

","I liked the movie, but I have a little trouble with the hype.  Jim Carrey does a great tribute to Andy Kaufman, and you can tell he got into the character and that he really cared about portraying him well.  But the fact remains, Jim Carrey is NOT Andy Kaufman.  Carrey is a highly-talented actor with a great range of physical humor, it cannot be denied.  Andy Kaufman, on the other hand, was into strictly conceptual humor.  His biggest physical trait was a disarming boyish innocence.  As a comedian, he was much more limited than Carrey.  His act was one whacky idea at a time, played to the hilt.  He would ""become"" his concept, suppressing anything else in his personality for the duration of the act. Carrey is at a little disadvantage in trying to portray this.  Maybe it's because he naturally brims with personality, always threatening to burst out.<br/><br/>Kaufman's concepts were almost always off the wall, which played well to a pot-smoking generation.  He almost always was able to deliver the goods with a straight face.  Whatever the weird concept, Kaufman always played it straight down the line.  His ""Taxi"" work was a single shtick -- a non-English-speaking, borderline hysteric, very verbal and high-strung.  It was, like his other routines, a single concept, although for some reason it was almost always funny.  I remember his routines from Saturday Night Live, too.  They were much funnier than the movie's recreation of them.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe it was because Kaufman was LESS naturally funny than Carrey, which combined with the whacky concept, was somehow completely hysterical.<br/><br/>This is not an easy film to make.  Milos Forman is a genius of a director. With Carrey and DeVito to work with, he's managed to capture a lot of the environment and spirit of Kaufman's life and work.  Most importantly, he's made a good film, one that's not only watchable, but continuously engaging.<br/><br/>I can't help but recommend this movie.  It'll be one you'll remember, at any rate."
"gagliano","Null","0","0","13 February 2000"," First of all....I loved it.
","First of all....I loved it. Jim Carrey is the spitting image of Andy Kaufman. Now with regards to wanting to see the movie this can be good, but it can also be a negative for the film. For there are some people who disliked Andy Kaufman so much that they could never bring themselves to watch a movie about him, let alone one that has an actor who truly brings him back to life. On the other hand, watching a film in which an actor such as Jim Carrey portrays a man as complicated as Kaufman so perfectly is worth seeing just for the great acting. Andy Kaufman is a comedian who did so many things to the audience that made him both endearing and hated. He was so enjoyable to watch on ""Taxi"" and yet so offensive to watch on TV talk shows when he became a woman's worst enemy. This film is the brainchild of Danny Devito, who not only worked alongside Andy Kaufman on ""Taxi"" but also stars in this film. I give two recommendations: 1) if you liked Andy Kaufman (even the slightest) you should see this film for Jim Carrey is excellent; and 2) if you disliked Andy Kaufman, you should see this film because it will open your eyes to the complexity yet simplicity of the man. ""Man on the Moon"" brings some deeper understanding and appreciation for Kaufman as an actor/artist/comedian. It seems that this season has brought forth a great deal of true stories to the big screen and I think that's cool. Anytime we can gain a greater appreciation of someone or something through movies, I am all for it, for it also brings back some great memories, rewrites an injustice, or it may just entertain us. Bottom line...while Andy Kaufman is someone who died at an early age and may have been completely forgotten in a few more years, this film will keep the inevitable from happening for at least a bit longer."
"stiny","10","0","0","13 February 2000"," If you believe they put a man on the moon...
","Andy Kaufman has come alive in Man on the Moon, the movie based on his own life. They say that Jim Carrey is the star of this movie but I certainly never saw him. Instead I saw Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman. Not the Jim Carrey of Dumb and Dumber or Ace Ventura or even The Truman Show. There were no usual, obnoxious, gross Jim Carrey jokes. Instead Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon. The one thing that makes this movie special is Carrey's `performance' which I think you can hardly call a performance because it is beyond that of a performance. He does something with his character of Andy Kaufman that we have rarely seen before. Something like Tom Hanks did with his character named Forrest Gump. Like Hanks, Carrey fuels the movie with his portrayal. Carrey does everything perfect as Kaufman including the nervous looks, the many voices, and the multiple egos that Andy had. Carrey not only portrays Andy Kaufman perfectly but all of Andy's characters including Taxi's Latka, the infamous Tony Clifton, and even Elvis perfectly. He is especially good as Tony Clifton, the Vegas lounge singer who to this day is still a mystery. Tony produces many of the laughs in Man on the Moon with his highly offensive behavior that often includes making fun of others. Carrey also recreates many of Kaufman's acts throughout the movie including ones on Taxi, Carnegie Hall, and Saturday Night Live. These recreated shows are some of the most interesting things about Man on the Moon due to the fact of how accurate they are. Some of the other stunts recreated in this movie are Andy's infamous appearances on The David Letterman Show and his highly controversial wrestling matches with whom he wrestled women. All of this is highly entertaining to watch and will make you love and hate Andy Kaufman's character all at the same time. However, Man on the Moon is not just a movie about Andy's acts and many different personalities. It is a movie about Andy as a person. It shows with much heart and feeling how Andy was affected by his many triumphs and tragedies. How he rejoiced when leaving Taxi and how his whole world was an act with him playing the main character. He was in character all the time never coming out. Never revealing his true nature to anyone, not even himself. There never was a `real' Andy. It shows how he always would almost abuse the crowd always making them angry with him and making the tension build between the audience and himself. If he did not like the audience he would simply bore them but if they were a good crowd going along with his never before seen humor and antics he would please them and try to put on his best show for them. Andy never liked to be recognized for just one character like he was for many years with Latka. He wanted people to know him as his many personalities not just singling out one character to know him as. His famous run on Taxi was the thing that made him characterized as Latka for those many years. One of the best parts in the movie comes when Andy is trying to do his act while everyone in the audience is yelling for him to do Latka. This of course makes Andy mad and very disgusted with the crowd. So instead of doing his act Andy decides to bore the audience by reading The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. He does not stop until the whole book from cover to cover is complete. When he looks up after the act is over and after finishing the book the few members of the audience who are left are asleep. This might well be the best scene in Man on the Moon. A great supporting cast and a legendary director back up Jim Carrey in this superb movie. Paul Giamatti, whom I am sure you have seen before as either the notorious `Pig Vomit' in Private Parts, Ed Harris' assistant in The Truman Show, the reluctant hostage in The Negotiator, or as the soldier who knocked down the wall while trying to get a rock out of his boot in Saving Private Ryan, plays Bob Zmuda. Zmuda is Andy's writer and partner in crime who helps Andy think up his many acts, stunts, and pranks. Zmuda is the best supporting character in Man on the Moon. Danny DeVito plays George Shapiro, Andy's agent. You may remember DeVito was one of Andy's fellow cast mates in Taxi. DeVito also serves as one of the producers of the film. His performance is solid but nothing special. Courtney Love (The People vs. Larry Flynt) plays Lynne, Andy's wife. She does a decent job and seems to have good chemistry with Carrey. The are a number of cameos in this movie including ones by Christopher Lloyd and Jerry Lawler who both portray themselves. The renowned Milos Forman expertly directs Man on the Moon. He is well known for his works such as One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus which both earned him an Academy Award. He puts his expertise into Man on the Moon to make it a great picture. Man on the Moon should appeal to many people. Kaufman fan's or not they will enjoy this movie and have a great time seeing it. If you do not like Andy and his brand of humor you still might be satisfied with this movie because watching Jim Carrey at work as Andy Kaufman is an incredible thing. If nothing else see this movie for Carrey's performance alone. The best thing that Man on the Moon does is it does not try to explain why Andy did what he did or why Andy was why he was. Both of these things are unexplainable and if this movie had attempted that it would have turned into one big mess. It simply shows who Andy was and it makes you laugh and cry along with him. It makes you appreciate Andy and his style of humor and it makes you want to see more of him. Man on the Moon forces you to become emotionally involved with Andy and his life. But Man on the Moon ultimately makes you wish Andy were still with us making us mad and stirring up controversy. ****(cinematic ecstasy)"

","Firstly, I was largely impressed with Jim Carrey as Andy. Wow.

My opinion of him changed upon seeing this movie. :)<br/><br/>(I read the guidelines and want to disclaim the following as a possible spoiler, but very unlikely to ruin the movie.) I want to mention I was dissapointed that Danny DeVito didn't play ""Louie"" from Taxi... It just didn't seem right that all the other cast members were there... and Danny played a character IN the movie (I'm having a hard time explaining it, but I think most of you know what I mean).

","Although not a biography in the traditional sense, I nevertheless found this movie very entertaining and at times moving.  I only knew Andy Kaufman from watching Taxi as a kid, but I never knew he had so many strings to his bow, and the blurring of the lines between reality and fiction in his work certainly added an interesting theme to the movie. I'm not usually Jim Carrey's biggest fan but he proved himself to be an excellent dramatic actor with a very creditable performance. Strong support from the likes of Danny de Vito also added to the film. My only disappointment was Courtney Love, but then I just don't like her anyway! I suppose you can't have everything. Anyway, this is definitely a film worth seeing, and if nothing else it has one of the funniest and original openings I've ever seen."

","Jim Carrey, although known as a comic actor, is excellent at dramatic work also.  He proved this in 1998's The Truman Show.  Although he won the Golden Globe for The Truman Show, he was shut out in the Oscar race.  Also taking home a Golden Globe for Man On The Moon, it will be a shame if he is not at least nominated for the Oscar this year.  As Andy Kaufman, this is the role that Jim was born to play, a comedian who was often misunderstood."

","Spoilers ahead:<br/><br/>I've heard all the negative things about Man on the Moon, such as, it adds nothing new about what is already known about Kaufman, or it doesn't go inside Andy's head to see what makes him tick. Well say what you will, at least it doesn't present fabrications or half-truths unlike a certain other bio-pic (*cough* The Hurricaine *cough*). Besides, it would be impossible to try to portray what motivated Andy. Even his closest friends and family did not truly know who Andy really was.<br/><br/>Although there are many hilarious moments in the film, there is an underlying sadness about it, that Kaufman was never really appreciated or understood during his life, and is only geting respect after death. My favorite part was the final moments of Andy's life, when he travels to the Phillipines to see a psychic surgeon to cure his cancer and discovers that it's all a hoax. After spending most of his life fooling his audience with his antics, he's the one being tricked. The irony is not lost on Kaufman before he dies. Jim Carrey gives a tour de force performance as Kaufman, and should definitely be in the runinng for the Best Actor Oscar."

","I'd heard a few interviews (e.g., Charlie Rose, NPR) with Taxi characters, Bob Zmuda, and others who'd known Andy.  Out of that, I had a suspicion that Andy was a somewhat unusual variant of a Multiple Personality Disorder in which neither he -- nor anyone else -- knew who he really was.  Everything I saw in the movie only strengthened this view.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey did a great job of showing us, letting us experience in small part, the dilemma that Kauffman induced so many people to feel about him. If Carrey wins the Oscar for the role, no one who's seen the movie would be surprized.  For me, the supporting cast was also excellent.  The movie was long but compelling enough that I wasn't wondering when it would end.<br/><br/>The only thing missing was more of a hint as to ""why?"" -- why did Andy get that way?  But perhaps that's asking for far more than anyone knows and might have needed passing a considerable amount of speculation as bio-drama.<br/><br/>

This movie offers no insight to who Andy Kaufman was or why he acted the way he did. It brings up the question--why did they bother making the movie? Movie biographies are usually made to show us who someone was and why they acted in a certain way.

Yes, the reviewers are right on many accounts: it's not an idealized portrait, it does have to make changes for dramatic purposes, and it can't cover everything in his life.  But...<br/><br/>It's a film that demands a viewer to be patient, to be willing to accept that it won't have all the answers, and perhaps most importantly to have an open mind and heart...to at least *try* to understand him, to see why he was/is important, unique, and beautiful.  A viewer with those attributes will have a huge head start on enjoying this film.<br/><br/>This description does make the movie sound cold but it is really very funny and touching.  The script and direction evoke feelings skillfully yet without callous manipulation.<br/><br/>And then there is Jim Carrey...if ever a movie depended so much on a lead actor's performance, it is this one, and he rises to the incredible task set before him (as Peter Travers pointed out in ""Rolling Stone"") to deny his own personality so Andy's can shine through.  It is not a ""mere impersonation"", despite what you may have heard.  No ""mere impersonation"" can make a person weep.  There is something greater at work here.<br/><br/>Perhaps you won't feel the same way - I understand that.  You're not me. But please give ""Man on the Moon"" a chance.

","I came into the picture never having seen Andy Kaufman in anything, not on Saturday Nite Live, not on Taxi, not anywhere. Somehow (I must have been severely distracted at the time) he was off my radar screen. Some friends told me they loved him and waited for  all of his appearances -- he was different, a genius, etc., and I was looking forward to the picture. I must admit I came out confused - a strange movie about a strange and apparently dysfunctional human being who may or may not have been a genius, depending on how loosely one uses that word.<br/><br/>I don't remember seeing a movie with so many audience reaction shots. The purpose seemed to be to let you, the audience, know that it it was appropriate to be confused, or embarrassed. Andy's concept (and he stated during the film that he was NOT a comedian) seemed to be fully confrontational and to act unexpectedly at all times (say, like a 4 year old). Some of it was certainly funny, but most of it was simply embarrassing. (This may have been completely intentional on Kaufman's part.) I know that this point of view puts me into the category of old fogy, but so it goes. When you can't say you're sick to someone  and be taken seriously, maybe you have gone too far.<br/><br/>Yes, I will make amends and try to get Andy Kaufman reruns.

Danny DeVito plays George Shapiro, Kaufman's manager who finds himself defending Andy constantly. Paul Giamatti plays Kaufman's best friend Bob Zmuda and Courtney Love plays Kaufman's girlfriend Lynne Marguilles.

","MAN ON THE MOON is a thoroughly unpleasant little movie about Andy Kaufman. Andy Kaufman was a gifted performance artist of the 1970s and 80s, with, unfortunately, the self-discipline of a mean-spirited seven year-old. Thoroughly unpleasant little movies generally are rewarded with small audiences and grosses, and this one, thankfully, is no exception.   Unfortunately for Universal, MAN ON THE MOON cost 100 million dollars, largely for the salary of star Jim Carrey, for whom this movie can only be called a ""vanity piece."" Carrey is in virtually EVERY scene; worse, no other actor is given a chance to ""break out"" and show any real emotional range.  Worse, Carrey ""imitates"" Kaufman's best bits, but never succeeds in submerging himself in the role. In any event, that may have been a futile task.  No one seems to have known whom ""Andy Kaufman"" really was.  To paraphrase Courtney Love's character, ""There is no 'real [Andy Kaufman].'""<br/><br/>Some of what Kaufman did was funny, hilariously so (largely his TAXI work, which he disowned).  Most, unfortunately, was rude, condescending, self-indulgent, embarrassing, cruel and, worst, unfunny.  Too bad, this is the work that is largely on display in MAN ON THE MOON.  While we long for Latka Gravas and Vic Ferrari, we get Tony Clifton and the ""Intergender Wrestling Champion.""  The stars of TAXI are exploited; but what made THAT show great is entirely excluded.   Would it have been too much for ONE interchange between Latka (Carrey) and Simka (Carol Kane)?  All Kane gets to do is sit around looking embarrassed and slightly frightened at ""Tony Clifton's"" antics.  Kaufman may have thought TAXI (and his contribution to it) was junk; but, just because Kaufman was a great performance artist doesn't make him a good judge of his own work.<br/><br/>MAN ON THE MOON is not a terrible movie.  It's just a terribly wrongheaded movie.  It's about as much fun as root canal work; as was, unfortunately, much of Andy Kaufman's ""humor.""   And, to you die-hard Kaufman fans, who might be offended by that comment; hey guys, I'm only joking..."

","There has been much panning of this film because it does not delve into Kaufman's inner workings. The people who were the harshest most probably had not viewed ""I'm From Hollywood"" or ""A Comedy Salute To Andy Kaufman"" before watching ""Man On The Moon."" Andy was best known as the adorable Latka on Taxi, but his other characters were focused on much more. This film made many people uncomfortable because you're not supposed to laugh at some obnoxious person named Tony Clifton degrading and spilling beer on his audience. As I laughed aloud, almost through the entire picture, it was almost more funny to see the audience reacting to the few people laughing than the film itself. Most people unfamiliar with Andy Kaufman's deeds during his career have misguidedly labelled ""Man On The Moon"" as shallow, and although almost all critics have recognized Jim Carrey's performance as truly impressive and unique he is likely to get snubbed again in the 2000 Academy Awards. The truth is, probably no one knew or knows what made Kaufman tick, but who cares. His legacy survives as a comic pioneer not because of who he was, but what he did. ""Man On The Moon"" fell out of the top ten at the box office in mere weeks because of what it is, an inside joke for all Kaufman fans."

","If the movie seems to run in chronological order, there is a slight anachronism.  During Andy's first performance where he meets Shapiro, he tells the audience that he is going to do his impression of Jimmy Carter, President of the United States.  However, Carter wasn't elected until 1976. Since Andy's performance seems to precede Andy's appearance on the first ""Saturday Night Live"", which premiered in 1975, Carter couldn't have been president at the time.  Ford or Nixon would've been the president in office at that moment."

","Let me start by saying that I do not regret seeing this movie, nor would I recommend against it -- especially those who thought  that Andy Kaufman really was a sexist pig who wrestled women to  prove men were superior.  But fans of his humor will be disappointed.  I must also say that I have not liked most of Carey's humor with the lone exception of ""The Mask"" -- he does manage to pull off AK as well as anyone could have.<br/><br/>This was a real hollywoodizationalization that tries to ""humanize"" AK for those who ""misunderstood"" his humor.  Anyone who took his macho wrestling against women stuff seriously should see this movie and be ""educated.""  Just like anyone who thinks the pro wrestling fights in the parking lot are real should talk to his or her daddy or mommy.<br/><br/>
I remember almost wetting my pants during the real letterman ""fight"" when the ""insulted pro wrestler"" decked AK whose neck he had ""cracked"" in the ring with a ""piledriver"".  Dave's reenactment was less than genuine -- i remember him pulling off his ""fearful"" routine far better in the original -- kissing up to Lawler.  That was part of what made the whole routing funny then, it was decidedly less funny in this movie.  Thinking about it I have to agree with many viewers' impression that this thing looks like it was hacked up by some standard brand studio editing.<br/><br/>Like a pro wrestler, andy made us believe his characters while this movie tries to make a larger audience that never liked or even had a clue as to the humor in his routines ""like Andy"".<br/><br/>A nice homage, I would have preferred less sap and more AK spirit -- like trying to convince us his death was staged -- that would have Andy Kaufman smile.

","Many of Andy's antics are recreated in this film, making it a kind of ""Best Of"" compilation.  Unfortunately, some of the details were romanticized, as is so common in Hollywood.<br/><br/>However, the film is very enjoyable, interesting, and funny.....funny especially because you get a better idea of where Kaufman was coming from than you did when he was alive(Hard to believe it's already been over 15 years since he died).  His years on the TV show Taxi is given some substantial time (with most of the original cast members present), as well as his escapades in the wrestling ring with women and Jerry Lawler. Particularly funny are the bits when Kaufman was his alter-ego, Tony Clifton.  I have never been much of a fan of Jim Carey's, but he did an EXCELLENT job of portraying Andy Kaufman in this film. <br/><br/>
Of course, you know that near the end of the movie, Kaufman will die, and although the film deals with it as painlessly as possible, I left the theater saddened that I hadn't paid more attention to Kaufman when he was alive."
"Tug-3","Null","0","0","10 January 2000"," An unsatisfying biopic
","As a die-hard fan of Andy Kaufman, I am upset to be so disappointed with his long-awaited film biography.  While _Man on the Moon_ is a well-made film, it presents a portrait of the comedian that simply does not ring true.  I understand that Kaufman was a complex individual whose life cannot be summed up in a satisfying package.  But this movie leaves out the one important aspect of Kaufman's multiple personalities that made him bearable and entertaining: his innate sweetness.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey does a good job of aping Kaufman's mannerisms, and he does manage to create a three-dimensional, interesting character.  However, his performance is too brutish, too physically intimidating, to really capture what made Kaufman appealing.  Carrey's Kaufman is a complete pain and everyone around him knows it.  The film makes no attempt to explain why George Shapiro promoted the renegade comedian so relentlessly; why Bob Zmuda put up with his bullying; why his parents and his girlfriend weathered the cruelty of his gags; why the entire cast of ""Taxi"" admired him despite his prima donna status and his self-centered shenanigans; or why anyone would make a movie honoring such a mean-spirited individual.<br/><br/>Whether or not Kaufman was ""nice"" is a subject for endless debate.  In interviews concerning Kaufman, his onetime colleagues almost unanimously discuss his good-natured sweetness, his generosity, and his boundless creativity.  It seems incongruous that the selfish star Carrey portrays would inspire such adulation.  <br/><br/>At the same time, the movie soft-pedals Kaufman's more irritating moments as well.  When he reads the entire _Great Gatsby_ to his audience, Forman underscores the scene with an orchestral adaptation of the movie's theme song, as if to say ""What a misunderstood genius!,"" giving the scene an elegiac quality that is completely misplaced.  Even when Kaufman's acts fail, we are made to feel that audiences were wrong to walk out on him.  <br/><br/>As a result, the movie is tremendously unsatisfying.  We are left with no idea why anyone would ever find Kaufman appealing.  As a Kaufman fan, I could at last admire the last moments of the picture for their touching portrayal of Kaufman's battle with cancer.  But I am dismayed to think that for many audience members Carrey's portrayal will be the closest they come to experiencing Andy Kaufman's comic talents."

","The film is incredible.  I have been a big fan of Jim Carrey for years, and I have been a fan of Andy Kaufman for even longer, but after a while I could barely tell the difference between the two.  Carrey's performance alone is worth the price of admission.  The acting of the other main characters is excellent, although some of the roles, especially Courtney Love's, were rather limited.  Paul Giammanti is seen a lot but his character is not used to its full extent.<br/><br/>However, these two complaints are only minor ones when taken in the whole scope of the movie.  The story really brings you into it, and even those who aren't fans of Kaufman are drawn in.  The man portrayed is not a saint by far, perhaps not even likable at times, but Carrey and director Milos Foreman make him utterly intriguing.  Even if none of the information is new, and to those who followed Kaufman's career with anything more than a passing interest, Carrey's portrayal makes the movie worth your while."
"Gene Hoke","Null","0","0","5 January 2000"," Disappointing
","Man on the Moon is the eagerly awaited biography of Andy Kaufman directed by Milos Forman, an Academy Award winner whose last biographical feature was the outstanding The People vs. Larry Flynt. I want into this movie with very high expectations because: (1) I have a lot of respect for Forman as a director and (2) the early reviews were glowing, suggesting Oscar gold for both Forman and Carrey. Sad to say, I was disappointed. I didn't learn anything new about Kaufman from Man on the Moon, and in fact the movie seemed like little more than a series of sketches strung together in an attempt to illustrate Kaufman's life. The movie gets off to a promising start, showing us how Kaufman had the urge to entertain even as a child (he's just sure there are cameras in his bedroom walls broadcasting to some huge unseen audience). It then skips years into the future, and we find Kaufman (now played by Jim Carrey) is making a meager living doing stand up in nightclubs (of course, his idea of stand up involves reciting nursery rhymes to an increasingly hostile audience). His boss lets him go, explaining that Kaufman needs to learn to perform in a more conventional fashion in order to engage the audience (he suggests impressions or dirty jokes). Kaufman returns to wow the audience with a hilarious Elvis impression, and soon finds himself cornered by agent George Shapiro (Danny De Vito), who soon convinces him to star on the prime time sitcom Taxi against his better judgment (""Sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment"", he says). Taxi thrusts Kaufman into the public eye, a place in which he seems increasingly uncomfortable. He finally comes up with a funny scheme to get off of the program, involving his riotous alter ego sleazy lounge singer Tony Clifton (for whom Kaufman has secured a recurring role on the sitcom). It's about here that the movie seems to lose its' way. Kaufman meets Lynne (Courtney Love), and I suppose that we are to assume that the two develop a close relationship, even though the film doesn't give us very many interesting dialogue scenes between them (compare this with the intriguing relationship developed between Larry and Althea in Forman's People vs. Larry Flynt). Kaufman and Lynne become involved in the pro wresting circuit, pioneering intergender wrestling and causing quite a stir with such wrestling pros as Jerry Lawler. Kaufman becomes known as the ultimate prankster -- willing to do anything for a laugh, and liking nothing better than when he can fool his audience. In fact, his family and friends don't even believe him when he develops cancer -- they think it's just another elaborate prank, making comments such as ""This is a showbiz hospital, Andy knows all these doctors, etc"". But, it's not. One problem I had with Man on the Moon concerns personal preference. I just didn't find a lot of Kaufman's humor in this movie funny. Kaufman seems less a conventional comedian than he does a performance artist of sorts, and that's fine, but it makes for a long haul when you are watching a biography of a comedian you don't find particularly amusing. I laughed some during the movie (particularly at the scenes with Tony Clifton), but having seen the movie I can honestly say that I don't see why Kaufman is revered so. He seems less concerned with entertaining an audience than he does with entertaining himself, and indeed the second half of the movie deals in depth with his rejection by a mass audience, a development I understood completely (though the film treats it as baffling). If you are a big fan of Kaufman, you may find this movie hilarious and may want to add a star to my rating.... but I just didn't think a lot of it was funny. I can't lie. However, I think the main weakness with Man on the Moon is its failure to really probe the psyche of its protagonist. Going into the movie, I knew Andy Kaufman was on Taxi, I knew he was considered a comic genius, and I knew he was destined to tragically die quite young. The movie wasn't very illuminating in that it didn't really allow us to get to know Kaufman, and so when I left the theater I didn't know anything more about him than I did going in. Sure, Carrey is brilliant in the scenes in which he recreates Kaufman's skits, but when it comes time for him to really portray him as a character (in the second half of the movie), he seems lost. There just isn't much of a real character here for Carrey to sink his teeth into as an actor. Even though I personally find much of Kaufman's humor strange and unfunny, if the film had given me a really good idea of who Andy Kaufman was and what he did to deserve his status as a national icon, that would have been enough for a recommendation. It doesn't, and for that reason, the movie left me unfulfilled. It's quite good technically, with strong performances all around and the usual pro job from Forman, but the script seems pitched at the level of a tv-movie. A few less skit re-creations and less time spent on the wrestling coupled with more character development would've resulted in a higher grade from me. An honorable misfire. 6/10"

","In a way, Carrey-as-Kaufman's opening objections to the movie ring truer than the filmmakers probably intended.  The film is, as many here have noted, a mostly shallow biography.  It is saved only somewhat by a terrific impersonation and a fascinating subject.<br/><br/>I'm not a Johnny-come-lately to either the Kaufman or Carrey bandwagons.  I dug Andy from his SNL appearances on -- always saw the genius subtext of every ballsy bit he tried, even the ""controversial"" wrestling stuff.  And I liked Carrey from ""In Living Color"" on...in addition to becoming a fine actor, he has become perhaps the most talented physical comedian since Buster Keaton.  It's fitting that they both have the same birthday...this is truly a match made in comedy heaven.<br/><br/>So for that reason, and almost that reason alone, the movie is worth seeing at least once.  But man, what a botched attempt at a great film!   We get overly simplified transitions between Kaufman bits, a woefully slight treatment of Kaufman's developing years (Why TM?  Why Zmuda?  Why the ""performance art"" approach?), and a sloppy approach to the details of Kaufman's life (for example, no mention that he did ""Van Dyke & Company"" before ""Taxi""; that Dick Ebersol, not Lorne Michaels, produced SNL when Kaufman was fired from the show...and where was Elayne Boosler, a close pal and former girlfriend of Andy's?  Her presence was acknowledged not at all.)<br/><br/>It's almost a shame to waste a great performance like Carrey's on a movie this compromised and lame (it does look as if it were brutally edited.) Someday, I hope, another fine actor will take on portraying Andy, and be supported by a director, writer and producer more committed to providing insight about Kaufman the man."

There was also the whole wrestling schtick and Tony Clifton (the obnoxious untalented lounge singer).  Kaufman went out of his way to push peoples' buttons and lots of people couldn't wait to see what outrage he'd commit next.  I frankly couldn't have cared any less. While the film did not change my opinion of Andy Kaufman, it did reinforce my opinion of Jim Carrey's acting abilities. <br/><br/>Carrey does not merely play Kaufman, he becomes him: from his physical appearance to his mannerisms.  Carrey displays a depth and energy that goes beyond anything he has done before. I was concerned that he might give an over-the-top performance then realized that given the subject matter that simply wasn't possible.  Carrey apparently became so enmeshed with the character that while on set his colleagues addressed him by the names of the different persona he portrayed.

If rules are made then more often than not they should be broken. Amazingly humor and chaos are often the by-products. If he stirs up extreme antipathy, all the better. I will not spoil the extravaganza part of the movie but it is amazing. Andy has the sensibility of a child at Christmas who leaves Santa milk and cookies.

When he is on the table he notices ""his tumor"" being palmed by the ""surgeon"". I am sure that the macabre humor of just another reality illusion is not lost on him.

He actually became Andy.  Unlike Carrey's other movies in which he plays pretty much a stereotypical character, in this you get to see a different version of him.  The writers of the movie, Scott Alexander and Larry Karazewski, along with director Milos Forman, did an excellent job of portraying the most important aspects of Kaufman's life.  To me, they captured the many different sides of him:  his comic ingenuity, opinions of the entertainment world, his ""different"" (and unaccepted) childhood, and his wracked emotions.  Carrey's co-stars include Danny DeVito as his manager George Shapiro, Courtney Love as his girlfriend Lynne Margulies, and Paul Giamatti (also known as ""Pig Vomit"" from Howard Stern's ""Private Pars"") as Kaufman's best friend and writer Bob Zmuda.  And although I really don't like Courtney Love, she is a very convincing actress; I'll give her that much.  So I do really recommend this movie to everyone, but I would suggest that you have previously seen some of Kaufman's work, or at least have a bit of an interest in his life and who he was.

If you're a Jim Carrey fan do not go in expecting the typical Carrey flick, he is hardly distinguishable from Kaufman himself, and immerses himself in the role.

What was really cool about this movie was that while there was some dramatic license taken in some places, many of the scenes were recreated exactly as they happened originally.  One thing that disappointed me though was that in almost all of the recreations the actual people were used where ever possible with one glaring exception.  When they recreated the night Kaufman guest starred on Fridays.  Norm MacDonald portrayed an actor that was actually Michael Richards of Seinfeld/Kramer fame.  I was disappointed that Richards didn't play himself there.  Jeff Conway who's been said to have punched Kaufman out appeared in the film, so why no Michael Richards??<br/><br/>I didn't know much about the Tony Clifton stuff, but the first scene he appears in was hilarious and disturbing at the same time.  I won't spoil it, but it was genius.  <br/><br/>If you know anything about Andy Kaufman, you have to see this movie just so you can see Jim Carrey play him.  It's almost unbelievable."

Insanity or Genius is the big issue, and as Jim Carey portrayed in this movie, Andy was 100% pure genius, just as Carey was.<br/><br/>Anyone who doubts Carey's dramatic acting abilities, even after the Truman Show, will be proven wrong completely by his role in MOTM.

","I really wanted to like this movie a lot.  I'm not a huge Jim Carrey fan, but I knew beforehand the level of commitment he made to really becoming Andy Kaufman for this part.  Fortunately, his performance does not disappoint.  Down to Andy's voice qualities and mannerisms, Jim Carrey really succeeded in in exploring and reflecting each of Andy's strange personalities on Taxi and on the stage.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is that every scene that takes place off stage is tragically shallow.  There is not a drop of depth to this movie or any of its characters.  The talent that is wasted in this movie is almost criminal. Courtney Love, who proved to be a great talent in Forman's ""People vs. Larry Flynt"" hardly has any meaningful screen time or dialogue.  Paul Giamatti, one of the great character actors of recent memory is completely wasted in this film, playing a two-dimensional Bob Zmuda with only a single flash of his real acting brilliance (if you haven't seen him before, check out Private Parts or The Negotiator).  Danny DeVito tries to escape the shallow script but is largely unsuccessful as well.  Its not that these performances are poor, only that they have very little good material to work with.<br/><br/>The ""Taxi"" scenes were also strange with no real dialogue for any of the cast members, only multiple scenes of them watching Andy's antics with concerned or angry looks on their faces and showing their ages much too much for the scenes to seem real.  There was also the conspicuous absence of Tony Danza.<br/><br/>In short, if you want to relive some of Andy's great comic genius, you will enjoy Jim Carrey's portrayal.  If you want to see a film that really explores the off screen life of one of the 80's most misunderstood and enigmatic figures, you are going to be sorely disappointed.  Milos Forman is capable of a much, much better film than this."

","""Man on the Moon"" is a truly stunning look into the mind and the genius of Andy Kaufman.  It was hilarious at times, not because it was comedy, but it was looking at the sorts of stunts Andy Kaufman would pull.  Andy Kaufman truly was a genius, because he not only managed to confuse the hell out of his audiences, but he confused the people he was working for as well.  He treated comedy and entertainment almost as if it were some big conspiracy, in which the audience was left in a haze.  On the other hand, his idea of comedy was merely p***ing people off, instead of trying to make them laugh, which unfortunately, brought great hatred upon himself.  After Jim Carrey did ""The Truman Show"", he has found his way into dramas instead of comedies. Here, Jim Carrey, a comic genius himself, seems as if he were born for the role of Andy Kaufman.  Carrey really does an amazing job, matching every minute mannerism and facial expression, which should most definitely earn Jim Carrey an academy award.  People complain that they know no more about Andy Kaufman than they did before seeing this film.  I knew some stuff about him, so I was somewhat prepared for the movie.  However, ""Man on the Moon"" functions more as a tribute to Andy Kaufman and his comic genius, rather than a biography.  In a way, that's probably the way Andy would have wanted it to be.  I liked this film very much and it's certainly an oscar caliber picture.  Mainly, this is a film for those who liked Andy Kaufman and his comedy.  I do hope that there will be some videos of him available since the movie came out.  My thanks to Milos Forman and Jim Carrey for giving the world such a great film, ""thank you veddy much""!"

","Jim Carrey, originally just cast as an obnoxious character with the rubber face, has managed to really start breaking out with better and deeper parts. Admittedly, I didn't care for Ace Ventura, but with acting skills displayed in Man On the Moon and the Truman Story, I could become quite the fan.  I won't bore you with details or personal thoughts and comments, but I can sum this movie up in one sentence:  if you have seen the autobiography on A&E, you have seen this movie.  There is no new information.  No insight.  No answer to why?  Andy Kaufman was a performance artist that performed for reaction.  It just happened to be a benefit that he was able to make money doing it.  Jim Carrey performed like a man possessed and played the part as well as Andy did.  If you have 2 hours to kill and want some to see top notch acting by Jim Carrey, who may just yet make that break to drama (can anyone saw Tom Hanks or Robin Williams?), and have not seen the life of Andy Kaufman, this is a worthwhile movie."

"spe1977","Null","0","0","29 December 1999"," Is Jim Carrey Andy Kaufman, or vice versa
","After driving home from watching this movie, I wondered if it was worth all the hype.<br/><br/>First, will this movie get Jim Carrey the Oscar?  In my opinion, this won't even get him a nomination.  Although Milos Forman cast Carrey perfectly for the role, it was only because Jim Carrey is the Andy Kaufman of the nineties.  If the roles were reversed and Kaufman starred in the movie, `Jim Carrey: There Was No Pet Detective Like Him, Kaufman would be receiving the praise.  Critics say, `you think you are actually seeing Andy,' and although most people will agree, is it a true statement?  For the first part of the film, the audience sees Carrey, a man who is imitating a performance artist, but as the film continues, you forget you are watching Carrey.  Why is that? Great acting?  The only way I can explain it is like when watching a movie made in England (Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Full Monty, ect). At first, it is impossible to understand what anyone is saying because of the accents, but as the film goes on, you slowly start to feel more comfortable with the accents and without even consciously realizing it, you can understand ever word.  That is the only way I can parallel it.  I watched Carrey's bad imitation, got used to it, and by the end of the movie thought it was dead on.<br/><br/>
Second, the movie in general.  I would have to agree with the majority of the critics who state that Forman, Alexander, and Karaszewski did not go deep enough into Andy's world.  Andy Kaufman had a complex life, but the film only touched the surface.  It seemed research was gathered only by watching The E! True Hollywood Story and A Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman on Comedy Central.   It only covered what the public already knew, as opposed to The People VS. Larry Flint, which went much deeper.<br/><br/>
Other than that, the rest was good.  You can always count on a solid performance by Danny DeVito and Paul Giamatti (always funny).  Although her role served no purpose in the movie, Courtney Love did a fine acting job. This again brings back the point that the movie did not go deep enough.  If she was in the movie, they should have gone all the way and dove more into her character.  Without that, she was just a pretty face."

","Man on the Moon is one of the stranger films I've seen in recent memory, which is fitting for the life of one of the strangest men ever to acheive fame, however fleeting.  From the first scene, in which Jim Carrey (as Kaufman) tries to convince us the film is already over, the movie is a non-stop celebration of Kaufman's sense of humour, in which the joke was usually on the audience.  The film is somewhat sketchy - Kaufman appears to go from nightclub comedian to 'Saturday Night Live' guest in no time flat - but Jim Carrey's remarkable performance perfectly re-enacts his most famous comic antics.  I was not really familiar with Kaufman before seeing this film, but I will now try to hunt down his real performances on tape.<br/><br/>The audience I saw the film with didn't really know how to react.  Andy Kaufman is not really that well known to Carrey's usual audience, and it wouldn't surprise me if many theatregoers didn't even know Andy Kaufman was a real person.  Indeed the audience was as befuddled as the people who paid to see Kaufman do 'Latka' and ended up hearing him recite 'The Great Gatsby' in full.  All of this may hurt the film at the box office - but I think Kaufman, in a way, would have approved. (8/10)"

This movie and The Truman Show prove that Carrey has really cleaned up as an actor.  It's kinda like Robin Williams but Williams seems to go more for merely sentimental sappy scripts rather than emotional and smart (Williams movie's past the mid 90's are O.K. but that's it). Carrey does Andy Kaufman justice in a movie that makes you wonder what's a joke and what's true in the world of comedy.  This film isn't for everyone but it is a movie worth watching.

","Publicity for Milos Forman's biopic on Andy Kaufman has turned this film into less of a tribute to the late comedian and more of an Oscar grab for Jim Carrey.  Since Carrey was snubbed by the Academy the previous year for The Truman Show, Carrey's camp have been eagerly pushing this one as his second coming.  <br/><br/>Man on the Moon is indeed a tribute to the late comedian who's comic style was not necessarily genius, but certainly off-beat.  In the movie we are treated to almost all of his best gags, most of which were meant to get a reaction from the audience, but not necessarily one of laughter.  As Kaufman experts note, often he was the only one laughing.  And even more often than not, we were never sure of what was real and what was fake. <br/><br/>
Jim Carrey does do an admiral job of imitating the comedian.  Carrey brings to life many of the old acts, including wrestling with women, portraying the vulgar Tony Clifton and appearing as Latka on Taxi.  We are also treated to the behind-the-scenes antics, as the film suggests what was true of Kaufman's stunts and what wasn't.  <br/><br/>I remember watching Andy on Taxi and Saturday Night Live as a kid.  I also saw the Friday's episode where he started a fight and I saw the David Letterman episode where he sparred (again) with Jerry Lawler.  From that perspective, this film was well worth watching.  On the other hand, I saw this with someone who was not familiar with Andy, and they didn't seem to get it at all.  (I think that should tell you something.)<br/><br/>So, lets change the subject, since this is not a movie so much about Andy Kaufman, as it is a vehicle to get Jim Carrey an Oscar nomination.  Should Carrey get nominated for this film?  <br/><br/>Remember that I am writing this review well before the nominations have even been announced and the film has only been out for a week and a half.  Anyone reading after March 2000 will already know the whole sordid story.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey is good as Andy Kaufman, there is no doubt about that.  And if we want to play true Oscar politics here, he does deserve the Oscar nod only because he was ignored for another good film, The Truman Show, last year.  A little snubbing goes a long way in Hollywood.  <br/><br/>And let's take this a step further.  Carrey is a master comedian who had had some very funny moments in some pretty clever films (The Mask, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective) that would never be nominated. The Academy likes to recognize people for their body of work.  Carrey has had an impressive decade.<br/><br/>On the other hand, while Carrey is good, he isn't great.  From what I saw, Carrey is good at imitating Kaufman.  He does the bits just as well, and sometimes better.  He has the facial expressions and some of the vocal patterns down pat.  But when it comes time to really act Carrey doesn't seem to be all there.  When Kaufman finds out he has cancer, we see a little moaning  and crying, but not the kind of acting that Oscar nomination are made of.  <br/><br/>Sorry, but to judge the performance on its own merits, and officially, that is what we should be doing, Carrey does not give the best performance of this year.  Man on the Moon is worth seeing.  It's a good movie with a good performance.  I don't think it's the film that Carrey should be remembered by."

He recreates some of the best and most famous of Kaufman's performances and if you loved or hated them originally, you will feel the same here.<br/><br/>However, after the recreations of what I already knew, I was hoping to see what led Andy to perform the way he did.  What motivated him?  Why was he so dead set against ever letting the audience in on the joke (his one-upping the executive after the ""Fridays"" staged argument)  These questions the film doesn't answer.  Perhaps this is in keeping true to Andy's enigmatic persona but in a bio-pic I expect these kinds of revelations more than just finding out the truth about him & Jerry Lawler.<br/><br/>Speaking of the wrestling.  Way too much of this too-short film is dedicated to Andy's ""wrestling"" career.  Now, in all fairness, too much of Andy's life was dedicated to his wrestling career as well, but that doesn't mean the filmmakers have to make the same mistake.<br/><br/>Here's to hoping there is a 3 1/2 director's cut lying around somewhere that gives more background on this fascinating performer."

It's those dramatic moments that he needs to master a little bit more and I think he was closer to doing that in Truman Show.<br/><br/>As for the movie, I knew Andy Kaufmann only from Taxi, but I think the portrayal made here is one of the best possible.  You really get to see the complexity of a character that many people, including, at moments, even the closest friends, did not understand.

","Milos Forman is one of the greatest directors of our time. He has only made a handful of movies but each one he makes is an excellent success. ""Man On The Moon"" is no exception. Jim Carrey plays Andy Kaufman to a ""T"": his voice and mannerisms are top-notch. The movie doesn't leave out any major details about Andy Kaufman's life. Everything you've seen or heard about is in this movie. Although it's a few minutes shy of 2 hours, it never seems to rush through anything. I didn't want it to end. The opening scene is one of the most interesting scenes ever in a movie. This goes right up there with Forman's previous works (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus) and is superior over Forman's last biopic The People Vs. Larry Flynt, another very good movie but not an excellent one."

I don't want to give away a spoiler.  But other than that, nothing actually new is revealed about Andy Kauffman's controversial life. The movie is really a tribute, not a source for answers.

"lou-50","Null","0","0","30 December 1999"," The Boy Who Cried Wolf
","As a child, Andy Kaufman would perform make-believe TV shows in front of his bedroom wall because he believed his wall was his audience.  Later in life, he would ask his Mahareshi what the secret was to being funny and the response came back to be silent  not the silence of absent sound but the silence of listening inwardly.  Kaufman's world never became a world we could understand.   Milos Foreman film, ""A Man in The Moon"", while well-acted and directed, doesn't try to explain why Kaufman did what he did. Instead it chronicles the several well-publicized events of Kaufman's brief stardom with a near perfect portrayal by Jim Carrey.  So we see his stand-up routines ranging from the juvenile musical numbers to the Elvis impersonations,  we see his infamous relationships with alter-ego Tony Clifton and wrestler Jerry Lawler,  we see his supposed blow-ups' on Merv Griffin, David Letterman, and the Friday' shows, and we see his successful Carnegie Hall one-man engagement ending with the audience bussed to a hall for milk and cookies. But ""A Man in the Moon"" does not enlighten us to why a comic would push the envelope of his craft by performing as if he was still a boy, making mischief and not telling anyone about it, suffering and getting humiliated for the inward pleasure it derived.  Why did the film bring back many members of the Taxi' TV series including Marilou Henner, Judd Hirsch, Jeff Conaway (for that matter, Danny Devito) and then merely use them as props instead of integrating their take on Kaufman into the film?  Why did Kaufman's parents appear in largely non-speaking parts, again acting as props, when their dialogue would have been good source for explaining Kaufman's behavior.  Was Andy Kaufman a good prankster, a good showman forever putting on an act, or was he truly a comic genius?  ""A Man in the Moon"" suggest that he was all three.  But ironically, by recreating Kaufman as well as he did, Jim Carrey, years from now, will be remembered as the Man in the Moon' with Andy Kaufman as an afterthought."

The film devotes about 10 minutes tops to his stint on ""Taxi"" and recreates a whole bunch of events that Jim Carrey as Andy recreates for us to a tee. By the time we start to see a little bit about Andy Kaufman and what people thought about him, he's already dead and buried. I always liked him, on and off ""Taxi."" I recommend this flick only to those who have no idea what Andy Kaufman did while he was here. He wasn't a HUGE star, but he was an entertaining man. I'd be more interested in a film showing why a lot of stars who worked with him did not want any part of the film. Where was Tony Danza? I wish they explored his ""shock comic"" personality a little further. All in all, a bit of a disappointment, but a well done recreation of a lost comic.

During the crucial scene when Kaufman announces that he has cancer, the film started rolling and finally white light shone at the screen.  After about 5 minutes people began wondering if the film break was real or just part of the movie.  People were screaming out ""I'll bet it is part of the film""  Others shouted ""No, the film is broken"".  After about 15 minutes people were offered free passes because indeed the film had broken.  (I wouldn't be surprised if a Kaufman fan had somehow sabotaged the projector).  Indeed, if the director had actually decided to end the film that way, it would have been brilliant -a 10 rating!

","Going in I was leary. Andy Kaufmann, Jim Carrey? Kaufmann was described to me as a loony whenever described, and maybe he was, but what the writers, actors, and director Milos Forman have done is show us Andy (his true side?) at his best. I'm not going spoil anything but there's a few times in the film that you will be fooled by Andy's humor, but in the end, you'll love every second of it. You'll love Andy. You'll love Carrey for bringing Andy back for 2 hours. And it'll leave you questioning if any of it was really funny at all, or just a really damn good try.<br/><br/>I thought that this film towered over Forman's last exploration of a misleading personality, in ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt"", which struggled to show the torment of Hustler magazine's founder fighting for his first amendment rights. ""Man on the Moon"" doesn't waste time showing us every one of Andy's vices, but instead shows enough for us to know that he had them, but they didn't overcome him, the story stayed with Andy. In ""Larry Flynt"" it was sometimes diverted to his wife, Althea, also played by Courtney Love (as was Andy's girlfriend). In short, a touching history of a man trying his best in a business that sporadically awards greatness on a whim. In my mind, this film awards Andy his final world champion belt, in true form, thanks to Jim Carrey. A 9.8 out of 10, but I round down, so this fell to a 9 out of 10. But please, don't miss it... and don't walk out after the first 2 minutes, that was just a joke."

","Coming in to see this film, I had watched a Biography episode on him and thought that Andy Kaufman was a real example of a pure artist who put his art ahead of commercial success.  According to this film, that would seem to be the case, but also that that kind of stance is not always a good idea.<br/><br/>This film seems to show Andy as a performer with the soul of an artist, but lacked the instincts of a showman.  In other words, he and Zmuda were boldly original in their humour, but they too often failed to convey the humour to the audience. For instance, when Andy orders the verticle hold on the footage of his special put deliberately monkeyed with, there is no effort to let the audience in on the joke, not even a knowing wink to the camera. Compare this with Monty Python, who put out equally crazed and original comedy of their own, but they had the essential performing skill to include the audience in the humour and let them enjoy it.<br/><br/>In short, this film is an intriguing testament of the need for the balance of artistic challenge for the artist and the need for the audience to entertained at the same time.  This movie showed that Andy, however stunningly original he was, could not achieve that balance and paid the price."

","Andy Kaufman may have been a funny guy, but this movie is a bomb. Jim Carrey is not good as Kaufman, but Andy would have said..""Ï don't care"". The movie has so many flaws i really don't know where to start. Mr. Kaufman was an ""avante guard"" comedian, which is like saying...it is kind of art house and you ""get"" it or you don't. His flaky style of substituting himself with another character was funny...if you saw it once. But Andy used this over and over. He was in the sit-com Taxi, and if there was one thing Kaufman did have it was confidence in his own material. (he didn't see his weaknesses). The best thing one can say about Kaufman---is that he was highly original. The movie is one long tedious bore, and Carrey does nothing to lift the sinking film.

(what star doesn't). Is it news that TV has its trends, and he hooked into something (no). As Paul Giamatti says:...""we got 40,000 people tuning in to see 'Taxi' every night""... . Kauffman: ""What do they know?"". Giamatti: ""exactly"". Ah, yes, thank God for stupid American audiences.<br/><br/>The funeral scene in particular was irritating. Coutney Love, Peter Bonerz, Kauffman's parents, all are reverently singing the world is a happy place (or some such nonsense) because the sing-along song is a backdrop behind Kauffman's coffin. What is the subliminal message? We, Hollywood, revere Kauffman; we know something you don't.<br/><br/>Presumptuous, smug and really, I hope the international audiences out there don't think all American audiences are stupid.

Jim Carrey doesn't excel at playing Andy because he becomes Andy in the film, won't be surprised if he idolized him. The real Andy Kauffman was a unique and brilliant comedian who was ahead of his time. His comedic sketches on Saturday night live and performance in Taxi was incredible which displayed his foreign man character. He was arguably the most creative comic in the twentieth century who was well ahead of his time. Often his creativity and eccentricity was misunderstood by many as Andy was a purist in his comedy. Many saw his wrestling with women as taking it too far but never realized the joke was on Andy and not women. <br/><br/>Jim Carrey fills large shoes very well as he impersonated Andy who impersonated a foreign man and even his other personality Tony Clifton. We saw the often misunderstood Andy through most of his career and how a few of his stints were always an act. His tragic end is also well acted by Carrey which captured the tragic end to a legendary comic. Andy Kauffman once said he would fake his death and return years later.

","Man on the Moon (1999):Dir: Milos Foreman / Cast: Jim Carrey, Danny De Vito, Courtney Love, Paul Giamatti, Jerry Lawler: It showcases an individual who seeks recognition through diversity. Comedian Andy Kaufman died of lung cancer in 1984 and his thoughts were far away from the expectations of others. He was a daredevil whose stunts included characters like Tony Clifton the rude nightclub singer, or a wrestler who challenges women. Danny De Vito plays George Shaprio who discovers him, which leads to stints on Saturday Night Live and Taxi. It is not a pleasant story but director Milos Foreman brings insight into it as he did Amadeus and The People Vs Larry Flynt. Jim Carrey does a remarkable job portraying the wild personality of Kaufman. De Vito is excellent as a voice of reason and an onlooker of awe. Courtney Love as Kaufman's wife is first seen as one of the women he wrestles. Love also portrayed Larry Flynt's wife in The People Vs Larry Flynt. Paul Giamatti plays his partner in his acts and even sometimes becomes involved in the actual characters just to suspend the illusion. Wrestler Jerry Lawler is involved in an interesting subplot where he attacked Kaufman and eventually annihilates him in the ring. This is another triumph for Foreman who often documents controversial figures. It is a sad story of a joke that comes to an end at the expense of the joker. Score: 9 / 10"

","What an odd fellow Andy Kaufman was! Watching the biopic Man on the Moon is something of an effort within itself. It's a film that seems to want to unravel the mystery that was Andy Kaufman, and yet at the end seems content to leave him an eternal mystery. And maybe that's for the best.<br/><br/>Andy Kaufman wasn't very well known outside the US. To UK audiences, he's best known as the eccentric mechanic Latka from the sitcom Taxi. MOTM charts Kaufman's rise to fame, his offbeat antics outside the series, disagreements with co-workers and executives, all leading up to his eventual death from lung cancer in 1984.<br/><br/>Of all the people who could have portrayed Andy Kaufman, Jim Carrey really was the man most eminently qualified. Not only do they look alike, they share the same birthday, and Carrey's acting style is perfectly suited and in sync with Kaufman's.<br/><br/>To watch Carrey is to experience slowly growing astonishment. He so completely disappears into the man that he is Andy Kaufman. He doesn't just mimic the man. He is the man!<br/><br/>MOTM was a film that Carrey notoriously campaigned to be a part of. He wanted it so badly he simply stopped calling himself Jim Carrey for the entirety of the film's production. On and off set, he was only known as Andy Kaufman.<br/><br/>Although a box office flop at the time, MOTM is a real gem of a film. Not only because it contains one of Jim Carrey's finest performances to date, but I like it's imaginative construction.<br/><br/>Directed by Milos Forman, he starts the film off with a cracker of an opening scene. A Black & White Jim Carrey in front of a black background welcomes you to his movie, speaking in a higher register. He admits he edited out the bad parts himself until there was nothing left. He wants you to go home. And proves his point by rolling the end credits (in order of appearance) to the accompaniment of a cheesily uplifting melody on a tatty record player. The picture goes black. Carrey peers around the frame. And is surprised to see you're still here. Then he speaks in his normal voice, and shows you the real movie.<br/><br/>Its one of the most inventive, wonderful openings you'll ever see. But the scene impresses on more than one level because it gives us a fascinating insight into Andy Kaufman's mind. He was prepared to toy around with an audience's perceptions and expectations. He was a man who asked for a fair bit of patience from an audience. And just when it looks like his act is dying a horrible death, he instantly drops the act, and rewards you for your patience by launching into his real routine. That was the genius of Andy Kaufman.<br/><br/>That one scene encapsulates the driving force behind Kaufman, and the film itself understands that too, helped in no small part by the astonishing performance by Jim Carrey.<br/><br/>Nothing else in the film quite matches that scene's genius, but I really enjoyed MOTM, far more than I thought I was going to. Kaufman's routines were bizarre to say the least. And yet I still found them oddly funny. On the DVD special features, Milos Forman admitted he saw Kaufman doing stand-up. He had no idea what he was watching, but he laughed anyway. Quite often too. And I had similar feelings during MOTM.<br/><br/>Kaufman would often begin speaking in a funny voice, confounding an audience with what appeared to be his sheer lack of talent. And then just as suddenly launch into an uncanny impersonation of Elvis Presley. He was the master of deception.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey's performance is the one people ultimately talk about. And rightfully so. But there's a nice line of supporting characters too. One of the oddest touches to Man on the Moon is the inclusion of Danny DeVito. Now you may think that's an odd thing to say. Because DeVito played Louie in Taxi alongside Kaufman. But instead he plays Kaufman's long suffering manager, George Shapiro. That means he can't appear on the recreations of Taxi along with the other cast members (who all make cameo appearances). But oddly enough it works, and DeVito acts as the perfect sounding board for Kaufman's frustrations.<br/><br/>Special mention should also go to the very underrated Paul Giamatti as Kaufman's friend and co-conspirator Bob Zmuda. He was the one man who seemed to understand Kaufman's style, and occupied the same head-space. They're friendship is touching and intriguing too.<br/><br/>One of the most bizarre aspects to Kaufman was his alter-ego, Tony Clifton, an obnoxious lounge singer. I could never really understand why Kaufman immersed himself in such a thoroughly detestable person, but again Carrey plays this character just as expertly. Its a larger than life bit of acting, but Carrey lets out all the stops and makes Tony Clifton a completely different person. Which is as it should be.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey himself seems a lot like Andy Kaufman in real life. Two outrageous comedians you either learn to love or hate. It may be that key which makes Carrey so perfectly suited to this role.<br/><br/>When Kaufman learnt he was dying of lung cancer, despite the fact he didn't smoke, everyone thought it was another of his put-ons. Even I thought that. The film pulled off several narrative somersaults beforehand that really left my head spinning, so I was expecting the same thing here. Even during his funeral, you're half expecting him to sit up in his coffin and yell ""fooled ya"".<br/><br/>Andy Kaufman remains as much a mystery in death as he did in life. I don't think the film was trying to get to the heart of the man. If it did, he wouldn't be so fascinating. Its a film that wants to leave you confounded. Just as Andy Kaufman himself did to many an audience."

It's totally different situation, and it's a rare case for an exceptional hero. So the movie tried to be as unusual as its lead character. Nevertheless, remember that I said ""tried""!<br/><br/>It's not that kind of biography movie at all. It's a film about the success of a man, a comedian, who had all of these silly jokes, mysterious intentions, and odd style, though he made it to be a star, some kind of star anyway!<br/><br/>It's all in the last scene, where we have that unforgettable bored to death look from his wife and his producer, while all the acclamation of his fans for their star's biggest practical joke ever. Watch carefully the very last shot, with that wonder smile of his writer / friend (Bob Zmuda), which recognizes strongly that strange but great admiration from all of (Kaufman)'s audience. It's maybe the most powerful feeling created by that film, or THE certain meaning which created such a film originally, especially when you know that there is no accident like that in the actual life of (Andy Kaufman). It says: ""Even the silly ones have their own die hard fans"", and it's true. Otherwise, it's just a story about a man who believes in himself, being confident in his talent to the furthest limit, despite anyone or anything.<br/><br/>The problem of this film was its semi mute script. You think that the uniqueness of this man required much effort to scrutinize his character, and examine his history. Instead, it gave us results not reasons. No convincing, or even understandable, excuses for his behavior. And just too brief scene from his childhood - as his so-called ""history"" - which told eventually nothing. That's why the script ended up as endless practical jokes, silly one after another!<br/><br/>So, as a comedy, it's not one in the first place. As a bio-pic, I knew from it that its lead character was nearly untalented comedian, with twisted sense of humor that didn't make me laugh, rather made me disgusted. And as a character-study film, it didn't care to study anything, and its message about ""believing in yourself"" was represented through a story of a ridiculous loser, namely the worst representative for such a message!<br/><br/>(Man on the Moon) tried to be as different as its character, but didn't explore that character; thus lost it, the difference, and us. Its lead character reminded me with real characters through cinematic bio-pics; to be as self-centered and determined on assuring his greatness as (Lawrence of Arabia - 1962), and as art-loving and feeble-minded as (Ed Wood - 1994). This film's (Kaufman) was a cross between both, however without any glance of their luster. So - sorrowfully - the film was muddled. And while none of its factors deserved to be watched again, then it was not only muddled film, it was dry too!<br/><br/>As for the film's funny title, I read that it was the title of a song that has been written after (Kaufman)'s death for the memory of him. But when you have it as a title for that film in specific, then you must ask yourself: (Man on the moon)?! Is he above all?, or is he so alone in such a dark desolate place which had spots of light sometimes? I'm just wondering!"

","Jim Carrey's (Ace Ventura) performance as this quirky insane comedian in this biographical comedy about a stressed comedian trying to make it in the world failed to capture my interest. <br/><br/>Carrey has always been my favourite comedian with his physical enthusiastic style of humour and although he shines in this film once again, I failed to be inspired by the plot. <br/><br/>The beginning was sensational. A black and white shot of Carrey standing addressing the audience with the credits running infront of him, this is simply a must watch! The humour behind Carrey's impressions are cannot be missed it is that captivating and humorous.<br/><br/>However from the beginning the film did somewhat drag with many lapses of concentration from the central idea. Too many characters are introduced and focused upon rather than the idea and struggle behind Kauffman's life. I understand that this film is based on a true story but unfortunately the plot behind this film is far from stimulating. <br/><br/>Carrey's performance makes the film enjoyable however. There are many great scenes with him in, for example the beginning and the ending provides an interesting twist to the film. <br/><br/>I found myself drifting off at points if I'm being honest. A somewhat humorous comedy with magnificence from Carrey once again. Not his best performance in the average comedy drama. <br/><br/>Watch it ifyou are a fan of Jim Carrey"
"paul2001sw-1","8","1","2","20 January 2007"," Carrey's best performance
","All ""serious"" comics tend to turn away from pure humour towards an investigation of what it means to be funny: perhaps, that's why they're considered serious comics, because they're just not funny themselves any more. But Andy Kaufman, throughout his career, pushed the definition of comedy to its limit. But we he any good, and does the fact of his early death justify a biopic? Or, to put it another way, can someone who did not grow up with, or does not appreciate, Kaufman's own peculiar form of humour, enjoy Milos Forman's film, 'Man in the Moon'? Fortunately, the answer is yes, because of Kaufman's own bizarre character, brought brilliantly to life by Jim Carrey (not an actor I usually particularly enjoy). It is said that Kaufman never came out of character, but in the film's most telling line, a girlfriend comments ""there is no real you"", and the film certainly does not subscribe to the view that there was a normal human being behind the masks. Kaufman, as portrayed in this film, remains an enigma, maybe he even was an enigma to himself, but this adds a quality to the story of his journey through life that sets it apart from ordinary tales. When you finish watching this film, you don't necessarily like the act (if ""act"" is the right word); but in spite of yourself, you do like the man."
"Howlin Wolf","8","1","2","18 January 2007"," Wearing down your resistance.
","Having viewed this movie for the second time today I now find it absurdly funny that when I watched it for the first time at least four years ago, I didn't get it. My first attempt at having a look stalled about 20 minutes in because I didn't know enough about the subject and sat down assuming that Kauffman was just another comedian. To me it was Jim Carrey doing a very convincing impersonation of some stranger with a funny haircut and a silly voice. I was befuddled. It seemed almost as if the film were daring me to switch off, being deliberately unconventional at the beginning to weed out those who would only miss the point. I caved in to its creeping demand, not being prepared to think at that time.<br/><br/>Later I learnt that it wasn't just me. Andy Kauffman himself alienated a lot of people during his lifetime with the routines he performed, and so I resolved to watch it at least a second time now that I was armed with some idea of what to expect. On my second try I saw the whole thing, and what's more, I appreciated its aim, too.<br/><br/>The most revelatory thing about Andy's approach is that it taught people something important if they were willing to observe. It taught them just how far imagination can take a person. If you have an imagination you can set your own rules, because then you'll be living up to your own standards and nobody else's. If you don't have an audience, pretend, like it's hinted Andy did as a kid - and then at any rate you won't be crestfallen if the real thing shows up only to leave. Executives may find it infuriating that you first and foremost choose to amuse yourself, but being so fearless will surely pull in a few admirers along the way, as a bonus.<br/><br/>""What if they don't get it?!"" ""Then I'll just keep trying until they do."" I know now that I'm living proof of this philosophy working. It took giving it a go twice, but I got there in the end! Carrey's performance is good enough to make the effort on everyones part worthwhile, no matter how long before things start to click. It'll happen sooner or later. Your resistance will wear down. Andy would've been proud, because if there's a compromise, it'll be in you and not the film."
"one-louder","10","1","2","5 December 2006"," Jim Carrey is a better Andy Kaufman than Andy Kaufman
","Having seen this film before knowing who Andy Kaufman was, I was truly in awe of the comic genius of Carrey. I am myself A big fan of Carrey and admire the lengths he goes to create a character that is so much more than what was imagined on paper. The endearing depiction of Kaufman that Jim portrayed makes this character my favourite.<br/><br/>I was so excited by the story of Kaufman that I had to explore his eccentric world. I watched all the episodes of Taxi with Andy in, plus the ones he refused to be in. I watched his Saturday Night Live clips and his infamous special. Kaufman brought to comedy that no (at the risk of calling him a comedian) comedian had ever done. Above all however I was fascinated at how well Carrey portrayed Kaufman. Every nuance was replicated to an auteur style degree.<br/><br/>As a whole Foreman creates an endearing and tragic depiction of such a man who was both loved and hated. The film flows with tranquillity and you cant help but fall in love with Carrey and Kaufman. Rumour had it Edward Norton was going to take the role, in my opinion this would have been a travesty. I cant think of another actor who could play Kaufman with as much conviction as Carrey. Perhaps Spacey would have been my second call for the role. This film ranks high in both my favourite Carrey film and my favourite film. I will continue to watch it religiously."
"benighted2005","10","1","2","29 August 2006"," Brilliant Humor
","The first half an hour of this film shocked me cause I was in tears laughing because of how untamed the humor content is. I couldn't believe this kind of humor was unleashed at an unsuspecting audience watching this film. Jim Carrey is the most underrated actor in the world and No, I didn't like Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind because it is the opposite of what Man On The Moon is all for.<br/><br/>You see, Eternal Sunshine just might be the most conscious semi dark heartful effort ever. All in all, it's consciousness is what makes it ""everything that is wrong with our world"". Man On The Moon is not for one second taking itself too seriously. I've always been a fan of Carrey but it is Man On The Moon that made me realise that there is no higher level of acting than this. THIS IS EASILY HIS BEST PERFORMANCE.<br/><br/>Man On The Moon has the most extraordinary of beginnings and the story relation is different yet captivating and it doesn't make you wanna be anywhere else for one second. Based on the life of Andy Kaufman, this film manages to recreate the life of an extraordinary man. Many people felt Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman. The level and kind of humor this film contains is not meant to be understood by an average movie go'er. Between the 41st minute and 91st minute the film goes into an enjoyable dull period where most actions by Andy have no explanation.<br/><br/>I hate Bongo drums but I cannot believe anyone can possibly sound better on them than Andy in the film. The reason the casting of this film is perfect is because Jim Carrey has one big heart for a comedian. Andy's funeral was the most touching scene in the film and almost a tearjerker.<br/><br/>I'm trying really hard to explain what it was about this film that touched my heart but I cannot quite get there because my comprehension fails me. Watch this film to know what I'm experiencing."
"moonspinner55","5","1","2","26 July 2006"," Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman...not the event-movie people were hoping for
","Jim Carrey (as Andy Kaufman) opens this film insisting that there is no movie and tells the audience to leave. The credits roll and Carrey continues, ""It was all a joke, there is no movie, go home!"" This gag, perfectly in keeping with Kaufman's sense of absurdist (and straight-faced) humor, is more interesting than anything else director Milos Forman comes up with. Forman stages Kaufman's life as if it were a manic episode treated matter-of-factly; perhaps he was just the wrong filmmaker to translate this story. Carrey is just about perfect as Kaufman, who was terribly unafraid to be unlikable and yet left audiences wondering whether he really needed the applause and acceptance or not. The movie is a little plastic, a little smug, and finally--by the end--not very satisfying. The recreations of Andy's TV events aren't well captured, and the wrestling stuff gets dull fast. Courtney Love has a nice (if benign) role as a young woman who loves him, but she's not used much. Carrey certainly gives it a valiant try, but you don't learn anything new about Kaufman via the film--which may have been deliberate. ** from ****"

","Milos Forman has made a lot of great films such as Hair, and some more than decent ones such as One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, and this Man on the Moon is probably his best. It beats One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest in pure entertainment value, one of the only things that prevented One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest from being a great film. And it beats out Hair with the fact that it has a story and is not just a bunch of songs that will stick in your head and try to make you forget its aberrant lack. Man on the Moons is chop full of energy, it zooms along like a very entertaining bullet, it is truly vibrant as is Jim Carreys, well not performance more embodiment of Andy Kaufman, he proves that the academy is truly dumb for not even nominating him once he has deserved it four times for Eternal Sunchine of the Spotless Mind, The Majestic, The Truman Show, and most of all for his best performance in Man on the Moon. Paul Giamati also deserved a nomination as did the script and the director and the entire film. Man on the Moon is a vibrant and hilarious film homage to the great Andy Kaufman."

"slokes","4","1","2","3 February 2005"," Wrestling With Andy
","There's a scene in this biopic about the life and career of comedian Andy Kaufman when Kaufman and his creative partner Bob Zmuda tell their agent, George Shapiro, about a prank they played years ago, hiring actors to run around a zoo yelling that a lion had gotten loose, and watching everyone run.<br/><br/>I can see the headline now: ""12 Killed In Zoo Stampede Panic; Comedy Frontiers Extended.""<br/><br/>Andy Kaufman was a very brilliant comedian. He wasn't always funny, and sometimes was just weird for the sake of it, but he had an amazing talent that created something remarkable in show business, a way of reaching the audience for something more than laughter or sympathy. He wanted complete engagement, a shared sense of purpose, even hatred or childlike awe. Laughs were fine, too, but he really just wanted to break down the wall between entertainer and audience, and give people something to take home and think about.<br/><br/>A lot of people took Andy home and thought about him. That's what was so great about him. You really don't need ""Man On The Moon"" for that. Yes, Jim Carrey captures him in all his guises, such as Latka the star of the TV sitcom ""Taxi"" and Tony Clifton the bitter lounge singer. You have to marvel at Carrey's talent. Even the way he uses his eyes is spot-on Andy. But everything worthwhile Carrey does in this movie you can see Kaufman himself do in documentaries and video clips.<br/><br/>The main problem with ""Man On The Moon"" is the story around Carrey, which is a very pedestrian retelling of the various outrageous public moments in Kaufman's career. Carrey as Kaufman introduces the film in a funny bit, telling us they played around with the facts for dramatic purposes and that he doesn't approve. But there's nothing organic or involving in the rejiggered storyline, just a lot of set pieces people already know from seeing the two Kaufman documentaries that did the rounds at Comedy Central back in the day.<br/><br/>There's a ""Taxi"" montage where we see many of the real cast members playing alongside Carrey, but it doesn't say anything about what Kaufman did on the show to connect with a mass audience for the only time in his career. The assumption going in is everyone watching this film knows we are watching a master at work. Throughout the film, there's a sense of homage being paid which grates.<br/><br/>""You're insane, but you might also be brilliant,"" his aspiring manager George Shapiro tells him in one of many groaner lines.<br/><br/>Danny DeVito plays Shapiro. DeVito worked with the real Kaufman, and I guess that's a plus, but I don't get why a guy so well-known for playing ""Taxi's"" Louis DePalma is filmed hovering around the ""Taxi"" set playing someone else. It's distracting.<br/><br/>Nobody else clicks in the supporting cast, either. Paul Giamatti feels awkward and forced as Kaufman's writer and friend Bob Zmuda. He's too smug, and not enough of a doorway into what makes Andy tick. Courtney Love is awful in the role of Kaufman's squeeze, never really giving us any sense of why she's there and loves him after all the misery he puts her through around the wrestling ring. Does she know if Andy is playing with her? Does she care? She did a good job in director Milos Forman's previous film ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt,"" and you get the sense he either enjoyed working with her or fancied she was a critics' darling.<br/><br/>The film does work more near the end, especially with a giddy Carnegie Hall performance starring Kaufman where the Rockettes, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and Santa Claus close the show and Andy takes the audience out for milk and cookies. That's a good moment; it would be a great moment in a better film."

","Some things about this movie are pretty good, but for the most part it is incredibly blah. Jim Carrey does a pretty good Andy Kauffman impersonation, but if I wanted to watch Andy's standup, I would watch the 2 specials that are on Comedy Central all the time, which are hilarious. The material from these 2 specials make up more than half of this movie, but with Jim Carrey instead of Andy. Many of the things that were wrong with Ali are wrong with this movie as well. Much like anyone interested in Ali is probably familiar with Ali's boxing, everyone who would be interested in this movie are at least a little familiar with his standup, so why make it the focus of the movie. It would have been far better if the focus would have been on Andy's personal life and his struggle with cancer. The end of the film does focus on this, but waiting through the first hour and 15 minutes is a waste of time."

Having said that, this movie really captures the essence of who Andy Kauffman thought he was.  Jim Carrey, of whom I am not a fan, turns in a remarkable performance, and everyone else in the cast is first-rate. It should come as no surprise to anyone that Milos Forman has given us yet another deeply emotional cinematic experience.  Oh, that it should be every bio-pic is this moving and interesting.

I bought this DVD because I had heard that it was a great performance by Jim Carrey, portraying one of his idols, and I figured I would learn a bit about Kaufman. The thing is, it was a great performance by Carrey and I did learn a lot about Kaufman. I learned that he was remarkably unfunny and a pain in the ass. I learned that the only thing he did that I enjoyed was 'Taxi' and that Kaufman hated being on the show, and most of the other regulars could not stand him. In short, this is a well made, well acted movie about an extremely unlikable person who seemed to enjoy irritating everyone around him. His only redeeming talent was portraying a character on a show that he did not enjoy. Watching the movie was not an enjoyable experience, and I would not recommend it to anyone, unless you are a big Kaufman fan. It is difficult to express my feelings upon reaching the end of the movie. I did not care a bit for Kaufman, but Carrey did an excellent job of portraying him.

Could he, like Kaufman, be yet another extremely talented comedian-entertainer who is often maligned and ignored by the 'Hollywood set' because of his excessively eccentric behavior.

He gives an impressive performance through out the film although at times he looks as if he is trying to hard. Part of the problem is that he chose to play a man who really was not that funny to begin with so it was hard to empathize with some of the more 'heartbreaking' scenes of the film. The public never really understood what Kaufman was trying to do and I think this movie simply states that. Carrey does give a good performance though."

It's difficult to watch a film when you hate the main character. Carrey is a fantastic actor and certainly capable of going deeper into the character of a complicated man.

","First of all, I was a big fan of Andy Kaufman's, I enjoy Jim Carrey and I've seen 4 or 5 Milos Forman films that I would call ""great.""  That being said, I do not understand the motivation for making this movie.<br/><br/>Most of the scenes were just staged re-enactments of televised moments from Kaufman's career.  On that level, you're much better off watching one of the oft-repeated documentaries on Comedy Central or parts of the retrospective shown at the Museum of TV & Radio last year.  As far as the ""uncanny"" portrayal from Jim Carrey, I don't remember Kaufman as that blissed out.<br/><br/>As for his off-camera life (what there was of it, which I suppose is almost the point of this movie/exercise) some of those scenes were dreadful.  Like when Jerry Lawler & he are in Shapiro's office and Lawler says something like ""We really showed them, didn't we Andy?""  I don't remember the exact line but things like that were so clunky you could hear them coming out of the typewriter as the writer pats himself on the back.<br/><br/>There's kind of a built-in system from fans of Kaufman and/or this movie that if you didn't care for him/the movie, then you ""don't get it.""  I was right there with Kaufman most of the time.  But there were other times when he really was neither funny nor interesting (like that one-time TV special of his - oy!).  Like every performer, he had his ups and downs.  Yet those in his camp seem a little too eager to think of him as a ""genius"" and thus won't say the emperor has no clothes and admit that everything Kaufman touched wasn't made out of gold.<br/><br/>As for this movie, OK ... he's an enigma.  We get it.  That does make this script worthy of an audience for two hours.<br/><br/>This thing was so stiff it made me rethink the whole creative principals involved and admit to myself that The People Vs.

","After a brilliant opening sequence, the film lapses into TV movie-of-the-week mode, offering a paint-by-numbers script that does little to delve into what made Kaufman tick (his motivations for some of his more outlandish behavior go completely unexplained). It also didn't do a very thorough job of explaining his celebrity--his standup routines seem lame and stilted, leaving many people in at least my screening audience to wonder what ever made him popular in the first place. His club audiences in the movie, however, roar with atrociously exaggerated delight over every little facial nuance of his. It just doesn't work.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the movie lacked any real visual flair, which was a real surprise coming from a talent like Forman. While Carrey did an admirable job of capturing Kaufman's mannerisms, trust me when I say you've seen this schmaltz before on NBC and CBS. Pointless flashbacks. Rote relationship conflicts. ""I'm an underappreciated genius."" Ugh. The final frames of the film leave the audience wondering what this guy EVER did to warrant being labeled a ""comedian,"" outside of a somewhat memorable (though minor) character on ""Taxi""."

","As I recall the appeal of Andy Kaufman was that he did a hip, sophisticated act, somewhere between state-of-the-art standup and museum-quality performance art. In this film he's portrayed as an obnoxious, antisocial jerk whose humor mostly consisted of alternately insulting and boring people. Which I suppose is credible as the ""Kaufman for Dummies"" version, but hardly the whole story. Anyway, the very stale, predictable Hollywood biopic style of the film is so far beneath the intelligence of its subject that it's practically nonsensical.

","I heard of and seen the poster for this biographical comedy drama from director Milos Forman (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus), I was looking forward to seeing it. Basically Andy Kaufman (Golden Globe winning Jim Carrey) was the eccentric comedian who grew to fame for performing Elvis impressions, then as Latka Gravas on stage, and then on the popular sitcom ""Taxi"". But as his popularity grew, so did his desire to perform even more unconventional, bizarre and practically hated routines, stunts and performances, which concerns his manager George Shapiro (Danny DeVito, who knew the real Kaufman in ""Taxi"", also producing the film). His various inside jokes, put-ons and happenings are seen not only on stage, but on ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Late Night with David Letterman"" and ""Fridays"". His long-running ""feud"" includes his self-declared Intergender Wrestling Champion of the world fights, plus wrestling with Jerry ""The King"" Lawler, and his portrayal of bawdy singer Tony Clifton. George, his creative partner Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti) and girlfriend Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love) are first unconvinced when he announces he has cancer, but of course he is telling the truth, and after his death, there are still questions as to whether he was a comedy genius or not. Also starring Vincent Schiavelli as ABC Executive Maynard Smith, Gerry Becker as Stanley Kaufman - Andy's Father, Peter Bonerz as Taxi Producer Ed. Weinberger, Greyson Erik Pendry as Little Michael Kaufman, Brittany Colonna as Baby Carol Kaufman, Leslie Lyles as Janice Kaufman - Andy's Mother, Bobby Boriello as Little Andy Kaufman and the real George Shapiro as Mr. Besserman. I can agree that the director makes you unsure of what to think of Kaufman, but of course this is the point, in real life, you never knew when the act stopped. Carrey gives a very convincing performance, DeVito, Giamatti and Love give good support, and with music and songs by R.E.M., including ""Man on the Moon"" (made in 1993, but it is about Kaufman) and ""The Great Beyond"" (written for the film), this is a very interesting film. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Very good!"

","""They say, 'Oh wow, Andy Kaufman, he's a really funny guy.' But I'm not trying to be funny. I just want to play with their heads.""<br/><br/><ul><li>Andy Kaufman</li></ul><br/><br/>Was Andy Kaufman a brilliant comedian far ahead of his time, or a disgraceful, unfunny, mentally unbalanced individual who had a sick desire to confuse people? This is the topic at the center of Milos Forman's screen biopic, but the movie never really reveals anything remotely interesting - or enlightening - about Kaufman. He's more of an implacable human being after the movie ends than he was before.<br/><br/>To be fair, Carrey does a commendable job of portraying Kaufman, the man who was present for the launch of ""SNL"" on October 11th, 1975, and was later voted off of the show by callers, after producer Lorne Michaels asked his audience to decide for themselves. What's most bizarre about Kaufman, however, is that he admittedly never actually revealed himself to anyone. He was never in touch with himself, and relied on multiple personalities for amusement. Back then, he was regarded as a different sort of comedic talent, but to be blunt and honest, as much as I love the television show ""Taxi,"" I think Kaufman really did have mental problems. As a child he used to stare at his wall, pretend there were cameras and put on shows.<br/><br/>This is where the film opens. Then it skips ahead. If there's one movie that needs more flashbacks of childhood, it is ""Man on the Moon,"" a film that should have revealed Kaufman's past, rather then present us with a fairly mediocre timeline of events that we're already aware of. What has never been explained is Kaufman's past. Which leads to a startling conclusion, and one that the filmmakers may have stumbled upon (and which may explain the reason some twenty years are cut out of the movie): Kaufman has no past.<br/><br/>He's a man who left behind a legacy of mysteries and loose ends that were never settled. Did Kaufman stage his death?<br/><br/>To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if he did. It sounds far-fetched, but everything Kaufman did was a hoax, from the David Letterman sequence to the ""Fridays"" disaster to showing up on the set of ""Taxi"" dressed as Tony Clifton.<br/><br/>Lots of people mimic his style, but after a while they usually let up and break character. Andy never broke character. When he was in character, he was in character, and that leads to another interesting possibility that has been oft discussed by his fans: Was Andy Kaufman actually a valid persona? Where did this man come from? One day he was a nobody, then he was famous, then soon infamous for his awkward behavior on and off the screen. (During filming of ""Taxi,"" his manager found him in the kitchen of a restaurant, cooking fries for people and telling them he was not Andy Kaufman, despite the similarities he was always noted for.) Andy unarguably received pleasure from confusing his audience. He fit into personalities and never let go. Is it too unreasonable to suggest that Andy Kaufman was another persona he created one day? And one he eventually grew tired of and abandoned like he had with so many others? If so, then why would he do this to his family? Why would he not resurface after his adopted daughter traced her origins to Kaufman?<br/><br/>We don't know much about Kaufman's parents, and he introduced them only once on David Letterman's shows. To be fair, they could have been paid to pose as parents, and this is exactly the type of bizarre stunt that Kaufman would be capable of pulling. Also, as a child, he reportedly liked to run away and hide and scare his parents into thinking he had gone missing.<br/><br/>""Man on the Moon"" tackles none of these subjects. It's a straightforward timeline of Kaufman's life, sloppily constructed and quite poorly directed on the whole. This could have been a controversial, epic biopic, and it also could have been a lot funnier and insightful. Even if Forman and Carrey decided not to delve into any ""conspiracy theories"" regarding Kaufman and his origins and his ""death,"" it still would have been nice to explore his background more.<br/><br/>Was Kaufman an utter nut case or an under appreciated comic genius? We'll probably never truly know. And that's the primary fault of ""Man on the Moon."" By the end of the movie, Kaufman is completely unexplained. We're not able to truly sympathize with him, because the movie portrays him a freak of nature. Kaufman told the press once that he never cracked a single joke. It's true. So was he funny or just a sick, demented human being who liked pulling tricks on people, and possibly pulled a final one before disappearing into the middle of nowhere, leaving behind little traces? ""Man on the Moon"" doesn't know, and it doesn't try to offer any clearer resolutions. It's about as muddled and confusing as Kaufman was. And like Kaufman, it doesn't tell us a single joke, which is really a shame.<br/><br/>2.5/5."

","Comedy amounts to this. You either laugh or you don't. It is completely subjective.<br/><br/>Those who laughed at or with Andy Kaufman may like this Movie because it is basically Andy's material mimicked by Jim Carrey's ""in the skin"" performance. There is really not much else. Maybe an attempt to make the ""Comedian"" seem Human and we should empathize, forgive, and try to understand. <br/><br/>It is a hit and miss Movie with some real Actors playing themselves that lend a you are there feel, but who among you really wants to be there. It is not a pleasant place or a fun time. According to the Movie, Kauffman spent most of His energy behind the scenes trying to convince everyone that everything is a joke.<br/><br/>He comes across as probably the most misunderstood Performer in the History of Show Business. He did receive his ""15 Minutes"" and an amount of Fortune. Deservedly or not, the troubled Man squandered it (or did He?). <br/><br/>The Movie is as painful to watch, at times, as an Andy Kaufman skit. But there is quite an amount of Pathos toward the end that may soften it a bit for Mainstream Viewers. Overall it is a well crafted Movie that isn't very enlightening or entertaining or funny. Kind of like one of His Gigs."

","The film relies heavily on the acting performance of Jim.

This film is entertaining even though it had the flaws of character analysis. You'll definitely not regret watching this.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>The acting of Jim Carey is flawless and extremely satisfying. He did his best in making an entertaining film. What I got about the ideas of the character- ""Andy Kauffman"" is that he wanted to do something unorthodox and was rejected a lot of times. This line is attractive and makes us watch how it was handles in a film. Other cast performed fine. The story is good. I am glad that they made a film on this character.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>Just one little and important thing which is missing in the film is its ability to make the audience understand the ideas of a major comedian.

"KnightsofNi11","8","0","1","21 July 2012"," Strange and awesome
","My first taste of avant-garde comedian Andy Kaufman was, while watching old episodes of Saturday Night Live, his Mighty Mouse bit he did for that show. I knew nothing about him at the time, and I still didn't know much about him until seeing this brilliant biopic about his life and career. Jim Carrey plays Kaufman in this Milos Forman directed flick that examines the controversial and confusing career that Kaufman had. It's full of lies, deceit, and publicity stunts that established his career as something of a great big farce. Andy Kaufman was a brilliant mind that very few could understand completely. What he did, he did for himself. He had huge aspirations to be incredibly famous, he just didn't know what to do in order to get there.<br/><br/>It's clear that the world of comedy has never seen anything quite like Andy Kaufman. It's hard to adequately explain just what his career was all about. It includes sitcoms, jazz singing, wrestling, and everything else you wouldn't expect it to have. But there was a bizarre brilliance to it all that translates throughout this film wonderfully. Watching the dramatized development of this strange career is as entertaining as it is fascinating. We never get an idea of why Kaufman does all that he does and no explanation is given as to why he is how he is. This somewhat breaks the ideals of what a biopic should be but, then again, nobody fully understood what Andy Kaufman was all about, so does a film really have the right to make that up? The biggest complaint I've seen about this film is that it focuses more on the career of Andy Kaufman rather than his personal life. There is undoubtedly some truth to this, but it's not something that bothered me. His career is what is interesting, and his career was so involved and it completely consumed his life so, in a way, his personal life was his career.<br/><br/>Man on the Moon is simply just a great film. It's not a perfect biopic, but a damn good one and it tells an incredibly interesting story about an incredibly interesting man. Jim Carrey absolutely owns his role as Kaufman and gives it his all in portraying the late genius. The film is more entertaining than it is heartfelt and it's more comedic than it is dramatic, but it possesses all of these elements in some degree. It's a bizarrely fun film to watch, uncomfortable at times but always pleasing, much in the same vein as the career of the strangely brilliant Andy Kaufman."

","The previous reviewer finds it incredible, not the movie but the man's life. The movie he doesn't have too much to say about apart from the fact that Jim Carey was good in the title role. But Kaufman's life, he just can't believe what he is seeing. How could he possibly get a part on SNL it is unbelievable, how could he get a part in Taxi, it's incredible. The reviewer is so astounded he seems to imply that these things could not have happened. They did happen, he was on SNL, he was in Taxi, he was one of the most popular comedians of the day and he was a genuine eccentric. The movie portrayed the man's life {more or less}and it was a popular and well regarded movie (just ask Michael Stipe)."
"Antony-4","8","0","1","17 March 2011"," A spectacular piece of art
","Jim Carrey manages to pull off a tremendously difficult role with this film. How to honestly portray someone who was not a very good person. Sure, it's less difficult to a Nazi psychopath or some other sicko, but how do you let the audience in on the fact that the person they thought they knew wasn't who they thought.<br/><br/>So it takes another misunderstood genius to adequately describe him. Andy Kaufman was an artist, but a jerk, a lot of people knew this, but not the vast majority of his fans. Now we know. His goal in life was to annoy people and he was very talented at it. He could also sometimes do comedy, but mostly he spent his time trying to figure out how to annoy the most people he could. He went after pro wrestling fans because he perceived them as being easily deceived and annoyed. He couldn't stand his day job, so he tried to destroy it.<br/><br/>It must have been insanely difficult to portray Andy. To be able to bring a mass audience into his mind, to not sugar coat anything and to make the audience understand someone in a completely new light is film making art at its highest level.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean that this was a particularly enjoyable film to watch. Much like a lot of expressive art, it's not supposed to just be a pretty thing to enjoy. Anyone could represent an uncomplicated concept well enough for thoughtful people to understand. Representing a complex subject well enough for average people to understand takes great skill.<br/><br/>There were a few minor annoyances about the film and I can't say that there was much to laugh about, but Jim's acting makes this a solid 8/10 in my opinion."

","MiloÂš Forman is a legendary filmmaker, he's made the best of films during his heyday. I've always been a fan of his, always loved his work. 'Man Of The Moon' however, ranks amongst his okay efforts. A biographical film about the late American entertainer Andy Kaufman, comes a biopic, that doesn't really entertain.<br/><br/>Kaufman was an amazing entertainer, who got in Tony Clifton & Latka Gravas, both of which are legendary today. 'Man On The Moon' brings the biopic to life, but, it could've been better. The film beings with a bang, but slides as soon Kaufman becomes a flop star. Some biopics are worth-watching again and again and again, but 'Man On The Moon', despite being an honest effort, isn't one of those gems.<br/><br/>Carrey is the highlight of the film, playing Kaufman from top to bottom. He's fantastic in every dialog he delivers, A Golden Globe isn't all, he at least deserved to earn a Nomination at the Academy Awards. Courtney Love is excellent. She's always been an actress to watch! DeVito is his usual self, which is passable. Paul Giamatti is good, while Jerry Lawler hams.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Man On The Moon' isn't the best biopic in any angle, but it surely deserves a watch for Carrey's fantastic performance."

"Brogan","Null","0","1","1 December 1999"," A somber tale about a underrated entertainer.
","I'm right now sitting at my computer with a mini t.v. right next to me.  There's a rerun episode of TAXI on right now, and it's featuring Andy Kaufman performing the character of Laka Graves.  Just after watching MAN ON THE MOON, and comparing it to the real Andy Kaufman, there are little differences and more similarities.  The film really shows on what was going on with the mind of a man that many people loved, and just as many people hated.  Andy Kaufman (for those who don't know), was a famous entertainer who usually shocked people with his unpredictable actions.  From wrestling women in the ring, to performing the rude Tony Clifton on stage, Kaufman always played his audience, and no one, not even Kaufman's closest friends and family members knew what to expect.  Kaufman is probably best known for his role of Laka Fraves on the sitcom TAXI.  But Kaufman wouldn't like that, Kaufman would like to be known as a entertainer, and this shows that.  I would say that Jim Carrey plays Andy Kaufman, but I won't.  I was very impressed and pleased with Carrey in this film that I'll say Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman.  I've watched Andy Kaufman since I was four years old, and not only myself, but my entire family has always enjoyed his work.  I just consider it for the extremely intelligent.  Kaufman is shown his real thoughts and feelings as he stages some of his most controversial moves in his career.  Some of those bits include his dead-on imitation of Elvis, and his fight on the t.v. show FRIDAYS. I could also say that this is Jim Carrey's movie, but it isn't.  Milos Forman has always felt sympathetic towards individuals who cuased trouble in society.  From Randal MacMurphy in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, to Wolfgang Mozart in AMADUES, to Larry Flynt in PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT. In MAN ON THE MOON, Forman shows at first how much of a rude and cruel guy Kaufman can appear to be at first, then you realize, it's all a act. Kaufman just likes to really fool people, to where they don't know that if it's a act or not.  And Forman is the perfect director to make a movie about a troublemaker in society.  The supporting acting in this film is also great. Danny DeVito is good as Kaufman's agent, George Shaprio, and so is Paul Giamatti as Kaufman's clase friend Bob Zmuda.  It's also a treat to see some of the original cast members of the show TAXI, yet they have aged quite a bit.  But what's great is seeing character actor, Vincent Schiavelli who plays a ABC executive in this film.  Schiavelli originally appeared on the show TAXI, as playing the priest who married Kaufman's character to Carol Kane's character.  It's also great to see the real Bob Zmuda, and Lorne Michaels make appearances in the film as well.  It goes to show that if all of these people are appearing in a film about a man who appears to be rude, but really isn't.  From the beginning of the film, the viewer sees a young Andy performing to a wall, then to his younger sister. And that is all Andy ever wanted is a audience.  And hopefully with this film, even 15 years after his death, his audience would have grown. This is a excellent, very funny, and very sad tale that people shouldn't miss.  It might help explain the attitude of the eccentric person that you know.  ***** (out of five)"

I admit to my lack of Andy Kaufman knowledge, although I have seen many of his SNL skits and plenty of TAXI episodes, I learned a great deal of respect for his genius in entertainment and also became aware more of his personal history and personality.<br/><br/>Not only is this movie informative, but amazingly entertaining. Nowadays, a combination that can seem almost non-existent. Milos Forman has proven himself again in my book, as I loved One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest, and more recently, The People vs. Larry Flynt. I'm convinced that, although he hasn't worked on many films, he chooses them wisely.<br/><br/>So all I can really say is see this one for yourself and then pass the word along to your friends because this is a guaranteed winner.

","I really like Andy Kaufman. I grew up watching him torture the world, and I think more than a little of his brand of humor made its way into psyche and helped me become the person I am today. I saw him on SNL and Fridays (and of course Taxi). I followed the tabloids when he got sick (the web wasn't around yet, so the tabloids were still the least accurate medium of the time) because they were the only ones who seemed to really care. I remember watching a late-night news program one time showing in great detail what the charlatans like the one who treated Andy really did. I followed anything I could on Andy to the point that I even watched wrestling for a while (and believe me, back then, if you didn't live in a trailer park, you didn't admit to watching wrestling.) In high school, his bits were always some of my circles of friends' favorites to recite ad infinitum. But I never felt for a moment that I knew who Andy Kaufman really was, and unfortunately I still don't.<br/><br/>Man on the Moon is a really good movie; there's no denying that. Jim Carrey's performance is dead on. He deserves an Oscar nom here much more so than he did for the overrated Truman Show. But when you put Milos Forman together with writers Alexander & Karaszewski for a film about a comic genius, you expect GREAT. What Man on the Moon does is give almost perfect recreations of Kaufman's most famous bits. What it doesn't do is give any real insight to what made the man this way. If A & K get a writing nom for this one, they should defer it to Andy Kaufman and his longtime writing partner, Bob Zmuda, because those two wrote over half of everything seen in this film. The recreations were fantastic; they couldn't have been better if Kaufman had come back and performed them himself. But when it came time to show what was going on in Andy's head, they were obviously stumped. Maybe the behind the mask stuff didn't test well and was cut out. I don't know. All I know is most episodes of A&E's Biography show more insight in an hour than Man on the Moon did in two. Maybe, like Courtney Love said as Lynne Margulies, Andy's girlfriend, ""There is no REAL (Andy Kaufman)."""

The last paragraph makes a point about the end of the film. While I do not believe that it ruins anything, I'll issue the warning in fairness to all.<br/><br/>The ending was a kicker! To think that he goes to get help for his cancer and it turns out to be fake. Incredible! He spends his life putting on and faking out other people only to be faked  out by a so called miracle healer at the end of his life."

","Outstanding film all around.  Jim Carrey proves himself to be of oscar caliber once again. For a guy that didn't catch Andy Kaufman's antics the first time around, I certainly enjoyed getting to know him, or should I say NOT getting to know him, throughout the entire 2 1/2 hours of the film. There was never a dull moment, as I was always curious as to what Carrey's character was going to do next.  A great tribute to the late, great Andy Kaufman."

","Granted, I went to this movie a little biased having grown up on Kaufman, Taxi, and Saturday morning 'rastlin, so I was expecting to enjoy it. Jim Careys' performance was brilliant, not only in the characters and voices he immitated, but in doing Andy's actual speaking voice also. Carey deserves an Oscar nomination, but the powers that be will probably view this as one stand-up imitating another, and not Oscar worthy. And that is ultimately the type of people the movie pokes fun at. If you can't tell who is the butt of a joke, it's probably you. (that's from me, not the movie)"
"NomadBoy","9","0","1","22 December 1999"," A wild, funny, eccentric, moronic, silly, good-natured look at Andy Kauffman
","Only seeing Andy Kaufman on the old TV show Taxi, I never understood why people loved him so. He was funny, yes, but what was the big thing about him? After I saw this movie, however, I just had to look up more info him, and sure enough, the movie was very true to life! Andy's antics of playing a joke on the audience was very real, and yes he did wrestle woman, and yes he did manage to get a lot of people very upset. He was however a comedian that was way ahead of his time. Or perhaps Andy defies time.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey plays Andy so well, it's scary. Using Danny Devito as his agent was a stroke of genius. Even Courtney Love is good as Andy's sweetheart. There are times that the movie isn't funny. But that's the point. Andy didn't consider himself a comedian. It shows how completely original he was,  how you should never expect the expected with him. Even if you never liked Andy, then see this film for Jim Carrey. And you if you don't like Jim Carrey (shame on you!) Then see it for the way ABC and it's execs get abused."

"Krusty-14","4","0","1","3 June 2000"," Was this a film or a documentary?
","There are a couple of things that distinguishes a film from a documentary. One of the most important is building a unifying theme throughout the movie, telling a story, rather than just reiterating historical events.  This movie was mostly just a replay of the real-life exploits of Andy Kaufman, with very little attention given to the behind-the-scenes action or, more importantly, motivation behind the events.  Carrey does a great impression of Kaufman, but no effort is given in making Kaufman a complete character. <br/><br/>I could have rented a ""best of"" Kaufman tape and gotten the same effect as this film. In fact, the real Kaufman would have been much funnier.  This was like reading a biography written by the subject's biggest fan...a skewed effort attempting to show how great Kaufman was.  Unfortunately, we already knew how much of a comic genius Andy was...he showed us himself.  There is no reason to watch imitators attempt to replay his shining moments.  Andy left his own legacy, and I suggest everyone relive it by watching the master himself."

","Andy Kaufman was a stand up comedian who specialised in antagonising his audiences. Stunts like reading the whole of The Great Gatsby in a mock British accent and having an old woman seemingly die on stage during a performance were standard Kaufman fare.<br/><br/>	Yet another product of Saturday Night Live, where his act lip-synching to the Mighty Mouse theme became legendary, not to mention his terrible impersonations using only his ""foreign man"" voice, Kaufman based his humour on rib kicking assaults on what the audiences demanded of him.<br/><br/>	It's a wonder he got any work at all!<br/><br/>	Apparently, I don't remember seeing Kaufman, he essentially had a blissed out, hippie like demeanor; a sort of a silly boy determined to make you laugh at something that was just not funny, even plain stupid.<br/><br/>	Jim Carrey certainly doesn't portray Andy Kaufman as a dill brained hippy though, although he certainly does impress upon us that Kaufman's motivations were not definable.<br/><br/>	Those who know tell us that Carrey's Kaufman was uncannily like the man, but I get the feeling that Carrey was unable, or unwilling, to give Kaufman innocence.<br/><br/>	But then the feminists who closed down Kaufman's myriad and increasingly lurid wrestling contests with women probably wouldn't attest to his innocence!<br/><br/>	And it seems that Kaufman, who delighted in controversy, would have loved the women howling at him from the side of the wrestling ring, as he would have found it terrific that we still don't know what the hell he was on about.<br/><br/>	Man On The Moon becomes the Jim Carrey Show. It's split time structure and unlikable main character leave its audience antagonised and just wanting to slap Jim Carrey. Kaufman fans would by definition be a strange and unconventional lot.

"marchrijo","4","0","1","22 February 2000"," Now I understand the R.E.M. song - but this gain is not enough...
","This film has one big problem: its subject... Andy Kaufman isn't interesting enough that you feel like spending an evening with him, not even in cinema. It would be good for a semi-documentary (IF - I want to see the real Kaufman, too!), but Forman decided to bring his life onto a big picture - with all the ingrediences you need to reach the masses, especially the pathetic stuff. Infortunately it doesn't work here. The film can't tell me where is the special significance and the importance of Kaufman. He provoked the TV-public with his artistic and humoristic extravaganzas, Forman says, and he is right, but he did it in an era, in which the public was already accustomed to nonsense in TV programs. In fact, Kaufman didn`t hurt existencial taboos of society, but just the feelings of some of its members. There was a documentary about the Sex Pistols on the Berlin Film Festival, where the anachronisms in society (monarchy and british hypocrisy vs. punk phenomenon) is shown much clearer. If you mind the circumstances (wrong subject, wrong type of film), Forman even made the best out of it..."

","Despite a great performance from Jim Carrey, this feels more like a ""greatest hits"" collection of Andy Kaufman performances than any serious attempt to examine him or try to understand him. Some people have said that by not trying to psychoanalyze Kaufman the filmmakers show admirable restraint and point up the fact that we can never truly ""know"" anybody or their motives. Fine, but in that case why make a movie? Without an angle or a point of view to it, a biopic is just dull. Books and/or documentaries remain the best way to chronicle a person's life - and in Kaufman's case, there are several good examples of both (books: ""Lost in the Funhouse"" by Bill Zehme and ""Andy Kaufman Revealed"" by his friend and writing partner Bob Zmuda; documentaries: Comedy Central's Salute to Andy Kaufman and, if you're interested primarily in his wrestling exploits and his bouts with Jerry Lawler ""I Come From Hollywood"" - and there are others as well). With so much information out there about the man, this movie just feels redundant and unneccesary."

"Bronis","7","0","1","17 December 1999"," Funny, warm, and entertaining but the film has one giant flaw.
","""Man on the Moon"" is a funny film only in the fact that what Andy Kaufman did was sadistically funny.  Jim Carrey, who has stated that he ""became"" Andy Kaufman does a great impersonation, at best.  The biggest flaw for me was the question: Why watch one funnyman's impression of another funnyman? Why not just watch Kaufman's original material as performed by the man himself?  With that point aside, director Milos Foreman and his talented cast (including Courtney Love, Danny DeVito, and a great Paul Giamatti) do bring back the Kaufman gags with high energy and maximum laugh appeal.  The film becomes unexpectedly touching in its last moments and Carrey does a tremendous job with his material.  I would reccommend it, but again, why not see Kaufman's genius (or moronic/psychotic tendencies, depending on who you are) performed by the man himself? Grade: B-"
"ThomasLS","9","0","1","16 December 1999"," Questions about Andy that have stuck in my mind for years are not necessarily answered by this film, but they are acknowledged, and that acknowledgement makes me feel better overall.
","I was only 6 years old when Andy Kaufman started working on ""Taxi"" and believe it or not, I remember. Who wouldn't? Latka Gravas was an adorable character, and despite his being a network redefinition of Andy's original Foreign Man (from his stand up routine), I still believe that the tenderness was true facet of Andy's complicated heart.<br/><br/>Those expecting a standard lifeline biopic will perhaps be disappointed. A look at the teenage Andy in high school is not to be found here. No first dates here. We go from a very young Andy singing animal songs with his baby sister, directly to his singing those same animal songs with a drunken and unamused audience in an anonymous comedy club. But the film suffers nothing from this leap in time, because this is a look at the private Andy behind the public Andy we all watched develop on television.<br/><br/>To say the representations of the people in Andy's life are accurately portrayed is an understatement, because the people he knew and worked with are (with notable expections) all here. The cast of Taxi, Lorne Michaels, Jerry Lawler, David Letterman and others all play themselves, and you sense that they are all doing this out of their love for Andy.<br/><br/>My feelings about this film are time-released, like the old Contac commercials used to claim. I saw it yesterday afternoon, and today I find myself pondering points and sorting emotions.<br/><br/>Questions about Andy that have stuck in my mind for years are not necessarily answered by this film, but they are acknowledged, and that acknowledgement makes me feel better overall. It is hard to explain, and especially difficult because I have no desire to reveal any of this films secrets and surprises prematurely.<br/><br/>The film is wonderful. I have been asked by friends if it is sad. Yes, very much so. And it is very funny. There was a gleeful darkness to Andy's art that did not make him an easy person to appreciate, but there is a poignancy to his story that offsets that darkness. And somehow this film has managed to give its audience a look at the center of that balance of light and dark, of sadness and joy."

If you have seen any of the Andy Kaufman specials on comedy central, or have seen Andy Kaufman other than on taxi then you will truly appreciate this brilliant movie.  If not then after you leave the movie you will be wanting to see more of Andy Kaufman.  Devito, Giamatti, and Love all make performances of a lifetime, and you can certainly add this to one of the tops of the brilliant Milos Forman masterpieces.  When a movie makes you leave yourself and feel like your in the film and want to know him, that is a movie that you will never forget.

"billm-4","Null","0","1","15 December 1999"," Excellent performance by Jim, but why make this film?
","As a British citizen who moved to Michigan in 1998, I have never seen Andy Kaufmann on TV. Indeed I had never heard of him before the release of this movie. But I responded to a free ticket offer and saw it for nothing at my local multiplex. <br/><br/>For the first half hour or more I was mighty glad I had paid nothing as Andy's act did not tickle my sense of humour in any way. In particular, Jim Carrey's introductory chatter and the running of the ""end credits"" at the beginning of the movie were merely tiresome and irritating. To judge from the laughter around me, I assumed that he must be a nostalgic cult figure and the audience were reliving their teenage memories of Andy's antics, much as Brits of my generation can quote Monty Python verbatim. After a while I found myself laughing despite the seeming dumbness of much of the material, especially where Jim skates on the very edge of bad taste and political incorrectness - and frequently falls over that edge. <br/><br/>I cannot judge how truthful an impersonation Jim delivers, but his typically dynamic performance seemed to be the product of really concentrated effort. The later sequences in particular, where Andy is diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer, becomes progressively sicker and tries all manner of alternative therapies, are unreservedly touching and a portrayal of quiet courage. It was particularly fascinating to be reminded of the bizarre Philippines hand-on surgery without anaesthetic which I saw in documentaries of the early 1980s.<br/><br/>As with all Milos Forman films, the craftsmanship is impeccable and the soundtrack highly enjoyable. At the end of it, I was still left wondering why Forman found Kaufmann so interesting that he was willing to invest the staggering effort which it takes to create any movie. As in the case of his last movie about Larry Flynt, though for rather different reasons , I could not see why he picked this guy out of the billions who have lived in this century to immortalise on film. Larry was just too loathsome and Andy was somehow not that distinctive. I will be surprised if the movie has much success in markets where people have no memories of seeing the original Andy first time round. I would give it 7 out of 10 for craftsmanship, acting and (against the odds) making me laugh."

","This film is a wonder.  Jim Carrey can't help but look like Jim Carrey with Andy hair, but he moves and talks like Andy.  His moving like Andy really shows his acting genius.  The film is perhaps slim, in that Andy is a cypher.  But its heart lies in watching Andy's life in his art.  That a film can take on this is a testimony to the terrific job the filmmakers did.  Of course, that this is a biopic of Andy Kaufman, a practical joker who is no longer with us, may make this film undramatic in one sense.  However, exploring Andy's nature: compulsive, childlike, with a raging center of desire, reveals that the real mystery of Andy may be in how such a amazing creature could exist.  Seeing his life exploded on the big screen brings a sense of wonder to Andy's life and death.  It's a worthy and exciting film."

I personally loved him for his crazy humor, even though I was not old enough to appreciate his genius in his time.  It was very moving as I felt that I was experiencing it first hand.  Carrey plays Kaufman with a haunting reality.  I see a nomination in the future..hopefully this will make up for the one he should have gotten for Truman Show (even though I am still pretty sure that Kevin Spacey will walk away with it).  There are some fabulous cameos in the movie, which also hint at how much people miss him.  It also lets in on the secrets that people might still not know.

","Jim Carrey delivers a superb performance as Andy Kaufman. Carrey clearly did his homework in preparation for his role as all of Kaufman's mannerisms, speech, facial expressions, and body movements are nailed down perfectly. Here's a role that perhaps only Kaufman himself could of played better. This film, in addition to his work in Truman Show, solidifies Carrey as a legit film actor who can perform brilliantly in dramatic roles.<br/><br/>In fact, drama is the strength and backbone of this film. Although no serious film about Andy Kaufman could of been made without showing the comical genius of the comedian/entertainer, the film's best moments are when it takes you behind the scenes and show Kaufman as a human being and his deep relationships with his friends, not just a silly Kaufman on stage as either a prankster or wrestler or comedian.<br/><br/>Perhaps my only problems with the film were the recreations of televised footage of Kaufman such as when he appeared on Saturday Night Live, David Letterman Show, Taxi, or his wrestling matches. What I would of love see is to transpose Carrey's image over Kaufman's image (ala Forrest Gump style) in those real footages and thus allow the audience to see the actual events as they had taken place."
