"cardsrock","8","9","9","30 March 2020"," A fascinating story
","Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut is a solid, entertaining entry from 2017. His script is full of his trademark rapid-fire dialogue and keeps the film moving at a brisk pace. The voiceover can be a bit exhausting at times, but it adds a lot of context to the film. Chastain and Elba are both terrific and each get their moments to shine. The film is a tad long, but it's never dull. Molly's Game is a very interesting true story that lends itself well to cinema."
"sierralouie","10","82","104","13 May 2018"," Chastain is a knockout
","Molly's Game works as well as it does due to the sheer vitality of Jessica Chastain's performance. As an actor, she isn't the most overt emoter, and she doesn't need to be. She manages to draw an incredible amount of empathy out of her characters, always in control but willing to let the cracks in the armor show. She is one of the most remarkably restrained, yet emotionally potent, actors in Hollywood. She excels at taking these strong, resolute women through hell and back, coming out stronger and more complex while being very aware of the gender dynamics of her characters. Molly Bloom is by necessity steely and crafty, but she is also a human being in a world that oftentimes has no regard for humanity. As Bloom, Chastain is a scorching force of nature with a hell of a wardrobe. It's easy to praise her more dramatic moments later in the film, but watch her every move during her initial rise to power. You want to root for Molly as she begins to learn, as she faces disrespect from her boss, as she gains more and more confidence.<br/><br/>Chastain and Elba give fiery performances that help the film retain some of its shine as it moves toward its conclusion. Shoutout to Camp, d'Arcy James, and Cera for their small but solid roles. The film overall is a bit too long and does inspire some fatigue, but the story is engaging enough and Chastain is an absolute star. There's nothing particularly remarkable about the way the film is constructed, but it manages to keep you reasonably entertained."
"TopDawgCritic","9","100","132","18 January 2018"," Jessica Chastain nails her role
","I don't think Molly Bloom could have been cast any better than with Jessica Chastain... she nailed her role. Oddly enough, she looks similar to the actual Molly Bloom.<br/><br/>Great film, love the fact this is based on a true story, and what a great story it was. The rest of the cast were great and the directing was decent, although too much back and forth between many timelines.<br/><br/>8.5 rounded up to 9/10 from me for Chastain's excellent performance."
"borromeot","7","127","173","14 December 2017"," Clinically sharp
","The focus is clear and yet cold and distant unless Idris Elba is on the frame. He is a human with his complexities but without barriers. He is open, accessible. Jessica Chastain is a technical marvel to be admired but it is hard, very hard to warm up to her. I felt I needed to see in her what Idris Elba saw and I could do it with my head but not my heart. In any case, it is a brilliant performance. Aaron Sorkin writes and directs this time with remarkable self confidence. The film, like the script is clinically sharp, surgical actually. I bet it's also a great read. For Aaron Sorkin's fans and I count myself as one, this is a must."
"PotassiumMan","6","105","149","31 December 2017"," Chock full of Sorkinian glibness, biopic goes south in the end
","Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut about the Olympic skier Molly Bloom, a brilliant over-achiever who chose to forego law school to become a gambling entrepreneur, is a compelling film that starts out very strong. Even with its lengthy running time, it's never slow or uninvolving. It's gripping and fascinating throughout, thanks to Sorkin's master penmanship at keeping the dialogue and tempo of the film at a heady pace.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba both give dynamic performances here. Elba makes a great presence as the defense attorney who tries to grapple with the sheer size and scope of Bloom's considerable legal problems as her gambling operation becomes progressively more mired in the criminal world. Even if you find Chastain's character cold and detached, her performance here is strikingly realistic.<br/><br/>Alas, we have the film's ending. Where the film goes wrong is this highly far-fetched and phony attempt to humanize Bloom beginning with a chance encounter with her father at a skating rink in Central Park. A corny scene does not sink a film all by itself, but unfortunately this scene was followed up with an equally ridiculous courtroom sequence that struck me as unduly and comically political. It's always a shame for a film to look first-rate for most of the way only to collapse in the final act. Recommended mostly on the strength of the performances, even if the film as a whole misses the mark in the end."
"arifin-ade","8","10","11","21 October 2019"," Smart and Moving
","I don't know a thing about Molly before, so I don't know how much the truth is pictured in this movie, but I totally love how Jessica Chastain portrays her character in this movie.<br/><br/>A smart young woman, if not beause of a small branch of pine tree, she could have a whole another life. And even the immoral things around her: Gamble, Drugs, Alcohol and all other bad things.. she could still hold on her integrity and put up her 'goodness' above all.. money or even her freedom.<br/><br/>I love also how the daddy role plays a big part in this movie. That family matters has a big impact in this movie and how Molly could reconcile with his father after all those years (even though I am not really sure that the scene was a non fiction). Love how Kevin Costner portrays the dad also.<br/><br/>Idris Elba plays very well also.. love the chemistry between Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba.<br/><br/>If you like family drama with a lil bit suspense, fun but also serious (coz I'm sure the reality should be much more scary than it seems in the movie), this movie surely should be the movie you watch."
"gortx","Null","63","91","7 January 2018"," Less a dramatic movie than an illustrated Podcast
","If you ever wanted to know what a video illustrated Podcast would be like -- then MOLLY'S GAME is the movie for you. Jessica Chastain stars and narrates as Molly Bloom, a former Olympic skier who found herself as a Poker madam who ran ultra-high stakes underground gambling games in L.A. and New York. The high priced events attracted Hollywood celebrities, wealthy financiers, baseball players and the mob. Chastain/Bloom narrates and narrates and narrates. When not narrating, we are given picayune details on gambling, the law, what exact drinks are being served and the ins and out of skiing. Chastain is a wonderful actress, but, she doesn't possess the most proficient narration voice. But, of course, the real 'voice' here is not the actresses, but writer (and first time) director Aaron Sorkin's. It's all very much delivered in his trademark fast rhythms and idiosyncrasies. Sorkin should have just cut out the middle-man and done the narration himself. 
 
 Sorkin is obviously a gifted writer, but, Sorkingthe DIRECTOR fails him here. In the past, fine filmmakers like David Fincher, Danny Boyle and Mike Nichols knew that as good as the writing is, you also have to show the audience what is happened. Instead, we are told what has happened, what is happened and what will happen. We are told what the characters are not only thinking, but what they are about to do. The effect is suffocating. The viewer is given little to chance to take a breath, let alone enjoy the drama. <br/><br/> What makes the Direction so unfortunate, is that the true story of Molly Bloom is inherently interesting. Along with Chastain (who delivers a solid performance despite it all), there are fine actors like Idris Elba, Kevin Costner, Michael Cera, Graham Greene and many others in the cast. But, Sorkin's over-reliance on narration squelches the drama. Oddly, about 3/4 of the way through the 140 minute movie, the narration subsides substantially. Almost two hours in - and we suddenly shift into what resembles a normal motion picture. Those final scenes may not be great, but, at least one can appreciate what the actors are doing without being told in advance every nuance. 
 
 Finally, there's Sorkin's well known disdain for keeping to the facts of the true story. The central metaphor for the movie how Bloom had a tragic accident that ended her career sending her life into disorder. But, the real Molly Bloom never had a Wide World of Sports style ""agony of defeat"" fall. Sorkin pulled it out his ass. Nobody is dumb enough to believe that a Hollywood movie with big stars is going to tell the full unvarnished truth, but Sorkin is a serial abuser. Instead of the usual movie disclaimer: ""Although based on a true story, some events and characters have been changed for dramatic purposes"" - Sorkin's disclaimer should read: ""This is fiction, but, but some true events have been included to sell this to the public"". Also, Bloom did not have a tough but powerful black Attorney by her side with a cute precocious child (which just so happens to closely mirror the young Molly Bloom who - you guessed it! - was also a cute precocious child). <br/><br/> Much of this wouldn't matter so much if MOLLY'S GAME worked better as a movie. Unfortunately, it's all tell without much show."
"bhodso","10","79","117","28 January 2018"," One of my favorites of 2017
","I was absolutely mesmerized by this tale of Molly, a woman who was obsessed at being the best at anything she did whether that was Olympic skiing or controlling the seedy underworld of high stakes Poker.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain is incredible as Molly Chastain. She makes the character feel real, holds the camera's attention, and helps us to understand the underlying motivations behind Molly's actions.<br/><br/>I particularly liked the chemistry between Idris Elba (who plays Molly's lawyer Jaffey). Their scenes are some of the most electric in the way they play off each other's emotions and spar with the great dialogue barbs Aaron Sorkin wrote so wonderfully.<br/><br/>Speaking of Aaron Sorkin, for a first time director, he absolutely knocks this out of the park. He conferred with his friend & director David Fincher on strategies for shooting this film along the way and he go great advice because the innovative camera angles, control of time (a key sign that a director knows what they are doing), and assured pacing make this one of the most enrapturing and compelling dramas of 2017."
"ianenderby","5","55","83","7 May 2018"," Look at all my words
","Let me start by saying that I absolutely LOVE Aaron Sorkin. I really enjoy the movies he's written and his television shows are among my all time favorites. In fact, I have even said on more than one occasion that I believe that his name will go down in the history of great American writers along with people like Mark Twain.<br/><br/>I am also a big fan of Jessica Chastain, of poker and of writer/directors. So, as you can imagine, I was very excited for this movie, especially when I heard that Mr. Sorkin would be making his directorial debut.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it seems that not all directors can/should write and that, at least this writer, can't direct. I know that it is his first time in the chair, but he has been in the business for over 25 years and has had the opportunity and privilege to work with some true masters of the craft. Yet he managed to fall into what is possibly the biggest trap for someone in his position by ignoring one of the basic rules of the medium: ""Show, don't tell."".<br/><br/>This movie had more voice over narration that I've EVER heard in another film before. Don't get me wrong, when done properly I think this device can be extremely useful for both efficiently moving the story forward and effectively creating emotional investment and impact. This was not the case in Molly's Game. <br/><br/>Aaron's words didn't have any of their normal spark or edge. There was no music to the language. The voice over and the dialogue were both incredibly flat and unengaging. The words themselves weren't even that interesting, there were just so many of them and with every additional one it made the last that much less significant. I haven't read the book that this screenplay was adapted from, but at times I wondered if entire sections of the narration weren't just being read verbatim from it. <br/><br/>I really think I could have closed my eyes and just listened to this ""movie"" and got about 80-90% of the experience. Honestly, the only visual element Sorkin seemed willing or capable of paying any attention too were the lead actresses admittedly lovely curves that were so frequently highlighted in the vast array of expensive dresses she wore throughout the film. I'm certainly not opposed to a little female based visual stimulation, but it isn't really the type of ""smart"" content I've come to expect and adore from one of my favorite creators.<br/><br/>It seems that I am in the minority with these opinions and I hope that those of you who would disagree with me were able to take something meaningful from this film because I was just left wondering why I just spent nearly two and a half hours of my time enduring a film that barely grabbed by attention once. <br/><br/>Here's hoping that this was a minor glitch in an otherwise stellar career and not a sign of things to come."
"areatw","7","20","27","31 October 2018"," Fascinating and rewarding biographical drama
","There is a lot to like about 'Molly's Game' and the film gets a lot more right than it does wrong. I always enjoy films based on a true story, especially when they are as unique and interesting as this one. It's also always refreshing to see a biographical film without knowing anything about the story beforehand. I for one had never heard of Molly Bloom or her story, so it really made for fascinating viewing.<br/><br/>The film runs very smoothly and despite the rather long running length, it never goes through any lulls and always feels fast-paced and on the move. 'Molly's Game' is not only an entertaining film but it's also informative and educational. The story is approached well, digging beyond the surface and ensuring no detail is missed from the story.<br/><br/>'Molly's Game' is a strong biographical drama that does a very good job overall at telling a fascinating story."
"Serge_Zehnder","8","64","99","7 October 2017"," A True Tall Tale of High Stakes
","Nothing comes close to the rush of winning, at least according to those who have succeeded where others have failed. Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain) managed to become a millionaire with a dose of luck, will and endless street smarts. The former professional skier ran high stakes poker-games in Los Angeles and New York and found herself in the middle of a federal investigation, where she was accused of colluding with organized crime.<br/><br/>Being a sucker for great stories of real life characters, it is easy to see what Aaron Sorkin saw in the very true tale of Molly Bloom. The American ethos of being No. 1 combined with the isolation and principles of its heroine make ""Molly's Game"" a tremendous playing field for Sorkin's directorial debut.<br/><br/>Even though he has dealt with themes of power, loyalty and the darker side of entrepreneurial endeavors in ""The Social Network"", ""Newsroom"", ""Steve Jobs"" and ""Moneyball"", what sets this story apart is that Sorkin chooses to layer the rise-and-fall of the titular character with questions about business morals and the loss of a more principled economic system, that has been washed away by fast-buck artists and fatalistic devil-may-care attitudes.<br/><br/>""Molly's Game"" has a speedy pace, marvelous performances by both Chastain and Idris Elba, as her lawyer, and is directed with a sure hand. Which makes Sorkin's first directorial outing a joy to watch. <br/><br/>It's two-hour-plus running time glides by like a breeze and ends on a corny yet truthful note about the virtues of failure, that is a glimmer of hope in times of struggle, as well as one of the tenets of screen writing. <br/><br/>The fight, the hustle and the failure never end, but then again, so do the rewards in their own funny way. You win some, you lose some, and Sorkin never seems to forget how close he is to the edge."

","Saw the movie last night, one of the best movies (if not THE BEST) I seen for some time now.

One of the best discussions in cinema history (the therapy scene).

"VisualConnoisseur","Null","145","250","30 November 2017"," A movie without harmony
","Molly's Game feels like a movie without the center of gravity. It tries to carry itself on overanalysed, emotionally insignificant environmental details. Methodologically explained poker games are captivating the first few times, but get incredibly dull and underwhelming in the second half of the movie, feeling like redundant content. The protagonist is unable to pull the overexplained and ""all over the place"" narrative into one harmonious puzzle. When at the end Molly and her father discuss the memories of the past, the movie attempts to have a significant emotional culmination but ends with nothing more but a shallow and uninspired moral of the story - check the path before you follow it.<br/><br/>I would give this movie two stars, but there are some solid performances (especially from Idris Elba). Therefore my score is 4."

","I hesitated to be critical in the way I'm about to be because of a few factors that I ask readers to keep in mind. I'm 71 and wear hearing aids. At home on my TV, I almost always have captions on because of my hearing problem. Still, But then, I already had trouble following all the dialogue in the West Wing. In ""Molly's Game"" getting the flashbacks was a similar experience for me: too fast, not quite clear enough who was who, and the connections with the current scene sometimes not quite clear enough and it went by too quickly to think about it as did much of the dialogue. That I have hearing and processing problems hardly means I don't understand and/or can't follow most films I see at the theater. I loved ""The Post."" Nor did I have trouble with ""Molly's Game"" because I'm not smart: I have a M.A. in philosophy from U.C. Davis.

I'm surprised I mad it through the whole movie. And honestly the ending is ridiculous, the acting gets really bad and you just keep saying, is it over yet??"
"thebricks","4","58","102","6 January 2018"," Dumbed down; the book was much better
","It was sad to see how much this movie was dumbed down from the book. There was lots of great material in the book. The main focus should have been on how Molly organized the games and who was involved. However, the director felt that adding Kevin Costner and Idris Elba's characters and the skiing subplot was more important than actually telling the story faithfully. There was so much detail about what went into setting up the games and they totally ignored it and actually invented other things. Like for example, I do not think the drug problem was even in the book, and if it was, it didn't mess her up that badly. It's like the actual games and the celebrities involved were an afterthought. Without the names of the celebrities involved, the story had less of an impact. They were just Hollywood C-List actors and extras. Tobey Maguire also got a total pass, they went light on him in the movie; I can't believe they didn't even include the Shufflemaster debacle and worse yet, the time he demanded she bark like a seal for a tip.<br/><br/>A friend of mine that's big into film raved about the film because other people have, but as someone that read the book, I just thought it was awful. I can't recommend it."
"TwistedMango","7","54","97","4 December 2017"," Thrilling hand but with a few bad cards
","After suffering a horrific accident at a national skiing contest, Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain) gives up her Olympic dreams and moves to LA. While working as a cocktail waitress she meets arrogant real estate agent Dean (Jeremy Strong), and agrees to become his assistant.<br/><br/>Her duties include setting up his lucrative weekly poker game, which hosts some of the biggest names in Hollywood. Soon she has cut Dean loose, and is hosting huge stake matches in Los Angeles and New York. As her own personal fortune increases so does the attentions of the IRS and the criminal underworld towards her and her game.<br/><br/>Director and co-writer Aaron Sorkin starts the film well, with a well executed and wince- inducing freestyle skiing sequence. From here we are in LA, and the poker sequences are fluid and engrossing in a Goodfellas style that is indebted to Scorsese without being derivative in a manner of American Hustle. There is plenty of fluid camera movement and excellent visualizations of poker hands, and Sorkin is able to use simple things like shot- reverse shot in a creative manner. Sorkin has added some electricity to this most unfilmable of sports, showing Rounders how it should be done.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain looks phenomenal throughout, and credit should be given to a costume department that varies a wide range of stunning outfits. It's clear she dominates the room and hypnotizes these powerful men, whose extravagance and indifference to extreme wealth is intoxicating to watch (a highlight is when one player tries to leave a Monet painting as collateral).<br/><br/>Bill Camp puts in a great performance as Harlan Eustice, a seemingly competent poker player who starts to feel the heat. Stealing the pot is Player X as played by Michael Cera. Here he is using his youthful demeanour as a mask for a wicked personality, his most malevolent role since Francois of Youth In Revolt.<br/><br/>This is a first directorial effort of prolific screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, and it is with a certain irony that one of the weakest elements to Molly's Game is the script. There is an undue focus on voice-over and an only fleetingly involving legal case in which Molly is wrapped up in years after her stint as a hostess has ended.<br/><br/>The real high stakes finale happens as Molly's empire starts to crumble. That an audience is left with a resolution filled with hokey courtroom drama and cloying family moments between her and her father (Kevin Costner) afterwards dulls the film. Sorkin seems to have made the same mistake as Molly Bloom; thinking that being in an interesting environment makes you an interesting person outside of it.<br/><br/>Another key difference between Sorkin here and Scorsese's best work is the score. It is ordinary throughout, except in the legal cases when it is also bogged down by dull, obvious cues. While Molly's account of a poker world few of us have seen before captivate regardless, the music is another dud element in repetitive legal scenes.<br/><br/>What was amusing is that Molly's lawyers are played by Michael Kostroff who starred in The Wire as lawyer Maurice Levy, and Idris Elba who was criminal/wannabe businessman Stringer Bell in the same series. This footnote aside, I found nothing of particular interest in this chunk of the plot, which leaves the whole work dangerously close to a flop.<br/><br/>@BrianInvincible christophermarchant.wordpress.com"

Between her dialogue and her ridiculous narration, it started to feel like some kind of schizophrenic episode where I just wanted the voices to stop! There was no room to breathe, the story was bad, and the writing was worse. Next time, hire a better editor to say what you said in a quarter of the words and a half hour less of a movie.

"dromasca","5","29","51","14 February 2018"," verbose and boring true crime biography
","Americans love the true crime genre. The big bookstores in the US have dedicated true crime books sections. Many of the Hollywood or independent films are based on true crime stories, biographies and memoirs of people who walked on the wrong side of the law. Good and bad books, good and bad films. ""Molly's Game"" (written for the screen and directed by Aaron Sorkin and based on the auto-biographical book written by Molly Bloom) is a good example of how short is the distance between the good ones and the bad ones.<br/><br/>Molly Bloom is a real person, born in 1978. She spent much of her childhood and teen years in sports training, she was a skier and Olympic aspirant, but jer sports career was cut short by an accident. Shortly after that event she became involved in the high-stakes poker games, at the edge of the law. While the money that the games she organized went up, her life spiraled down, she became involved in a big scandal and lawsuit involving the mafia, accused of money laundering and organizing illegal gambling. The whole operation fell apart during a big FBI crush-down on illegal games and gambling. The film describes her ascending and downfall, the inquiry and the trial during which she refused to become a state witness, preferring to plead guilty and eventually avoiding a prison sentence.<br/><br/>Much of the film relies on acting performance of Jessica Chastain. She does a find job in describing a woman of character and ambition, who makes the wrong choices at several moments of her life, but finds the inner strength to assume responsibility and change the path of her own destiny. Unfortunately, Chastain's acting is not enough to save the film. Much of the screen time (which exceeds two hours) is spent in legalities and technical details about poker. You can follow these for a couple of times by a couple of minutes, but here they come back for almost all the duration of the movie. The second aspect that I did not like was the way the film describes the building of the relationship between Molly and her lawyer. There are several dialogs written by script author Aaron Sorkin that filmed director Aaron Sorkin liked so much that he forced the actors to declaim them at high pace, almost with no break for breathing. They looked to me theatrical and not credible. Another weak part in the script was the psychoanalytic explanation of Molly's choices which we get in a teary scene by the end of the film that contains a discussion between the hero and her father, who happens to be a clinical psychologist. The fact that the role is played by Kevin Costner did not help either, this is for Costner another bad choice among many that he made in his career.<br/><br/>""Molly's Game"" is probably close to the book and may be faithful to the real events which happened quite recently. They may have actual resonance which may be enough for a TV documentary drama but it is not enough to make of it a good feature film. Hints to real persons, actors or other celebrities are not relevant, especially for for international audiences. In the absence of true drama or characters evolution, we are served with a lot of legal and poker technicalities, and with a conventional and melodramatic view of the whole story. The result is verbose and boring, and seems even longer than its 140 minutes of screen time."

","The San Fransisco movie reviewer phrased it very well when he wrote, ""at a certain point, everyone watching this movie will ask, 'why should I care about any of this?'"" The question hangs in the air very early during the film, and it's never really answered-- at least not in the 1 1/2 hours that I watched it. Yeah, I bailed.<br/><br/>I think that it sits currently at 7.6 on this site and 80% on Rotten Tomatoes because so many people WANT Sorkin's directorial debut to be great... But it's just.... not.<br/><br/>Molly brags about her accomplishments and her intelligence throughout the movie (yes, the braggadocio is boring in itself) , but in the end she just exploited simple concepts from someone who she describes as an ""idiot."" Alright... So you supposedly put off attending law school at an Ivy League school to put yourself in the feds' cross-hairs with this ""idiot's"" schemes? Brilliant.<br/><br/>There are also the lacking technical aspects of the editing and camerawork such as the ESPN-like side panels when the guys are playing poker. The minutiae and graphics are mind-numbingly boring to novices and professionals alike. Jessica Chastain does voice over while they play with so much garrulity and monotony. It would have been much easier just to SHOW the game. Instead of, ""Max thinks that Jake has a jack, which would give him two of a kind, but Jake is overselling his bluff a bit too much which tipped off Max and made him--"" just show it. We can see it: ""That dude had a great hand, but he tipped it off, so the other guy folded."" Wow. So complicated. It doesn't require paragraphs.<br/><br/>There is also dull legalistic minutiae in which Molly is showcasing her intellect and supposedly correcting her own lawyer in the process. Again, who cares? She didn't want to actually apply that intellect in the way that her lawyer did, so now she must pay millions to him instead. Wow. Brilliant.<br/><br/>The acting is shaky. Jessica Chastain is undeniably sexy, but she has all of the charisma of a DMV worker. For me, she just can't pull off leading lady.<br/><br/>I majored in psychology, so I want to conclude this review by stating that it's ironic that Sorkin focused on the minutiae of poker and the law, but he is apparently lost on the details of my science. At one point when Molly is an adolescent she says to her father that she thinks that Freud was a ""moron"" and a ""quack."" Her father bristles at these insults and says something like, ""I'M NOT A QUACK."" Well, although I respect Freud immensely and most of the theories of modern psychology are derived from his theories, even during the early '90s (when I assume this exchange occurred) few psychologists were heavily invested in the Freudian paradigm. I don't know why so many writers think that psychologists are obsessed with Freudian ideas. Anyway, this film is a sh** show."

","An Olympic standard skier injures herself and her entire life changes. Everything she has worked towards is no longer possible. She takes a job as a waitress and then falls into an underworld of speakeasy type high stakes poker games which of course are illegal. <br/><br/>Sounds intriguing and exciting, right? Well, not when you watch the film, they somehow make it all look rather dull. We see games being organized and Molly being hit on. The film looks a bit like a trailer or music video. Things are happening, well mostly the same thing over and over really. The games are run in a very straight forward manner, none of the characters are very engaging. <br/><br/>When the investigation process starts I found myself still not caring. Jessica Chastain wears a lot of dresses which expose a lot of cleavage. Her cleavage should have received top billing here. Nothing else really mattered. <br/><br/>What should have been an awesome story, just wasn't at all."
"rbbdagge","3","12","19","15 October 2018"," Victimization film #345
","O dear - I thought I was going to watch a film about high-stakes poker and instead sat through yet another film about the victimization of Strong Capable women at the hands of rich, foolish but powerful men. Even Sigmund Freud is called a misogynistic oaf. Molly talks like a machine gun and seemingly knows EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING. And every man adores her and wants to date her, despite the fact she is unpleasant and ill-humoured throughout the entire film. <br/><br/>Anyway, the film should have spent more time on poker and less on Molly being victimized (she was, after all, the person who actually initialed these games). A successful film generally requires the viewer to sympathise with some party, but since just about everyone in Molly's Game is unpleasant and/or foolish, that is rather difficult. The one exception is her lawyer who seems a decent chap, and he should certainly be given sympathy because he appears to be doing all his work for free. For this, he gets hours of abuse from Molly. The film is based on Molly's own book, which I suspect is a bit of a white-wash and somewhat overdoes her own saintliness - I doubt that a woman who can mingle with such high-powered people, organize such poker games and earn such sums of money is really so clueless about whom she invites to games and so utterly selfless in her protection of others (especially given she clearly believes that they are all a bunch of rich arrogant scumbags).

"Jared_Andrews","7","14","23","3 February 2018"," Sorkin and Chastain Flourish in this Fun, Fast-paced Ride
","As is the case with all Aaron Sorkin movies, Molly's Game (based on a true story) pummels you with sharp, rapid-fire verbal jabs. Sorkin confidently dances circles around you, dizzying you with repartee, occasionally dropping your jaw with powerful verbal combinations. His scripts come at you aggressively. He hopes to leave you dazzled by the speed and impact of the dialogue, and he succeeds. <br/><br/>As a first-time director, he delivers the same speed and ferocity with the creative camera work and cuts in the opening scene of Molly's Game. The sequence is a whirlwind of clever explanations through narration and visuals. Immediately it becomes clear-this guy knows what he's doing behind the camera. <br/><br/>The remainder of the first hour zooms along in a similarly spectacular fashion. Jessica Chastain shines as Molly Bloom, the poker princess. She exhibits the class, composure, and tenacity required of someone who ran the most elegant poker games in the country for billionaires, athletes, and actors. And, most importantly, she smoothly rattles off all the light-speed Sorkin dialogue in a natural-sounding cadence. The movie doesn't work without the perfect actress playing Molly. Chastain is perfect. <br/><br/>While Chastain delivers her powerhouse performance with swagger, Idris Elba (playing her fictitious lawyer), falls a bit flat. I don't blame Elba, who has consistently proven to be a more than capable performer. His part feels underwritten. As skilled as Sorkin as with dialogue, he does not always create the most compelling or complete supporting characters in his stories. <br/><br/>Elba does deliver one devastating speech with great earnestness. It's a touch preachy, but he says what had needed to be said the entire movie. I was grateful.<br/><br/>The poker scenes bring a lot of fun to the table (sorry, it was right there). Each character represents a real-life celebrity or rich guy or at least an amalgam of a few real-life players. I had great fun guessing which character was which celebrity as I watched. Then I looked up the names later (obviously). That part was fun too. <br/><br/>At some point about halfway through, the movie hits a lull. It drags. It's never boring, but it doesn't hit with quite the same fury. Not every scene feels necessary, so the length becomes noticeably extensive. The movie definitely needs a trim.<br/><br/>After regaining its footing, the movie seems to be on the way to a satisfying conclusion. Then a bizarre ice-skating scene leads into an unwatchably awful three-minute therapy session. I nearly covered eyes and plugged my ears. Tough to forgive that one. <br/><br/>Despite the one horrendous moment, the movie offers far more good than bad. It's fun. It's smart. It's a commendable directorial debut from a long-time writing superstar, Aaron Sorkin, and it's one of Jessica Chastain's finest performances to date."
"breheneyjames","7","28","52","18 December 2017"," Not quite a Royal Flush but a high full house
","'Molly's Game' is written and directed by esteemed screenwriter Aaron Sorkin of whom it is the directorial debut. It is adapted from the book of the same name by Molly Bloom herself. The film stars Jessica Chastain as the eponymous character in a commanding performance which keeps the audience hooked when the story itself fails to do so. Idris Elba plays Molly's lawyer in another good performance to add to his collection. The story is about Molly who was once an Olympic-hopeful skier who got sidelined due to injury which is shown in an engaging opening scene accompanied by her voice over. After to this she moves to LA and after a brief stint as a cocktail waitress ends up working as an assistant at a high stakes poker game featuring Hollywood stars, business moguls and unknowingly the Russian mob. When her boss refuses to pay her because she is making some much in tips she strikes out on her own and moves the game to a new location making sure to alert all the regular players of where to show up in the process. She also has a game set up in NYC and runs them both at the same time. <br/><br/>Of course this after we watch her being arrested by armed FBI agents in the middle of the night in an earlier scene. Sorkin does this throughout the movie intertwining events before and after she was taken in. It was works for the most part however it does slow down the pace at times when the audience gets invested in Molly's activities before her arrest (running the poker games) and then Sorkin suddenly cuts to events after which are far less attention grabbing (her legal trouble). I will say though that these less intriguing scenes are made more watchable by Chastain and Elba's performances. They are both really good in this movie and two of the strongest parts of 'Molly's Game'. There are a few other noteworthy performances as well namely Kevin Costner as Molly's father, Michael Cera as Player X (apparently based on Tobey Maguire!) and Chris O'Dowd as another one of the poker players. The other major strength of the movie is the script which is full of wit which one has come to expect from Sorkin. This gives Chastain a lot of ammunition to shine and she uses it brilliantly. <br/><br/>The constant voice over does get a little distracting quite often especially when filled with Sorkin's signature choc-a-bloc style dialogue. Thought again it less irritating due to Chastain's fine performance of it. I will also add that the direction is a tad undeveloped but then again this is Sorkin's debut so I'm sure he can only improve from here on out. Despite this though he does use some nice techniques to make high stakes hands of poker more exciting to watch. Overall this a decent directorial debut for Sorkin and one that will hopefully lead to better films from him in the future."

Also, don't have a high-level sophisticated lawyer not know what in propria persona means. (it means as your own person and refers to people that appear WITHOUT a lawyer.)

","There's no doubt this is a well made movie with some strong acting performances but there was no real connection to the characters. Am I supposed to like Molly because she had a hard upbringing and was able to turn that around by breaking the law and running a fancy card game with lots of famous people (whose names can't actually be mentioned)? Should I fell sorry for the gamblers who don't care that they lose he money because they are rich anyway? I know this is partly based on a book Molly wrote but the fact she doesn't offer full disclosure and lies to brush over certain parts of what happened makes me question how true her story really is. If you take it as based on a true story you'll see another hollywood puff piece designed to get some acting nominations. For a movie about poker games there wasn't a lot of poker. Sure there were a few times where it started to get exciting but then the director would cut to a flashback of her younger years and the pace would be lost. It reminded me a lot of Logan Lucky where I kept waiting for something to happen but it never really did."
"michaeltrivedi","7","4","5","29 November 2019"," Intelligent but Entertaining
","Molly's Game was an intelligent movie. And yet it didn't lose its entertainment value. It was there to entertain people, not teach them. Therefore, it had moments that seemed like The Big Short or Glengarry Glen Ross. But it was just fun to watch.<br/><br/>The movie is about an ex-professional Skiier (Olympian?) who suffers an injury and decides to move to LA. Once there, she ends up joining a private gambling card game, where she's introduced to the LA high rollers, including movie stars and businessmen. She soon messes that up after starting her own card game, and moves to New York, where she gets involved with the Russian mafia. And that's where she finds herself at odds with the law.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain is really great in this. She's pretty and fun to watch, and yet she could easily get lost in the crowd. She's not a favorite, she's just there, perhaps at her own convenience too. The rest of the cast is good, but weak. No great movie stars were pulled in, and the familiar faces aren't enough to keep you entertained. What is entertaining is the movie. The main characters' intelligence and work ethnic shine through. Her rise to the top is what we are craving.<br/><br/>Also this movie I didn't find was too much about the American Dream and the economy. It was just one lady's experience in life. Nothing too deep, but good altogether.<br/><br/>7 stars"

","It looked as good on paper - Alan Sorkin, Jessica Chastain, biography ...
So, I went into local theater to watch it. And that was really bad idea. Bad idea was too, to get some sympathy by saying 'f* you' right at beginning. Now I think that Sorkin should stay at writing. Storytelling was almost not present, there was narration of her (Molly) instead, but it was rather irritating than helping. Why ? Because all it was so egoistic. Right, that's proper word, and I just added it to summary of review. One scene too slow, other too fast, with barely followable dialogs ... And I knew that it will be almost 2.5 hours, so did what probably never before - went out for drink. 'Beer will be good to calm self down, and yes, will give me excuse for another 'vacation' from this mess'. Basically, all what kept me from leaving it was that wanted to see ending. That was not done well, especially very last part, and another egoistic talk. But verdict was interesting. Actually, it could be much better subject for some much better movie. As it was, most of movie focused on less relevant things, and all was just superficial.<br/><br/>Somehow I remembered one short scene from my life, more than 40 years ago. It was in bar, where most of people were more-less drunk. So, a prostitute, not so young anymore, not that attractive, stand in front of mirror on wall, and said 'Beauty matters not, what matters is how you mixing in bed' (mixing maybe sounds not best in English, but I'm sure you got it) . Well, that short scene and monologue says much more about life than this 140 minutes of 'I will survive' bragfest . I'm sure she will. But why should I care more for her than for some working man, mother, who making not money and fame, just complete 'irrelevant' things for life - like food, cleanness, future of kind ...
In bigger part I just had feeling that it is not realistic. Forget money, get real life. Then maybe will make better movies too."

The subject is poker and Sorkin's genius is that you don't have to know anything about poker to enjoy this massively entertaining film. Molly is Molly Bloom, a one-time skier, who ran one of America's highest stake poker games until she was arrested by the F.B.I. and she's played, terrifically, by Jessica Chastain, who just happens to be one of the best actresses working in movies today.

","I loathe the voice over technique because it signals a failure of the cinematic imagination. You tell instead of show, and film is primarily intended to show. So how come I was glued to the screen every second of Molly's Game? The glorious, unbeatable, irrepressible Ms Chastain. Her magic and charisma result in a screen presence that dominates her films to the extent that flaws in the movie making process go unnoticed. This film is no exception. She scintillates on the screen, in the characterisation, and because the narration is in her voice, it becomes a seamless part of that characterisation.
Whether she narrates or interacts with the other characters, she achieves a multilayered convincing characterisation. I'm reluctant to call it a ""performance"" so naturally is this character built and developed.
Mr Elba is equally brilliant, having a greatly charismatic screen presence himself. The chemistry between the two jumps off the screen. The dialogue and editing pace are cracking. They elevate a rather ordinary real story into cinematic myth territory. O'Dowd and Costner make remarkable character contributions too. Cera is a tad miscast as Player X, he just doesn't have that evil undertow the character requires. But this is another Chastain triumph. She totally owns this movie, dominating the screen in a powerful, layered, thoroughly convincing piece of work, morphing into the character so naturally you can't take your eyes off her. Outstanding work from her and Mr Sorkin."

","With an interesting subject matter, advertising that drew me right into wanting to see it, a great cast (Jessica Chastain, Idris Elba) and one of today's best screen writers in Aaron Sorkin making his directing debut, 'Molly's Game' had a lot going for it and had more than enough to compel me to see it.<br/><br/>Saw 'Molly's Game' a few weeks ago but didn't get round to reviewing it due to being so busy and my ""to review"" list being a long one and getting longer all the time. Likewise with my ""films to see"" list. Finally getting round to reviewing 'Molly's Game', to me it was a great film and worthy of every ounce of its positive reception, being one of the year's better reviewed films (another factor in my want to see the film). Not flawless, but one of the year's best? Yes. Absolutely. <br/><br/>'Molly's Game' perhaps runs a little too long and it fizzles somewhat at the end. At this point the momentum grips less and things ring false, particularly in the over-sentimental family elements (Elba's powerful speech makes the courtroom elements worth it).<br/><br/>However, Jessica Chastain is a marvel in the lead and she is matched every step of the way by charismatic Idris Elba. Their chemistry blisters. Also worthy of credit are Chris O'Dowd and, more surprisingly, Michael Cera, known for their more comedic roles, being cast against type in very dramatic roles and being every bit as much at ease with them. Kevin Costner also hasn't been this good in years and that is saying a lot. <br/><br/>Sorkin's directing debut is a very confident one and shows huge potential and assurance. Despite perhaps being too early to say, he is a better writer than as a director, only because he is so outstanding a writer. The energetic and stylish production values make 'Molly's Game' a visually striking film. The music score is not the most memorable or extraordinary there's ever been, but it at least fits and sounds appealing. <br/><br/>On top of all that, 'Molly's Game's' story is fast-paced and highly enthralling. The poker elements fascinate and to me it wasn't talky and the narration wasn't that over-used or over-explanatory, there are far worse examples in film and for no reason at all. Other than the cast the other big star of 'Molly's Game' is the crackling script that sizzles in energy, razor-sharp in wit and consistently thought-provoking and entertaining.<br/><br/>In summary, one game that is a must play. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

","Molly's Game- What starts out as a dry story about what appears to be a rather unlikable braggart turns out to be something more by the end of the film. I love money and I like poker but piecing it all together with repetitive narration frankly would have lost me as a viewer had it not been for Jessica Chastain. She eats up the screen and, not to go all ""Wolf of Wall Street,"" but jargon and supposition goes down so much better looking at an amazing woman with spectacular cleavage. The final act and character arc really saves the movie. There are signs that things have been whitewashed and that Molly may not have been the noble soul that hits the screen yet it an intriguing tale and worth the watch."
"willz187","1","15","33","10 January 2018"," Hurt my head
","One of the worst movies I've seen lately. A case of when a writer shouldn't also be the director. I think if there were a director they would've said 'no, we don't need to over-explain and narrate everything here, let's try to tell a story visually, let the audience figure out what's going on'. <br/><br/>The whole interview/exposition set up in movies is so overplayed, and it's done very poorly here. It's like everyone in this movie is giving an explanation of the world that's going on around them. The dialogue is so forced and fake. I nominate this movie for the Razzies.<br/><br/>And why does every single movie that has poker in it, have to explain how to play poker and the colorful terminology that comes with it? Is this a story or a poker lesson? Is this writing supposed to be interesting because it's littered with poker terms?<br/><br/>Chastain is wasted here. She's great in Miss Sloane. Just go watch that.<br/><br/>All the yakking, it was like watching people read from a cheesy book. Yak yak yak, then big fake emotional send up. The flashbacks were bad too. Michael Cera was maybe the only decent thing about this movie.<br/><br/>The real life story itself seems stupid. The Russians didn't even seem to have anything to with the outcome? Yet they're painted as the antagonist's from the beginning?<br/><br/>None of this should've happened, movie or real thing."
"Turfseer","6","11","23","20 January 2018"," Reasonably entertaining take on private high stakes poker world but depiction of hostess as feminist icon proves dubious
","Noted screenwriter and TV writer Aaron Sorkin is back with his take on the short career of high-stakes poker game hostess Molly Bloom, based on her book of the same name. A good part of it violates one of screenwriting's cardinal precepts: ""Show don't tell""-due to the reliance on off-screen narration. I can understand why Sorkin resorted to the voiceover however, as Molly's story doesn't always lend itself to great moments of dramatic conflict as the narrative is much more dependent on mere character description, which turns out to be (pardon the pun) one of the film's stronger suits.<br/><br/>Molly's back story is quite interesting and Sorkin begins the film with his young protagonist on the ski slopes, competing for a place on the Olympic team. A freak encounter with a patch of shrubbery on the slope derails the fledgling athlete's career sending her off to California where her fate is eventually sealed as high stakes poker hostess.<br/><br/>Sorkin flash forwards to the present time with Molly consulting with an attorney Charlie Jaffrey (Idris Elba) to see whether he'll take her case, after she's been arrested on federal racketeering and illegal gambling charges. Perhaps Sorkin liked the idea of writing a part for an African-American actor or wished to suggest that Molly was not only not racist but liked black people, but the real-life story has it that her attorney was actually an ordinary white guy.<br/><br/>Most of Idris's dialogue is invented out of whole cloth and the interaction between client and attorney is the least interesting aspect of the film. Sorkin attempts to inject some drama into his Jaffrey character by having him agonize over whether he should take Molly's case (her lack of funds is the issue leading to his indecision). It's his high opinion of Molly's character (reflecting Sorkin's high opinion of his protagonist) that leads the attorney to take on her case (initially) pro bono. <br/><br/>Later, Elba delivers an impassioned speech to the federal prosecutor arguing (rightly) that she was not directly involved with any of the gangsters who attended her poker games and was only guilty of a low level crime (taking a ""rake"" from each hand dealt at the poker table). <br/><br/>The ""meat"" of the film is Molly's description of the various outlandish characters that inhabit the shady world of private high-stakes poker games. Of particular interest is Jeremy Strong as Dean Keith, a real estate agent who initially hires Molly to run the poker games, constantly berating and abusing her before she quits and begins running her own games; Michael Cera as ""Player X,"" principally based on a ruthless Tobey Maguire, who eventually has her replaced, resulting in Molly moving to New York City; Brian d'Arcy James as Brad, a hedge fund manager, who bets using funds accumulated from a Ponzi scheme and Chris O'Dowd as Douglas Downey, the man who introduces Molly to the Russian mob.<br/><br/>There is a sub-plot involving Kevin Costner as Molly's over-achieving psychology professor dad who is held up as the motivation for Molly's decision to get involved in the risky, illegal world of private high stakes poker (in addition to the father, both Molly's brothers are over-achievers, one an NFL player and the other, a physician). An unlikely scene of the father confronting the daughter takes place at film's end which serves as a confession of misguided filial concern.<br/><br/>Despite the colorful stories, Sorkin's moral integrity remains highly questionable as he has cast Molly as some sort of feminist icon, bravely taking on men in a man's world and supposedly (albeit for a short time) ending up as a triumphant pioneer. In reality, there is nothing brave or admirable about his protagonist, as Molly (using her own free will) chose to become involved in a sleazy world of illegal operators. As the film ably illustrates, she almost lost her life at the hands of a Mafia goon, who robbed and beat in her the confines of her supposedly safe, doorman attached, high rise apartment.<br/><br/>Following Sorkin's lead, Jessica Chastain is bent on depicting Molly not so much as a self-serving illegal businesswoman, but as that pioneer, bent on providing those sleazy (male) poker players with a dose of certified comeuppance.<br/><br/>Ignore Sorkin's attitudinizing and you might find Molly's Game reasonably entertaining and a decent enough ""docudrama,"" depicting a world of fringe players who have now come to light as a result of Ms. Bloom's perceptive observations."

"namashi_1","7","9","18","1 January 2018"," Jessica Chastain is ACE in Sorkin's Impressive Directorial Debut!
","Oscar-Winning Writer Aaron Sorkin makes his Directorial Debut with 'Molly's Game', a true-story about a Woman who used her mind to bring up the stakes & made it big, despite falling hard eventually. Sorkin keeps the narrative entertaining almost throughout, but its Jessica Chastain who proves to be the real ACE here. Its a superlative performance, that empowers the show!<br/><br/>'Molly's Game' Synopsis: The true story of Molly Bloom, an Olympic-class skier who ran the world's most exclusive high-stakes poker game and became an FBI target.<br/><br/>Molly Bloom went from being an Olympic-Class Skier to a Poker magnet. Its interesting to see Chastain embody Molly, starting from scratch to end up being an FBI target, after having made a lot of money. Sorkin's Screenplay is well-done, despite flaws. The narrative is thoroughly watchable & the sequences involving Molly & her Lawyer (Idris Elba, in fine form), stand out due to clever dialogue & also due to Chastain & Elba's winning on-screen chemistry. Having said that, Sorkin's Screenplay isn't always on point. The sub-plot of Molly & her strained relationship with her father (Kevin Costner, terrific in a small role) isn't entirely engaging. Its these bits that appear flabby & take away some glory from 'Molly's Game'. So the Writing goes this way: The rise of Molly is engrossing though, her fall also has winning moments, but the sub-plot is weak, despite the commitment of the actors. <br/><br/>Sorkin, a master at his craft in Writing, however trumps over the flaws & delivers a nicely done Screenplay, that explores a Woman's journey. Sorkin's Direction is pretty good, leaving his mark in his debut. I would like to see Sorkin calling the shots again. Cinematography & Editing are perfect. Art & Costume Design are superb. Daniel Pemberton's Score is well-done. <br/><br/>And now to the ACE - Chastain. In what can be called as her sexiest performance yet, the actress is terrific as Molly Bloom. Portraying a woman who went through emotional turmoil & later hosted the biggest bets in the world of Poker, Chastain is firebrand. She has never looked this gorgeous before & her performance, is all heart & soul. Truly among the strongest performances of the year!<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Molly's Game' isn't perfect, but it has enough merits to earn itself a viewing. Recommended!"

Young women watch movies like this and come away thinking they can do whatever they want and get away with it. Terrible moral story. Also Jessica was 4 out of 10 and Idris was 8 out of 10.

","I had high hopes for this flick cause I'd heard a lot about the book and the plot.
However, there wasn't too much focus on her setting up the games.. and even less on the players so they're unremarkable and you couldn't care less about them.<br/><br/>Of course, since the movie is recent, we MUST have some misandric exchanges, right? Molly is having an argument with Matt Serra's character and he calls her on her BS.. and she does what most women do these days: tell the guy what to do. So he leaves and basically dismantles her game. She get depressed blames the misogynistic man.. oh poor girl.
Later on, when she's meeting 2 blokes at the 4 seasons, she needs to make some condescending remarks.. of course, had it been reversed, the harpies would flip if a man were to be making misogynstic comments.. oh well..<br/><br/>Let's not forget the annoying narration. Oh boy, it hindered the pace and it was unnecessary. 
And last but no least.. Jessica Chastain's cleavage. I think there were only a couple of scenes where she wasn't showing the twins. Guess they should've received top billing for such screen time."

","My husband and I attended opening night and were dismayed to see that the theater was only about a third of the way full. It was mostly middle-aged couples (we're 32 and 37) at the 7:10 showing. Despite being 2 hours and 20 minutes, we were both engaged throughout the entire film. Jessica Chastain was fantastic and I thought that she played the part very well. Her depiction of Molly Bloom as both sexy and driven was spot on, as we researched the real Molly Bloom after watching the film. Michael Cera's character was somewhat of a villain, which is a far cry from the part he played in Superbad. Idris Elba and Kevin Costner both had supporting actor roles and gave the film really good depth. I liked how the film jumped back and forth between Molly's childhood and current day and current day and her venture into the underground gambling world.

"Rob-O-Cop","5","5","9","27 May 2018"," Good Criminal? How many wrongs make a right?
","Another in along line of American movies that glorifies and makes heroes of the act of skating the barely legal line for profit and self.
Molly Bloom's true story is a caper movie, except that her caper is a true story.
It's a reasonably made movie in the genre, flashy sets and costumes, idolizing the lifestyles of the rich and decadent, and in presenting it that way perpetuates the American dilemma of founding their culture on the self serving capitalist ahead of honest true and fair. 
Molly sets up an empire founded on the rocks of gambling addiction, opulence, obscene wealth and the abuse of that wealth, and the act of trying to skate as close to the legal line as possible while skating well over the lines of Good, Honest, True and Fair, and idolizing that behavior, in this case apparently in the interests of entertainment but on another level in the interests of normalizing Molly's behavior, it's fair because most of it doesn't technically break the law,while being well aware of how far over the line it goes for the acts of building a good community in it's preying on the addicted and fraternizing in the seedy underworld.
Molly's guilty of pushing society in a bad direction, but this film does just as much to normalize the behavior and then the media machine that lauds Molly's efforts to do right by her 'wrong' customers and keep their secrets secret, how many levels of wrong are we going down to come up with a right?
Go watch some interviews after watching this movie and look at the media scrambling to paint Molly as a role model for keeping her mouth shut. 
It's a case of not seeing the forest for the trees. Her act of loyalty is seen as good except it's loyalty to a sick society, granted loyalty against another sick portion of the same society, the messed up law enforcement sector.
There's so many levels of wrong from this kind of movie, and this movie in particular, and it's all wrapped up in an easily digestible entertainment package.<br/><br/>This is a loose for everyone involved, audience, Molly, film makers, media, society in general, but technically it's a well made piece of cinema so points for that.<br/><br/>I feel bad for having watched it now.
And thanks for making me rant like a fundamentalist for noticing this stuff. Stop making this damaging rubbish and glorifying these people. The only plus was there wasn't much in the way of graphic violence and lovingly portrayed gun play, well, apart from her beating."

"bankofmarquis","8","9","20","8 January 2018"," Strong writing, directing, acting
","The more I watch Jessica Chastain on the screen, the more I am convinced that she is the best actress working today. Her turn in the new Aaron Sorkin vehicle, MOLLY'S GAME adds to this conviction.<br/><br/>Following the real-life exploits of Molly Bloom, who ran one of the biggest underground recurring poker games of all time, Chastain brings to life a well rounded character with a strong backbone and even stronger convictions who, whilst under Federal Investigation, was unwilling to ""name names"" in order to save herself.<br/><br/>Chastain's performance is spot-on, a brilliant, strong performance that shows the strength (and strength of character) that Bloom possesses but also bringing forth her humanity and human frailty in such a way that creates a real person, and not some Super-Hero caricature. Sparring ably with Chastain is Idris Elba as Bloom's lawyer. I've stated before that I don't really get Elba's rise as a ""special"" actor. I think he is just ""fine"", but nothing more. But here he is much, much more than ""fine"". Dare I say, I think this is the best that Elba has done and I now see the strength of his acting. It is an un-flashy, supportive role that is much, much more than a supporting role and in the hands of a lesser actor, could be forgettable, but in the hands of Elba is certainly NOT forgettable.<br/><br/>Of course, both of these actors are able to shine because of the words that were written in the script by Aaron Sorkin. Not much more praise needs to be heaped upon Sorkin as his writing speaks for itself. I was impressed with the restraint that Sorkin shows in MOLLY'S GAME, he dials back all of his ""Sorkin-isms"" in this film (I can't remember a single ""walk and talk"" scene) and let's the story unfold in a natural sense. Part of the restraint has to be given to the Director of this film who eschews flash for substance. Of course, writer Sorkin is helped out by the Director - Aaron Sorkin. He is able to keep the action moving forward and the poker - while an essential part of the story - is not at the forefront, so Sorkin was able to keep the complexity, and intricacies of the game off to the side while focusing on Molly and the effects that her driven nature inevitably has upon her. .<br/><br/>Much more than a ""two-hander"", Sorkin has delivered a layered, fine film that includes many, many strong actors in small-ish roles - Chris O'Dowd, Jeremy Strong, Graham Greene, Brian D'Arcy James and even Michael Cera(!) all shine - but it is the continued refinement and rejuvenation of Kevin Costner that surprised me here. As Molly's overbearing father, Costner brings the same sense of strength and vulnerability that Chastain brings to the screen - albeit in much, much less screen time. I can see how these two can be father and daughter.<br/><br/>Come Oscar time, I would be very happy to see Chastain listed as a nominee - it is that strong of a performance.<br/><br/>Check out Molly's Game, an intelligent, character based drama with sharp dialogue from one of the best screen writers of our time.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A-<br/><br/>8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

","Hopes were high for Molly's Game, the directional debut of famed screenwriter/playwright Aaron Sorkin and for good reason.<br/><br/>Based on the fascinating true story of American Molly Bloom, who went from Olympic class skier to high stakes poker coordinator/FBI target and very much a lady of the spotlight, Molly's Game had all the elements lined up to suggest that Sorkin's first foray behind the camera after many year's collaborating with the best in the business would be the type of Oscar baiting biopic that was also a crowd pleasing good time.<br/><br/>Renowned for making the seemingly unexcitable exciting and accessible, court room battles (A Few Good Men), politics (TV series The West Wing), social media (The Social Network), baseball statistics (Moneyball), complicated public figures (Steve Jobs), Sorkin has made a career out of brilliantly realised dialogue and understanding of subject matters that have worked wonders when teamed with filmmaker's like David Fincher or Danny Boyle but that magic is missing from Sorkin the director as Molly's Game extensive runtime limps towards the two hour plus mark.<br/><br/>Sorkin's examination of Bloom (whose played with an Oscar-baiting mannerism by Jessica Chastain) is a curiously cold experience as we're thrust into an odd narrative structure of Bloom in her later life reflecting on her rise up the underground high-stakes poker scene to where she is now, battling a publicly scrutinised court case with the help of Idris Elba's lawyer Charlie Jaffey and while Sorkin's Oscar nominated script is fine within itself, it never truly unlocks the reasoning behind Bloom's choices or characteristics and fails to engage on the emotional level Sorkin's words usually end up unlocking.<br/><br/>Unlike his way with words, Sorkin also struggles to inject energy into his picture.<br/><br/>Film's such as The Social Network and Moneyball managed to match Sorkin's unique abilities as a screenwriter with imaginative and energetically infused direction but Sorkin fails to deliver that here as we proceed along Bloom's journey from cash strapped ex-athlete to high rolling big timer and while you don't exactly expect a film focussed on poker to induce white-knuckles, Molly's Game feels like a rather generic offering from a writer who is anything but.<br/><br/>Final Say - <br/><br/>Molly's Game isn't irredeemably bad by a long stretch of the imagination but when a film such as this is led by such a powerful behind the scenes presence, you do expect a lot more. With moments of genius in its screenwriting, Molly's Game will still please hard-core Sorkin acolytes but outside of this component, Molly's Game deals a dud hand.<br/><br/>2 bags of bagels out of 5"

Michael Cera's character Player X is suppose to be the best player, but they show this by saying someone's laying down the nuts to him because he's talking, that doesn't make him good, that just makes that player bad.

Chastain gives a peerlessly brilliant performance as Molly Bloom, a one-time Olympian skier whose descension into the dark underworld of high-stakespoker leads to a downward spiral while also establishing her own character in the process. Based on Bloom's book, Aaron Sorkin - who adapted and makes his feature film directorial debut with aplomb - imbues the unsinkable Molly with deft Ã©lan and fearlessness. A finely tuned supporting role by Costner as her ever-demanding father is one of the actor's best performances. Well-conceived and executed."
"smileykate","Null","6","13","4 January 2018"," Aaron Sorkin's 'Molly's Game' was definitely worth the gamble.
","As a huge Jessica Chastain fan, this film about a strong women who persevered through failure to run high stake poker games, appealed to me very much. When it first started, I wasn't sure that I was going to enjoy it. I thought that it would just be nearly 2 hours of explaining poker whilst we saw how easy it was to fail when you have everything to lose. Luckily this was not the case. What we got instead was the story of an extraordinary women who defined odds to build a poker empire that was entirely her own creation. Chastain was the perfect actress to cast in this role, as she has no trouble at all in portraying the confident and unyielding Molly, who could be compared to other characters she has played in the past. I also think she brings some of herself into the character as well; her intelligence and her urge to be taken seriously in a profession where women are not seen as equal. What I especially loved was the chemistry between Chastian and Idris Elba. Their scenes show us Sorkin's true talent for words and this allowed them to really be at the top of their games. Elba's supporting role is the icing on the cake really, as he shows us in a amazing scene where he performs a speech for the opposing counsel.Here he shows us not only his talent for stealing a scene but also showing us how well he can develop a character so that we really see their human side and how seeing the truth can change how we perceive things. Both stars deserve to be nominated for their performances this award season, not just Jessica Chastain, but we all know how unfair these things can be. On a final note, I would like to say that this is probably Kevin Costner's best film of recent years, maybe he should stick to supporting roles in the future."
"rabbitmoon","6","7","16","18 February 2018"," Sorkin running himself into a slightly boring corner
","I miss the days when Aaron Sorkin put effort into writing stories, like Malice, A Few Good Men, or The American President. Sometime since, he fell so much in love with his own formula (characters delivering fast monologues involving random facts, statistics, distorting each others words into new meanings) that he doesn't seem to care about story any more. Apparently the audience will salivate and be duly aroused by yet another cutesy bit of fast-talking dialogue that could be about anything. <br/><br/>Put simply, the story of Molly Bloom could have been told in half an hour. Heck, a 3 minute montage could have done it. Dragging it out to 2 hours 20 is just... silly. This is NOT an epic story. Its not even particularly interesting - the result has nothing in particular to do with anything. Jessica Chastain plays EXACTLY the same character as in the utter-Sorkin-imitation Miss Sloane. <br/><br/>I was really hoping it would end soon, and there was still an hour left. Yes, Sorkins writing can be 'amusing' here and there, but most its taxing and irritating, people simply don't speak like that in real life, and it seems a real shame to let it get in the way of telling a good story. There isn't one here."

"brucegiff607","9","3","5","1 December 2018"," This is Jessica Chastain's Game
","Molly's Game is Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut. You may have heard his name before because he wrote the screenplay for many great movies: The Social Network, Moneyball, and Steve Jobs, just to name a few. As a first time director, this was a solid debut. The film stars Jessica Chastain as Molly Bloom, a once Olympic-class skier who starts running an exclusive high-stakes poker game. She's arrested by the FBI who believes she might be part of the Russian Mafia because of some of her players being in the organization. The movie is based off a true story and very fascinating.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch! Jessica Chastain kills it in the role of Molly Bloom. When I first saw the trailers, I was worried it would be too much like Miss Sloane (another of Chastain's roles). I really enjoyed Miss Sloane and thankfully Molly's Game is even better and might even be a better performance from Jessica Chastain. She's a rebel and independent. Her character is smart and incredibly confident, but Chastain has range in the movie as she can also be vulnerable whenever Molly gets betrayed or makes a mistake. Jessica Chastain owns this movie, but all the acting was phenomenal in the film. Idris Elba, Kevin Costner, Michael Cera, Chris O'Dowd, Bill Camp, Jeremy Strong, and so many others are great and play interesting and great characters.<br/><br/>The opening scene is perfect and encapsulates everything you should expect from the film. The scene is a skiing scene and has nothing to do with poker, but it details her brutal wipeout which ends her Olympic Skiing career and starts her down the path of having to find something else to do with her life and for a living. It also gives you a taste of the narration that would be throughout and gets you in the head of Molly Bloom's head. The editing is just as sharp as the narration in this scene as it is though out the movie. The sharpness can be confusing to some and those people might feel the film is all over the place, but it's clear these edits are meaningful and every scene has its place in the film.
Sorkin's writing and Chastain's performance makes this movie what it is and gives it a witty, snappy style I love.<br/><br/>I've never really been a fan of poker, but all the poker scenes and the story of how Molly grew her high stakes poker night was my favorite thing about the movie. The story about Harlan Eustice (played by Bill Camp) was especially heartbreaking. But the film isn't just about the ""rise and fall"" of Molly Bloom. It is also a character study and there is more internal turmoil with her past and why she does the things she does<br/><br/>The only nitpicky things I can say about the film is that there is one ice skating scene towards the end that looked strange and looked like bad green screen. Almost right after that scene, there is a part with Kevin Costner and Jessica Chastain and a three minute therapy session. I have mixed feelings about the therapy session, because I like that there is a purpose for Kevin Costner's character, but I also don't like how it wraps everything too nicely as if to explain everything to the audience.<br/><br/>

","Why fix what isnt broken?<br/><br/>This a very entertaining movie, told in a great way by one of the industries' top writers (also his debut as a Director). The fable behind it is a classic one - ambition and fame, fueled by Hollywood's bad side make an otherwise beloved ""character"" deviate from her previously strong moral compass.<br/><br/>But the way the real story how Molly Bloom ended up organising and running the world's most exclusive poker game is much richer than that - namely it dwelves a lot into how you can come back from your falls and how sometimes maintaing appearances is the most important thing<br/><br/>The style of going back and forth in time (from flashback to present day in a single room almost) is not new (see the Social Network written by Sorkin as well, directed by Fincher) but works brilliantly here.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain - not sure if her acting is that good, or if she was just amazingly casted as Molly Bloom here. One of the most believable interpretation of a real person I have seen in a while. Very good casting. Idris Elba puts on also a strong performance with strong dialogue.

Basically, this 'Rise and Fall' formula - the lead starts to do well until he's doing too well to stay unnoticed and things start to go wrong - was done before several times before ('Wolf of Wall Street', 'Casino') so there isn't much novelty here.<br/><br/>To sum it up, Molly's Game is a very good watch.

","Jessica Chastain at her Best! But, what else can we expect from this fine, focused, incredibly talented and alluring young woman? 
One gets the idea she's read the script one hundred times before ever stepping foot on set. She is more than prepared, she is more than expected, the long and the short of it is, she is a delight to watch in action! She always leaves me yelling ""Brava"" and ""Encore"" at the ending credits! 
And then you want to pair her with the incomparable Idris Elba? Bamm! I could watch him make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches while reading the local city ordinances and be entertained. And by that I'm not saying he's just eye candy; oh no! I'm saying he has the ability to make anything interesting! He dominates a scene in this movie where he pleads his case to procecutors with such conviction and passion you'd swear you see the blood dripping from his brow. I've been a huge fan for a long time and am always guaranteed a good watch whenever he stars in a project. 
The movie itself is amazing! Something that only happens in real life. Like the saying goes, ""You can't make this crap up""! There's a lot to learn in this film, not the least of which is the lengths the Gov't will go to to get what it wants - justice be damned!

"littleging12","8","3","5","14 March 2018"," She Got Game
","Aaron Sorkin (aka The Godfather of dialogue) teams up with the ravishing Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba to bring the crazy true story of Molly Bloom to the big screen. ""Molly's Game,"" based on the book of the same name, chronicles the underbelly of the most exclusive, illegal high-stakes poker game in LA. Sorkin, in his directorial debut, brings his signature fluid dialogue and exceptional writing. Jessica Chastain brings her signature acting chops and amps up the eye candy to glorious effect. Together, they produce one of the best written and most consistently engaging movies of the year.<br/><br/>""Molly's Game"" follows the trope of an ambitious and morally questionable person who gambles everything, builds an empire only to have it come crashing down upon them, writes a successful book about it, and even gets a movie adaptation. This has been done many times before, but what helps ""Molly's Game"" stand out is not only Sorkin's dialogue and Chastain's charisma, but the depth explored between Molly and her complicated father (played magnetically by Kevin Costner). One of the best scenes in the film is towards the end when Molly and her father have an intervention of emotional awakening. It may seem shoehorned in for some old-fashioned father daughter catharsis, but the intelligence and power of the scene are enough to overcome this. Molly's father confronts her on why she chose her path of running an illegal business and calls her out for wanting to control powerful men as a way to get back at him. This scene beautifully breaks down the enigma that is Molly Bloom and is like an orgasm of self-actualization.<br/><br/>The only real flaws of ""Molly's Game"" are the repetitiveness in the story - could've trimmed the runtime - and the dialogue is so fast it's as if it's sped up. Otherwise, Sorkin and company make what could have been another average based on a true story crime drama, into a marvelously written and acted, fast paced entertainment."
"kaptenvideo-89875","8","3","5","4 February 2018"," What happens when you mix ""Wall Street"" and ""Casino""? Something that a devoted movie fan must see!
","After a decades-long, successful writing career both on TV and for movies, it's kind of surprising that ""Molly's Game"" is Aaron Sorkin's first project as a director.<br/><br/>He has adapted a true-story-based book about a woman (Jessica Chastain) organizing high-stakes poker nights for the famous and wealthy into a delicious thriller which is a pure movie lover's entertainment, just as he surely planned it.<br/><br/>If you have seen any of the movies Sorkin has (co-)written previously - such as ""A Few Good Men"", ""The Social Network"", ""Moneyball"", or ""Steve Jobs"" - you can bet your sweet bottom that his directing debut follows the same route, and tries to be even more awesome.<br/><br/>Which is to say that you're gonna experience a high-profile, star-studded project, which is long, tense drama full of great performances and machine-gun-paced dialogue.<br/><br/>Think of ""Steve Jobs"" (the version starring Michael Fassbender, of course), add another 20 minutes to it, and you get the idea.<br/><br/>The need to deliver loads of fast dialogue as fast as possible will surely put to the test even the very best of the actors, but of course Sorkin has picked an able cast as expected.<br/><br/>The biggest pressure is put on Chastain's lovely shoulders, playing the titular character who has the most lines and also fills the voice-over duties.<br/><br/>She has already proven herself as one of the top actresses working in movies today, and does a great job here too. There are couple of moments when her delivery falters a bit and shows signs of fatigue. But these are minor flaws in otherwise gripping and powerful performance.<br/><br/>And it's all the more impressive if you know that Chastain and Elba had only 10 days to shoot together, and shot 45 pages in the first six days.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the supporting cast is strong and varied too, starting from always-super Idris Elba who is the main screen partner to Chastain, and including Kevin Costner, Jeremy Strong, Michael Cera, Chris O'Dowd, Brian d'Arcy James et al.<br/><br/>The biggest problems with ""Molly's Game"" might be Sorkin's insistence to feed us the same kind of fast, high-octane content for the whole 140 minutes - which may prove tiring for many, and that the story is just another version of ""greed is good"" / ""rags to riches"" blueprint introduced by Oliver Stone's classic ""Wall Street"".<br/><br/>Luckily, neither of them breaks the movie. Sorkin is actually very effective at playing with the tempo, to give us moments to breathe from the constant acting and dialogue ""fireworks"" - he didn't manage it as effectively in ""Steve Jobs"".<br/><br/>The second point - why still copy ""Wall Street"", a movie which has been countlessly copied for 30 years now - is down to my personal exhaustion from seeing this formula, I guess.<br/><br/>It doesn't make anything significantly worse, really. It's just that every movie using said bluepint seems to concentrate on events and leaving the character building to play the second fiddle.<br/><br/>We never get to follow a well-rounded, satisfying journey of the character's development from point A to B and C, how s/he is depends mostly on the current events.<br/><br/>It would feel like a lesser deficiency for 90 minute movie, perhaps, but these types of movies are usually long, 140 minutes in this case. What about Molly's personal life, for instance?<br/><br/>I am not saying preferring story-driven to character-driven necessarily ruins the experience. I am just saying that maybe there's a time to modify and update the blueprint a little, for a more demanding audiences used to higher quality storytelling dominatnig TV and streaming series. Sorkin should be able to do that, considering his background.<br/><br/>Usually, I feel hesitant to give a movie more than 7/10 for this approach, just because I've seen too much of this kind of thing to feel really excited about it.<br/><br/>But ""Molly's Game"" deserves more, if only for how it also plays like a good Scorsese style mafia movie. Which would be ""Casino"", of course, for Molly always lurking in the shadows and watching the poker from afar. For all the determination and power hunger, she really is a fascinating character.<br/><br/>""Molly"" doesn't seem to be an award juries' darling, gathering mostly nominations so far and losing both Golden Globe noms to ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"". There may not be big Oscar chances, is what I'm saying.<br/><br/>But it is still a very entertaining and attractive variant of ""greed is good"" type movies. I was hooked from the first minute, just like reading a good Stephen King novel."

","When I heard of a poker story with more than 7/10 on imdb, I had to check it out. Most poker movies are inaccurate and overdramatized with no clue as to how the game is really played.<br/><br/>Guess what. This movie is no different.<br/><br/>First, I cracked up laughing at Molly cracking up her spine at the ski slope.<br/><br/>My first facepalm came when Molly was talking about a guy folding the ""mathematically the best hand, which in poker is called the nuts"". For those of you who don't know, the ""nuts"" means the best possible combination of cards currently on the table. It's not the ""mathematically best hand"", it is absolutely the best hand possible according to the rules of the game. <br/><br/>If you've ever watched a few minutes of ESPN poker since 1998, you would know this. If you're writing a movie about poker, is it really acceptable to have this level of incompetence regarding the game itself?<br/><br/>I guess Aaron Sorkin doesn't play poker, or simply doesn't care. At this point I was ready to stop watching, but Idris Elba's character kept me engaged for a while longer.<br/><br/>Speaking of Idris Elba, let's talk about character motivation. The movie starts with Molly getting arrested. Then suddenly she's heading into Idris Elba's office, who doesn't want to help her, but then does. Why? Why is Idris Elba's daughter in his office? We don't know but Elba draws a triangle on a flatboard with Molly's name in the middle, so that proves something.<br/><br/>Then we learn your laptop takes backups of your text messages when you hook your phone up. I had to watch that part twice to check if I heard that correctly, but I guess these people live in a world where technology is magic and that sort of stuff happens.<br/><br/>Then we have a supposed poker pro completely going on manic life-tilt after losing ONE hand. Dramatic purposes surely, but a rational human being does not act that way, much less a poker pro.<br/><br/>When the one lady started collecting rake in the middle of a hand with illegal bet sizings, I stopped watching.<br/><br/>Boring overdramatized garbage. Go watch ""Rounders"" or that one Eric Bana-flick if you want a poker movie. They're not great, but at least you can watch without rolling your eyes."

"CinematicInceptions","9","4","8","13 February 2018"," Surprisingly inspiring story.
","As much as I liked Dunkirk, I think this may be my favorite movie of 2017. Aaron Sorkin was the thing that attracted me in the hopes I would get something that was almost as good as the Social Network. I expected it to be smart, brilliantly written, and deep in character. What I did not expect to get was an empowering story of an incredibly cool person. Honestly, I think Molly Bloom may be the coolest character of the year, which is saying something considering that she has Logan, Baby from Baby Driver, and Chris Washington and Rod Williams from Get Out as competition. <br/><br/>Both in the trailer and in the movie, it seemed like major plot points and even the ending was given away far too early on, leaving no room for suspense or mystery. But this turns out to not be true, because the movie is not so concerned with the ""what"" as it is with the ""why"". I think Molly even uses the term ""spoiler alert"" when discussing her book with Charlie. Despite this, the story is very well-paced and engaging to watch. <br/><br/>There were two things that really blew me away about the story of Molly Bloom (thus far). First is how much Molly takes pride in her work. There is no real end that she seemed to be trying to achieve from her poker game, it was just a life she enjoyed. She is firm in her way of doing things, running clean and legal games, which in itself makes her kind of the Don Vito Corleone of underground poker. Just the fact that she was able to keep her waitresses and employees from getting into any relationships with the players was impressive. Second is her refusal to use the names of the celebrities that she interacted with. There are so many people who probably would have given up the names, and it even sounds as though it would have been in Molly's best interests legally to give them. I just thought it was so cool that she would take the path less travelled in that situation. Were the story fictional I would have thought it was overly convenient that Molly was let off easy in the final court case, but since it is real it just made the movie that much better.<br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin's writing is not as impressive here as it is in the Social Network, but he proves himself as a more than competent director in his first attempt. I know that people get annoyed at the various ""Sorkinisms"", but I can't think of any of these that showed up outside of one character ordering an appletini. He doesn't have as much flashy writing or snappy dialogue, but it's still a great screenplay. He also gives us a very memorable opening scene, and brought an incredibly inspiring though flawed figure to life for audiences to root for. Even though I do not like Jessica Chastain as an actress, I thought that both she and Idris Elba gave great performances that should have been nominated for Oscars.<br/><br/>I would recommend that just about anyone see this. It's a pretty light R, nothing really disturbing or intense in any regard. But it is a story that you won't forget easily, and its a pretty entertaining and interesting ride while you're on it too. It may not be a masterclass on how to adapt a true story, especially because it's a recent true story, but other movies of its kind would do well to emulate it. It's hard sometimes to end a biopic of a person who is still alive, but I loved the way it was done here with the ""what will I do now?"" posed as almost a challenge rather than a question. Overall Rating: 8.5/10."
"CinemaClown","Null","4","8","4 February 2018"," Another Impressive Addition To Jessica Chastain's Acting Ouvre
","Helming the director's chair for the first time to translate his polished script on the film canvas, Aaron Sorkin commences his feature filmmaking journey on a rather impressive note, for Molly's Game is an incredibly smooth, shiny & sophisticated biopic that's engaging from the get-go, and is further bolstered by another smashing showcase from the ever-amazing Jessica Chastain."
"LnBK","7","4","8","3 February 2018"," Entertaining film with a lack of real poker knowledge
","Just saw 'Molly's Game' and I must say it's not bad. Fantastic acting by Idris Elba and Jessica Chastain made this film quite entertaining. There are a couple of reasons why this is not an 8 or a 9. One of these is Molly's character. I felt that her character wasn't 100% likable. It wasn't so easy to warm up to her. However, by the end, you do end up feeling something.<br/><br/>The other reasons have to do with the poker itself. I immediately noticed a few details in the way they show or explain the game. OK, I'm not talking about cheesy and unrealistic scenes like that final hand in 007: Casino Royale. I'm talking about some of the poker jargon Molly explains to the viewer. Most of these explanations are right, but there are some words that they explain incorrectly or use in a wrong way. One example is about ""the nuts"", which is a very popular poker term. Not knowing what this word actually means and then explaining it on the audience on the big screen shows me a laziness by the producer/director/writer to get it right. It shows to me that this was something they knew they could get away with since most of the audience won't know the truth anyway, so they didn't bother researching it properly. The scene I'm referring to specifically is one where a player tries excruciatingly hard to get another player to fold his hand. First of all, the way he tries is something you would only see in a movie. I, however like my movies to be as accurate and realistic as possible. I want to learn something when I watch them. It's simply a far too exaggerated attempt to get the guy to fold his hand. Meanwhile the narrator (Molly) is explaining how the player ends up folding 'the nuts'. Well, the nuts would be the absolute best possible hand that anyone could hold at that moment. Unless you are completely clueless about poker, you would not fold that hand. It would be like finding out you have the winning lottery ticket but then purposely flushing it down the toilet. It just doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>There was another poker scene where the pot was $2.1 million and the first guy bets $200k with the player after him raising $100k more. Again, that's not possible. To raise, you must raise at least double of what the previous player bet. That is a universal poker rule.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for this lack of knowledge about poker, the movie would get one or two points higher from me. Why put so much effort into making a decent movie and not get the little details right?"

","GRADE: B- <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A hand well played, but not a grand slam.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: The true story of Molly Bloom and the fast-paced world of gambling.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Molly's Game is a well directed, well acted, and well written film. Yet I was never emotionally drawn to any of the characters or their situations. Everyone is so into self-gratification and greed that nothing appears remotely real, though it is based on a true story.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain is Molly Bloom and she is perfectly cast and almost makes one care for this controlling and conniving survivor. Her character becomes the mastermind behind many gambling sessions from Los Angeles to New York. Molly uses her business savvy and sexuality to lure many men into her high-stakes card games. Wearing the tightest of dresses and showing off her wares in low cut cleavage revealing outfits, Molly is dressed to kill as she preys upon a rotating group of motley losers ranging from famous egotistic actors, rich businessmen, and Russian thugs. (Kudos to costume designer Susan Lyall.) <br/><br/>We meet the many crazy types of rich gamblers and their obsessions with instant thrills in the crazy world of poker. We also learn that Molly is one sharp player who is slowly being corrupted by the high rollers and their expensive habits. This will all lead to her arrest and trial on federal charges. Enter Idris Elba to her rescue as her fast-talking attorney (no one in this movie speaks slowly or at at normal pace).<br/><br/>Part of the reason the film mildly disappoints is the film's structure. It jumps from past events (Molly's adolescent years, her rise and fall as an Olympic athlete, her gambling acumen) to her central issue as a gamer who destroys others people's lives in order to earns millions. The flashbacks and forwards tell her autobiographical tale of wealth and corruption, but at the cost of any remote feeling for this rather shallow and selfish person. Much of the film (based on her memoir) seems like a con game for not only the gamblers, hoodlums, and patsies that crisscrossed her life but for the moviegoers too. The real world as depicted in this movie just is too unreal.<br/><br/>In his directing debut, Aaron Sorkin tries to keep the action moving and plays up the psychological ramification of this dangerous game but his message becomes heavy-handed and no matter his visual sleight of hand, with all of his fancy editing techniques and wordplay, it cannot hide the film's emptiness of any redeemable characters, including our lead heroine.<br/><br/>Mr. Sorkin's screenplay is literate and filled with quick talk and clever conversations, but it never builds to any satisfying conclusion. Scenes are riveting but then jarringly cut to another piece of Molly's life. The effect makes one becomes dizzy with all the exposition and convoluted storytelling. Also, there is a plot contrivance in the third act, that is so far-fetched and melodramatic (although it is well performed by Mr. Costner as Molly's strict father) that I was ready to hold 'em and fold 'em due to the absurdity of the sequence.<br/><br/>Another problem script-wise is that the film's colorful supporting characters are introduced, have their big dramatic moments, and then conveniently disappear from the narrative. The film focuses a tad too much on the title character without paying enough homage to its fine supporting cast which includes Bill Camp, Michael Cera, Brian d'Arcy James, Chris O'Dowd, Jeremy Strong, and the aforementioned Mr. Costner. Their strong ensemble work becomes mere second-place footnotes in Molly's non-stop voice-overs.<br/><br/>The lead acting, however, is aces. Ms. Chastain greatly impresses with her nuanced performance and her subtle acting choices which show us a strong but damaged character worthy of our attention. Her verbal sparring and rapid banter with Mr. Elba make their film teamwork rather special.<br/><br/>The film may not be a grand slam or one of a kind filmmaking, but it deals a somewhat winning hand. Just don't expect to win big when seeing Molly's Game."

","Poorly directed, insane amount of words, overall flat and boring with no insights of the poker gaming...the only thing that stands out is her cleavage..."
"Ed-Shullivan","10","5","11","18 February 2018"," Well done Molly! Well done! This film delivers the best hand in a Royal Flush!
","It is understandable that the producers would take some liberties with the film Molly's Game and portray Molly Bloom (played by Jessica Chastain) as more of a victim than a perpetrator of a crime(s). It is also understandable that it is near impossible to portray a real person's true persona on the big screen in only 140 minutes when their true story covers three (3) or more decades of actual living experiences. Suffice to say though that Mrs. Shullivan and I quite enjoyed the ups and especially the downs of Molly's game.<br/><br/>There were some great supporting performances such as Bill Camp's performance as the serious poker player Harlan Eustice. Molly's professor father Larry Bloom was played by Academy Award winner Kevin Costner, and her defense lawyer was played by the superb actor Idris Elba. Graham Greene played the sympathetic New York state Judge Foxman.<br/><br/>The film unfolds as Jessica Chastain who plays Molly periodically narrates her own life story to the film audience. Molly Bloom's narrative style works quite well in explaining Molly's lifestyle choice and how through osmosis and some strong female ambition she beats the men in a men's game/world. If not for a sympathetic judge Molly may have done some hard time in prison for her crimes at running an illegal card game that included a known criminal element at her tables in more than one state.<br/><br/>The film ran for 140 minutes and I never found it to be slow moving at all. Mrs. Shullivan felt that some of the poker terms could have been explained and I heard the same concern raised by other movie goers at the film end, but eh, how often in a medical drama film does a doctor provide his/her diagnosis to a patient using a medical term and no one even cares what it means. The actual euphoria that some players experience after winning a big pot was never included in the film. However the despair of an addicted poker player who cannot buy a winning hand was quite evident when seasoned actor Bill Camp (2016 The Night Of) who plays Harlan Eustice insists to Molly to keep extending him a further line of credit way above his ability to pay back Molly for his hundreds of thousands of dollars of poker debt extended in one night. The desperation and fear on Harlan's face I have witnessed many times on a losing gamblers face and it is not a pretty sight.<br/><br/>Molly's Game may have only shown the audience half of who Molly Bloom really was downplaying her drinking and drug addictions but it also portrays a woman who would not sell out any of the men whose lives would have been ruined even though none of them appeared in her corner when she could really have used both their financial and personal support when the Federal government was squeezing her for high profile names and critical information.<br/><br/>Molly's game draws a Royal Flush and is well worth seeing at least twice. A perfect 10 for 10."

"williampsamuel","8","2","3","16 March 2019"," A Tense Legal Drama and a Slick Poker Movie Rolled Into One
","Molly's Game is as smart and stylish as any movie now in theaters. Part poker movie, part legal drama, part biography, it tells a deeply intriguing story about a fascinating woman, and is all the better for being mostly true.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain gives a wonderful performance as Molly. She's smart, fierce, often funny, sometimes deeply vulnerable, and above all sympathetic. She makes you really root for a poker millionaire who by her own admission knowingly broke federal gaming laws. And why not? She lost her Olympic dreams to a freak accident, was repeatedly screwed over by her male associates, nearly killed by the mob, and after all that refuses sell out any of her clients for a better deal. The movie may work too hard to remind us too often that's she's a good girl who made some mistakes, but Chastain's performance sells it.<br/><br/>There's also some very good work by the supporting cast. Kevin Costner is cast well as Molly's insightful and supportive, if sometimes overbearing semi-estranged father. Idris Elba makes a real impression as her lawyer. Strait laced and honest to a fault, he makes a great foil to Molly's eccentric stubbornness. And it's his attempts to understand his seemingly irrational client that make her and her story unfold. And Michael Cera plays very strongly against type as Player X, a top Hollywood celeb and A grade jerk who plays not for money or love of the game but because he ""enjoys destroying peoples' lives.""<br/><br/>The screenplay and editing are superb as the acting. Molly's Game makes heavy use of flashbacks to slowly unwind its story, jumping from her career ending run on the slopes to her arrest, then back and forth from Molly's meetings with her lawyer to the games she ran. The structure really adds to the tension and keeps the audience guessing, while the frequent changes of scenery help it maintain a brisk pace. Writer-director Aaron Sorkin also does an excellent job of setting the tone. He knows when to be funny and when to be dramatic, or even scary. Surprisingly little time is actually spent in courtroom or talking to the feds, but the film still generates as much tension as the best legal thriller.<br/><br/>And the poker scenes are very good. Fast paced, boisterous, and featuring Molly's constant observations, they hold your attention and flesh out the minor characters without stealing the focus from the larger narrative. Watching this movie makes you feel like you almost know something about poker. A complete novice will learn just enough to keep track of the game while still being duly impressed with its speed and complexity.<br/><br/>At times there is a feeling at the back of your mind that maybe this is a somewhat sanitized version of events. I wonder if her adamant refusal to name names is purely a matter of principle, or from fear of retribution- legal or otherwise. I also find it somewhat hard to believe that someone of her smarts and sophistication wouldn't know to steer clear of big spending Russians from Brighton Beach. But then again, I suppose it's possible that someone on as many drugs as she was could make that mistake. And the fact that she didn't realize another regular was a federal informant lends credence to the idea.<br/><br/>Either way, there's no denying that this is a highly entertaining and very well-made film, and as true as anything from Hollywood ever is. If you're looking for something better than the average January fare and don't mind an R rating, then this is your movie."

And even if I didn't understand all the details fully as it was sometimes complicated to understand all the legal terminology, certainly for a guy like me that has a different language than English, it got all my attention during 140 minutes. A long movie that doesn't get boring, there are not much of those. The cast is well chosen and they all contributed to the good story. Jessica Chastain as Molly Bloom has the perfect physique to play that character. It seems that Idris Elba only plays in good movies so when I see his name I'm already excited to watch that movie. Molly's Game is an interesting story, even for people that have absolutely nothing in common with poker and rich people. Better than I expected."

It grabs your full attention almost immediately and doesn't let go. It's well worth watching.

","While the phrase ""based on a true story"" is usually code for ""Hollywood has run out of original ideas so we hired a cheap screenwriter to adapt a biography in order to save money and still have a shot at an Oscar because...wow...isn't life sometimes stranger than fiction"", Molly's Game is different.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin's feature Directorial debut kept me pretty well engrossed for its 2 hour and 20 minute runtime, largely because the Director employed a Screenwriter whose grasp of the craft of storytelling is evidenced in such works as the laugh-track-era-ending- Sports Night (1998 - 2000) as well as lesser known works such as The West Wing and The Social Network 2010).<br/><br/>Molly's Game cracks along at a fair old clip, distilling the decade long story of a one-time would-be Olympian-turned high-stakes underground celebrity poker Host facing criminal charges into a slick and pacey picture.<br/><br/>Yet with Sorkin's trademark fast-paced dialogue comes Sorkin's inevitable trademark schmaltz and hence the film's only real let down is a scene toward the end which amazingly is still not earned after approximately 2 hours of dense activity. This contrivance is perhaps a necessary evil of Sorkin's work given his enduringly refreshing interest in portraying professional and capable characters striving for greatness. More specifically, the titular protagonist of Molly's Game is a would-be gold medallist skier who, forced into a change of career due to a serious injury, cannily works her way up from glorified waitress to master manipulator through her intelligence, integrity and tenacity. The obligatory adversity Molly faces comes primarily in the form of her run in with the law, cue her adept yet initially sceptical advocate Idris Elba.<br/><br/>Necessary contrivances and aforementioned schmaltz aside, Molly's Game is a prime example of Writer / Director Aaron Sorkin's penchant for snappy dialogue and for exploring the mechanics of spheres most of us will never otherwise understand."

I don't know how much the movie veered from the actual truth but if it's accurate, Molly may be a great skier but her morals are diametrically opposed to her athletic ability.

Jessica Chastain is also great in this movie, the only ""problem"" is the writing... oddly how I just stated that the writing was great. Let me explain. Aaron Sorkin is a great writer, the only thing is that he has this same predictable craft in each of his movies that he writes. It's usually a biopic, some genius who has done something bad, meeting with their lawyer or something, and the story is told through the case. That's great. Worked once in ""The Social Network,"" which is why he won the Academy Award for that. People who don't really know Sorkin's style very well, since his movies are mainly released in a wide gap between one another, will just commend Aaron Sorkin's writing (and directing) for this movie, while someone like me, who's favourite movie is ""The Social Network"" found the same craft in his storytelling, which made it kind of predictable.

","Aaron Sorkin makes his directorial debut with Molly's Game, a film he also wrote, and if you've ever seen a film written by Sorkin you'll know that you're in for a film where the dialogue comes at you like bullets being sprayed from a machine gun. We've seen Sorkin write films about Facebook, baseball and Apple before but Molly's Game see Sorkin explore the world of poker to bring us the true story of Molly Bloom.<br/><br/>Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain) was known for running the world's most exclusive high-stakes poker game, an entrepreneurial path chosen after injury cut her dream of skiing for the American Winter Olympics team short. It's a path that led to interactions with the Russian mafia and Bloom becoming a target for the FBI, ultimately leading to her attempting to clear her name.<br/><br/>Right from the film's opening sequence, you know you're in for another special screenplay from Aaron Sorkin as Jessica Chastain narrates over the point where Molly Bloom had to give up her skiing career. It's fast-paced and full of a lot of nonsense however, it's the true mark of Sorkin's quality that he can fill it with so much nonsense but still have the audience feeding from the palm of his hand. <br/><br/>Sorkin's dialogue usually brings out the best in his leads and in Jessica Chastain, Sorkin really does have one of the best leading his film. Chastain has previously proved that she is a force to be reckoned with but this is her finest hour for me, driving Molly's Game forward with such ferocity and composure. It's not only Chastain who gets to shine mind, Idris Elba is as good as he's been in a long time as Molly's defence lawyer, Charlie Jaffey, the scenes the pair share being noticeable high points of the film. There's a host of supporting characters who all add different dimensions to the narrative, Kevin Costner as the authoritative father figure, Brian d'Arcy James as the totally inept poker player Bad Brad and Chris O'Dowd as Douglas Downey, the man who introduced Molly to the mob. <br/><br/>For a film that's so dialogue heavy, Molly's Game has a hefty runtime of nearly two-and-a-half hours however, thanks to the quickness of the screenplay and the quality of the performances, it's a film that absolutely flies by. Expect this to be a big player in the writing department come awards season."

","Aaron Sorkin's debut feature film lives and dies with a barnstorming Jessica Chastain, MOLLY'S GAME, based on the newsworthy true story of Molly Bloom, an athlete manquÃ©e who makes her name by organizing underground poker games for high-rolling punters (celebrities, businessmen, rich second-generation youngsters and mafias alike), first in L.A., then in New York, but cannot shuck off its consequences. <br/><br/>A preamble of how Molly ended her mogul-skiing career is peppered with Sorkin's trademark oratory in machine-gun velocity through Molly's voiceover, tinged with mockery and pique. Years of harsh training from her magisterial father Larry Bloom (Costner, sustains a stern look all the time until a cathartic confession to reconnect the family tie) - her rancor-fested relationship with whom will get its dilatory payoff near the end, goes down the pan because of a slight oversight, this lesson hits Molly hard and actually actuates her with a high-risk taking, opportunist ambition to prove her (pecuniary) worth, that she is not a loser, yes, thanks to American's putrid winner-takes-it-all motto.<br/><br/>Molly's subsequent road to accure lucre is totally contingent on her own acumen and moxie once she chances upon a money-spinner, she seizes upon it and aspirant enough to be her own boss when time fits, she is remarkably clear-minded to leave sex off the table, especially if we consider how inextricably it correlates with the life she inhabits, Sorkin clinically excises any sex-related content from Molly's rise-and-fall, and this conspicuity-by-its-own-absence is pregnant with many indications, not the least a lucid message to spurn the ubiquitous exploitation of gratuitous sex scenes in films, also it trenchantly points up the impersonal facade of Molly's enterprise, she works like a machine, circumspectly avoids any personal contact with those dastardly, well-minted gamblers, and its burning-the-cande-at-both-ends requisite also takes its toll in exacerbating Molly's drug addiction. Yet, at the end of the day, what she has seems so fragile and precarious if one of those arrivistes decides to leave her in the lurch just because he is offended by her ethical judgement or entangle her into legal actions when he is busted, although Molly is far with blameless in her own downfall, but to Sorkin's lights, it is this misogynous, ruthless frame-of-mind that victimizes her as a cog in the machine of profit-seeking capitalism and repugnant gambling jones. <br/><br/>Chastain is indeed at the top of her game, albeit there are tints of kinship between the protagonists in this and MISS SLOANE (2016), both head-strong, opinionated women wrestles with a toxically patriarchal society that constantly diminishes women's values, here the story is more self-oriented and self-sufficient in Molly's own vivid experiences, Chastain continues to be a beacon in today's female screen presentation and yoked to Sorkin's prolix script, she is nonpareil, particularly in those less wordy moments where she manages to convey Molly's own trepidation and perplexity to elicit our empathy albeit the unsavory nature of the life she chooses to lead. <br/><br/>Less rewarding is the two-hander between Molly and her lawyer Charlie Jaffey (Elba), where the latter feels strangely miscast with his towering stature going at odds with his apparently strained (albeit solicitous enough on the spot), short-breathed elocution, their chemistry never gives occasion to a legitimate boiling point, of which this overwrought convo-fest is much in need, by and large, MOLLY'S GAME is too avaricious in indulging its maker's ideology to its own good, however sagacious his intention is."

"jtindahouse","8","3","6","22 February 2018"," Only thing letting it down is some sloppy poker writing
","I'm quite the poker enthusiast myself so 'Molly's Game' was always going to be up my alley. It's very rare that I don't enjoy a movie based around the game ('Rounders' in particular is up there with my favourite films). That being said I can still judge the films critically (maybe even more so than usual) and find flaws where they lie. 'Molly's Game' isn't perfect but it's pretty damn good. <br/><br/>Firstly, the cast is in incredible form. Jessica Chastain gives one of her best performances to date. She plays the role perfectly and was entirely believable as the head of a poker ring. Not one member of the cast lets the production down though and that's why almost every scene is this movie is phenomenally strong.<br/><br/>The writing is also superb, for the most part. The film did have a very similar feel to 'The Social Network' about it. The dialogue is always powerful, entertaining and thought-provoking (and somehow all at the same time). There was also a great rhythm found. The story covers three timelines and intersects each one of them wonderfully.<br/><br/>The only thing letting the film down is the writing of the actual poker itself. It's very clear in certain scenes that Aaron Sorkin wasn't exactly sure of the game and its intricacies. Things like suddenly taking a rake halfway through a giant hand (there would be outrage), a player folding the nuts (the best hand possible in poker - which no player ever, regardless of how bad they are, would fold in Hold-em) and a raise by $200,000 when the bet was $300,000 (no game in the world would allow this), are just sloppy and really bring the film down. I read that Sorkin even went to the extent of having professional poker players as the extras because he wanted everything to be as authentic as possible. If you're willing to go to that extent then surely you get an expert to check over the writing of the poker scenes? Otherwise though, this is a very hard film to fault and one I thoroughly enjoyed watching. <br/><br/>Note: I would recommend reading up a little about the story and who the particular characters being referred to in the film are before you watch it. It adds a lot of enjoyment when you know."

","Molly's Game tells the story of a woman who runs a celebrity poker game until the cops nab her. But director Aaron Sorkin's focus is not nearly that narrow. While he shows the glitter and the seaminess of high-stakes poker, he offers up Molly, brilliantly played by Jessica Chastain, as a complex and multifaceted character, starting not with poker but with her attempt to make the Olympics.<br/><br/>Molly is fascinating; smart, prickly, and fiercely ethical. And, since this is a Sorkin script, she's also incredibly sharp and witty, especially when she spares with her lawyer, terrifically played by Idris Elba.<br/><br/>This is Sorkin's first film as a director and he hits it out of the park. The movie is stylish and riveting, and he does a beautiful job of explaining Molly's world, even putting graphs and arrows on screen to make sure you get it.<br/><br/>Funny, touching and engaging, Molly's Game makes it clear that Sorkin should direct all his scripts from now on."
"Hellmant","10","3","7","5 January 2018"," Any true film fan has to see this movie!
","'MOLLY'S GAME': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Acclaimed screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (one of my favorite writers) makes his directorial debut helming this crime drama, based on the memoir 'Molly's Game: From Hollywood's Elite to Wall Street's Billionaire Boys Club, My High-Stakes Adventure in the World of Underground Poker', by Molly Bloom. The film stars Jessica Chastain as Bloom, and it was also scripted by Sorkin (who's also Bloom's favorite writer). It costars Idris Elba, Kevin Costner, Michael Cera, Jeremy Strong, Chris O'Dowd, Bill Camp, Brian d'Arcy James and Graham Greene. The movie tells the true story of Bloom's experiences running the most exclusive high-stakes poker game in the world (in Los Angeles and New York), before being arrested by the FBI, and her legal battle against those charges. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards (Best Screenplay and Best Actress - Drama). I was absolutely blown away by the movie! <br/><br/>Molly Bloom (Chastain) was a champion skier, who had serious relationship issues with her father (Kostner), who was also her trainer, and she was also seriously injured doing the sport. She later went to work for an abusive real estate agent (Strong), who introduced her to the world of high-stakes poker. Bloom became so good at her job there, that she later started running her own game, and then quickly became caught up in all the dangers of it. She was ultimately arrested by the FBI, and turned to lawyer Charlie Jaffey (Elba) for help. Bloom tells her story to Jaffey, as we all watch. <br/><br/>The film is so quickly paced that it was nearly impossible for me to even keep up with it (the dialogue at least), especially at the beginning. I still absolutely loved it though. The characters are so well developed, especially Bloom, and Chastain is amazing in her performance (once again). She's also becoming one of my very favorite actors (as a person, and as a talented movie star). The film is not only a blast to watch, but it's also extremely touching at times. I think I cried tears like 3 or 4 times during it. It's nearly a perfect film in my opinion, and one of the best of 2017. Sorkin also impresses as an amazingly talented director here too, and I'd put the film at least in the same league as 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' and 'A FEW GOOD MEN' (two of my all time favorite movies, that are also written by Sorkin). Any true film fan has to see this movie!"

"lavatch","Null","2","4","11 April 2018"," ""Molly Dubin Bloom is My Name!""
","In the bonus segment of the DVD of ""Molly's Game,"" the real Molly Bloom appears on camera to describe her life as ""a story about 'going for it' and succeeding in a man's world."" But the filmmakers went further to develop a character of impeccable ethical stature, whose photo should be on a Wheaties box instead of a police mug shot.<br/><br/>The dynamic Molly Bloom who appears in the bonus segment is dynamically portrayed in the film by Jessica Chastain. The film takes much license with the biography of Miss Bloom to paint a picture of what writer-director Aaron Sorkin calls ""someone who does the right thing."" <br/><br/>The moral preening in the film was far too excessive and smarmy. After a freak accident on the ski slopes that ruined a bid for Olympic gold, Molly went to Los Angeles where she became proficient in operating high-stakes poker games, catering to wealthy and powerful men and serving as stepping stone to the ruin of several compulsive gamblers. <br/><br/>As an athlete, Molly's specialty was mogul skiing; in her second career, she was attracting mogul men to the poker table. Was Molly's goal only to make money? Or did she derive a subliminal pleasure from the power she exerted over men?<br/><br/>The film descends into smarmy pop psychology in Molly's troubled relationship with her domineering and abusive father, a pompous psychologist, who performs a jaw-dropping three-question Freudian therapy session on his daughter. It is never quite clear if Molly is the abused woman, victimized by callous men, or if she is the abuser, exploiting men's weakness for gambling. At one key juncture in the film, Molly refers to herself as Circe, the Greek goddess who turned men into swine.<br/><br/>There was an interesting dynamic between Molly and her slick defense attorney. But, as performed, the dialogue was delivered at such a fast pace that it was difficult to believe that two people could engage in such non-stop banter without at some point falling into a state of collapse. Much of this dialogue sounded ""scripted."" A fine turn of the phrase from Winston Churchill was squeezed into the dialogue, as his wisdom is recalled in ""the ability to move from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm."" This tenacity may have belonged as well to Molly Bloom, but she needed a pharmacy full of drugs to sustain her level of enthusiasm. Somehow, she was able complete online courses in astronomy while million-dollar poker pots were being exchanged on her table. Was this due to her ""enthusiasm"" or to the rush from the drugs?<br/><br/>The most frequently produced play of Arthur Miller, ""The Crucible,"" figured in the drama of Molly Bloom. The attorney's young daughter is studying ""The Crucible,"" which ends with John Proctor going to the gallows during the Salem witch trials in order to salvage his ""good name."" The film tries to draw a twenty-first century analogy with Molly Dubin Bloom's commitment to preserving her good name, which apparently is worth more to her than an Olympic gold medal. But despite the good performance by Chastain, the film's feel-good message was hollow and empty."

","While I didn't particularly like the structure or length of the film, Jessica Chastain's performance was enough for it to be a definite success. I was expecting this to play out like a corny sports movie but its actually quite authentic with little to no glamorising of Bloom herself and poker games that are actually portrayed realistically- quite a rarity in Hollywood movies. I would certainly have preferred a more fluid telling of the story, with less interlacing of the two timelines and a shorter runtime. However, thanks to excellent supporting performances from Idris Elba and Kevin Costner, many of the extraneous scenes were perfectly enjoyable. I did find the overall tone of the film to be a little ostentatious but there is more than enough substance to make this a fairly memorable experience."
"classicsoncall","8","0","0","22 April 2020"," ""I bet heavy on the favorite.""
","The thing that fascinates me about the life of Molly Bloom is how virtually inconsequential things in and of themselves can have such a major impact on one's life and career. I'm thinking of the little sprig of pine needles that upended her Olympic trial run for which she was a virtual shoo-in. Then there was the jerk Dean Keith (Jeremy Strong) who hired her, and despite his irritating persona, introduced her to the world of high stakes poker gambling which the feisty woman took as a challenge and ran with. Having hung on long enough to learn the game and the major celebrity players involved, Ms. Bloom (Jessica Chastain) eventually struck out on her own and became an even larger force in the gambling world.<br/><br/>I've seen Jessica Chastain in a couple of other films (""Zero Dark Thirty"", ""The Zookeeper's Wife""), but never this glamorous or gorgeous. You could understand how the real Molly Brown, who was just as beautiful, would have become a magnet for the high stakes players who showed up at the Cobra Lounge and later, her own digs after the break with Player X (Michael Cera). With a high degree of integrity and personal discipline, Brown built a mini-empire that brought her wealth and made her name a household word in an underground economy.<br/><br/>I'd have to agree with a handful of other reviewers here who comment on the length of the picture, playing out a bit longer than necessary by what felt like some repetitious events in Molly's experience. There's also the poker lingo that blows by so quickly you'll wonder just what the heck the voice over narration was talking about; I watched with captioning and it still left me in the dust. There was a great poignant scene later in the movie in which Molly faces her demanding father (Kevin Costner), the source of her early anger by pressuring a total insistence on perfect performance. Up until then, Costner was a minor figure in the story, but in that one scene he took a miniscule role and made it profound."

It's not just any poker game, but one with movie stars and tech big wigs, the cool kids of LA.
Reading some reviews I was shocked to read some think Chastain's acting is great. To me she seems to read her lines way too fast, have a sort of adult version of a valley girl accent, and doesn't act anything like a real person. Of course she is always delivering quips and quotes that people don't come up with sans a team of writers, and has the knowledge of a lawyer with only an undergrad degree in Poly Sci.
The script also gets real ""woke"", ie she has all the wisdom and integrity, and the guys are mostly corrupt, dumb , chauvinistic and bossed around by the women.Then it devolves into a message piece :men are all cheating immature pigs who need to listen to their wives, devote all their time to their daughters, and probably not hang out playing poker or doing anything for themselves.
Everything about the script seems fake : game w all billionaires and stars, another with all women who are 9s and 10s who are expert poker players, a Heidi Fleiss of poker games that will give a tell all but , of course naming no names of anybody alive.

To understand her motivations. It works, in the end, but that doesn't change the fact that it gets tedious in the first half. The use of voice over doesn't help (does it ever?).

Because she's the only main character, it's a problem.<br/><br/>The story is good but I didn't feel it was as epic as the movie tried convince us it was. This is not really about the intricacies of the corrupt police, political and judicial system allowing the mobs to control and fight over the criminal underworld. It wasn't about foundations and corporations working as money laundering facades nor it was about the fraudulent world of finances (""The Big Short""). Because the story focuses on her, something that could've been epic, gets smaller. The movie tells us is big, but we don't see big.<br/><br/>About the performances, Idris Elba is also really good as Molly's moral lawyer, and Kevin Costner makes everything of the few minutes of screentime, helping the movie to land Molly's emotional arc. The score is kind of forgettable. The editing questionable (like I said, some scenes felt boring but in theory they shouldn't have been).<br/><br/>The movie is fine, and it's not a waste of time nor it is knowing about this story, but I just can't forget the boring first half and the not so great execution of the second part."

","Considering that the real Molly was touring and giving motivational talks and, in each interview with her, and there are a quite a few, she tells her story to her interviewers, which I have absolutely no problem with, however, the movie says it all AGAIN... NARRATES the same stuff that the real Molly tells us at TED talks, interviews etc. Now why on earth would you make a movie on an interview/TED talk model? Frankly, what ranked the 6 stars was the excellent cast, that's about it. It is a FASCINATING true life story and deserves something a little more intriguing as a movie IMHO. At first the narration was ok but then it got so bogged down at the too-long mark that even the great actors couldn't salvage those dull, over long sections. The really interesting stuff began at the near-end, with her lawyer etc. I think the very beautiful and brilliant real life Molly was very well portrayed here but the direction or something was a bit dull witted considering the cast that its working with."

It is not easy seeing how sleazy and soul-shrinking is the world of men (all men) who have more money than sense and put too much value on adrenalin rushes. What a waste of time and money.

","Molly's Game tells the true story of Molly Bloom, played by Jessica Chastain. An Olympic class skier who found herself running the world's most exclusive high stakes poker game and became a target for the FBI.<br/><br/>Molly's Game is the latest script and first-time directorial effort from Hollywood legend, Aaron Sorkin. Adapted from the book about the real-life adventure of Molly Bloom this is certainly a film trying to capture the success and imitate Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street (2013). As much can be seen in the tone and direction of the trailer. So does it succeed? In short, no.<br/><br/>Ironically, given that for his first time Sorkin steps up to the directors' chair - it's the script that stands out as the weakest link. Throughout the film, I noticed terribly clichéd moments, written as though Sorkin didn't care about his clever, engaging dialogue from previous works. Which has to be said is still prevalent in this film, despite the unfocused script there is still a great deal of the engaging and sharp dialogue that we have come to expect from Sorkin. Fortunately, he does a good job of directing the film, as mentioned taking a lot of ques from Wolf of Wall Street but not quite matching the character study that Scorsese filled the debauchery fuelled escapades of Jordan Belfort with.<br/><br/>Sorkin instead directs a very thin layered approach to Molly Bloom, giving us some 'armchair psychology' as to why Molly Bloom is the way she is, frankly it almost acts as though the audience will eat this up as smart intelligent storytelling. Sorkin furthers this insult with the uninspired soundtrack choices, scenes such as the film explaining why Molly is the way she is, has these blatant scores to inspire emotion, but they just come across as panderingly silly.<br/><br/>Sorkin does do a good job of juggling and pacing the movie, balancing a film that is one part biopic, one part poker movie and one part court drama (which it somehow manages not to be outstanding in any aspect), remarkably though, it all feels like one movie, one story (despite its unfocused nature) and for the most part, this is an engaging tale. It's plenty funny and the cinematography does a good job of always having Molly as the focus, each shot, no matter where she is in it, it's as though the camera is always on her. Some of this can be attributed to Jessica Chastain who is compelling and eye-catching as Molly. Idris Elba also acts like a breath of fresh air for the film when he is on-screen, often adding a much-needed vibrancy to the scenes he is in.<br/><br/>Sorkin does an acceptable job of juggling the different facets of Molly's Game, pulling out fresh visual ideas and a 'golden age Hollywood' style of storytelling, sadly not always to its credit and ironically it is his script that has suffered. Unfocused and occasionally lazy, this is not Sorkin's writing at it's best but it makes for a decent, engaging tale of Molly Bloom's adventure into the exclusive world of large stake poker games."

Then the FBI arrests Molly and she needs a lawyer and gets Charley Jaffey (Idris Elba).<br/><br/>This is some good true story and the real winners in here are the dialogues between Charley and Molly, who together form an unbeatable team with their quick dialogues and comebacks.

"TheMovieDiorama","8","2","5","24 February 2018"," Molly's Game is an energised directorial debut from the best of the best when it comes to screenplay writing.
","Aaron Sorkin. The master, the legend, the myth...! He has devised some of the best scripts that film has to offer, it was only a matter of time before he puts down the pen and picks up a camera. He played his cards at creating a biopic on Molly Bloom, a professional skier whom, after an accident, becomes embroiled in the rich and dangerous lifestyle of hosting private poker games. An array of wealthy billionaires, movie stars, sports legends and even professional poker players were the competitors during Molly's hosted games. This is frenetically paced, I could feel the energy surging from the script to the characters. Instantaneously the film starts, rather frantically I must say. Bombarded with narration, quick cuts and an assortment of images to illustrate Molly's life before the poker games. Found it slightly too jarring with too much information being assimilated in a short amount of time. But once the title smashed its way on screen, I was in. My mind was ready and I thoroughly enjoyed this. It is a meticulously crafted biopic integrating three different timelines of Molly's life: her childhood detailing the difficult bond with her father, when she was running the poker games and how she got herself involved and finally two years later when the FBI warrant for her arrest. The consistent switching of these pivotal moments in her life keeps the pacing rapid and feeling fresh. The script is sharp, concise with a sarcastic undertone where the characters just bounce off each other like a beautiful game of tennis. Jessica Chastain, again, proves she is one of the best actresses working today. She controlled every scene just from her presence...that's without her even speaking a word of Sorkin's poetry-like script. Idris Elba also shines with a particular outstanding scene defending Molly against the prosecutors. Some of the scene transitions felt basic, consisting of just fading to black. But what an accomplished debut! Very enjoyable."
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","2","5","21 February 2018"," Jessica's Game
","It was a good film thanks to a great screenplay but Aaron Sorkin and solid performances. This marks also Sorkin's directional debut and you can see that he learned a lot from his pal David Fincher. The style is similar but often comes across as a poorer copy. Still for a first time direction effort it was fine enough. Jessica Chastain is very good in the role of Molly Bloom and delivers one of her best performances of the last years. Very solid, condoled and to the point. A character that fits her usual choice of role quite well. but because of that comes up less inspired. Idris Elba was good as well, he had a couple of really great scenes and played his character very appealing and sympathic. I really loved Kevin Costner and wish he had had more scenes, a great performance, one of his finest for sure.
The score was good and the film had a nice cinematography. The editing was often a bit too quick for my taste, it really didn't fit the rest of the film and it could have been a little shorter, but that is really complaining on a high level as the film in general was very good, especially if you like Poker but not only because of that as it is also an interesting character story and biopic in general."
"CineMuseFilms","6","2","5","14 February 2018"," an lightweight expose of the seedy world of high-stakes gambling
","A film does not need a message to be meaningful, but it can feel lightweight without one. Even a big-name star and a brisk plotline provides little weight in a story about illicit money and a gambling queen's efforts to keep ahead of the law. That, in essence, is the plotline of Molly's Game (2017), a fast-moving tale that struggles to say anything of value.<br/><br/>Based on real events and published in her 2014 memoir, Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain) was a world-class skier whose Olympic aspirations were shattered through injury. An overbearing father and over-achieving brothers means that failure is not an option, so Molly finds her way into the company of a high-stakes gambling den operator. She becomes the den manager and glamour bait for high-profile and high-wealth players. The intricacies of poker playing become interwoven with the narrative, and we see in detail gaming rules and techniques that few will have heard of. Molly is super-bright and learns quickly, making enough money to set up her own luxury-class den in opposition. Her success and notoriety draw the FBI and the Russian mafia into her orbit, and she faces prison after publishing a tell-all book. With the help of top lawyer Charlie Jeffrey (Idris Elba) she fights to restore her seized assets.<br/><br/>If the film was fictional, you could read it as a high-stakes thriller, a feminist tale, or a hustler's mockumentary. However, as it is based on Molly Bloom's real career, it becomes a voyeuristic expose of the seedy world of illicit gambling, money laundering and racketeering that is inhabited by the rich and famous. What is not clear is why this film was made at all. For those interested in professional poker, it no doubt has much to offer. Molly's character has few redeeming qualities except being smart and ambitious, and she outshines every male around her. She is also clinically ruthless and emotionally distant, making her character difficult to embrace. Chastain plays all these characteristics to perfection.<br/><br/>Finding a worthwhile message in this film is a challenge. Perhaps it's about a woman's mastery of a man's world, using both brains and conspicuous sexuality. Or perhaps it is found in the film's closing minutes when, with condescending masculine authority, Molly's lawyer says ""you're my daughter's role model, and I'm OK with that"". He may be; many are not."

","Jessica Chastain's performance in Molly's game has once again solidified her as a very solid actress. I genuinely enjoyed and related to her presence throughout the film in the way that she portrays the character of Molly Bloom. Chastain was able to show so many sides to the character, while wearing a sort of facade from the beginning of the filma nd allowing audiences to slowly peel back and unveil her characters until we really get an in depth look at her childhood and the events and relationships that made her what she is today. <br/><br/>Along with Jessica Chastain's brilliant performance which was amazing we also got a very powerful performance from Idris Elba's Charlie Jeffery who showed so many dimensions as character, from loving father to stern lawyer.<br/><br/>What I really liked about Molly's game is the way in which it told the story in such an intriguing but light way, while the subject matter is somewhat of a more serious one the film panders to the entertainment aspect of gambling and that really added to the narrative flow. Making it a lot more accessible and intriguing but also a lot more entertaining<br/><br/>While Molly's game isn't groundbreaking in the sense of dealing with deep or sophisticated subject matters, it told a good story, had great acting and brilliant pacing. While, also dealing with the psychology of such a character of Molly Bloom and her interpersonal relationships adding a much needed layer of icing atop the cake. A perfect example of a well told story, told in a way that services the theme and adds value to the film."
"rogier-86785","8","2","5","3 February 2018"," Fascinating story that is surprisingly accurate
","Carried by Jessica Chastain her narrative voice-over, Molly's Game is a surprisingly accurate depiction of celebrity poker matches and their dicey links to criminal activity. It paints a fascinating picture of what happens when very rich and very famous people meet to butt heads in a game of skillful bluffing and all the power plays that come with that. And to think it's all based on a true story. 
My score of 8 is lower than my gut feeling is telling me. However, in terms of speed of narrative and certain choices of filming it wasn't perfect. Mind you, it was good, the opening scenes even excellent and quite a feet for Sorkin his debut as a director instead of only screenwriter. 
His roots as a script-wizard are very clear though: the script is almost flawless. It's just that the execution can leave you wanting for a little bit more speed and maybe left or right a few tweaks to the performances. That said, great movie with Idris Alba, Kevin Costner and of course Jessica Chastain showing sparkles. A must see!"

","Molly's Game is a biographical drama film based on the memoir of the same name. Written and directed by Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing, A Few Good Men, The Social Network), it is a solid directorial debut from the veteran screenwriter and yet another interesting look into the mindset of a real-life individual.<br/><br/>In the early 2000s, Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain) an aspiring skier, dreams of making it big in the 2002 Winter Olympics. After sustaining a serious injury to her spine, Molly decides to take a year off and move to Los Angeles. While there, Molly lands a job as the office manager for a real estate developer named Dean (Jeremy Strong), who also holds underground poker games with many rich and famous individuals. Molly helps Dean out by appealing to his poker players and in doing so, makes large sums of money from tips alone. Eventually, Dean feels that Molly has become too independent from him and he fires her, leading her to decide to run her own underground poker games.<br/><br/>Right from the get-go, the film draws its audience into the world of its titular character. The rapid-fire dialogue, a trademark of Sorkin's style, immediately helps us get to know Molly's motivations and aspirations in life and what makes her so intriguing in the first place. Sorkin's directorial style is somewhat reminiscent of Edgar Wright, with its quick-cut editing and brisk pace and his approach to telling this story in particular feels like how Martin Scorsese did with The Wolf of Wall Street. Jessica Chastain gives one of the best performances of her career as Molly Bloom. Her delivery of some of the film's best lines is perfectly on point and feel natural coming from an actress like her. Idris Elba is also worth noting as Molly's lawyer, Charlie Jaffey, a man equally as fascinated by her life story as the audience itself.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10"

But despite the solid cast and the presence of Sorkin, this film seemed to have clear quality gaps, with the occasional feeling of an 80's TV movie.<br/><br/>Chastain was superb throughout, although often shot as if the director really wanted Julia Roberts. She plays the sharp hostess, the sympathetic ear and the foil to the boys with money. And yet the script often just fails her. Intelligence is often reduced to stupid wikipedia quotes, and the indie style sidetracking didn't really work. At one point she almost said 'I know Kung Fu'<br/><br/>Idris Elba finally gets his first serious role for ages, and the film's clinching speech, but he has a couple of scenes which simply needed to be reshot. He doesn't yet display the timing needed for light comedy or the touch for those early two way sizing up parts.<br/><br/>The photography was surprisingly poor; combined with indifferent post processing that made it look inferior to most Netflix productions. If you have sports shots, you need sport photography - which was evidently missing. They used some of the classic 'bag of money' shots, and the god life going out of control fast sequences, but there were many energy sapping loose scenes between. Much of the set design was oddly second rate. I don't understand why this should be. <br/><br/>Some of the scenes just lacked chemistry; Chastain doesn't always work well with others. This sometimes reflected Molly Blooms slightly fish out of water naivety, but sometimes not.<br/><br/>All in all this was an entertaining piece, with some fun bit parts, that just should have been treated better."

","Molly's Game has the window dressing and the star power to bring you in but what I found most alluring was the story. How did this woman navigate her way to this post? Why did she go to jail for it? How did she figure out a way to dodge the larger legal complications? The trailer sets up all those questions. I think the movie capable answers each of them. I found the plot to be engaging but I was waiting for the big bombshell to drop and other than 1 violent confrontation, I didn't feel like I got that. I was expecting one of those divine inspiration moments for either Molly or Charlie that would give them the ability to win the case but that never came. I credit the movie for subverting those expectations, but it disappointed me a little. <br/><br/>Although this is a character piece, a large amount of the movie is spent around a poker table. I enjoy poker and I appreciated that the movie showed different angles on the game. How important the psychological aspect of both the game and gambling addiction are focal points that were solid choices. They also talked about different styles of play (aggressive vs. non-aggressive, skilled vs. unskilled) and how difficult it is to keep track of high stakes games like that (Molly's continual problems with collateral and managing debt were intriguing). I liked most of the scenes that were centred on the game and they were appropriately intense. <br/><br/>Other than the actors, the other biggest star in the movie is Sorkin's dialogue. It's also his directorial debut but he does a solid job at directing and an excellent job in screenwriting. He just has a way of making every sentence sound like someone has a beautiful mind with a soul of a poet. That last comment sounds cheesy, but I never walk away from a movie where he worked on the script without feeling the need to trumpet that the guy has a gift. Molly's Game is another one of those projects that he delivers and has those same strengths.<br/><br/>I saw this with a friend and we were talking about Chastain's performance as Molly Bloom. The conclusion we came to was that she was great in the lead role but you expect that from her. It would honestly be weirder if she wasn't and I can see why she's garnering so much praise for this. I echo that and the same sentiment for Idris Elba as Charlie Jaffey. His accent is a little off but when he and Chastain are together is when the movie shines its brightest. They both throw themselves in completely and especially at the end, they have a great rapport. The movie centres around them so much that the rest of the cast capably performs around them, but they are relegated to the background. Michael Cera has a nice slimy role as Player X, he was fun to watch. I also liked Bill Camp in his small bit as Harlan. Kevin Costner is a good actor, but he was undercut by his role as Larry Bloom. He's a stereotypical too serious father until the ending twist (which I'll touch more on later).<br/><br/>The biggest criticism I have for this movie doesn't come till the movie has almost wrapped up. Molly's relationship with her father is difficult and they are shown through flashback fighting with each other constantly. But at the end, her relationship with her father is almost magically reconciled in a way that I didn't find very believable. It minimizes her struggles to gain ground in this seedy world of egotistical people down to having ""daddy issues."" Now that may be Molly's story, but the movie also didn't have to make it seem so abrupt and I thought it undercuts the gravity of her situation. Plus, her dad being a decent human being for a few minutes doesn't makeup for him being a complete jerk for most of her life.<br/><br/>I was really stoked to see this movie, I looked at it as a wrap up for the 2017 theatre going schedule and it had a lot of elements that interest me. This movie is never bad, and it rarely misses but I still thought it was a tad underwhelming. It was good, but I thought it could have been even better. But on the other hand, Chastain and Elba could and should be considered for awards season, Sorkin's script is a polished gem, and you can't deny wanting to see how Molly gets out of this pickle. Check this out at the local Cineplex but you don't need to sprint to the theatre to see it."

-Jargon Heavy<br/><br/> Molly's game is a drama that remained entertaining and engaging from start to finish. Its success comes in the presentation of the movie, tying past and present together in a format that keeps the movie pushing towards the goal of describing Molly's consequences of her actions and in a pace, that does not drag. This presentation has strong writing for the film to spring off on, and such a strong foundation made the job of bringing her story to life to an easier level. Yet the acting, primarily by Chastain and Elba, is the royal flush of the game, the former doing the heavy lifting to bring this role to life. All of the emotion is packed in this performance, crafting a character that will inspire and empower the audience for at least the first ten minutes post showing. 
 Certainly, this movie isn't the most original tale to come to Hollywood's corner, but that doesn't stop the studios from fluffing up the character somewhat. I think this is a more realistic biography, but one can't help but question the integrity of the film staying true to Molly's tale. Outside of that, the film primarily needed some tightening up of the scenes and cutting out some fluff to reduce the run time. Throw in some better definitions of the various jargon involved in this gambling world and you would have smoothed out some of the rough edges I had with this movie. 
 Molly's game lacks a lot of the flash, bang, boom that modern cinema has, but in its place, is an engaging, realistic tale that is a beautiful portrayal of this woman's life. It may not be the most exciting tale, but it's a drama I loved because it cut much of the overdramatic moments out and kept it at an exciting pace with its dynamic presentation. I strongly encourage many to go see this film in theaters, but definitely scope it out when it hits the rental places in three months. If you are really looking for a movie that portrays the talented part of Hollywood, check this movie out then."

","The central character is smart and beautiful and who better to play such a person than Jessica Chastain. She is stunning and keeps your attention throughout. There's a lot of dialog and some times the dialog could have been shortened to make the speeches and crucial dialog more meaningful when they take place. There is such a thing as too many words in a movie. <br/><br/>It's an interesting if not very appealing look at the kind of horrid people in high stakes poker.

They carry their characters off the screen and into your head almost perfectly.<br/><br/>I can't speak to the artistic license that may or may not have been taken, but it is one great piece of story telling.

","The film tells its story well enough, mostly due to the script, editing and breakneck delivery of dialog from Jessica Chastain. Along with Idris Elba, Chastain holds the interest of the audience with great portrayals that feel real and well grounded. However most of the other elements of the movie become mundane and hold nothing special. Still, this is an interesting story and a fine film to watch on a weekend when there's not much else to do."

"andrewmerritt-31652","10","1","2","18 January 2019"," Best movie of 2017
","Molly's Game stars Jessica Chastain, Idris Elba, and Kevin Costner. Jessica Chastain plays Molly Bloom an Olympic skier who went from competing in the Olympics to running underground poker clubs that attracted the attention of the FBI. At first when I heard about this and watched the trailer I was thinking to myself that this was cool how an Olympic athlete went on to run her own poker clubs and that was what attracted me to this movie. And from the very first bit of the movie, I was mesmerized by how incredible how this actually happened. The script and the dialogue are top notch that I forgot I was watching a two and a half hour movie because of how intelligent it was. Jessica Chastain is incredible and delivers a great performance and she narrates her life from when she was in the Olympics to hosting her own poker clubs to her encounter with the FBI. I want to compare this to Goodfellas, which is also a great movie by the way, but instead of Henry Hill we have a sort of Henry Hill character here. But instead of him becoming a gangster we have her working at two jobs she hates to become a successful businesswoman. If I could pick a flaw it would be half way towards the end which went on for a little bit long, but no so much that I was checking my watch every five minutes. Even those family moments didn't bother me at all as we learn a brief history about her life. Everything about this movie fascinated me that I didn't care what was true or not because I wanted to watch a movie that entertained me and that's exactly what it did. And in the end I will say that this is definitely one of top films of 2017."

Sorkin is known for his edgy, smart, fast-paced lines but he fell too in love with his own voice in this one. The characters - sometimes ridiculously so - talk the same way; we can hear the same person speaking through each of them.<br/><br/>But enough with the bad, the actors were fantastic and the true story itself is unbelievable.

I was reading reviews on another film Jessica was in ( I've never seen her in anything) saying she's a horrible actor. I have to disagree. She isn't an over the top actor but a very fine one indeed. I thought all the performances were great. Isra was excellent. The narrating, in the beginning did kind of get in the way of immersing yourself in a scene completely and was a bit confusing. But I enjoyed it and it became less of an issue as the movie progresses. Yes people it's a true story but a movie. Could tearing it apart for not being exactly like the real story.

"Camoo","9","1","2","16 December 2018"," Writing that jumps from the page
","Sorkin has always been a stellar writer, but in recent years he has honed his craft so precisely in biopics that the next sensible step would of course be to try his hand at directing his own script. Thankfully, he's now proven that he knows what he's doing behind the camera just as well as he knows how to write a gripping scene.<br/><br/>And scene after scene in Molly's game jumps off the page like the best scripts do. The actors all seem to be relishing in the freedom of strong characterization and dialogue that they are completely aware will land as intended. Acting out a Sorkin script must be a wet dream for many who dedicate themselves to the craft.<br/><br/>Molly's game follows a somewhat classic arc: a character rises in the underworld, gaining power through deceit and immorality, until things start to crumble and fall in pieces around them. In this case, the character is Molly, played wonderfully by Jessica Chastain in her strongest role to date; a strong, wily woman who carries the film on her own shoulders like the wind is on her back.<br/><br/>I also love a film where you learn something about a process you never thought much about before. The mechanics of how underground poker games are run are so well described in Molly's Game, that it anchors the film into something true and gripping, and we are engrossed because we are learning something as well as being wildly entertained by the scripts oratorical pleasures, (and some excellent and surprising casting decisions.)<br/><br/>I appreciated this film a lot, for its commitment to characters, plot and script, fundamentals which are sometimes overlooked in lieu of style or effects. The film surely has a strong, defined style about it, but it smartly refuses to be overruled by the carefully constructed foundation underlying it.<br/><br/>Great film, with a re-watchability factor built in."
"michael-young-585","8","1","2","21 August 2018"," Excellent Writing and Chastain Isn't Bad Either
","Molly's Game is a long movie - 140 minutes - but it is a testament to the writing that it doesn't feel that long. The story is complex with many threads. Keeping the threads straight and savoring the complex language is part of the enjoyment of watching this movie.<br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay for this movie, adapting the book ""Molly's Game"". The book, written by the main character Molly Bloom, is the true story of her life, which originally started as an almost-Olympic skier. As the movie lays out in the first few moments, she isn't able to pursue her skiing career and settles into running the most exclusive, and high stake, poker games in the country. The book, and the movie, is all about her rise and fall in her second career.<br/><br/>That she is involved with some very interesting characters in this career is a given and the movie puts together a terrific cast of characters that play the poker players, both in Los Angeles and New York. The viewer will learn more than she ever wanted to know about playing this kind of poker. But the cool thing is that we are learning along with Molly, because, at the beginning, she doesn't know anything about the game herself. Only through the same kind of persistence and hard work that she had applied to skiing, does she become such an expert that, although she never plays the game herself, she is able to understand every little nuance of what is happening at her table.<br/><br/>It is one of the great strengths of the story that it is able to bring the viewer up to speed so quickly. Indeed, this movie is more about the mind than it is about the body - more about the language than the action. And that is why it received a well deserved nomination for writing. As is often the case with adaptations, I can't tell if the excellent writing comes from Aaron Sorkin's screenplay or Molly Bloom's original book. Whichever it is, let's just say it works.<br/><br/>An important device in the movie is Molly's narration. The voiceovers are frequent and sometimes lengthy, but certainly help keep the film moving forward. Molly's explanations of her own actions are an important part of understanding the complex events and the narration fills in important gaps. I suspect that much of the narration are almost exact quotes from the book, but, having not read the book, I can't say. At any rate, they are an essential element.<br/><br/>But there is also some very powerful dialog. Molly's conversations, always with men, are critically important to understanding her intellectual power, which is considerable. I think that a key aspect of the movie is that it shows a woman achieving mastery, on her own terms, over a group of powerful men. The most interesting point of the movie is how she does that and, importantly, why she chooses to do so!<br/><br/>But Molly isn't the only intelligent character in this movie. There is a powerful monolog by her attorney, played by Idris Elba, detailing why Molly shouldn't be prosecuted that is wonderfully rich in both words and ideas, and, mostly successful. And there is a critical conversation between Molly and her Father (played by Kevin Costner in one of his best recent performances) where the essential motives for Molly's behavior, and identity, are made clear. That is a conversation that will draw tears from most viewers as it explores the father-daughter relationship in important ways - and makes it clear that despite what daughters think, fathers are fallible human beings too!<br/><br/>Sorkin has written numerous other movie screenplays that illustrate his ability to develop complex plots and difficult subjects. Moneyball, The Social Network, Steve Jobs, and A Few Good Men were all written by Sorkin. He was nominated for an Oscar for Moneyball, and won the Oscar for The Social Network. All of those movies explore complex worlds of technology or sports, or both, and yet convey a level of excitement and emotion that is normally not associated with them. If you liked these movies, you will enjoy Molly's Game. (As an aside, Molly's Game is Sorkin's first attempt at directing.)<br/><br/>And, as icing on the cake, there is Jessica Chastain as Molly. She wasn't nominated for her performance here and I don't really understand why. This was maybe not an award winning performance, but it was worthy of a nomination. Her character is complex and Chastain successfully illustrates the difficulties of a woman being successful in a powerful man's world. That in itself makes the performance worthy. She has previously shown talent in movies like Zero Dark Thirty, Interstellar, and The Martian, and securing Oscar nominations for Zero Dark Thirty and The Help. It is said that Molly Bloom herself wanted Chastain to play her.<br/><br/>Molly's Game isn't a perfect movie by any means. But if you are interested in a true story about an intelligent woman figuring out how to control powerful men, this film fills the bill. Along the way, there are terrific lines of dialog and monolog that illustrate the value of good writing."

I don't think Molly Bloom could have been cast any better than with Jessica Chastain... she nailed her role. Oddly enough, she looks similar to the actual Molly Bloom.<br/><br/>Being a sucker for great stories of real life characters, it is easy to see what Aaron Sorkin saw in the very true tale of Molly Bloom. For a first time director, he absolutely knocks this out of the park. He conferred with his friend & director David Fincher on strategies for shooting this film along the way and he go great advice because the innovative camera angles, control of time (a key sign that a director knows what they are doing), and assured pacing make this one of the most enrapturing and compelling dramas of 2017.<br/><br/>The American ethos of being No. 1 combined with the isolation and principles of its heroine make ""Molly's Game"" a tremendous playing field for Sorkin's directorial debut. It's two-hour-plus running time glides by like a breeze and ends on a corny yet truthful note about the virtues of failure, that is a glimmer of hope in times of struggle, as well as one of the tenets of screen writing. <br/><br/>
The fight, the hustle and the failure never end, but then again, so do the rewards in their own funny way. You win some, you lose some, and Sorkin never seems to forget how close he is to the edge.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Molly's Game (3 out of 5 stars). <br/><br/>Molly's Game is a captivating drama film that is cold with its undertone performances and provocative with its thrilling poker games that Molly Bloom is in charge of. <br/><br/>The film starts with Molly being a world class skier until an accident ending her career. She moves to Los Angeles to start a new life while taking a break from law school. She meets a guy that introduces her to an underground poker game where celebrities and high end clients buy in to compete. From there, she decides to host her own poker games in hotels and begins making a name for herself and money until the law catches up with her. When she will need the help from Charlie (Idris Elba) her lawyer. <br/><br/>I am not a huge poker player or get excited for the game itself. But the film and direction does put you in a fresh perspective for the audience that are not familiar with the game. Even Molly Bloom was seeing this and trying to understand the game and the rules. When she has to google each poker player terms to understand it. Also, the films visuals of showing us the decks and the idea of putting it in to win. <br/><br/>Jessica Chastain is a beautiful actress. She did great in the film portraying Molly Bloom. Her performance was cold and stunning. Idris Elba was also good too playing her lawyer. <br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin did well with keeping up and making it a fast talking script. Just like how he did The Social Network or Steve Jobs. It could have been a very boring movie when the conversations are all about poker and breaking the laws. The script was fast and kept the pace moving with the characters. <br/><br/>The couple of things i did not like about the film. I felt like the music score by Daniel Pemberton could have improved. Atticus Ross or some composer that could have mixed the original score with electronical could have made the film more exciting with its poker story and direction. <br/><br/>Also, the film does slow down by the end of its second act. During the climatic court case scene. It just went from an interesting fast drama film into a boring let down. <br/><br/>Overall, Molly's Game is a fair film. It is a provocative drama film with its true events and concept. The acting was great and the script kept the dramatic scenes exciting. It just fails with a tedious music score and boring ending."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","7","15 March 2018"," It's on
","""Molly's Game"" is a Chinese/American/Canadian new movie that is mostly in the English language and at 2 hours and 20 minutes, it is one of the longest big players this awards season. It culminated in another Oscar nomination for writer Aaron Sorkin, for whom this film is also his very first directorial effort almost at the age of 60. Lead actress Jessica Chastain managed (like Sorkin too) a Golden Globe nomination for her effort here and she is basically in almost every scene from start to finish. The movie is based on the book by the real Molly Bloom and funnily enough Bloom is younger today still than Chastain who played Bloom in the very early stages of her life too, not the childhood scenes though obviously. But Chastain works the part and this film here is definitely better than her also fairly recent ""Miss Sloane"". Idris Elba is probably the male actor with the most screen time here, but honestly his material is very mediocre most of the time and I am saying this as a big fan of Elba, especially on Luther. It is really all about Chastain. All about Bloom and not so much about all the male characters surrounding her. Interestingly enough, there is not really one other female character who even plays a supporting role in the grand scheme of things. For me as a Dark Angel fan, it was a truly nice surprise to see J.C. MacKenzie in here play one of the bigger supporting characters as he is in quite a few scenes. But the male supporting characters were all fairly fun and interesting, be it the completely unskilled poker player Bad Brad who beats the talented one (Harlan) eventually causing his demise, or be it Dean Keith who was fun too in the first half before he disappears. So was Chris O'Dowd in the second half. The only one who really did not fit was Michael Cera to be honest as some kind of business/poker mastermind pulling all kinds of strings. It just did not feel real. Then again, I think Cera is generally pretty limited, so this conclusion does not surprise me.<br/><br/>As for the subject, yes it is about poker, but you don't need to know the rules or play the game yourself in order to enjoy the movie. I personally play very rarely and this was not a problem at all. The film is about much more. I do think the writing is the greatest strength of the film next to Chastain's performance. Especially the voice-over sequences felt very competent. But also most of the dialogues. Still there were problems. The ways in which they depicted the character's struggles to gain power over men and eventually quoted this as her key motivation did not always feel smooth and same goes for the parallel they are making towards her past as an athlete compared to her competitive spirit in the now. Or I should say later in the past as the now is really the trial I guess and everything else is just really long flashbacks. Costner did a good job for the most part and elevated the material most of the time, but the father-daughter relationship component, which proves crucial near the very end, did not always work in a way I hoped it would. It all felt a bit for the sake of it giving the movie additional emotional depth without really succeeding in that field and I am not surprised Costner did not receive any big awards attention here despite playing a fairly baity character as we find out at the very end. The film is not scared of depicting pain and violence and this is a good thing as it just fit in convincingly. On the completely opposite side, Sorkin does a good job with getting occasional moments of comedy in like the Kirke reference. On the downside, there were moments when the movie did not always feel 100% realistic and authentic like the pair of kings eventually appearing, but well it can happen of course, but chances are so minimal that it felt more for storytelling purposes really. But all in all, this was certainly a good watch. The film never drags and that is a pretty strong achievement for such a long movie I must say. It is definitely among Sorkin's best from what I've seen and does not need to hide behind his recent television work or ""The Social Network"", which earned him an Oscar and may still be his career-defining work. I definitely recommend Molly's Game and if you like most of the actors as much as I do, then that is the icing on top of the cake that will make it an even better watch for you just like it did for me, but also if not, you may want to check it out. It really is worth seeing. Finally, to close my review: One small reference about how the central character expects phone calls and the first one comes resulting in her dismissal, while the second one does not come after she was beaten up and had her life (and her mother's) threatened by the Russian mob thanks to (for Molly) lucky coincidence. Also interesting how the main character is really depicted as a very likable person despite all she did, also with the help of scenes that show her caring for and helping the poker players when their addiction gets the better of them. They definitely wanted to make sure here that audiences cheer for Molly and don't want her to go to jail for what she did. I have not read the book, so can't say how close the film is to the original literature it is based on. That's all now. Watch it!"

","The story of Molly Bloom is fascinating to those who seek realism. The story follows the historical Molly Bloom who sought out Director Aaron Sorkin to make the film. Major and minor details were preserved from the memoir to ensure accuracy. The intriguing part is the story line and concept is that of a documentary. However, the story itself is told from a narrative standpoint that draws the viewer in with a creativeness that the viewer can potentially redirect their mind on ""it was a great movie."" <br/><br/>This film is more than just a great movie, it is a fantastic film that documents Molly Bloom and sheds light and represents Molly as the figure of truth and upholding dignity. As Molly has opportunity to ""win"" with freeing herself. She chooses to be graceful and cares about people more than herself, which is a remarkable trait that moves Molly forward with acceptance that she would rather be punished than to hurt people."
"t_k_matthews","7","2","7","5 January 2018"," Virtue Preening
","Aaron Sorkin is a terrific screenwriter with a terrible tendency to burn holes in his script.<br/><br/>Sorkin's scripts are full of words, interesting words, witty words, humorous words. He has good ideas and a genius for working them into a great story. So far, so good.<br/><br/>But his flaw, his weakness, is that he can't resist moral preening. The central character is given dramatic license to be morally superior, and to tell you about it. By extension, the movie's point of view, and that of the filmmaker, are virtuous. (Sorkin wrote and directed.)<br/><br/>This is no small flaw--the preachiness which is invited in by lack of moral ambiguity reduces the film's complexity down to simpleminded virtue-peddling. Here is how right-thinking people are required to behave, even against self interest.<br/><br/>This shows up in the Molly character in two ways. After she sets up extremely high-stakes poke games among the very rich, she repeatedly becomes counselor, social worker, and big sister to the players.. I didn't buy it. I don't know anything about the real Molly Bloom, but I'm pretty sure that a woman who goes into the business of hosting high stakes poker games isn't Mother Theresa. (The movie does admit a flaw in the woman's conduct, but soft-sells it. It-s not a flaw you see, but only a natural and forgivable response to her circumstances.) I could have done without the effort to turn the character into Mary Poppins.<br/><br/>The other example of moral preening comes with decisions made by the character at the end of the movie. No spoilers here. Again, though, high moral conduct beats self-interest.<br/><br/>This unfortunate tendency by Mr. Sorkin is a form of self-sabotage. An example: The American President, a charming first-half movie ruined by screeching political right-think in the second.<br/><br/>Sorkin also likes the Big Dramatic Showy Scene. He's got one here, and it feels a bit unjustified by the rest of the movie. Again, late in the movies, no spoiler.<br/><br/>I've hit the negative. It has its good points, too. If you see it, you might want to bone up on poker terminology."

","This is a drama and true story of Molly Bloom. She was a former Olympic worthy freestyle skier, who while competing suffered a terrible career ending fall. <br/><br/>During the opening sequence we see the FBI arresting her for connections with a Russian money laundering operation. Also during an early flashback sequence we see that Molly had massive issues with her overbearing father, who was also her ski coach. This tense relationship ultimately translated into her later desire to control men. <br/><br/>She moves to LA and becomes both a waitress and also PA to a real pillock of a guy. She starts by helping him to run illegal high stakes poker games before branching out on her own to become the leader of the most exclusive underground poker games in the world, entirely played by powerful men. <br/><br/>This is a long film, full of heavy dialogue and narration, with excellent award worthy performances from Jessica Chastain, as Molly. Idris Elba, as her lawyer and Kevin Costner, as her pushy father. Look out for the emotional 'therapy' scene between father and daughter on a bench scene towards the end.<br/><br/>Recommended viewing."

","The movie is in its own league, it's a brilliant story with many great performances. The main factor that makes this movie such a success is the structure of the story, as the story is known to be about Molly Bloom and her personal story, which throughout the movie is told to her lawyer. This is the way that the story is told, like a person talking to their lawyer, the story goes on and as questions are asked the answers are given adding more detail to the story. And on the discussion of detail, the story of Molly Bloom is given in strong detail, which would usually appeal to be boring but in this case it being mixed with the characters sassy attitude it is done in great entertainment and gives of a lot of information about character and setting. but as a whole the movie is empowering and gives a strong stance of women in this world and is a movie be enjoyed and inspired by."

","I'm a giant fan of Aaron Sorkin as a screenwriter. I loved The Social Network, who knew a film about Facebook of all things could be so well written. I also loved his work on Steve Jobs, the sharp writing and focusing on three key points in Jobs' life just made for such an entertaining watch. I don't know anything about poker, but just seeing a combination of Sorkin and Jessica Chastain (who I adore) was enough to get me hyped for this.<br/><br/>The film is based on the life of Molly Bloom, a former skier who finds herself getting an in with Hollywood celebrities, famous athletes and other high rollers in games of high stakes poker. After spending years of learning the game she branches out and begins hosting and soon the games start involving the mob and law enforcement gets involved and she is eventually arrested. The film is primarily told from Molly's perspective and also stars Idris Elba as Molly's attorney.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain is one of my favorite actresses. She's absolutely gorgeous and is so talented. I always feel like she comes close to winning an Academy Award but doesn't quite reach the pinnacle. She's unsurprisingly superb in Molly's Game, it might be her very best. She nails a completely character driven performance. The running length is long (clocking in at 140 minutes) but for me time kind of flew by because I was so into Molly's world. The film brings style and enough substance for me to really take a caring for Molly and what happened in her life.<br/><br/>This film is not about a character finding love, no none of that crap here. We have a well written biography of a person who got entangled with the wrong group and you want to see her find her way out. Sorkin's directional debut works so well for me. The world of poker becomes accessible for know nothings like me because Sorkin breaks down everything so well, while showing us the glitz and fast pace of the gaming world. I'm happy with Sorkin's finished product. It'll be a tough year for her as always but I'd love for Chastain to win the big awards for this.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"kjproulx","9","2","7","22 December 2017"," A Fantastically Written Drama
","Adapted from the novel by Molly Bloom (the subject of the film), Aaron Sorkin has officially stepped up to helm his first film as both writer and director. Most notable for his screenwriting work on The Social Network, Moneyball, or Charlie Wilson's War (just to name a few), I've always had a love for anything he writes. His screenplays always place the dialogue in the forefront, making for a very intense drama on almost every account. Even if the material is dull, he always finds a way to pick up the pace and make it an interesting and engaging experience for audiences. Molly's Game is his latest film that's about to hit the big screen, and once again, his style is as engaging as ever. You should keep your eye out for the release of this film.<br/><br/>Opening with a very stylish sequence involving her past as an Olympic skier, we quickly learn that her character has been through a lot and will be a very devoted person throughout the course of the movie. From then on, this film is a series if dialogue-driven scenes that never seem to stop until the credits roll. Throwing you into the life of Molly as a waitress, only to see her grow into a woman who assists in running a high-roller underground poker event, this film wastes no time on the small stuff. Whenever it seems as though a certain plot point is starting to drag, it jumps forward in time, either immersing you in an intense game of poker, an emotional moment with a family member, or simply a double-cross by one of the players.<br/><br/>Characters state that everything going on is technically legal, but you'll still find yourself wondering, which is the beauty of such a well-written screenplay. This movie doesn't create an overdone conclusion because that's not the point of this film. This film exists to prove that this woman was innocent in what she had done and that everything was legal along the way. Sure, there are moments of tension between characters, but the film has much more heart behind it as well. This screenplay deserves a nomination of some kind, there's no doubt about that, but is the direction just as impressive as the script?<br/><br/>When writers or even actors step into the director's chair, it's always a risk for the studio. They could be fantastic and make the right step for their career, or it could end up where they should've stuck to what they knew best. Happily, Aaron Sorkin is definitely worthy of making films in my opinion. No, the visceral imagery and camerawork that comes from a film directed by the likes of a David Fincher (who he has worked with in the past) are certainly not present here, but that's not to say he did a bad job in the slightest. Molly's Game is above average in terms of direction and I can see him continuing to pursue this area of his career and doing an even better job. He was clearly passionate about this particular story and I believe his choices paid off in spades.<br/><br/>In the end, I believe Molly's Game will definitely be up for a few awards this coming season, due to its devoted cast and crew throughout the entire production. From its inspired editing by a trio of editors who have worked on some pretty large productions to its Oscar-worthy screenplay, to its intense moments of dialogue and surprise turns throughout each act, this is not a film to miss. Yes, I feel as though it may be about 10-15 minutes too long, but some of the greatest films of all time are nearly four hours and even those films feel unnecessarily long. Molly's Game is slightly drawn out, but it's a superb picture nonetheless. I loved my experience with this film and I highly recommend checking it out when it hits theatres."

","I make no apology for cribbing the last words of James Joyce's Ulyses, words spoken by Molly Bloom, wife of the protagonist Leopold Bloom. This is a fine effort featuring three fine performances from the eponymous Molly (Jessica Chastain), her father, Kevin Costner, and her lawyer, Idris Elba. I'm not familiar with the book which means I have no way of knowing how faithful the film is to it but judging it simply as a film it is a gripping story which holds the attention throughout. Screenplays involving sport and/or games are problematical but when they come off they come off in spades whether fact - The Pride Of The Yankees - or fiction - The Husler, and Molly's Game can now take its place on the pantheon."

"garabedbaghsarian","8","1","3","23 October 2019"," Good start with bad ending movie
","Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut about the Olympic skier Molly Bloom, a brilliant over-achiever who chose to forego law school to become a gambling entrepreneur, is a compelling film that starts out very strong. Even with its lengthy running time, it's never slow or not involving. It's gripping and fascinating throughout, thanks to Sorkin's master penmanship at keeping the dialogue and tempo of the film at a heady pace.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba both give dynamic performances here. Elba makes a great presence as the defense attorney who tries to grapple with the sheer size and scope of Bloom's considerable legal problems as her gambling operation becomes progressively more mired in the criminal world. Even if you find Chastain's character cold and detached, her performance here is strikingly realistic.<br/><br/>Alas, we have the film's ending. Where the film goes wrong is this highly far-fetched and phony attempt to humanize Bloom beginning with a chance encounter with her father at a skating rink in Central Park. A corny scene does not sink a film all by itself, but unfortunately this scene was followed up with an equally ridiculous courtroom sequence that struck me as unduly and comically political. It's always a shame for a film to look first-rate for most of the way only to collapse in the final act. Recommended mostly on the strength of the performances, even if the film as a whole misses the mark in the end."

"drqshadow-reviews","6","1","3","21 September 2018"," Behind the Stained Curtains of a High-Stakes Celebrity Poker Game
","Aaron Sorkin writes and directs this adaptation of an underground poker entrepreneur's almost-tell-all autobiography. As Sorkin's style is typically very polarizing, I figured we might as well get his name out of the way first. He's got his fingerprints all over this, especially (as ever) in the film's breathlessly snappy, long-winded dialog. As a fan, I'll gladly eat that stuff up, though I'd rank this one near the bottom of his extended portfolio. It lacks the thick tension of A Few Good Men, the untamed energy of The Social Network, the relentless motor of Moneyball. In conforming another writer's work to the screen, Sorkin's writing feels restrained, less electric. It brings us one great, big, passionate speech - powerfully delivered by an impassioned Idris Elba - but there seems room for two or three more.<br/><br/>A protagonist who's generally cold and unlikeable, withdrawn and specter-like in her own story, doesn't make things easy on the first-time director. Molly is a complicated character that we never completely figure out. When she enjoys a brief emotional breakthrough near the film's climax, it doesn't quite feel like she's earned it. She has a few tough run-ins with shady characters and uncaring g-men, but it never seems like she's seriously at risk. Things just always turn out in her favor, which leads to a rather flat ending.<br/><br/>It's an interesting story, and the plot is well-structured to keep audiences from feeling pummeled by the thick splashes of word soup. It avoids most of the major pitfalls of a film that revolves around Texas Hold 'em, too, though in fairness the game itself is never actually the focus. I liked it, I didn't love it."

"nurit-horak","7","1","3","8 February 2018"," A strong women?
","Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain is as wonderful as ever) the heroine of the movie ""The Big Game"" is a strong woman. She was an Olympic athlete in her teens, she ran a successful gambling business in her twenties, she wrote a book that became a best seller and she bravely stands up to police pressure and refuses to give away details about her clients when she is judged for her actions and rdo not wish to play by the ""their"" rules. She rents out the services of an expensive lawyer that she can not afford with the assurance and absolute faith that she can repay his duty and after all this she also succeeds in being a roll model for that lawyer's daughter when their relationship reminds her of her own relationship with her competitive father.<br/><br/>But the movie ""The Big Game"" not only shows us how strong Molly is. In fact it keeps trying to show us how weak Molly is in the world of the men thyat surrounds her. It begins with her father, who ignores her medical condition and drags her to a sporting event from which she almost dies at the beginning of the film. This continues with the players in the game she runs in Los Angeles, celebrities who are addicted to the thrill of the game and eventually prove to her that it is not her game at all, as she was wrong to believe. After that the aggressive poker players she meets in New York when she tries to start over, from royalty to Russian mafiosi. And it ends in the legal system itself, where the men decide between themselves about her fate when Molly is asked to leave the room. Until finally it is not clear why Molly has been arrested in the first place and there is a growing suspicion that Molly is right, and she has been a colorful gimmick to add popularity to one of the largest illegal gambling trials in America. All of these impair Molly Bloom's ability to really be a strong female figure on the screen and influence the viewers. Moreover, her psychologist father even diagnosed Molly with a situation in which she was caught up in her desire to take revenge on men who are as aggressive as her father. Thus, in a very simplistic interpretation, Molly's independent and competitive character is erased, and this is the main weakness of the film, especially when it repeatedly chooses to ignore the intersections in which Molly failes to escape from the game and the events around it. <br/><br/>The film does not even pass the Bechdel test. Other female characters who could become more central like the daughter of the lawyer, Molly's mother, and Molly's employees are lost in the plot and have almost no place, they come in and out of the movie immediately as if they themselves were a beautiful decoration for the set. The only scene in which two women talk about Molly's ""work"" can not really be considered ""passing"" because of the insignificant place it has in the film. On the other hand, the film does manage to criticize the male world in which Molly operates. A world where a woman is only a means, a world where big money is running without any second thought, a world made up only of men that only them have the crazy sums to spend on dangerous games. Men who often appear as ridicules and weak at best and manipulative, unscrupulous and murderous at worst. Accordingly, Molly's outward appearance changes when she wants to please these men as she enters the game and earns more money and becomes a successful businesswoman who rolls millions. This external figure is so adamant that she continues to be her outward persona years later when she appears in court and with her lawyer. When the latter comments to her in a patronizing tone that she might wear something else, she replies that she has no other clothes. Imagine that..."
"bottomsgaming","7","1","3","20 January 2018"," A fun, fast-paced biopic
","I'm a sucker for Sorkin's fast-paced, quick-witted dialogue, and a huge sucker for poker movies. So it's no surprise that I like this one. <br/><br/>Like most, I'll admit to being very impressed with Sorkin's writing up to this point. He generally writes dialogue that's grounded, entertaining, and (mostly) cliche-free. In fact, he's developed such a characteristic style that he's almost created his own self-contained cliches, some of which are hit here, in Molly's Game. Long story short - I like him.<br/><br/>This movie mostly delivers in its dialogue and storytelling. A story about a smart woman starting and running a high-stakes poker game? I'm in. I really enjoyed that the poker and logistics of running a game were portrayed (to my knowledge) accurately. Most poker movies, in an effort to make the content easily digestible for non-poker players/fans, create the most basic, ridiculous scenarios that they think the audience will understand. More often than not, it makes the writers look like high-schoolers whose only poker knowledge is the final 30 minutes of the highlights of a World Series of Poker event. Basically, most poker movies are stupid. Looking at you, Casino Royale. Anyway, Molly's game avoids this pitfall by not showing much of the technical side of the poker. What little it does show is spot-on, though. Mostly, it focuses on the difficulties or running the room itself, and the movie is much more interesting for it. <br/><br/>The story involving the game is excellent, and the dialogue makes it extremely fun to watch. <br/><br/>Here's where the movie loses me: the dialogue focuses so intensely on general wit and moving the story specifics along (and it does this great) that I feel like it drops the ball on developing human characters. This is most notable in Molly, our main character. In a film where she's narrating 100% of the time, we somehow never really get a sense of who she is. Whether Molly is seducing rich businessmen into the poker game, or being physically assaulted by the mob, lines are delivered in the same matter-of-fact, robotic fashion. This is most prominent with her, but every character suffers in the same way. Everyone is cool and calculated, and nothing else. I get that that's the tone of the movie, and it works for large sections, but it's just not enough when you look at the whole picture. The Social Network and Moneyball have the same style, but their characters were more nuanced and therefore able to elicit more emotion out of me.<br/><br/>This ties into the final 30 minutes of the movie, which ends the poker storyline and focuses on Molly, her status, and the aftermath of everything. I really needed to be invested in her character for any of this to work. The film up to this point was an entertaining poker story with smart, but thin characters. The ending tries to get an emotional payoff that wasn't properly set up, and ultimately rings hollow. This is where I began checking the time, which is never good.<br/><br/>Overall, Molly's Game is certainly worth a watch, especially if you're a poker fan. It has Sorkin's usual entertaining, witty dialogue, and a great story to work with. The film just tries to create too much emotional drama late, with characters that didn't quite have the meat. It takes what's a truly great first-half and pulls the final product down to good, but forgettable."
"Lewis_Heather787","8","1","3","19 January 2018"," Very Well directed and written film with one great performance.
","Going into this film I was completely unaware of the story of Molly Bloom, so I didn't have an expectations really apart from a really interesting trailer. Wow is this film deep and powerful look into a relatively unknown culture to ordinary working people. <br/><br/>When you hear that Aaron Sorkin, one of the best writers around today, is going to be directing a feature film you should probably bookmark the film and see it. Well not only can we call him a great writer but also a very good director. This film is beautifully shot and made with an intriguing story, that is woven in and out of multiple story lines that all connect in there own individual way. A fantastic method of telling a story that....lets face it... is extraordinary from start to finish, the life that Molly Bloom had even at young age let alone her adult years is a truly remarkable story. Being on the edge of an Olympics in a winter sport to then end up being prosecuted for hosting illegal poker games, what an insane journey. The changes in time throughout the film work really well especially with the voice over from Chastain as Bloom, taking the audience along with her. All round fantastic writing and directing from Sorkin!<br/><br/>Now Ive personally been saying for some time that Jessica Chastain will be one of the best actresses around, and this film only reaffirms by believe in her talent, what a performance. I do think this is her best performance of her career, yes better than Zero Dark Thirty, she is fantastic in the film. She embodies the character of Bloom so well that you quickly forget that its Chastain, her acting is brilliant. She should even get some awards buzz for this because yes it is that good!<br/><br/>A shot out should definitely go to Idris Elba, who is an extremely underrated actor that absolutely doesn't get the roles he deserves. He is brilliant as the at first reluctant lawyer who ends up defending Bloom until she gets justice, brings a sense of normality to the film, as if he was one of the audience members or just a regular guy. Elba goes toe to toe with Chastain in the scenes that they are in and they compliment each other extremely well. There is one standout scene of his late on the film where is trying to express his reasons as to why he thinks Bloom is not guilty, very good and powerful speech. <br/><br/>Overall this film is very good 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10, Fantastic directing and writing from Aaron Sorkin, with a standout performance from Jessica Chastain. Not to forget Idris Elba's supporting role as well which also really strong, the only weak point of the film is the pacing which is a little slow but you should expect that from Sorkin. Also the middle of the film is really slow and a bit uneventful.... if thats the right word, they are small gripes with the film. Apart from that is it extremely interesting to watch with an incredible story about a truly incredible life."
"markgorman","6","1","3","19 January 2018"," One to save for watching on TV.
","It's always a treat when Aaron Sorkin brings a new script to our screens, large or small, and his output (aside from West Wing) has been quite thinly spread over recent years. For me, the high point was The Social Network, but Steve Jobs was pretty damn fine too.<br/><br/>And it's an unusual move for writers to become directors (albeit Martin McDonagh has done so to remarkable effect). This is Sorkin's directorial bow and he makes a pretty decent fist of it.<br/><br/>It's a good, but not great, film that moves along at typical, for Sorkin, high pace, almost matching that of Tom Lehrer's, The Elements. And that is both its strength and its weakness. It's kind of exhausting keeping up with 140 minutes of non stop verbal action.<br/><br/>The story concerns the real life of Molly Bloom; Olympic skier turned (illegal) poker madame. My first gripe is the huge dependence on narration from the central character (played superbly by Jessica Chastain). It's a tiresome devise that too often intrudes. It doesn't kill the movie but, for me, it hampers it.<br/><br/>The second is that it's just too one-paced. It lacks light and shade.<br/><br/>But it's also absorbing, interesting and full of surprises.<br/><br/>Chastain puts in an an Oscar nominatable performance (but it's in no way winnable, given what Frances McDormand has put down in Three Billboards as a marker).<br/><br/>Idris Elba had the ladies in my company quite hot and bothered and puts in a decent shift as Chastain's legal representative. He's needed because her early cleaner than clean rules of engagement gradually become blurred and loose.<br/><br/>It's a great yarn and it holds the audience throughout. But will I remember it a year from now? Not particularly."

","Molly's Game was a pleasant surprise to me. I went into it knowing nothing of the person or the story. I found it refreshing how the backstory was laid out so clinically so one can see how the entire mess Ms. Bloom found herself in came to be. It's a good setup to how being relentlessly driven can go in several very different directions. The performance by Jessica Chastain as Molly drives the show here as she brings the intelligent highly complicated Molly Bloom to life.You feel Ms. Bloom was shaped into a tough cookie by early failure which drove her to succeed in a quite left-field way. That success did go sideways but, not without a complete reinventing of her life. That life was equal parts greed and proving herself while never selling out even the shadiest characters who often used her - and sold her out. Chastain makes you care for Ms. Bloom even as you never really like her. That's excellent acting because you still invest heavily in her situation It's a humdinger with loads of bad stuff including real life danger and ultimate ruin which looms right up until the finale. The other notable character in this tale turns out to be Ms. Bloom's unlikely defense lawyer Charlie Jeffrey played to conflicted excellence by Idris Elba. This movie makes me want to read the book as I'm sure it delves deeper. That's a real compliment as far as I'm concerned."

","Aaron Sorkin proves that he has what it takes to be a director now. He shows that he has a strong command over the camera, as well as giving us another excellent screenplay. I said before that a poker movie needs to appeal to non-poker players as well, and Molly's Game does that. It definitely has exciting poker moments, but the stakes are there because we are invested in the characters. We care about Molly's crusade, and thus, through that, we are invested in the game. Even if some audience members don't understand or like the game of poker, Sorkin structures the movie in a way where they can still enjoy the film without missing any of the story beats. This is a smart script, done to mirror Molly's own intelligence. It is incredibly stylized, and it absolutely works for this movie. It's not done for the sake of being stylized; it's done to further enrich and explain Molly Bloom. This is done through excellently written narration, and enhanced by graphics and clips. Altogether, it excellently captures her character, which is something few writers can truly accomplish, and Sorkin has done so..."

","Mini review of Molly's Game<br/><br/>By now most people interested in movies might have heard about the true story of ex freestyle Olympic champion Molly Bloom who, after a devastating fall, recycled herself as THE nominal princess of clandestine poker game organizer extraordinaire for the rich and famous. Some of her wealthy patrons were on the very shady side of the law namely russian and italian mobsters.
The story is one of vertiginous heights and precipitous lows at the hands of the FBI who wanted information which a principled Molly was unwilling and, for the most part, unable to give since she had very limited contact with her clients other than during the games themselves.
Molly is played with energy and ferocity by an actress which I love, Jessica Chastain, but she's hobbled by a too dense script and multiple voice overs which burden the action and drag the story down.
I've decided I've never actually liked any of Aaron Sorkin's scripts. The last one I saw of his was Steve Jobs it too suffered from too much exposition and redundant verbiage. Sorkin has never seen a word which he didn't love, wonderful, I love words too, but sometimes less is more.
This is what I learned from Molly's Game. Molly had a competitive streak nurtured by daddy Furher played indifferently by Kevin Costner. She had an affinity for expensive Louboutin shoes, a couture wardrobe, money, lots of it, and the presence of powerful men with copious deep pockets. She was mostly lonely, had no friends, relationships and interests other than the weekly organized 
poker extravaganza $250.000 gets you a seat, courtesy of a lavish suite at the Plaza Hotel in New York city.
To make money you have to spend money. Lots of care is lavished on Jessica Chastain who's never looked sexier in a vampy sort of way. Felt like her breasts were auditioning for a part and landing the coveted roles every single time. It's going to hit you in the eye I guarantee it if you go and see the film.
Hot shot lawyer Charles, played with a sinuous American accent by Idris Alba predictably takes on the role of defense even though Molly is now broke and can't really afford him.
The film is overly long. My mind wandered especially during the technical exposÃ© on the finer art of poker playing. Sorkin does the same for skiing at the very beginning. Not a great start, I want to SEE not just hear and be told.
A bravura performance by Jessica Chastain and so-so directing and script writing by Sorkin don't quite make the cut. 
I give it a lethargic B- to C+ can't quite decide."

","Staying within his current wheelhouse of intelligent biopics for his directorial debut, acclaimed screenwriter Aaron Sorkin choose to adapt ""Molly's Game"" the autobiography of Molly Bloom, Olympic hopeful turned Poker Princess. <br/><br/>The film stars Jessica Chastain as Bloom who, when injury side-lines her from her dream of representing the USA as an Olympic skier falls into hosting an exclusive poker game for some of Hollywood elite. When that game is taken from her, she moves to New York to establish a new game for the Wall Street High Rollers. Unbeknownst to Bloom, her game also becomes frequented by high ranking figures in organised crime. <br/><br/>Similar to ""The Social Network"", ""Molly's Game"" is structured using voice over driven flashbacks to fill in her history alongside scenes where Bloom talks to her lawyer, Charlie Jaffey, played by Idris Elba. Performances are universally excellent though the real star is, as usual, Sorkin's script. As you might expect he sacrifices realism for wit and the snappy dialogue fires back and forth. I think this, along with a focus on the relationship between Bloom and her father (Kevin Costner) really elevates the film as Molly's story in and of itself, isn't quite as interesting as it appears. <br/><br/>And that's probably what stops the film from hitting the very highest of heights. At times, certainly during her rise - Bloom is almost an ancillary character. Merely being in the room whilst things happen around her, suffering at the whims of others, or caught in the tail end of illegal activity just because of who sat at her table. The resolution too, to her personal story if not her legal one, stretches the boundaries of plausibility.<br/><br/>But these are relatively minor complaints about a movie I enjoyed enormously and would recommend is worth seeking out."
"matthewssilverhammer","6","1","3","11 January 2018"," A Movie for Adults! Yay!
","Molly's Game is essentially a Lifetime Channel movie. It's a true story about a woman overcoming adversity and gender disparity, often being abused, constantly having to pick herself up by her boot straps, yet somehow finding inspiration in her life. Normally this would be a dismissive pejorative, but because of Sorkin's trademark fast, fun and smart (albeit often contrived) writing, it stays consistently engaging, even if it's larger points and tonal shifts are more than a bit problematic.
It's the story of Olympic-skier-turned-underground-poker-ring-runner Molly Bloom, whose life was a seemingly endless run of persistent hard work, shrewd success, and overwhelming failure. In its parts, the film is kind of immaculate. The dialogue snaps and overlaps with daring preciseness. The poker and skiing scenes are tense and thrilling, and do a great job of keeping even the most novice of fans engaged. The performances are very good, including solid turns by both Costner as her hard-nosed dad and O'Dowd as a drunken idiosyncrasy. And Chastain is, of course, wonderful.
With such solid components, a cool script and a wild true story, it's a shame there isn't a more confident, experienced director to manage it all. This is legendary screenwriter Sorkin's debut, and while he has the tendencies of someone like Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's films, Traffic), he doesn't have the control. Characters are miscast (Elba), the score is inspirationally cliched, continuity errors abound; none of that is egregious, but it renders the final product a bit messy. Worse though, Molly's arc and nobler motivations, while likable, are barely cogent. Nonetheless, if you're looking for engaging and high-minded entertainment for adults, you could do much worse."
"IMDBreview2017","7","1","3","9 January 2018"," Good Character-driven film
","Didn't think I would like the film at the beginning, but it grew on me. Sorkin knows how to write dialogue and made some good decisions on pacing. Though felt the other characters could have had more screen time like between Cera's Player X or other Hollywood celebs. Sorkin seemed to gloss over those characters from the book and made them a little to generic. Costner seemed a little hammy with his demanding father protrayal. That being said, both Idris Elba and Jessica Chastain really delivered strong performances on their characters. Both of whom made it worth watching."

","'Molly's Game (2017)' comes at you fast, snappy and self-assured, but often forgets that it isn't the book it is based upon, falling into the age old trap of telling and not showing at every opportunity; it feels less like a proper cinematic experience and more like someone explaining something to you for two-and-a-half hours, leading to an exhausting event that's at its most entertaining when it lets off the gas, zips the lips of the narrator (who sounds solely like Sorkin, let's be honest) and lets the characters converse in its slower sequences, which really do get under the skin of the situation and seem like they understand something fundamental about people who occasionally feel just as real as their real-life parallels. 7/10"
"paul-allaer","7","1","3","2 January 2018"," Fast paced true (if unlikely) story benefits from the ""Aaron Sorkin treatment""
","""Molly's Game"" (2017 release; 140 min.) brings the story of Molly Bloom. As the movie opens, we watch Molly compete in the Salt Lake Olympic trials for freestyle skiing, seemingly poised to make the team, only to see her hopes dashed resulting from an improbable twig on the course. We then go to ""12 Years Later, West Hollywood"", where we find Molly being woken up by FBI agents who are at her apartment's door. Molly is arrested for running an illegal gambling operation. We then go back in time, as we see Molly arriving in LA after the Olympic trials, figuring out what she wants to do with her life. How did Molly get involved in illegal gambling? At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the highly anticipated directing debut from writer Aaron Sorkin, whose previous script work includes ""The Social Network"" (for which he won an Oscar), ""Moneyball"" and ""Steve Jobs"", just to name those. Here he adapts Molly Bloom's memoir ""Molly's Game"" for the big screen. I read the memoir when it came out in 2014, and it was as unlikely a story as it was fascinating and entertaining. That Sorkin ends up writing/directing this movie makes perfect sense, as it feels entirely in line with some of his earlier work. The movie's frantic pace is nothing short of dizzying at times, and I was concerned that it would be unsustainable. But after that initial wave, the movie does slow down just enough that we settle in for what I can only term as a wild, wild ride. It blows the mind that all of this in fact did happen in real life. Jessica Chastain is masterful in the title role. Idris Elba as her (initially reluctant) lawyer is also quite good. Kevin Costner plays her dad (and psychologist), in a smaller role that cries out for more details but with a running time of well over 2 hours already, there apparently was no room to dig deeper into that. ""The addiction is having power over powerful men"", Costner's character tells Molly. Bottom line is that ""Molly's Game"" is a wickedly entertaining and fast-moving film that will at times overwhelm you. Just buckle up and enjoy!<br/><br/>""Molly's Game"" opened in select theaters this weekend. The early evening screening on New Year's Day where I saw this at was absolutely packed to the rafters, somewhat to my surprise. The audience gave a spontaneous applause when the movie's end titles started to roll. This movie surely will generate positive word of mouth. If you are in the mood for a true story that is stranger than fiction, featuring some stellar acting performances, and all served up in the usual ""Aaron Sorkin way"", you cannot go wrong with this, and I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."
"gregkut","4","2","12","5 April 2020"," Molly's Breasts is more appropriate
","Realize this was based on a true story, but it was a bit ridiculous. First of all, Jessica Chastain is over 40, so seeing her cast as a woman in her mid 20's was not believable. 2nd, every shot of Molly was on her breasts, which seemed to get bigger throughout the movie. 3rd, who believes Michael Cera as a connected, duplicitous card shark? They were trying to make ""21"" again, where the innocent MIT math nerds dominate the high stakes gambling circuit through superior brain power. Almost but didn't do it for me."
"SimonSaysSmallScreen","6","1","4","12 January 2020"," Story unworthy of Sorkin
","I also believe Aaron Sorkin is a genius, and this is the kind of expert treatment we would expect of him. The subject matter makes for compelling entertainment. But. I just can't figure out why he took this on. Molly Bloom, if the story is taken at face value, is an especially intelligent woman with unusual potential. For reasons summarily revealed at the climax, she chose to arrange high-stakes poker games instead of developing her talent in some way that would contribute to society. In the process, she put herself in the company of dangerous people and before too long it splashed back on her. She's not a hero, although the movie implies that angle. So, absent any real moral tension (the late-stage attempt to create some around her plea is over almost before it starts), we are left with only the trademark snappy repartee and bigger-than-life characters. The result is like a bag of your favorite potato chips; very tasty in the beginning but toward the bottom of the bag, you wish the bag was smaller."

","The true story of Molly Bloom, who begins the film being arrested by armed FBI agents. From this teaser we jump back to see the path that led Molly to organize an exclusive high-stakes poker game for sports stars, Hollywood royalty, and, eventually, Russian mobsters.<br/><br/>Opening with a downhill skiing incident which is broken down in a snappy and slick presentation, Molly's Game is very much about the slickness and snappiness of the whole piece. This is perhaps not a surprise from Sorkin given his style, but it makes the film mostly very enjoyable as it moves well and suits the confidence of Molly and the exotic nature of her world. The narration adds to the film and it moves well for the most part. It does run a little long and towards the end I started to feel the length in a way I had not up till that point. Part of this is that it doesn't totally find the heart within the character - Chastain is very good when it comes to convincing of this young woman moving in such circles, but less good at why we should care for her. Another part of this is the way the film brings it home, because it has moments which don't ring true and seem overly convenient (the return of the father for instance).<br/><br/>Overall, the content and the slick way it is all delivered makes it engaging and worth watching, but it does have weaknesses, and it runs longer than it can totally stand."

","Overachiever Molly Bloom's promising skiing career is cut short by injury. Reacting against her domineering father, she ends up running dodgy poker games, initially for someone else, then on her own account. But she falls foul of the authorities who are after the organised crime people who play in them, and Molly seems like an easy target to enable them to get valuable inside information.<br/><br/>Based on true events, I have no idea whether Molly Bloom is as innocent or as principled as this film makes out. It doesn't matter - this is a strong and gripping story. And as well being a good story, I found myself thinking as the film ended that a good script makes an incredible difference. And the script here, by Aaron Sorkin (who also directs for the first time) is first rate. It isn't full of memorable, clever, unrealistic dialogue, but it is needle-sharp throughout the 140 minute running length.<br/><br/>The cast are excellent. Michael Cera plays strongly against type and, in a quiet performance, oozes an understated reptilian malice. Chris O'Dowd shows that he is not simply an Irish funny man, and Kevin Costner gives a beautifully nuanced portrayal of a man whose own hang-ups make him far more unpleasant than he needs to be. Idris Elba's American accent is more convincing than his native one. And Jessica Chastain, looking hot, holds things together as Molly, but doesn't come across as a particularly warm or likeable person, which may be how the character was intended to appear.<br/><br/>This was a good meaty watch - intelligent without being pretentious, and thoroughly engaging."
"hunter-friesen","6","1","4","5 March 2018"," A podcast would have been a better way of telling this story
","Aaron Sorkin is a brilliant writer with a great track record. With Molly's Game, Sorkin is expanding his role and taking the bold leap by directing along with writing. Sorkin proves he's a competent director here, but this film pales in comparison to his written work. Molly's Game is a film with lots a style and substance but still can't pull off what it's trying to do. <br/><br/>Based on a true story, the film follows the extraordinary early life of Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain). She's an Olympic skier who crashed (literally) and burned into a life of being an assistant as she tries to pay her way into law school. After helping run some poker games for her boss, she decides to run her own high stakes game. She soon begins to attract film stars, billionaires, and other celebrities, all of which raise her status and risk. Soon the FBI gets involved and takes her money, even though she claims she has done nothing wrong. Molly seeks the help of attorney Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba) to restore her image and avoid serving jail time. <br/><br/>First things first, this is a very dense story. It would be wise to know some background details before watching the film. Sorkin proves he's the master of writing witty and sharp dialogue, but he also shows that he struggles with filling in the time between. The overall story is constantly confusing as to why Molly is under investigation and how her past is affecting the case. It's also a long film that suffers from having too much to say in a short amount of time. This is probably the fastest 140-minute ever as it feels as if hours worth of content is condensed down for the sake of reducing the runtime. While a four-hour cut would not have had commercial value, the cut we're shown doesn't give us the necessary amount of information. <br/><br/>This film is also very confusing to people who don't know poker very well (which includes me) since many terms are thrown around as if you already know them. Sorkin tries to simplify the confusion by having Molly narrate the games as a sort of teacher, but the editing and talking are way too fast for someone to watch and remember in one go.<br/><br/>This film can be easily compared to Adam McKay's The Big Short as both films try to visually simplify complex material. McKay used celebrities and real-world examples, while Sorkin uses flashy editing and voice-overs. McKay's method didn't work and Sorkin doesn't fare much better as tries to condense a beginners poker class in only a few short minutes. <br/><br/>Acting is the strongest aspect here. Jessica Chastain leads the pack by giving a confident and authentic portrayal of a person who gets too deep in her own game. Chastain has the ability to handle Sorkin's rapid dialogue, which she expertly does with Idris Elba. Elba is great as the tough lawyer that reluctantly takes on her seemingly doomed case. He doesn't try to take over for Chastain, rather he settles for a large supporting role. <br/><br/>Kevin Costner shows up from time to time as Molly's father, Larry. He's a psychologist who has always pushed his kids to extremes, which caused a strain between Molly and him. Costner does well in his small time and never lets his gravitas overshadow Chastain. <br/><br/>Lastly, Michael Cera delivers a surprising villainous role as Player X, a movie star that thrives off of competition. He's the best player in town, which allows him to exert his power over Molly, eventually dominating her and the game itself. <br/><br/>Molly's Game is a film that doesn't do anything poorly, it just does everything alright. While that's enough for most, you would expect more from Sorkin and his talented cast. Overall, Molly's Game has some of the tell, but little show."
"pjcooper-33833","6","1","4","12 February 2018"," I think I will fold.
","I knew nothing of the book or anything about the story so watched this with an open mind. It started off well but soon I realised this was becoming one of those films where the protagonist is narrating through the majority of the film. History has taught me this is usually a bad sign. The story telling is so weak it needs a thread to keep the viewer hooked and aware of whats exactly going on. It seems to be prevalent in so many films one wonders why this happens. The film is entertaining enough its just there are moments you're left scratching your head wonder whats going on. Molly was an intelligent lady its just she had absolutely no common sense whats so ever. Idris made a very poignant speech at the end of the movie that most people I believe would have listened to. I guess each to their own. The film sadly for me was over by this point. I lost all interest in the character and hoped they'd throw the book at her. As the film came to an end I told myself well this is after all supposed to be a true story. And whats the old saying 'Truth is stranger than fiction'."

"Troy_Campbell","7","1","4","9 February 2018"," Exciting, clever and audacious - but not the masterpiece Sorkin was aiming for.
","Aaron Sorkin has long been one of Hollywood's premier screenwriters. His sharp wit and deep intellect has provided the foundation for modern masterpieces such as The Social Network, Moneyball and Steve Jobs, not to mention TV classic The West Wing. Branching out here to make his directorial debut (but still working from his own script), Sorkin doubles down on his trademark energy to bring the stormy life of Molly Bloom-convenor of exclusive big-money poker games-to the silver screen. Framed by conversations between Bloom (Jessica Chastain) and her lawyer Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba), we get a series of flashbacks that chart Bloom's tumultuous journey from Olympic skiing as a young adult to running poker games for celebrities and billionaire businessmen for nearly a decade. When Bloom is charged by the Feds over possible connections with the Russian mob she employs Charlie's help, despite his cynicism over her purported innocence, and it's their rapid-fire repartee, culminating in a breathtaking monologue from Elba, that provides the spark of the movie. In many respects it's a shame we dip into her past so often, because although Sorkin is a good fit for the fast life of high-stakes poker-his direction is much like his writing, a whirlwind of confidence and audacity-the film is never as gripping as when Chastain and Elba go toe-to-toe. Having sole creative control only amplifies what some people love, and others hate, about Sorkin; his razor-sharp dialogue is intelligent to the point of pretentious, whilst his sentimental tendencies (here encapsulated by a late-in-the-game family reunion) could have you either sobbing or scoffing. Sometimes brilliant, often exciting and always clever, Molly's Game is a more than competent debut behind the camera for Sorkin. But one wonders if his unbridled storytelling genius flourishes most when paired with an experienced auteur who can file back the ostentatious edges."

","Well I guess this is a Poker movie, there is of course Molly but she isn't someone who you really warm to. Having said that there are other elements that you will find interesting, like who were the famous people at the games ?? <br/><br/>The problem with this film is that the story was written by Molly, the book was a giant publicity stunt to get her off the hook and protect her Hollywood connections hoping to get something in return ( maybe Hollywood is more dangerous than the Russian Mafia ? ) <br/><br/>You can see within the story where the truth has been stretched and where it has been altered to help Molly get off the charges. Its quite plain to see that she knew exactly what she was doing and with who, I didn't buy the whole naÃ¯ve thing. Having said that to be fair all she did was run a poker game and just been aware of who plays does not make you a criminal. <br/><br/>The whole psychological aspect again was played upon for the sympathy vote and I found it annoying. Her life was in tatters and she wanted some cash, its as simple as that. Fair play to her for going for it, I admire that a lot but this film just comes across as a stretch of the truth and most of the lies are elaborated upon so much that it seems the director forced you to see the lies. If that was intended then he did a good job !!<br/><br/>Overall I found it interesting but it was lacking in real depth and meat and seemed all a bit plastic with little emotion or feeling. Chastain had one face throughout the whole film, no expression whatsoever !! I found this incredibly unnerving at times and a bit creepy. This is the person we are supposed to be rooting for but by the end I didn't care about her. I saw an interview of Molly on TV and she is a bit blank but she has a warming smile, something that was missing here. <br/><br/>Ill give it a 6/10, I would have given it more but there was a lot I found annoying that took me out of the film. Its very well made however but just a little bit contrived to fit in with Molly's Game"
"Prismark10","6","1","4","18 January 2018"," Coming up trumps
","Aaron Sorkin delivers another film with sharp dialogue but this time he also takes on directorial duties in Molly's Game based on true events<br/><br/>Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain) comes from a family whose father demands excellence. A freak accident prevented Molly from making it to the US Olympic skiing team. On her way to law school, Molly ended up working in a bar in LA and then became a PA to a man who ran underground poker games for the rich and famous. Over time Molly learned the ins and outs of this side gambling operation and took over it by providing a better and more glamourous experience.<br/><br/>As always Molly falls foul of the FBI and needs the help of a lawyer Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba) who wants her to give the FBI some names of her high stake gamblers. Some of them were A list celebrities, others were mobsters.<br/><br/>Sorkin adds depth to Molly by making her more than a smart driven woman constantly living of her wits. We see flashbacks of young Molly and her therapist father (Kevin Costner) who she was constantly flippant with.<br/><br/>The film moves breezily, Sorkin adds some visual trickery to make poker look exciting but it does have a bloated running time and some of the gambling lingo just goes over your head. The biggest problem is people involved in high stake gambling are never going to be nice people and Molly herself is descending into drink and drug addiction. <br/><br/>I also thought the parallels with the book The Crucible which the lawyer's daughter is reading just came across as rather ham fisted. Still Sorkin always try to write a film that has a bit of street smartness about it."

","Book to film adaptations are often risky, though Hollywood can't seem to help itself. Presumably inspired by massive profits made by films such as the 'Harry Potter' series, the written word continues to find it's way onto the big screen, regardless of how cleanly it will translate. Unlike direct adaptations of fictional stories, however, Molly's Game finds itself in an interesting situation. The film is an adaptation of the book by the same name, written by the titular Molly Bloom. Supposedly explaining the incidents outlined by the film, the book is non-fiction. Instead of simply making a documentary, however, director Aaron Sorkin seemed to have his sights set elsewhere, expanding on the book by including the events taking place after.<br/><br/>Detailed within an interview with Vice.com, Molly Bloom explains that the film never deviated from the truth. Of course, we have nothing else to go on besides the word of a convicted criminal (regardless of how 'harmless' her crime may have been). Assuming everything within the book and film is true, I shall proceed.<br/><br/>With films such as these, I'm put into a difficult spot; I can neither critique nor praise the plot, as the writers supposedly had nothing to do with it. I can, however, criticise the cinematography and soundtrack. They certainly weren't bad, they were simply serviceable. I rarely noticed anything that stood out, or that surprised me. If you're looking for revolutionary visuals, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. The film isn't ugly by any means, especially with the incredibly talented Jessica Chastain in the leading role, but it feels rather static at times. Instead, much of the film is carried by the dialogue, and the performances.<br/><br/>Each are rather fantastic. Again, I don't know how much credit I can give to those behind the script, as I don't know which lines are pulled from reality, if any at all. Despite this, I enjoyed much of it. Humour was attempted occasionally, which I found rather hit or miss, but it wasn't painfully invasive as I'm used to. Where I feel the real talent lies is the cast. Jessica Chastain's Molly Bloom, for the most part, was fantastic. At times, I found her character annoying, but I don't feel any of that falls upon the actress. Idris Elba's portrayal of Molly's lawyer was equally fantastic, if not more so. His character, however, is rather confusing to me. He seems to be fictional, though I don't know why they didn't simply portray her real Lawyers.<br/><br/>Despite being about Poker, the game took up very little screen-time. It was only the focus of the film twice or so, but when it was, it was legitimately nerve-racking. They made sure we knew the stakes beforehand, and it helped create real drama where in another film, there may be none. Going into this film, it may be worth researching the game of poker briefly if you don't already know the rules. It isn't necessary, and the film informs you of any mandatory information, but it may help should you miss a line, or wish to understand any scenes with more depth.<br/><br/>There was also many oddities littered throughout the film, which I shall cover briefly. Spoilers for the rest of this paragraph. Due to the film covering a longer period of time within two hours and twenty minutes, many characters feel like they change out of nowhere. Player X seems to go from being an odd but at least pleasant person, to almost destroying someone's life overnight. I imagine the real-life equivalent would have occurred over a year or so. Also, the story felt rather one-sided. I appreciate she's the main character, and showing her too harshly may be detrimental to the overall film, but the film does it's best to brush over major events that show Molly in the wrong. At one point, there was even a throwaway line about her potentially contributing to someone's suicide. Despite the character's criminal actions, the film shows Molly in the best light possible, despite being a convicted criminal. Rather than being an uplifting recovery story, with Molly bringing herself back from her drug issues and problems with the mob, it instead tries to parade her as some sort of role-model.<br/><br/>Also worth noting is that, despite it's almost two and a half hour runtime, I never found myself bored, unlike many other recent films.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel the film lacked style. The music was lacklustre, and I found myself forgetting it was there oftentimes. The cinematography, as mentioned before, was rarely anything revolutionary. If you don't seek to make use of the advantages of the new medium, why bother making a film at all? I feel I could have gotten the same experience by simply reading the book. Perhaps this is an incredibly expensive and elaborate advert? With this said, however, I did enjoy myself. Perhaps I'm a sucker for the general aesthetic of the film, but I wasn't disappointed when the credits rolled. If you enjoy poker, or Molly Bloom's story interests you at all, I can comfortably recommend you check it out. I'll give it a generous 7/10."

Expectations were high. The film is based on the book Molly's Game: The True Story of the 26-Year-Old Woman Behind the Most Exclusive, High-Stakes Underground Poker Game in the World. Molly Bloom grew up in a competitive family - her father was a psychology professor, her brother was an Olympic skier and then an NFL player. Molly herself was a competitive skier, who once nearly had a ""shot at the podium"" in the Olympics. We learn within the first few minutes of the film that at an early age she was diagnosed with a spinal disorder and had to go through extensive operations to correct it, yet despite this she went on skiing in hopes to make her father proud. At her big moment she suffered a horrible fall when one of her skis came off right before a jump and her dreams of the world stage were dashed. This moment catapulted the rest of her life into a completely different direction. After taking some time off to mope she moved to Los Angeles to wait tables at a nightclub, which is where she met Dean Keith (Jeremy Strong) and quickly became his personal assistant. As her assistant she was in charge of organizing his weekly underground poker games, which became a lucrative gig for her in tips, given most of the players are celebrities and/or wealthy businessmen. After running the games successfully for a while she and Keith have a falling out over finances and she begins running her own games. This is where the trouble starts. In order to run the games she stretches herself thin, fueling herself with drugs just to keep going, all the while becoming more and more successful in the underground world of poker. The thing is, she runs completely legal, legitimate games - no rake, nothing, until finally due to players being unable to payout she is forced to take a rake on a particularly expensive pot. Years later she writes a book about her story, and consequently is arrested by the FBI. No lawyer wants to take her case, which is where Charlie Jaffey comes in (played by a spectacular Idris Elba). He takes her case, and together the two weave back through time combing over her entire career looking for ways to get her off while still upholding Bloom's incredibly high standards of personal integrity.<br/><br/>Long summary? Longer film, ultimately not in its own favor. Sorkin attempts to cover a lot of ground here, and because he's Sorkin, he doesn't like to do anything on the surface, which kind of works against him. It's an interesting piece of filmmaking for several reasons. The writing is superb, and Sorkin as the director steps back and lets Sorkin the writer drive the film. Usually first-time directors want to make a splash or create a signature, and so the directing is bold or edgy, but Sorkin does just the opposite. Director Sorkin becomes the Ringo Starr in the back letting the talent (writer Sorkin) upfront shine while he simply provides a beat. I wanted some style, some flair, especially in the beginning - when Bloom is introducing herself and her story to the audience. The writing is so great, I feel that in the hands of a skilled director, it would have been a truly memorable intro, but it isn't. The camera simply stays put - there aren't any sweeping pans or creative movements to add to the excitement, Sorkin lets the writing and the performances (and the costumes, which were very well done) do all the work, and I found that choice left the film lacking. As a person who loves films and the intellectuality of filmmaking, I loved watching all the performances fill the stage, but as a viewer I didn't really learn anything - it took a long time to get to the heart and once we got there I didn't find much. I didn't learn much about life or myself. It was disappointing. The film and the story lacked soul.<br/><br/>The performances were incredible. Even Michael Cera, who isn't known for taking serious roles, as Player X, who helps Bloom transition from running Keith's games to running her own games, played an excellent part. He delivers his lines with such a coy air it's chilling at times. Kevin Costner plays the role of Bloom's father and he gives a good performance reminiscent of his role as Jonathan Kent in ""Man of Steel,"" but nothing that grabs the hearts of the viewers. He doesn't detract from the film, but he doesn't add anything either. Elba, who plays Bloom's lawyer elevates his role from a supporting slot to stand out performance. He doesn't have nearly as much screen time as Chastain, but I feel as if the movie is centered around the two of them even though Elba's character doesn't enter until the movie is halfway through. Chastain is perfect in this role. The character demands an attractive, charismatic woman, and Chastain nails it. As Bloom she is youthful, driven, and hyper-ambitious, but with subtly leads the audience to imagine that just beneath the surface she is vulnerable and maybe even fragile. Chastain follows Robert De Niro's acting advice when he said that the best actors don't focus on what to show the audience, but rather focus on what to hide.<br/><br/>Overall, the film's writing and its two leads (Chastain and Elba) are the reasons to see this film. I did expect more from Sorkin, but he didn't disappoint in the writing category, which to be fair, is his area of expertise. The film is too long, but I could watch Chastain and Elba go on spitting out incredibly witty dialogue for hours, so I didn't mind the length at all. The film lacked style and the directing was stutter step, but it did offer a great blank canvas-platform for the acting performances. Also, and this is how good of a writer Sorkin is, he created a cameo (not an homage, not a piece of reference, but an actual cameo) for The Crucible, and it worked! I don't know how you make a cameo for a play, but Sorkin did, and he pulled it off.<br/><br/>See hutchnotes.com for more reviews."

","Aaron Sorkin directs a movie like he writes one: with a snap, crackle, and pop.<br/><br/>""Molly's Game"" is a fast paced biopic about an ex-competitive skier turned poker grande dame who comes under a federal indictment when it turns out that some of her players are Russian mafia. Jessica Chastain commands the screen, which is a good thing since she's in nearly every scene. And Sorkin's dialogue is so fast and zingy that the film feels like a screwball comedy even when nothing funny is happening.<br/><br/>Entertaining as ""Molly's Game"" is, there's something intangible preventing it from attaining greatness. Maybe it's the fact that the character of Molly Bloom is portrayed too much as a madame with a heart of gold. She's such a sharp cookie that it's hard to believe she's as innocent as the movie makes her out to be, and I think the film misses out on some opportunities to dive into complexity in its interest to give us a female character to root for.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner turns in some fine work as Molly's dad, and he gets the film's best scene, the one time the film slows down enough to allow both its characters and its audience to feel some genuine emotion. <br/><br/>Grade: B+"

","It's no shock that Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut has one of the best screenplays and one of the most fast-paced but intricately thought out plots of the year. Molly's game not only is a fascinating biopic but an impressively acted piece all around, but particularly with Idris Elba and Jessica Chastain. <br/><br/>Molly Bloom, a former olympic worthy skier, became the leader of the world's most exclusive and underground poker game in the world. That in itself is a fascinating story worthy of sort sort of film. But couple that with the fact that the poker players included some of the most famous actors, athletes, musicians, and Wall Street representatives in the world makes Molly's Game addicting to watch. It's hard to take your eyes off the events as it never seems to let up. Even if it's over 2 hours and 20 minutes, the film never stops being interesting.<br/><br/>That's in large part thanks to Sorkin's direction of the lengthy dialogue scenes, particularly the sequences involving Elba and Chastain's back and forth in an office. Sometimes all it takes to progress the plot and provide a jolt of energy is putting two incredible actors in the same room. Yes, those scenes are impeccably written, but it also brings this larger than life story back to reality and adds humanity to the main character of Molly.<br/><br/>Complementing those scenes are a few involving Molly's father played by Kevin Costner. It's an impressive feat to get a grown man to tear up and feel emotion towards a person who's out of the realm of relatability, but that's not the case at all. Molly Bloom goes through quite the arc in this film, and it all comes back to the incredible adaptation that Sorkin does with this screenplay. Performances, writing, and a brilliant direction from Sorkin makes Molly's Game a thrilling, yet also emotionally satisfying piece of cinema.<br/><br/>9.2/10"

","Saw this movie with the family (two grown sons) and husband the day after Christmas in a pre-release. I purchased the tickets in mid-December and was disappointed not to be able to pre-purchase Star Wars tickets - this was a consolation movie; our expectations were not that high. The movie and the acting team were fantastic. We all left the theatre happy to have seen this movie before others could weigh in. I know people who are as driven as Molly Bloom, some pushed in childhood to excel as she did. Jessica Chastain characterized this person flawlessly in her role. The bits of arrogance, contempt, boredom ...all of it came to life on screen. I'd give it a ten out of ten as an average person out to enjoy a movie."
"bkrauser-81-311064","8","1","4","1 January 2018"," A Sorkin Flick Through and Through
","The thing about an Aaron Sorkin script is there's little room for subtext. In between crackling paragraphs of dialogue, expertly assembled scenes of dramatic irony and dizzying explanations of complex contemporary topics, there's just not that much left for the visuals to add, other than restating what's already said aloud. This isn't a bad thing - all the above makes his television series' so re-watchable. But much like the works of Dalton Trumbo and Paddy Chayefsky, a Sorkin feature feels like it needs to overcome the eccentricities of his writing to be its own thing.<br/><br/>This is the central problem with Molly's Game a movie that at times feels too proud of its explanations to the detriment of underlining the dramatic stakes. It's a big, complicated story. It's an unwieldy story; one in which Sorkin manages to confidently wield. And with said story being told by a shrewd, uncompromising woman in the first person, its voice is very much tuned to Sorkin's frequency. It just doesn't come across as that interesting a story, at least not to the level it should be.<br/><br/>The film stars Jessica Chastain as the very real Molly Bloom; a former Olympic skier who sees new opportunities in running underground poker games for movie stars, business elites and organized crime syndicates. The film bobs and weaves through different timelines, one of which has lawyer Charlie Jaffey (Elba) defending Bloom against an FBI indictment.<br/><br/>The fluid nature of white collar crime, the fungibility of high-stakes poker with late-term capitalism, the looming possibility that Molly committed serious crimes and knows more than she's letting on, the fragile psyche of a woman trained to win suddenly made humble and the need to control powerful men to offset the impact of a stern father figure; all of this comes across as text instead of subtext. With such obvious messaging, your reaction to Molly's Game is fully dependent on your ability to latch on to the film's minutia which is gleefully recounted from Molly Bloom's frank perspective. I for one have always been entranced with Sorkin's ability to turn exposition into its own reward, so I for one was going along with the ride. You may not be.<br/><br/>And while it might be one thing to write a movie like Molly's Game, it's another thing completely to direct it. As a novice director, Sorkin just isn't far enough removed from the power of his own prose to fully assess how to make everything come to life on the screen. He's by no means a bad director; he's just making himself redundant. When director David Fincher took on The Social Network (2010) he amplified necessary information while telling his own sub-textual and purely visual story. Here it feels like we're just watching a girl-power version of Rounders (1998); it's good and entertaining, it's just not vital.<br/><br/>None of this is the fault of lead actress and new-feminist patronus Jessica Chastain, who by now has elevated playing smart, driven women to a spiritual movement. She takes the breakneck pacing and wit of the script, parries it with her own signature grit and allure, packages it all into a performance that takes your breath away then says, ""what's next"" without breaking a sweat. She carries the film with so much confidence and attitude that if you'd asked me what I thought of Molly's Game just after I'd saw it, I'd just giggle and say ""see it"". A week has gone by and I'm feeling a little less entranced. <br/><br/>Molly's Game is by no means a bad movie; it's just not on the same level as The Social Network (2010) and A Few Good Men (1992). It's more on par with a pretty decent episode of The West Wing (1999-2006), which is to say it has a lot of fun moments but lacks clear resolution and a certain level of depth. Regardless, I can't help but love Molly's Game. It's less the love of an outright fan and more the love expressed by Molly's demanding father played by Kevin Costner. I'm happy with it, proud of it even but part of me was still expecting just a little bit more from it."

It's very sad when movie people do not understand that meticulousness doesn't translate into entertainment. I didn't sign up for a class or two with Mr. Sorkin about How to play poker, how to plan the perfect high end game, etc. I was looking for a story, something to connect with. And it isn't here. This is a tedious, emotionless, movie - full of impeccable writing, many details that I'm sure are all correct, and characters Jason Bateman would have a field day with.

Then you had the downfall and decline of her empire with the FBI knocking on her door. <br/><br/>The biggest issue with this film was directing and writing. Careful directing, writing and perhaps a killer soundtrack could have made this a great film because it had all the elements. There were so many unnecessary elements such as Molly's skiing which had no material part to play besides she used to like skiing as a child, so what does it have to put with running Poker games? There were also family issues with her father that were kind of unnecessary, I could see it was to give more depth to Molly but this wasn't explored as much so those scenes didn't add value. It seemed this film was trying too hard to be many things at once. It would have worked better if it was more about the rise and fall of Molly's empire and it might have made more sense to have a linear story instead of a back and forth. <br/><br/>Overall decent but needed a few tweaks. <br/><br/>7/10"

"ferguson-6","7","1","6","24 December 2017"," Molly and X and FBI
","Greetings again from the darkness. Aaron Sorkin's dialogue is like a rap battle with proper grammar and no down-beat. He must have been abused by pregnant pauses and moments of silence as a kid, as his screen banter gives new meaning to 'the fast and the furious'. This latest is his directorial debut, but his loquacious diatribes have previously tested our attention spans in such films as STEVE JOBS, MONEYBALL, and of course, THE SOCIAL NETWORK (for which he won an Oscar).<br/><br/>Molly Bloom's memoir is the adapted source material, and though her story might be a bit challenging to show, there is certainly much to tell ... which is right in Mr. Sorkin's wheelhouse. The verbal sparring amongst characters rarely pauses, and when it does, we have Molly immediately jumping in as narrator and guide. The ultra-talented Jessica Chastain (ZERO DARK THIRTY) takes on the Molly role, and narrates her back story at break-neck speed (there is a pun in there). We learn her psychologist father (Kevin Costner) pushed her hard as a kid and she became off-the-charts intelligent while also being a world-class downhill skier. <br/><br/>A freak accident ended her athletic career, and after deciding to delay law school, Molly found herself working for a real estate agent in Los Angeles. Soon he got her involved with hosting the high-stakes underground poker games he ran for local celebrities, and being a quick study, she was soon running and managing her own games. When Molly was forced to take her game to New York, the players transformed from movie stars and professional athletes to business magnates, hedge-fund managers and, unbeknownst to her, the Russian mob.<br/><br/>Don't mistake this for a poker movie. Cards and chips are everywhere, but this is Molly's story, and Sorkin wisely simplifies the poker details and focuses more on Molly's brilliant strategy to build her business. Of course, there wouldn't be much to this were it just rich people playing poker. Less than a decade in, Molly is arrested in an overblown FBI sting featuring 17 armed agents at her pre-dawn door. The charges ranged from money-laundering to hedge-fund fraud to dealings with the Russian mob. <br/><br/>The criminal charges lead Molly into the offices of defense attorney Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba), who is reticent to take what appears to be an unwinnable case. The Sorkin back-and-forth kicks into full gear as Molly and Jaffey expertly verbally spar until she convinces him that she is adamant in not wanting anyone else to get hurt - even if it might save her proverbial rear-end.<br/><br/>Although Sorkin doesn't name names, it takes very little research effort to determine some of the featured players in Molly's games. Hints are provided such as ""green screen"", New York Yankee player, and Oscar winner. Michael Cera is identified only as Player X, but it's quite obvious he is playing the noted green screen actor, and he does a nice job in a small, but vital role. The rest of the cast offers up colorful work: Jeremy Strong as Molly's first boss, a very funny Chris O'Dowd, Brian d'Arcy as ""Bad Brad"", Justin Kirk as a rock star, Angela Gots as the wise table dealer, and the always great Bill Camp as Harlan, whose story highlights the true risk in this supposed game of skill. Graham Greene has a nice moment as the judge hearing Molly's case, and it's likely the first time he and Kevin Costner have appeared in the same film since DANCES WITH WOLVES.<br/><br/>At times the film and story bear a slight resemblance to THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, but mostly it's one woman's journey through entrepreneurship and a web of legalities. Arthur Miller's ""The Crucible"" is used as a comparable for protecting one's own name, as well as a life lesson for Jaffey's young daughter. Writer Sorkin predictably surpasses first time director Sorkin, and never is that more obvious than a cringe-inducing father/daughter scene on a park bench near the end of the film. It's designed to wrap up Molly's inspiration and influence, but plays like a cheap Hollywood ploy to mop up loose ends. Molly deserved better, and fortunately most of the movie delivers."

I understand that this was supposed to be all about Molly Bloom, but what's the point in making a movie that solely relies on narration throughout the whole thing? The only scenes I enjoyed were the poker scenes, but even that couldn't save the movie from being the piece of big warm turd that it is. I don't understand where the 8/9/10 stars ratings came from and I don't think it is deserved. The characters, including Molly herself in the movie, have no redeeming qualities. I didn't feel sympathy, I didn't feel sad, I didn't feel angry. Not once did I feel any sympathy for the characters. It was bland. This movie's focus is on Jessica Chastain's rack and the role she plays as Molly as such an ""empowered"", ""brave"", ""strong"" woman who talks too much about how educated she is and how hard her life is because her dad was too rough on her and cheated on her mom. I couldn't even even follow along with the dialogue at some points because she JUST WOULDN'T SHUT UP. There were also plenty of scenes that tried to tug at my heart strings and failed miserably.

","Molly's Game delivers on two fronts: a deep story about a flawed human being in search for success and remembrance and a criticism on the dynamics of gambling. Jessica Chastain as Molly navigates us through a good performance, not mediocre, but definitely not memorable. I did not really cared for her experience that much, because she didn't manage to evoke any strong feelings from me. She remained too impassive for prolonged periods of the film, to the point that I did not care about her success in her business. The movie was entertaining. For a person that is not an avid poker fan and knows little to none on the dynamics, this was fresh and detailed. The movie delivered a way for the amateur to feel comfortable and understand the story engagedly.<br/><br/>I appreciate the profound display of Molly's life and motivations. The movie felt like it was going through the experience of many characters rather than have a prominent protagonist. What kept me always at least interested in the protagonist were the continuous gestures of analysis of her intentions and experiences in a relatable way. Some gestures felt a bit serendipitous or forced into the story, but it was not a drastic change that ruined the whole experience of the movie. The voice-over and dialogue felt a bit too fast paced for my taste, but it also added vitality and flavor. I am usually more irritated by a slow pace that disperses my attention than a fast-paced dialogue that might not give enough depth to the narrative but keeps me immersed.<br/><br/>I appreciated the subtle criticisms of gambling that occurred in the movie. Yes, it is talking about a woman that was able to escape legal consequences from starting an illegal gambling ring, but it also details the negative emotional, physical, and mental repercussions of immersing oneself into those environments. In no way did she remain unscathed. She went through a complex transformation of character and integrity that was dignified.<br/><br/>The story carries the movie. It is really eventful and descriptive, but uses too much voice-over and does not engage our imagination. Still an entertaining movie."
"eminkl","6","0","1","18 April 2020"," I liked it, I didn't love it.
","Aaron Sorkin writes and directs this adaptation of an underground poker entrepreneur's almost-tell-all autobiography. As Sorkin's style is typically very polarizing, I figured we might as well get his name out of the way first. He's got his fingerprints all over this, especially (as ever) in the film's breathlessly snappy, long-winded dialog. As a fan, I'll gladly eat that stuff up, though I'd rank this one near the bottom of his extended portfolio. It lacks the thick tension of A Few Good Men, the untamed energy of The Social Network, the relentless motor of Moneyball. In conforming another writer's work to the screen, Sorkin's writing feels restrained, less electric. It brings us one great, big, passionate speech - powerfully delivered by an impassioned Idris Elba - but there seems room for two or three more. A protagonist who's generally cold and unlikeable, withdrawn and specter-like in her own story, doesn't make things easy on the first-time director. Molly is a complicated character that we never completely figure out. When she enjoys a brief emotional breakthrough near the film's climax, it doesn't quite feel like she's earned it. She has a few tough run-ins with shady characters and uncaring g-men, but it never feels like she's seriously at risk. Things just always seem to turn out in her favor, which leads to a rather flat ending. It's an interesting story, and the plot is well-structured to keep audiences from feeling pummeled by the thick splashes of word soup. It avoids most of the major pitfalls of a film that revolves around Texas Hold 'em, too, though in fairness the game itself is never actually the focus. I liked it, I didn't love it."

This makes it hard to root for her, and I was actually awaiting her demise gleefully. There's no denying her smarts, and the way she ran her enterprise was a testament to that. Other then my hatred of the main character, the movie had some entertaining parts and characters. I actually enjoyed micheal cera's role as ""player x"".

Her father (Kevin Costner) and her Lawyer (Idris Elba) both do a credible job of acting although her father's lines, especially at the end, seem a bit contrived , not at all natural or realistic. And that is of course where the film falls short, a film whose narrative does not flow naturally. I liked it, would recommend watching it but don't expect too much. I think a different director could have done so much more with this story which is so compelling and unpredictable , the film doesn't capture the real life story as well as it could have."
"Criticalstaff","6","0","4","25 March 2020"," Too verbose for it's own good
","It's an okay movie. It is by far not a masterpiece but it is enjoyable and depicts the world of underground high-life poker games. It feels like a mash-up between Hustlers (2019) and Rounder (1998). But it is not dumb and superficial like the former and does not really have the charm and wit of the latter. So the movie does not really bother you, but at the same there is nothing special or unique in it, a part from the ""unbelievable"" story.<br/><br/>The movie has two parallel timelines: in one timeline, we follow Molly's life as if we are reading the biography. It is kinda flat and boring. Molly comes off as pretentious and unlikeable. I guess that was on purpose, because the real movie happens in the second ""present"" timeline where Molly is on trial and Idris Elba tries to keep her out of jail.<br/><br/>That split is somewhat interesting. The problem is that the movie does not really do anything with it. The clever way to tell this story through the book through the trial does not really lead anywhere.<br/><br/>Because Molly's story itself is told in a very descriptive and straightforward way: she goes somewhere, she meets someone, and she does something. The characters are fine but there is nobody to root for really. There are no twists and turns. There are no reveals. There is not a scene where Molly breaks a sink on top of the prosecutors head, they learn that their mommies have the same name and decide to fight the mob together.<br/><br/>There are no obstacles to overcome or unforeseen difficulties. And on top of all of it happens through know-it-all Molly. (The film kinda wants to show that she was not at the beginning of the movie but that is who she becomes because of her experiences but it is never really addressed)<br/><br/>It is only very late in the movie where Kevin Costner character comes in and gives the movie a bit of soul. I actually liked that scene very much. But the more I think about it the more I realise it's fake. The scene is very short and also very blunt. They sit on a bench and Kevin Costner tells us what the characters' feelings are towards each other. It is not by any means actually smart. But because it answers a lot of, until then unspoken, questions it feels good. Kevin Costner come in 2 hours into the movie and announces that Molly has daddy issues. Yes thank you finally someone says something smart!<br/><br/>I would actually appreciate a movie that challenges our perception and that dare present a protagonist that is flawed, unlikeable, or lacking self-awareness. But if you do there must something else. Like in The wolf of Wall Street, or even Rounders. The characters are flawed, but they have charm, they are interesting. We want to spend time with them, we want to know them, what they are doing, what they are scheming.<br/><br/>In Molly's Game, we despise Molly. And we stick with her, not unlike the characters in the movie, only because she promises to take us to these exclusive extravagant confidential Hollywood/elite parties. But then we get there, and it's rather lame. There is Michael Cera, who is not even playing himself and some drunk Irish guys. It is underwhelming.<br/><br/>There is a bit of talk about finance and the impact of the 2008 financial crisis, which is why it made me think of Hustlers. If you are looking of a movie about that and interested in that era, then yes this is a better movie, but that is not saying much, but it only superficially touches on the subject.<br/><br/>I would not really recommend this movie, unless you are fascinated by the lives of the rich and powerful, in which case this movie is fairly accurate: they pay a lady 10 000$ to have snacks in a hotel room.<br/><br/>I have added one point to my rating because Jessica Chastain's cleavage has more screen time than she does."

","I tried watching a different movie with the same actress in the lead, also playing a character that most definitely broke the law: MS. SLOAN. I found the main character thus superficial and not likable, appealing to the ballsy kind of speak that only impulsive idiots would find gratifying, that I turned it off after ten minutes.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the acting was spot on, but MOLLY's GAME has a different angle and it gave me something I didn't find in Ms. Sloan: a character to both care for and root for, or at least hope that in the end she would find good cause to live for.<br/><br/>Not withstanding that I can't tell in how far the real Molly would make me feel the same, everyone in the story is very human and also very flawed. Not in one way, but in many. Personally I'd rather trade knowing how to cook a bit for all the glitz and the glam in the world, because it's something you make and get to enjoy, while knowing what effort went into it, but I can't say I blame people for wanting to enjoy life.<br/><br/>The only thing that bugged me is how much the important player in the game at the table would always break with gentlemanly conduct and proper Poker conventions. What he did was unsportsmanlike and a metaphorical knee breaker. So I do love Poker and the culture it's supposed to adhere to... Just another thing to to some extent enjoy about this movie.<br/><br/>Great story. Heartwarming ending with a bit of a tear.

I believe that the adaptation Oscar nomination was well deserved, although I hadn't read the book. But the narration is a very strong negative point.<br/><br/>There was simply too much of narration; it seems that Jessica Chastain was just reading a book. There was some clearly unnecessary narration, making it redundant (it's a movie, so why don't let the images tell the story?) or even boring. It reminded me of The Wolf Of Wall Street, but badly executed, and you should consider that The Wolf has 3 hours length.<br/><br/>Bonus points for the female empowerment: it was very strong, but subtle when necessary, very clever, natural, and respects the public intelligence, different from other new movies that clearly just uses it as marketing. It shows the women character in a delicate point of viewing. In other words, it is a great piece of work from the director.<br/><br/>I finished the movie with the sensation of a good story bad executed only due the narration; if it wasn't for that I would give maybe 7 stars.

I normally don't mind a voice-over, but with this movie it was used strictly to give information. It had kind of a flat effect and there was very little personality in it. This was a very nice directorial debut for Aaron Sorkin who is a highly accomplished screenwriter. Clearly, he has studied the craft of directing and he knows what he is doing, but he doesn't have that special touch that great directors have.

"MovieManChuck","Null","0","2","17 August 2018"," Highly entertaining. Very well directed and acted.
","3.5/4<br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin has officially proven he can write screenplays AND direct! His directoral debut ""Molly's Game"" is surprisingly one of 2017's best movies. With only one Oscar nomination (Best Adapted Screenplay) this movie goes unnoticed in the midst of movies like ""Dunkirk"" and ""The Shape of Water"". However, it definitely deserves its spot as one of the year's greats.<br/><br/>""Molly's Game"" centers around Molly Bloom, a woman who fails to become an Olympic skier after an injury. She moves to LA, where she works as an assistant to a man involved in a very exclusive poker game. She learns all of the tricks of the trade from him, quits her job, and goes on to start her own game-the most exclusive table in the world.<br/><br/>The screenplay is very well written and Jessica Chastain gives a phenomenal female lead. To say the least, it is a very entertaining story, especially for those who throughly enjoy playing poker. The one flaw with this movie is the heavy-handed portrayal and narration. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but at times it fails to provoke the proper amount of empathy. He best example of Chastain's narration would be found in the opening skiing sequence of the movie, while learning about her addiction to narcotics was (in my opinion) a little bit rushed or glazed over.<br/><br/>The use of color and lighting in Molly's Game was definitely a highlight. Every color really stuck out from the screen while there was gambling, but in the more serious moments of the movie, everything was toned down including the atmosphere. The adept use of the camera and angles compliments the film all the more.<br/><br/>Molly's Game emerges as a great movie, and definitely one of 2017's biggest legacys to movie-lovers. Everything falls into place so well, and I'm excited to see Sorkin's next effort!"

His failing was in trying to outdo it. The Pithy Banter of the narration, one of the most fun parts of Goodfella's was so overdone here that I had to stop the DVD in mid-play to write this. Mr. Sorkin is an unrivaled talent, and I will always give his work deference, but in this case I think he needs to reel it back.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","17 June 2018"," Jessica Chastain's worthy Oscar bid
","""Molly's game"" is based on the true and recent story of Molly Bloom, the ""Poker Princess"" with a dubious reputation. Not knowing what the true Molly Bloom is like, I somehow suspect that Aaron Sorkin's (""A Few Good Men"", ""The Social Network"", ""Steve Jobs"") script has made her into a ""Sorkin character"", as a critic puts it, that is, a dramatized character with unparalleled verbal charismas.<br/><br/>Entirely anchored on Molly's own VO, the movie starts with an extraordinary stroke of bad luck as a result of which Molly, instead of matching her brother's achievement of an Olympic skiing champion, receives an injury that does not affect her ordinary daily life, but ends he skiing career.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie runs on two cross-cutting sequences. One is her arrest by FBI and the ensuing litigation. The other is a sequence of linear flashbacks of the trajectory of how she ended up in the present predicament. To make things simple, let's go chronologically.<br/><br/>Starting with wearing the only dress she possesses, bought from J.C. Penney for $88, working in a bar paddling insanely overpriced beer, she works her way up, step by determined step, to become the owner of the most lucrative high-stake poker club. Her success can be attributed to two ingredients, hunger (figuratively speaking) and intelligence, and one tool, Google (from which she learns everything she needs to know, particularly poker, obviously). Her intelligence is self-evident in her success, plus little things like an ability to recognize a genuine Monet instantly, by just looking at an exposed corner from the wrapping. Her hunger is lucidly explained in her VO. Poker, she intimates, is her Trojan horse to the world of high finance. From childhood she has been trained to be a champion, the initial goal being foiled by an unfortunate, freak accident. What is her goal now? To win. What? Against whom? Those are mere details, she concludes.<br/><br/>The most interesting thing about the ""present"" sequence, the litigation, is her lawyer Charles Jaffey (a fictitious character), played admirably by Idris Elba. Initially refusing to take the case as her ability to pay his fees is highly doubtful, he nevertheless makes an impulse decision right it the court, facing the judge, to announce himself Molly's attorney. The chemistry between the two of them blossoms beautifully, culminating in a passionate ""speech"" in a private meeting they have with the prosecutors, defending Molly and pleading for them to ""do the right thing"". That scene alone is good enough for an Oscar bid. <br/><br/>The proceedings and judgment of the case are all in public record and obviously the movie does not deviate from them. In addition to the brilliant dramatization with the character Jaffey, there is one that is less successful but still worth noting. Playing Molly's father Larry Bloom, Kevin Costner appears at various junctures, including playing against teenage Molly portrayed admirably by Samantha Isler. Towards the end of the movie, there is a somewhat contrived, but watchable scene of the father sitting with Molly in a park bench, playing the role not of the father but the psychologist compressing the lifelong analysis of Molly into three minutes, by asking three questions. The first reveals Molly's true addition (she has had a period of heavy drug abuse) to ""power over powerful men"". The remaining two leads to daddy and sibling issues (the latter I have coined ""Boromir-Faramir"" complex). Ultimately, it is childhood trauma of seeing dad in the act of adultery. Somewhat contrived, as mentioned."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","1","29 May 2018"," Sorkin remains a smart and captivating storyteller; ""Molly's Game"" just needs a little more vision
","Hardly any writers for film and TV can be identified by the words on the page alone, but Aaron Sorkin remains one of if not the most distinctive voice in the business, and that gives ""Molly's Game"" an immediate edge. Although Sorkin makes his debut behind the camera with this adaptation of Molly Bloom's memoir about her high-stakes celebrity-filled poker game, the film comes down to structure and verbal back-and-forth - Sorkin's calling cards as a writer.<br/><br/>Sorkin uses narration (as though Bloom is reading from her book) to navigate us through Bloom's (Jessica Chastain) backstory as a former Olympic-class skier and the rise and fall of her poker game. Interspersed throughout are scenes from a later/""present day"" timeline in which Bloom and her attorney, Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba), talk through her case and arraignment proceedings following her arrest by the FBI. The Chastain-Elba dynamic sees a lot of verbal swordplay while the narration of the storytelling scenes allows for a lot of clever and juicy setup and commentary for the scenes we're shown. This style generates a pace with a similar verve to 2015's ""The Big Short.""<br/><br/>Chastain doesn't quite have the verbal slickness of tonuge that Sorkin's writing requires of his characters, but rather than simply coming off flat, she uses that flatness to give Molly a somewhat unique sarcastic humor. The character has a cut-and-dry business-like approach, which is presumably what served her well in dealing with the rich, entitled and slimy while she was running the game. <br/><br/>Getting the next most screen time to Chastain is her cleavage, which is interesting in a film that's otherwise completely uninterested in sex or romance. Chastain's outfits and body seem to exist in a vacuum - on display for no clear purpose except that their purpose is obvious - Bloom's sex appeal was part of her brand, an unspoken component of her power that didn't need to be spelled out even though it's impossible to miss.<br/><br/>Actually receiving second billing would be Elba, who pairs with Sorkin's style very well, even though the dialogue in his scenes sometimes requires an intellectual rigor (or law degree) just to follow along. Even when Sorkin gets long-winded, however, he is pretty good about giving his scenes emotional punctuation. He digs into Bloom's psyche a lot as Jaffey tries to figure her out and presents us with a compelling, somewhat enigmatic female character.<br/><br/>The other ""psychological"" element to the film is Bloom's relationship with her father, played by Kevin Costner, a relentless figure who we are to presume is responsible for Molly's worldview and behavior. He also happens to be a psychiatrist, which makes their dynamic all the more on the nose. Costner is perfectly cast, however, and it makes Sorkin's device of using the father a lot in the story completely forgivable.<br/><br/>In totality, ""Molly's Game"" has great beats and scenes and unfolds with the drama of the best poker games, but as a work of art, it doesn't present a cohesive message, and that could well be the result of an inexperienced director. As good as Sorkin tells a story on the page and rivets us scene by scene, ""Molly's Game"" just needed to gel a little more. Still, it's a great start from someone who continues to justify the attention his name and projects receive.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"

To take a break between the end of her competitive skiing and her enrollment in Law School she moved to Los Angeles, took a couple of jobs, then fell into a job which required her to assist in legal high-stakes poker games. <br/><br/>This eventually branched out to the point where she staged and ran her own games, still legal, because she was not taking a cut, but earning a very nice living on tips from the wealthy gamblers. Because the stakes kept getting higher and her financial risk high if a gambler could not pay what he borrowed, she began to take a cut and this crossed over to illegal.<br/><br/>We have to keep in mind that this movie is based on Bloom's own book, so it is the story from her side.

","In Molly's Game (my latest review), we get a film based on a book and a true story. We also get a portrayal of a semi-protagonist who's in way over her head. Finally, we get the biggest amount of wayward chit-chat ever put on celluloid. Yup, this is Aaron Sorkin's sphere and we're just passing through it.<br/><br/>Sorkin penned ""Game's"" screenplay so you know the actors words will be juicy and expository to the nth degree. You also know that Sorkin's work will have hints of cynicism and cruelness. Finally, you know that Aaron Sorkin will be making yet another cameo appearance. With ""Game"", he plays an underground poker player that's just hanging out.<br/><br/>Anyway, Molly's Game has a similar arc to The Social Network (which is also written by Sorkin). And although ""Game"" isn't quite as invigorating, weighty, or compelling as ""Network"", it's still worth recommending.<br/><br/>Edited tightly (even at 140 minutes), completely dialogue-driven, and containing ferocious performances from the likes of Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba, Molly's Game is about a former skier turned illegal Hollywood poker game runner.<br/><br/>""Game"" dodges between flashbacks and present day scenes involving Molly Bloom (Chastain) and her quest to avoid jail time. In the vein of card shark tactics, buy-ins, rakes, and Russian mafia inquests, you can safely call Molly's Game 1998's Rounders on steroids (ha-ha).<br/><br/>In total veracity, I dug the intelligence and sophistication of a flick like ""Game"". This is Aaron Sorkin's first foray behind the camera and yes, he can direct as well as write. Sorkin shoots Molly's Game with a fast cutting style, a slow-motion know-how, and a rags to riches to rags residue. It's as if he were Martin Scorsese's unequivocal proxy. Firstly, Sorkin's a steamrolling director, sledgehammering character study interludes while filling the screen with countless details (his script feels like it's 5000 words long).<br/><br/>Now despite not fully hitting its stride thematically and climatically, ""Game"" is nevertheless Aaron Sorkin in his highest comfort zone. This is him getting free rein to do whatever he wants. Basically this is Sorkin pushing the talky envelope. Sure his Molly's Game is overlong, over-explanatory, and narrative-binged (Chastain is like Ray Liotta talking twice as much as he did in Goodfellas). Regardless, this motion picture feels worldly-wised and more cultivated than your average, dumbed-down blockbuster. ""Game"" while no ""royal flush"", still checks in as the thinking person's moonlight drama. Rating: 3 stars."

For the most part, the movie works. The protagonist and the structure are strong enough to cover over any other issues. But being Sorkin-y does have some drawbacks: the occasional line that tries a little too hard, the thematic element that is a bit too pronounced.

Is it even real? It would have been so much easier for him to be stalking her outside her apartment. There is also a tendency for Aaron Sorkin to overwrite his scenes. I love his poetic machine gun style but sometimes it's too much. For example, Jaffey's outburst at the opposing lawyers is too flashy. A simpler and more effective way would be for him to slowly realize the ridiculous Molly wiretaps and have a giant belly laugh. She doesn't say a word and he tells them about the drug reference. Sorkin needs a bit of silence which would actually elevate the writing. Sometimes, he is too much of a good thing. Molly has a great story. There is a small chance that Sorkin overwhelmed the telling of it."

","A seven out of ten is a fair rating, but the story is a little bit understated. <br/><br/> The voice over is a major complaint for most people, but to be fair, it's probably the only way to explain some of the game scenes such as the calculations, odds, cards needed. In other films about sports, gambling or chess, this stuff is explained by the TV commentator. Since these were underground games, they were not aired on TV and so there's no commentator. The alternative would be to have people in the crowd explain it to each other for our benefit, or dead silence as we see poker faces computing odds and read each other's faces.<br/><br/>There are a lot of strange things too. Did Molly not have a boyfriend of some sorts? Or a friend? The film showed her having no significant other, no friends, but did not show how lonely it was for her and how money did not bring her happiness. She didn't seem all that sad to lose it either. She didn't even seem to spend it. They made her very robotic, with the exception of her father issues.<br/><br/>The dialogue was very witty and the quips were funny.<br/><br/>The film also glossed over the people that were coming to the games and the writing of her book. It could've been interesting if they integrate those two into the story - i.e. while writing her book, she learns something important about the people that were playing the game, or she discovers facts and information for her defence.<br/><br/>A good film overall."
"thefilmnotebook","7","0","3","15 February 2018"," Molly's Game: boisterous fun, but ultimately deceiving
","Can a film have too much energy? Be too lively? Those are the thoughts that ran through my head after watching Molly's Game. It seems to have too much vigour, too much rhythm. We often complain that a film doesn't have enough, but this seems to be a rare case - it suffers at the opposite end of the spectrum. It tried to be exciting through giving too much, in too little time, and as a result, it has a suffocating effect. Even at 2.5 hours running time, the film felt rushed - as it determines to tell Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain)'s whole life story, from her early skiing endeavours, to her first jobs, her hosting high stake/profile underground poker games and her court case. It is quite exhausting as we weren't given much opportunities to breathe, and trying to make sense of everything.<br/><br/>At a glance, her story is a fascinating one - enough for a memoir to be written and published. Trained to become an Olympic skier, she pulled out after sustaining severe injuries. Under the strict upbringing by her father (Kevin Costner) Discipline and determination has always been a significant part of her life, and she took this on with every aspect of her life - sometimes blindly. When the opportunity came to assist in hosting underground poker tournaments for celebrities and wealthy individuals, she embraced the idea with curiosity and enthusiasm, and eventually, starting her own company to host these games. When her clients started to include business men and mob members that are involved in illegal financial /money laundering schemes, she was arrested and charged. I think the film incites a very interesting thought - was what she did really a deplorable crime in society today? Casinos today do theoretically practice the same 'crime'. <br/><br/>This is writer Aaron Sorkin's first film as director. He also wrote the screenplay for 'the Social Network' - which was about Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and he employs a similar storytelling approach here - Molly narrates her story through a court case - in this case to her lawyer (Idris Elba). And yet something feels missing. Perhaps it's the dominant focus on Chastain, and we never fully explore the story from other perspectives, causing its unbalance. We are bombarded with a poker game after another, though the games are alluring, and fun, and we are introduced to some interesting characters (in particular Bill Camp as Harlan and Brian d'Arcy James as bad Brad), the fun dissolves after a while and the characters are quickly forgotten. It seems Sorkin is determined to swiftly move from one thing to the next thing and never really stays in the present long enough. As a result, the film loses its central stability and impact. As the film progresses, I was yearning for something more delicious - the suspense is sustained well, but it's not nurtured towards something more compelling. <br/><br/>Both Chastain and Elba gave searing performances - it is admirable how they could both speak with such impressive speed and precision! Jesse Eisenberg gave a similar performance as Zuckerberg - perhaps that has become the norm now for Sorkin's writing - this lightning speed execution. The script is sharp and incisive, rightfully reflecting Sorkin's written acuity. Even though Chastain and Elba's intensely explosive performance give firepower and temper to Sorkin's words, it is not quite enough for an affecting film. Their commanding screen presence and passionate interactions make their scenes together quite enthralling, but it adds a little too much fuel to the film's existing zeal. <br/><br/>Through paying too much attention to the glamour and the thrill of poker, Molly's Game really missed the opportunity to offer us insight into Molly's mind and motivations, apart from whether she should be charged. Maybe Sorkin realised this too, and towards the end, he managed to insert a rather quick therapy session between Molly and her father where Costner tries to analyse and diagnose Molly's mental struggles and the causes for her actions. What he said about Molly wanting to exert power over powerful men made some logical sense to me, however, it was dismissive and lacked careful analysis - just like the film itself. It seemed Sorkin hastily tried to simplify a potentially complex personality, without truly revealing Molly's vulnerable side. She has for most of her life, crafted an impenetrable armour to protect herself, and to hide her true emotions. Chastain cheekily gives us a rare glimpse of her inner turmoil - but it is too rare for us to relate to her. <br/><br/>Molly's Game is boisterous, entertaining, but it fails to build links that bring us to the real Molly. Without being emotionally attuned to her, the film feels like a conventional poker film. In fact, it is almost like a poker game itself - on the surface, it's alluring and exciting, but ultimately it is quite deceiving. After the curiosity dissolves, we are left with its desiccated core."
"bbewnylorac","7","0","2","10 February 2018"," Quite a good movie
","Aaron Sorkin's snappy script and his assured direction make for an interesting tale about a young woman's foray into the tough, risky world of elite high stakes poker. I know nothing about poker, and am not interested in it, but Sorkin keeps you interested through multiple characters, camera angles and graphics. Often, narration in a movie can be bad, but it works here, as Molly (Jessica Chastain) reminisces back in time about how she became a wealthy hostess, and what went wrong, leading to her being charged in an FBI swoop on gambling houses.
As her lawyer, Idris Alba is great - trying to get to the truth beyond her tales of her past.
Woven through the main plot is Molly's troubled relationship with her Dad - when she was a rising skiing star, he was harsh and demanding of Molly.
Kevin Costner is great as the Dad.
They do find a bit of healing at the end. 
Molly seems to get off lightly, considering she did some questionable things - including hosting players linked to the mafia and running illegal gambling games. And watching gambling addicts play well beyond any sensible amount and lose obscene amounts of money. .
I doubt she was really as naive as she is portrayed in the movie. Also, for legal reasons, there would be many parts of Molly's story that we don't have access to. 
As well as drugs, Molly became kind of addicted to gambling herself - both to the money she made, and also the intoxicating power of directing elaborate poker nights, and socialising with, and manipulating the rarefied circles of super rich businessmen who played cards for cash. 
When she was pushed out of the LA scene, she moved to New York and flourished, but also attracted mafia thugs. 
Her life struck me as very hollow and cold. I guess she does realise this. It would be interesting to see what she did next."

","Molly's Game is based on a true story in which a smart, Olympic-level skier lawyers up after the feds catch wind of her exclusive, underground - celebrity and mobster riddled, million dollar per hand - poker ring and seized all of her assets as part of a rico case. Yeah, Aaron Sorkin was the right man to write this one. Incidentally, this was also his directorial debut, and while he doesn't appear to be the next Spielberg, he did a really good job, and I'd happily see another film made under his charge.<br/><br/>Like all of his work, the dialogue was written sharp, fast paced, and melodic. I realize some find this annoying, but I really can't get enough of it. The only obvious problem with the film was, at a running time of 2h 20min, it was almost a half hour longer than it had to be. But if that's the cost we have to pay to listen to his never ending barrage of buttery quips, deal me in.<br/><br/>The acting was aces all around, especially from Jessica Chastain who was the perfect choice for the titular character and the main reason it worked so well.<br/><br/>It's not an easy thing to write a story without adding a major love story plot (seriously, try to name three movies that don't have one - you'll be able to get there, but it'll take a while), but Sorkin almost never needs to concern himself with such story lines, and I really appreciate that. This film dealt with attraction and sexuality in terms of theme and economics, but otherwise found a way to make a full movie completely devoid of romantic love or happiness found via co-dependence. Not only did that make the ending message resonate that much harder, but it also scored points with me simply for the fact that when you're making a movie starring two people as insanely attractive as Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba, it would never have occurred to me to not take the story at least somewhat that direction.<br/><br/>Deep down this is a movie about strength of character and redemption and finding your way back home. It's no coincidence it came out during holiday break, it encompassed everything the holiday is supposed to be about. That being said, come on. Drugs and illegal high-roller celebrity gambling and stuff. What's not to like?<br/><br/>Prescriptions

","First of all, this is a well made movie with excellent performances. Both Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba give Oscar worthy performances. Having said that, the movie is overlong and has WAAAY too much talk. From the opening scene, which gives boring details about ski jumping (who cares -- just cut to the accident which ends Molly Bloom's athletic career and get into he story) to endless, endless unnecessary details about poker terminology, where Molly buys her dresses, what brand of liquor she buys. what labels are on the cheese she serves (who cares?). Aaron Sorkin is a hugely talented TV writer and producer but he seems to have ignored the first rule of film-making and that is that you show, don't tell. EVERYTHING that is shown on the screen is explained in voice over by Chastain, who seems to have been forced to read the book aloud as well as act in the movie. The result is a talk-fest that kills any chance this movie might have at the box office in foreign countries, where action takes precedence over dialog. At two hours and twenty minutes this movie is about half an hour too long. Molly Bloom is the kind of role that actresses would kill for but all the damn talk just wears the viewer down. If ever there was a case of over-writing on the part of the writer, this is it. A shame as the story is there, the performances are there but everything is explained down to the minutest detail that leaves the viewer overwhelmed and drowning in the unnecessary verbiage."
"Red_Identity","Null","0","2","20 January 2018"," Entertaining
","I would say that this is definitely an entertaining film. It's a bit too fast-paced in its storytelling and editing, but it is Aaron Sorkin so that's to be expected. What keeps it strong throughout are the strong performances, particularly Jessica Chastain in the title character. Chastain is a great talent, and she makes this character work in such thrilling ways. I'm not sure if I personally think she gave one of the five best leading actress performances of the year, but that kind of attention is not unwarranted. Overall, this film is recommended, although it's not a masterpiece by any means."

","Nothing was really bad at some point in this movie yet expect from the great narration and the poker game, there wasn't much fun out of the movie. Molly's Game is one of those great biography movie with a great cast and a well told story, yet it ain't The Wolf of Wall Street, it tried it's best to look like it but wasn't as funny or trhilling and fun as The Wolf Wall Street.... still don't miss understand me I know these two movies are really different, I just find the main vision in both of them kind of simillar. <br/><br/>THE GREAT-!:<br/><br/>Chastain, this movie is chastain's movie, she is incredible as Molly Bloom, she knows her character and her vision on the character is huge she gives a lot of efforts on her character. Still she ain't the only great actor in it, Idris Elba gives a great performances as Molly's Lawyer. We add Micheal Cera, Chris O'Dowd, Brian d'Arcy James and Bill Camp who also played well and were great poker gambits ! <br/><br/>The poker scenes is another great thing about this movie, helped by the cast and the characters developpement we had some great excitting, funny poker game.
With great narations by Chastain and some really nice transitions with a zoom at every players face those poker scene's have to be the best scenes out of this movie.<br/><br/>The characters, as small as some were they were nice, such as a small cameo by a Stranger Things star know as Joe Kerry who played a small great character, these small character are fun and well put in the story. Bill Camp, Brian d'Arcy James and Micheal Cera characters were really good, they all had their story and really felt like people every knows in is life, such as the poker adict, the wise thief, etc, you get it....<br/><br/>
THE BAD-!:<br/><br/>Runtime, it was too long way too long some scenes were boring and way too long and unecessary.....<br/><br/>Predictable, the ending is predictable and does not leave a mark in your hearts, like I mean at this point we are all like ''ok cool, it over wow that was an obvious bad ending'' .<br/><br/>That's pretty much it, it's a great film, a well-made biography that needs time to be taken seriously even tho it mean seem slow and boring it ain't some stuff is really enjoyable and you have to watch it for Chastain performance! 
8/10 for me !"

","This movie is unexpected in its level of depth, for sure. I went to it thinking it would be a typical poker type thriller movie, and the advertising is a little misleading for the film, because I think it gives this impression. Instead, we get a complex and intelligent ""deep"" type of film, about important, meaningful things such as family relationships and how the past can have lingering effects on peoples lives, and lasting consequences. If you like drama type movies with lots of character depth, and a movie that has lightning quick dialogue - you have to always be paying attention - the movie assumes the viewer is intelligent and is not watching it for cheap thrills or for shallow reasons, if seeing it in the right frame of mind, you will find this to be a very interesting movie."
"jboothmillard","7","0","3","14 January 2018"," Molly's Game
","I saw the trailer for this movie before the end of 2017, it looked interesting, then I realised it would be a contender during the upcoming Awards Season, so that gave me more reason to watch it, it is the directorial debut of writer Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men, The West Wing, The Social Network, Steve Jobs). Based on the memoir Molly's Game: From Hollywood's Elite to Wall Street's Billionaire Boys Club, My High-Stakes Adventure in the World of Underground Poker by Molly Bloom. Basically Molly Bloom (Golden Globe nominated Jessica Chastain) as a young woman was a competitive skier, at one time ranked third in North America for women's skiers, but she was forced to stop after an accident whilst competing, due to the curvature in her spine. In her search for a new career in Los Angeles, Molly finds a job working for Dean Keith (Jeremy Strong), doing odd jobs, then she discovers the world of poker, and the fortunes it could bring. Using contacts from Dean's mobile phone, she invites a number of wealthy men, and some celebrities, to a high-stakes poker game, she uses the help of the internet to help her work out all the rules and regulations to make sure it runs smoothly. Having made a tidy sum on her first night, Molly decides to create an underground poker empire, renting a premise and hiring high class women as waitresses, her players include Hollywood celebrities, athletes, business titans and the Russian mob. Molly makes sure to go through all the channels to make sure what she is doing is completely legal, she soon gains a number of regular players, who are prepared to gamble and potentially lose fortunes, both the good and the bad players. Soon enough, it becomes apparent that what she is doing may not be strictly legal, so she moves to New York City to set up a new ongoing poker game business, renting hotel rooms, but no longer inviting celebrities. Of course, Molly runs into a number of problems, trouble with the Russian mob, facing bankruptcy, and she delves into drinking and taking illegal drugs, until finally she decides to end her business for good. A decade later however, Molly is arrested in the middle of the night by the FBI, and brought in for questioning, facing federal charges, for money laundering and illegal sport gambling operation, her only ally is criminal defence lawyer Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba). However, her only support believes there is much more to the story of the poker empire Molly had than the tabloids reported, and that she has written in her book, so he presses her to reveal everything that she has left out. In the end, following a court session, Judge Foxman (Graham Greene) drops the numerous charges, deciding that there are more serious crimes to be examined, Molly is fined $1,000, and sentenced to a year probation, and 200 hours community service. Also starring Kevin Costner as Larry Bloom, Michael Cera as Player X, Chris O'Dowd as Douglas Downey, Bill Camp as Harlan Eustice, Brian d'Arcy James as Brad and Claire Rankin as Charlene Bloom. Chastain looks glamorous and is fantastic as the Olympic skier turned casino queen, nicknamed the ""poker princess"", Elba is great support as the sceptical lawyer, and special mention goes to Costner as the overbearing father, his best scene is on the bench with his daughter, where they are both brutally honest with each other. You don't necessarily have to know a lot about poker, I certainly don't, but knowledge about the complexities of business and making money will help, what could have been a dry and complicated matter is given life by the fast-paced editing and a snappy script full of razor-sharp dialogue, a terrific crime drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for Aaron Sorkin, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Very good!"
"mt-95256","7","0","3","12 January 2018"," A Winning Hand for Aaron Sorkin's Directorial Debut
","TL;DR<br/><br/><ul><li>Captivating plot, but starts to run out of steam in the second half</li><li>Poker games are fun and exciting</li><li>The script is perfect, with plenty of examples of witty, snappy dialogue</li><li>Wonderful cast - particularly Elba and Chastain</li><li>A promising directorial debut</li></ul><br/><br/>---------------------------------<br/><br/>Much like Tarantino, Aaron Sorkin has come to be known for his writing; impressive, snappy dialogues that have a real impact, are clever and funny and certainly add to a film's quality. However, unlike Tarantino, he's not known for his directing - yet. Confined for the most part to screenwriting, Molly's Game signifies a first for Sorkin, letting him trying his hand at directing as well as writing, something many have hoped to see for some time. So how does his directorial debut fare? On the plus side, Molly's Game is an enjoyable, well-done film that sucks you in and gives you a captivating plot with the sort of snappy and detailed script we have come to expect from this master writer. Despite this, there's still not much that lets the film stand out and be special - as you might guess, Sorkin's script stands out the most. Still, this doesn't mean he should hang up the directing hat just yet, because there's plenty to enjoy in his debut.<br/><br/>The story is an intriguing one (especially since it's based on reality) and the writing emphasises this, really sucking you in from the beginning. But watching countless poker games and listening to complex legal jabber weighs the film down, making it run out of steam about halfway through. Though frequent, the poker games are exciting and rarely cease to be fun to watch, with Sorkin managing to make the tension on the table jump through the screen to the audience. This extends to other elements, particularly the way it's filmed and the narration by Chastain. The style and visuals are impressive for a first-time director and work very well - clearly Sorkin understands what makes film a special and unique medium. However the process of building the 'business,' while initially fun, ends up wearing thin as things get more complicated, slightly repetitive and not explained too much. On top of this, flicking back and forth from the poker games to Molly's scenes with Jaffey, complicate the narrative in an already slightly complex plot (although with a character like Jaffey being played by Elba, it's very welcome to have him peppered throughout the movie). Sorkin also certainly adds messages and a heart to his film, but this can often be lost in the end amongst the beefy plot.<br/><br/>Despite the occasionally convoluted plot however, so long as an audience has enough attention, it's not too hard to jump back on board if you get lost. This is mostly due to fantastic writing, something we have come to expect (although still take for granted) from Sorkin. Whatever flaw that can be found in the film, can equally be made up for by witty, fast-paced writing, which embellishes the whole film and adds a tremendous amount of depth to the characters. Once again he proves himself to be one of the master bards of our generation. At times though you just want the script to slow down and relax, for us to feel comfortable and not be prepared for constant verbal jousting; it can be exhausting, especially around the point where the film begins to run out of steam.<br/><br/>Still it's brought back to life and we're made to be constantly aware and entertained by the wonderful cast who are all on top of their game. With a decent supporting cast including the likes of Michael Cera, who seems to slowly be distancing himself from Superbad's Evan (a character he seems to play frequently), Chris O'Dowd and Kevin Costner, proving to be a much more interesting father than in Man of Steel. The centre-point of the film revolves around Idris Elba and, even more so, Jessica Chastain, who really are the heart and soul of the movie - along with the script, of course; but who knows how this script could have fared with another cast? They are both excellent and play off each other very well, their scenes with one another electric at all times. Chastain is the one who really steals the scenes though, consistently captivating to watch and apparently effortlessly showing the progression of Molly.<br/><br/>All in all, Molly's Game is an impressive first time directing for Sorkin and shows his transition from writing to directing will hopefully be a smooth one, particularly if he can direct his own wonderful scripts. At times you can tell he consulted with friend and fellow director David Fincher (with whom he worked with for The Social Network), so I think we're yet to really see his own style and what he can really bring to the director's chair. A promising debut with a top-notch script, intriguing plot and excellent performances from the leads, Molly's Game is a winning hand."

","'Molly's Game' is one of those 'based on a true story' films where you never really know quite how much has been based on true events and what's been added to make it a better story. However, whatever the split, I quickly found I was able to suspend my scepticism and just enjoy the film for its entertainment value.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain plays the titular 'Molly' - a professional skier involved in a freak accident on the slopes at a young age. Then, and this is one of those moments where something is so unbelievable it is probably totally true, she changes her career and becomes host to exclusive high-stakes poker games for the rich and famous. Yes, there is a bit of a leap there, but, don't worry, it's not quite so glossed over in the film.<br/><br/>The story itself is one of those than bounces around through time. One moment you're with the adult Molly who's standing trial for taking back-handers at the table, the next you're with her teenage incarnation who's in the middle of a row with her - slightly overbearing - father, played by Kevin Costner. However, that's not as jarring as it sounds and you shouldn't be confused as to what time period you're in. However, because of this way of telling the story, you're - sort of - told how it ends near the beginning, but, again, there's enough intrigue to make you keep watching.<br/><br/>Plus, of course, Molly's lawyer is played by Idris Elba, who, of late, I felt hasn't been getting the 'meaty' roles he deserves. Well, he's not in it as much as fans may like (being that he's only in the 'present' and never in her past), but when he is there he does what he does best and steals the spotlight.<br/><br/>Then you have the direction - it's possibly more stylish than your average biographic drama is used to. It comes across as something between a Guy Ritchie film and 'Ocean's Eleven.' But then it is - technically - a crime caper, albeit a 'real life' one, so perhaps the style of direction is fitting. It works either way. It's over two hours long, but never really feels as long as it could do. You'll find yourself rooting for the characters and maybe even trying to Google who the mysterious 'Player X' really is. I have my ideas."
