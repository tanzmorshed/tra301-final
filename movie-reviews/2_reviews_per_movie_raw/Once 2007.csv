","This is a wonderful, fun and touching movie. At a screening at Sundance 2007 the director described it as a musical, and it really is. The primary actors are musicians and their songs tie the movie together and tie you to them. Although the primary cast aren't actors as a first profession, they are very natural together and the film flows very well because of it. Everyone involved in this film has a great passion for music, and it is very infectious. It is one of the few films I have seen in 7 years at Sundance that received a standing ovation. <br/><br/>From the Sundance film guide: ""A Dublin busker, who ekes out a living playing guitar and repairing vacuum cleaners for his dad's shop, meets a young Czech immigrant who sells roses on the same street. She likes his song, and what's moreshe has a broken vacuum cleaner! They soon find themselves playing music together in a nearby music store (since she can't afford a piano, the owner lets her play his floor models). Over the course of a week, they form a musical rapport and, newly inspired, decide to record an album. <br/><br/>Once may loosely be classified as a musical, but it has a refreshing vérité inflection. Conceived by director John Carney as a ""video album,"" it sports a scrappy, unembellished naturalism. Carney took a risk in choosing professional musicians over professional actors, but Glen Hansard (of the well-known Irish band the Frames) and Marketa Irglova (a Czech singer/songwriter) are not only remarkably charming together but they're equally adept with the more melancholy shades (Hansard's lonely soul, stuck on an old flame; Irglova struggling to support a mother and daughter). Burdened and brokenhearted, their musical bond is the heart of the film and of their love. <br/><br/>Great music aside, what makes this film special is how little effort it seems to exert. If it's possible to be blindsided by simplicity--a light touch, Once does it.""  John Nein"
"mjjusa-1","10","561","635","9 June 2007"," The heart has reasons that reason knows nothing about
","I write these for friends and if you love movies you are a friend: I saw a movie last night that was so good that I have spent the last hour looking up information about it on the Internet Movie Data Base and related links. I have included the Fox Searchlight website for the movie at the bottom of this review so you can hear the music. So now I know that is was made in 17 days and at a cost of less than $150K and reflects a Dublin of 10-15 years ago when Dublin was much poorer and more working class.<br/><br/>And, I would be much poorer in life and spirit, and my heart, like most of us, covered in scar tissue from life, would not seem so vulnerable and new, if I had not seen this movie. A simple story of a street musician in Ireland, singing covers during the day for Euros, and his own music at night for cents. A verging on middle aged man, still living with his Da, repairing vacuums in a tiny shop and writing songs to his lost love in his tinier bedroom. Approached by girl, an immigrant, who loves his songs, understands the pain that gave them life, and soon they are in a music shop with the girl playing the piano and together they prove that art isn't produced from big budgets or green lit by ten vice presidents and that seventeen days and a pittance can make me get goose bumps just trying to write a review of what I saw in a dark theater with ten other people in a complex dominated by Shrek, Pirates, and Spiderman.<br/><br/>I knew a woman once who only read novels about unrequited love. What a wonderful phrase: unrequited love. Archaic, unrequited, love, universally known and unknown, and as a friend said about the movie and its songs: no great art came from happiness. But the movie isn't sad, it's pulsing with life and music and incident and the process of how art is made. I have always been a sucker for movies about how art is made: Shakespeare in Love, Topsy Turvey, as examples, but in both those, art that was known. In Once, on the streets of Dublin, an Irishman and a Czech girl, remind us of how, to my generation, the guitar was king, a guitar, bass, drums and piano a symphony orchestra, and there was no power like the power of rock and roll. In all generations, love sought, found, lost, and sometimes regained is the stuff that brings us to the theater, to the book, to the movie.<br/><br/>I'm in the midst of reading a book by an Irishman, a detective novel, the hero a reader, and the author uses the book to list books he likes: from one...'the body moves on, the mind stays and circles the events of the past.' This must be true of the writer/director.<br/><br/>You won't forget these people. I can't forget their songs. We should all meet, my movie loving friends, and talk about this movie in a bar in Chicago I know that has great music on the jukebox, cold cold beer, and is dark enough so we would all look good. Neil Young sang: only love can break your heart, Once asks 'how often do you meet the right person', and as fellow movie goers I ask how often can the right movie be made, shown in your local, and break/make you heart at seven of a beautiful summer's eve? It's the best movie of the year. Maybe of the last five years. But, I am not a dispassionate critic, I loved it."
"bzimmer-1","10","216","241","26 January 2007"," A must see film!
","I too saw this film at Sundance, and we were treated to a live performance afterwards by the two main characters, who are actual musicians and not actors.<br/><br/>I can't say enough good things about this film. It is bittersweet and romantic, with great music (not Irish music, but the singer/songwriter type) as the two main characters collaborate on their songs and help each other become stronger and face the romantic challenges they both are suffering from. The end of the film is wonderful and Hollywood-cliché-free! I hope this film gets the distribution it deserves, because I'm going to be telling everyone to see it."
"mattman5000","9","21","21","27 May 2007"," see ONCE twice
","If the original lead actor (Cillian Murphy) hadn't dropped out at the last minute this movie probably would have felt extremely melodramatic and clichéd, but Hansard's spot-on authentic portrayal is amazing mostly due in part to the fact that he isn't really acting but playing himself. There is also a beautiful scene involving the lead actress trying to write the lyrics to one of his songs as she is walking home from a convenience store that illustrates the creative process on a realistic level that I have never really seen done before on film. Amazing that this film was made for $150,000. The fact that they didn't have a lot of money actually, in my opinion, helps make the film that much better. There are elements of naturalism and realism working in this film on levels that are sorely missed in today's mainstream cinema. Anyone who loves music and/or learning about the creative process of writing will thoroughly enjoy this small gem of a film. The well-written script also surprisingly manages to NOT take the predictable road one might expect when making a film of this nature, which is an extremely tough task to begin with. You'll know what I'm talking about after you see it."
"moutonbear25","9","30","31","3 June 2007"," And so it happened once ...
","From the moment ONCE begins, it is clear that the experience about to be had is unlike any you've had before. A busker sings for his dollar in the street. The quality of the image is grainy; the steadiness of the camera is shaky at best. The day turns into night and the song goes from bright to dark. The passion with which it is sung is almost overwhelming and suddenly borders on off putting. From the manner in which the busker is framed, it isn't clear whether anyone is there to hear his song but his fervor brushes skepticism aside and declares that the song itself and the satisfaction derived from singing it, outweigh the importance of having someone hear it. But someone is listening after all. A young woman from the Czech Republic stands transfixed before our busker on this Dublin street and a spark ignites the flame that gives ONCE its warmth. Writer/Director, John Carney, removes all convention from the movie musical and creates a film that reads like a well-written love song about two musicians falling in love with each other and the music they create together.<br/><br/>In the early 90's, Carney left his rock group, The Frames, to pursue a career in film-making. The Frames continued on without him and new lead singer, Glen Hansard, eventually took leave to search out new musical ventures, moving from Dublin to the Czech Republic. Here he met Marketa Irglova, a classically trained pianist, and they developed a project entitled The Swell Season. Though the two are not linked romantically, their meeting and the music that came out of that became Carney's inspiration for ONCE. During the week that follows their initial meeting on the street, the two artists who are never referred to by name in the film, learn to accept that they are inexplicably drawn to each other. Given the chance, a relationship between the two could become one that would help each other grow. He would make a great father figure to her young child and she would drive him to make something of himself. Though ONCE's tone is simple, these two characters' lives are not. He has a girlfriend in London he longs to be with but feels he cannot out of obligation to his father in Dublin, while she is still married to an estranged husband whom she is unsure she has a future with. The trick then becomes to remain in the moment with each other and never allow for their relationship to go where it naturally feels it should.<br/><br/>Albeit a modern approach to a movie musical, ONCE is not so modern that it leaves the music behind. Instead the music becomes the catalyst for love. She is first drawn to him by the sound of his song. He sings it with such passion that it gives her a direct view of his soul. It is not all who are able to show such vulnerability yet when the song ends, he trips over his spoken words and nothing comes out as it should. At first, she almost seems a nuisance to him. It isn't until he hears the beautiful music she can make with her hands that the glimpse of her soul captures all his attention. Theirs is a mating ritual carried out in song. When one sings or plays, the other listens. When one cannot express the proper sentiment in words, it is music that gets the point across. When the two find themselves alone in a local musical instrument shop, they learn what it means to sing together. In order to do so, they must truly listen to the sound of the other's voice and fall into the same pace and rhythm of their notes. Their voices, as it turns out, are the perfect compliment to each other. The harmony they create leads into a song that is itself a representation of the love between them, both fragile and pure.<br/><br/>The delicate chemistry between Hansard and Irglova is framed in such a stripped fashion that it only further serves to concretize the genuine sincerity between the two. Almost entirely hand held and lit only with natural light, ONCE seems less like intricate film-making and more like layered storytelling, or perhaps more appropriately, song writing. Put simply, ONCE is like a perfectly soft song played acoustically in a park; it seeps into your soul, soothing you as the sun beats down upon your smiling face, allowing for all cynicism to melt away while your reaffirmed belief in love is sung from your mouth."
"daveygandthekeyboard","8","28","29","23 June 2007"," The moment all artists live for.
","Probably the one thing I would say about this movie that is even remotely negative, is that if you don't like the music, then you are completely out of luck. Otherwise This movie is about a Guy (no name) and a Girl (same deal) who meet on the street while Guy is busking, a side gig from his day job as a vacuum cleaner repairman. The two form a bond through music, as they jam together in a music store, then ultimately they go through a weekend recording his songs before he goes off to re-unite with his lost love. Trying to explain this movie to someone who hasn't seen it, it just seems like a movie about nothing, 'cause the plot is so spare. But everything felt true--the dialogue, the way the two musicians relate, the way it captured the feeling you get when you see something you've created become real. This movie totally won me over after the recording session, when it is early in the morning, the studio technician and the band go out to do the ""car test""--seeing if the songs still sound good on inferior speakers. It is at this point you feel this ""seizing of the sword"" moment of triumph for Guy--this is what he has worked for, this is what he has created. It is a moment that all artists live for, and this is the reason I will go see it again."
"delphine090","10","26","27","14 June 2007"," What a lovely film!
","Sometimes I can see why someone would ""hate"" a film that I love. This time I just don't see why anyone would dislike this film.<br/><br/>It's a simple, unpretentious, lovely film. I've recommended it to several people (male and female) and they've all loved it.<br/><br/>The soundtrack's lyrics hint at a very different film, with more of the predictable sex/possessiveness/anger/painful character arc thing that we usually see, and perhaps people are missing when they criticize this film.<br/><br/>I found it refreshing NOT to see those things, to know perhaps that a decision is wrenching but without the melodrama. And even more refreshing is a script that never once beats us on the head with information, but lets us ""hear"" the characters not only in the songs (in fact the lyrics are not ""on the nose"" as they generally are in musicals but instead simply add nuance, flavoring the script) but in what they don't say, and in the choices they make without exposition and explanation.<br/><br/>I didn't notice any of the technical flaws people have mentioned. Any lack of ""polish"" in the camera work only added a hint of realism to me, as if it were my eyes instead of the camera watching this vignette, as a warmly invited guest. Little time is spent showing us unnecessary views of the city, or vistas to long after. It could be anywhere in the world, because the world is reduced, for a few days, to what's important to these two people, and we fall for them as they fall for one another.<br/><br/>The film does have an ending, it's not left up in the air (contrary to some comments here) - but it may not be the one everyone wishes for, or has been conditioned to expect.<br/><br/>More than one person, including folks commenting here, have said the same thing: What a lovely film . . ."
"lisadaly","9","146","170","26 April 2007"," Excellent, gorgeous story
","I have to say I loved this film. I went to see it with a Japanese friend, and she loved it too.<br/><br/>So the plot wasn't full of 'save the world' ambitions and the good guy wasn't a millionaire playboy, but who cares? It was a gorgeous straightforward film about two people meeting at a certain time in their lives.<br/><br/>I read a quote recently about someone who'd seen the movie and came out wanting to hug everyone they met - and I totally agree. I cycled home humming the tunes and feeling like I haven't felt from a film since seeing 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. I know, I know - totally different films - but the zen-like feeling after seeing them both...<br/><br/>From a Dublin dweller, it was fun to watch the geography, as the film makers played with the locations in that certain venues were on the same street - yet it looked like the actors had to walk through town to get to them. It definitely hindered the 'who do I know in the public street' shots moments! But was interesting, as helped make Dublin be a different city to what the residents would be used to.<br/><br/>My recommendation is to just go and see it if you're on for seeing something uncomplicated, feel-good without being too mushy, comedic moments that everyone can relate to and some singer-songwriter music thrown in."
"lcrawfor2","10","22","23","27 May 2007"," This is a film you don't want to miss!
","On a ten scale, ""Once"" is a 12! It just proves that ""magic"" doesn't necessarily require a huge budget; A great script and inspired acting can carry the day. The setting ( Dublin,) is as true-to-life as you could hope for, and the characters are all a natural fit. My wife and I were sitting there for an hour and a half with this comfortable grin on our faces. (And please understand, I generally hate musicals, but this one works!) Irglova and Hansard are perfect for the roles, the camera work is magnificent, and the total experience gives one hope for the future of film. (You just need to go ""Indy"" to find the really great stuff.) Be sure to see ""Once, and don't go alone; take somebody you really enjoy being with."

","At the persistent urging of a friend, I saw ""Once"".<br/><br/>Rarely am I compelled to write a comment about a movie, let alone yearning to see said movie again - immediately.<br/><br/>I have this sinking feeling that ""Once"" won't be around much longer in theaters (God knows, we need every available screen for ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"") so give yourself a treat: go see it! <br/><br/>Be warned...you may be so affected you'll buy the soundtrack, check out all the related YouTube videos and won't be able to get it out of your head.<br/><br/>Inspired, magical."
"harte","10","132","160","9 April 2007"," A touching and honest film
","I own a movie theater on Cape Cod and recently saw this film on two occasions at the New Directors Film Festival in NYC. I met John Carney ten years ago at the Golway Film Festival where I was part of a team which was reviewing film projects. John had a five minute clip of a feature he was working on ""November Afternoon"". I stayed in touch until he finished the film. He sent me a tape it just blew me away. ""Once"" like ""November Afternoon"" is a unique film experience. The low budget feel fits the story and the music blew me away. He captures a small slice of Dublin Life, spent the summer there in 69, that seems so real and honest. Glen and Marketa bring great strength to this story and a realism that is seldom seen in American Cinema. If you want to get in the mood for this movie then get a copy of Glen and Marketa CD ""The Swell Season"" five of the songs are in the movie."
"Termin8","10","242","302","11 April 2007"," The best Irish film ever
","Don't listen to the comments left on this page by idiots who don't get the film Once is a beautiful film, in my opinion the best Irish film ever but a great film overall. Made with an almost documentary realism on the streets of Dublin (this film shows how DV is not just a fad) this film is a modern day musical but the kind of musical where scangers eye up the camera, where musical numbers take place in dirty old music shops and flats. To me this film says something about Dublin , about immigration, about music but not in a worthy annoying ""a Tigers tale"" way. A masterpiece with great central performances and amazing music."
"screenwriter-14","9","100","121","17 May 2007"," ""A Magical Film of love, music, song...and a Hoover Vacuum!""
","ONCE is a film to see and cherish for the magic of song and music combined in the setting of Dublin for a young man and woman who meet and who make wonderful music together. The only issue is she's married to a bloke in another country. But that doesn't stop them for creating a wonderful piece of music which will stay with them forever.<br/><br/>John Carney has directed and written a brilliant film which tags at your heart and makes your feet dance all at the same time. ""Guy and Girl"" are tremendous in their parts and the humor and passion they bring to their music. Dublin is such a great location for this film and it resembles London in so many of its blocks of buildings. The bond is also wonderful to see between father and son and the encouragement which the father gives his son.<br/><br/>ONCE gives you a time in your life when you meet your soul mate who brings the music to your heart you have always dreamed of...as well as a Hoover vacuum-""who knew?"" See ONCE, because ""once"" you do, you may come back for more."
"Solipsisticblog","9","11","11","10 May 2007"," ""Once"" thrills
","""Once"", the Audience Award Winner at this year's Sundance Film Festival, is a gem of a movie. I had the pleasure of seeing the film last night at the Tivoli Theater with the film's leads and director in attendance. Hoping for great word of mouth, they are touring around the country with their film answering audience questions and performing songs from the film.<br/><br/>""Once"" is a musical but not as you might expect. There are no scenes of passerbys bursting into song and dance as the leads fall in love or swelling string sections as the lovers embrace. Rather, director John Carney fashioned a stripped down, more ""realistic"" musical where the songs emerge from the leads as they perform on street corners, for friends, and in recording studios. Carney informed the audience that the film was made in only seventeen days and for only $150,000. The leads are professional musicians, but have never acted before. No one will mistake this for a big budget feature, but in the rawness of its presentation and performances the film gains extraordinary power.<br/><br/>Carney's film--which he also wrote--is a love story about waiting and deferring gratification. It's about the struggle of making ethical decisions when caught up in the fever of new love. Musicals are frequently larger than life odes to seizing the day and falling in rapturous love, so much so that you can't help burst into song. Carney subverts our expectations of the musical and presents a film about quiet, reserved lovers-to-be who struggle with the consequences of what a rapturous affair would mean to those they love.<br/><br/>But don't think the movie is a bore. Rather, it is a spellbinding and fantastic romantic film. Glen Hansard, lead singer of The Frames, stars alongside Czech singer and Dublin resident Marketa Irglova. Their musical performances are raw and powerful. Their harmonies are otherworldly and fantastic. The music is reminiscent of Damien Rice. Hearing them perform live after the film, I realized how little the recordings we hear in the film have been altered. Fans of Rice and singer/songwriter performers will enjoy this film.<br/><br/>After the multiplexes have beaten you in to a pulp striving to entertain you this summer, you would do well to seek out the quiet, haunting ""Once"". It sticks with you and has you humming on your way out of the lobby. It'll certainly make a bracing tonic to the sure-to-be-overstuffed ""Hairsprapy""."

","Once is about a young Irish busker with a torn guitar and a raft of achingly felt songs about a girlfriend he lost the year before. He works in Dublin at his dad's Hoover Repair Centre. One day as he's playing on the street a Czech woman who sells roses and cleans houses comes up and starts to talk to him. She's somewhat cool but she's also disarmingly honest. The dialogue seems understated, offhand, but the words seem to come from the heart. She plays the piano (and later reveals she's written some songs herself) and they get together to make music. Both are suffering from love affairs that went wrong. He longs for her but she keeps her distance. The simplicity of the acting makes the characters seem real, like everything else in the movie. It doesn't try too hard. It trusts its material, and it works.<br/><br/>The recording session they wangle with a group of other buskers (two guitarists and a youthful drummer) is a metaphor for this whole film. These people know nothing about recording, but they've got good material and the initially skeptical engineer winds up acknowledging that they've made a beautiful thing.<br/><br/>Once's transitions are a little awkward sometimes and its images aren't fancy, but the story moves you without having any sentimental payoffs. Kitchen sink film-making: it works if you believe in what you're doing. And have something to work with. The core of Once is the music. It's what they have to work with. The studio recording session has the good feel of things coming together: it's so strong and uncalculated-feeling, it makes the studio scene in Craig Brewer's Hustle and Flow look self-conscious. In Once the sound of the music speaks without special need for dialogue or close-ups. The real love story of Once is the love of musicians playing together. Few movies perhaps have captured any better that warmth and pleasure of making music with others.<br/><br/>People have said this is a musical. If so, it redefines the musical as some American musicals have done recently, especially Spring Awakening and Passing Strange. What makes the idea fly is that it's as if the young man and the young woman can't express what they feel for each other, and the only way they can get their emotions across is to burst into song. But the songs are their songs, not some composer's. It's all perfectly organic.<br/><br/>Perfection, it turns out, doesn't have to be perfect.<br/><br/>Starring Glen Hansard of The Frames and Marketa Irglova."

","I was lucky to have caught the trailer for ""Once"" during a movie preview. This movie hasn't been advertised as much as all the Hollywood sequels coming out. It was the music in the trailer that captured my attention. Music is indeed a powerful thing. It was then, that I told myself I had to see it. <br/><br/>After seeing it, it was everything I thought it would be and more. The story is simple and it's been told before, but its execution is one that sets this movie apart from others. It's not a typical musical, but more like a long music video. It's a story that illustrates a moment in time that we can easily relate to. <br/><br/>This movie has moments of humor and it's songs are so telling. Hansard is charming and Irglova is candid. Both are very talented musicians turned actors.The story shows a different kind of love, a friendship that provides confidence to steer the characters in the right direction for each of them which isn't always easy to do. <br/><br/>The movie is sad, funny, real, everything that life is and it gives you hope. It's about a moment that happens in life that may not come by again or may not last forever, but it just might have the greatest impact on you. I know I'll be watching ""Once"" again."

","As I've posted previously I don't really like musicals, never have, generally waayyy too cheesy for my tastes. But in the absence of something else that drew our attention we went to see Once. We were in the Cinema anyway so why not. We went mostly, I suppose, as we'd seen Glen Hansard and the Frames playing before and they were great so we thought the movie couldn't be too bad. At the end of the day we both really liked this movie, not too sentimental and the music which is written and performed by the two main characters is excellent. It irks me to see other Irish people in here with such negative views, it really seems like its something personal towards Glen Hansard. I don't know the guy whatsoever but this is about the film which is worth seeing.<br/><br/>I'd seen Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova live in Christchurch cathedral in Dublin which in itself was pretty different. I'd only been inside the cathedral once before pretty much as a tourist. During the gig he gave a solo performance which stands out in my mind as the best I've ever seen, just him and an acoustic guitar. I've seen A LOT of bands big and small so that is really saying something. If you get a chance go see them."

","The chemistry between the lead actors (two people I've never heard of) is what makes this film a treat to watch. Marketa Irglova (whoever she is and wherever she came from) has a screen presence without a doubt. The scene in the music store where she and her street musician acquaintance (Glen Hansard) first make music together is magical and worth the price of admission in and of itself. <br/><br/>This is a sweet, poignant movie that is simple yet somehow captivating to watch. Maybe I'm just a sap for love stories, but the sound track that goes with this one is good enough to help carry the story and make us really care what happens to these people. Marketa and Glen make the music, and we are caught up in their moment."

","(My Synopsis) A Guy (with no name - Glen Hansard of the Irish band Frames) is singing his heart out on the streets of Dublin for tip money. One day a Czech Girl (with no name - Marketa Irglova) stops to listen to the Guy play his music. She is very impressed by his songs and she asks if he wrote his own music. The Guy says that he writes and loves to play his own songs to himself even if the street crowd wants to hear other music. It is nice to earn tips, but that is not what his music is all about. The Guy lives at home and helps his father repair vacuum cleaners, but he has a dream of becoming a recording star. His girlfriend of many years has just left him and is now living in London. You can tell what this has done to his emotions, because it is being reflected in his new songs. The Girl who happens to have a broken vacuum cleaner also has a musical background of playing the piano and writing songs. Their music brings them together and the Girl begins to help the Guy realize his dream. They begin to share their music and their feeling for each other. They put together a band with other street players and rent a recording studio for the weekend to record two demos. This could be the start of a new and wonderful life.<br/><br/>(My Comment) The storyline is almost like a reality TV show. The people are not actors, and they are naturally doing things in their lives that they just want to do. This is not your typical Hollywood movie as to the ending and especially the costs. The writer/director John Carney made the film in 17 days for an unbelievable $130,000. John Carney did not have the expensive steady cam cameras, but he used hand held cameras with telephoto lens so he wouldn't have to get a permit to film in Dublin. You will notice the movement of the pictures and hopefully it will not give you motion sickness, because it gives the film a raw feeling which in turn makes it feel real to the audience. Hansard and Irglova are charming together and very supportive of each other. All three people were at the screening that I attended, and they had a Q&A session and sang 4 songs after the movie. The three have been friends for many years. That is why I said that the movie is like a reality TV show, where friends got together to make music. Hearing them perform live after the movie, I recognize that it was the same performance that I saw on the screen. Now as for the music, personally, I liked some of the songs, but most of the music was not the type of music that I would listen to on the radio. Overall the film will give you a unique experience and realism that we normally don't get out of Hollywood. (Fox Searchlight, Run time 1:25, Rated R) (7/10)"
"Willie-12","9","16","18","11 July 2007"," Close to Perfect
","Who would have thought? Out of all of the movies to come out this summer, the one with the least amount of special effects (make that no special effects), the one with no A-list actors, the one with a director I, and I would venture to guess that many others had never heard of, would be the best movie of the summer, and quite possibly the whole year. I am not exaggerating. This is not hyperbole here. ""Once"" is as about as close to perfect as you can get. The story is simple, and yet it is the simplicity that makes it so good. The actors actually seem like real people. This is the type of movie that almost anyone can relate to. All of us have had that one relationship in life, where if it had only been another place, or perhaps another time, things would have worked out perfectly. All of us have had those experiences in life where we know that we just had one of the best times of our lives, with someone that we really connected with, and yet we know that the time will not live on, and the person will go out of our lives just as quickly as they came in. ""Once"" captures that realness almost perfectly. It is the type of movie that will make you feel better about people. And it may just make you feel better about yourself."
"Monotreme02","8","12","13","3 November 2007"," What bitter sweetness this film stirs
","What bitter sweetness this film stirs within the deepest bowels of any viewer! And how startling it is that such a small, miniscule piece of work that stirs such emotions, that big, bloated epics many times fail to stir? Production value is low but the almost documentary-style film-making only adds to the realism. The movie was shot mostly on video and with many extended, uncut long takes quite unlike the complex, operatic set-ups we've seen in the films of Martin Scorsese and more recently in Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men, but rather simple, static shots simple depicting our two characters interacting. Most of the film is just that  the two characters interacting  but such incredible depth of emotion derives from these interactions that it is truly inspirational. The filmmakers' and actors' capturing of total and utter realism is so convincing, that the film might as well be a documentary feature about two music lovers, following them from their chance encounter and throughout the course of a whirlwind, impulsive week of music-making. But what's truly remarkable is the emotional rainbow this documentation provides.<br/><br/>The key word in this film is simplicity. The plot is as simple as it gets  a chance meeting and a week of music making. Production value is almost non-existent and the cinematography is obviously simplistic and minimalist  except for one set-up involving a crane, which seemed a little out of place for my taste. The acting is extremely minimalist and realistic; we sort of get the feeling that our two stars are very much like the characters they play in real life, much like the same feelings evoked from Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise/Before Sunset, in which we know Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy donate so much of themselves into their characters.<br/><br/>Many people have labeled this film as a modern-day musical. Well, at first I resented this statement, as all of the music in the movie is performed on-screen within the context of the film. We don't see any breaking out into song-and-dance in this film; it is all the real, actual music these two people are making on-screen and in real time. But later on I thought about it a bit, and eventually reached a conclusion that may explain why people describe the movie so. In the classic movie musicals, the songs all deal with advancing and portraying the plot. In Once, though, there is a twist: Since there isn't actually much of a plot to talk about (although the characters DO have a well-rounded arc), the songs all deal with advancing and portraying the characters' emotional states. Listen to the broken-ness of Hansard's earlier songs written about his girlfriend in London. Or to the sad longing of the lyrics Irglová writes to Hansard's as-yet-unwritten melody that he leaves her on a CD player.<br/><br/>If the songs pack a big emotional punch, the rest of the movie packs a much more subtle emotional resonance. I think this may just be one of the saddest, truest and most beautiful cinematic depictions of platonic and entirely unrequited love. Many people have said that they left this film with feelings of elation and levity. I myself found the ending extremely melancholy. It's great that both of our characters at least try to get back together with there long lost loves, but it is sad that they don't get to see each-other for one last time. It is sad to think that even if the Guy goes back to London, he may not be able to mend the wounds with his girlfriend. It is sad to think that if the Girl couldn't get along with her husband the first time, chances are that the same troubles will arise the second time around. It is sad to think that if Hansard isn't himself a stadium-filling musician in real life, his character in the movie probably also won't be one. And it is great, of course, that the film ends where it does, in their parting, and doesn't linger on what happens after the Guy arrives in London and submits his demo tape, for example. The film begins and ends in the relationship between the two people and leaves it at that. But how sad it is that when the Guy asks the girl if she loves her husband, she replies in Czech so that he won't understand ""no, I love you."" And it is saddest to think that all the beautiful, happy and good things that happen in the film can happen only once in a lifetime. As the film's tagline says: How often do you find the right person? The answer lies in the film's title: Once. Many other questions can be asked: How often do you get a chance to go from being a Dublin busker to recording a professional demo tape? How often do you get a loan from a bank teller that just happens to have a passion for what you're trying to get a loan for? How often do you get to secretly rip off your father's beloved motorcycle for the day? The answer to all the questions: Once.<br/><br/>Shot on a shoestring budget, it's films like these that promise a very promising future indeed for independent foreign film. Devoid of the weights carried by Hollywood productions and the need to contradict those weights fulfilled by American independent film, the independent cinema of the world is free to draw inspiration from whatever source it requires, be it the human psyche, random surrealism or Irish folk music. Once in particular succeeds so admirably in all its fields not only because of the stunningly beautiful music it features, but also because of the simplicity and the anonymity of its characters and events. Can this happen to anyone? Yes. How many times can it happen? Once."
"jaredmobarak","10","12","13","13 June 2007"," Just playOnce
","Wow.<br/><br/>That's it, one word reviewWow.<br/><br/>This is the movie of the year for me right now, and quite possibly will stay that way until next January. With what has to be the simplest story I've seen on screen in a long time, it gets everything right. Once is a perfect little gem, both concise and powerful in a small but infinitely memorable package. Literally, a guy and a girl meet on a street corner in Dublin while he plays guitar for loose change. This chance encounter sets into motion a series of events that will bring kindred souls together with the strongest bond of love and friendship as they both try to reconcile with themselves and give their lost loves a second chance. You can't portray the unfathomable link love holds people together with better than this. These two are not lovers in the traditional sense, but neither will ever be able to forget the friendship they forged and how they helped pull each other out of their respective emotional ruts. They are lovers of the mind and soul.<br/><br/>I'll admit that I am a huge sucker for brilliant music in film. Whether it be a musical like Moulin Rouge!, or a story that is enhanced by its soundtrack like The Royal Tenenbaums, or a visually stunning piece set to a haunting score as in The Fountain, I cannot get enough. The power that an assault on the eyes and ears simultaneously has can't be beat. This entire film is shot with hand-held camera, many times subversively, (for instance when our lead Guy and Girl go to a diner for lunch, the camera stays outside looking in, but you can tell the sound is coming from within by tape recorder as the background noise is very noticeable). The graininess and intimate quality shown by this style of film-making only makes you feel the realism that is pouring from each frame. These two actors are singers themselves and accomplished musicians. Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová are truly and utterly remarkable. Their interactions are never forced or fabricated, this film feels like a behind the scenes documentary on the creation of an album.<br/><br/>Once is definitely a musical above anything else. Half of this film takes place with songs either being sung in real time or being played over a montage sequence. Rather than use the words of the music to tell the story, writer/director John Carney uses them to set-up the emotional core and existence for our two leads. The words they sing are meaningful to their characters and how they react after uttering the lyrics can be both joyous and heartbreaking. He must be credited with having the guts to stage many musical moments in single takes, letting the performances and the music take over the scene. To go from the sheer happiness of laying down a track in the studio, to the sorrow-filled moment of Irglová unable to finish singing the song she wrote for her old love, back to the comradery of finishing their demo is a roller-coaster of emotions that sum up the whole film completely. There is not a misstep in sight. From the fateful meeting at our start to the bittersweet perfection that is the final scene, you don't get many opportunities to see original work like this in cinema anymore."
"meechiganman","10","15","17","18 June 2007"," See ""Once"" many more times than once.
","Let's say you're watching a movie and you are loving it and at the end you cheer and tell yourself that ""this was an awesome movie!"" and then you realize, as the credits are rolling, that the 2 main characters are just called ""guy"" and ""girl""--their names are never mentioned the whole movie! That is the beauty of ""Once"", you are so drawn into the story and interplay between the guy and girl that you don't need names. Each character is defined by who they are to each other and those in their lives! Glen Hansard (singer of the Frames) does a great job of playing the heart-broken street busker/vacuum repair-man who pours his pain out in his music. The guy is so appealing and likable that, even when he has a momentary lapse of reason and acts like an arsehole, you forgive him because you know it is so out of character for him. Marketa Irglova plays ""the girl"" with a mix of winsome charm and worldly smarts that makes you like her from the instant that ""the guy"" (and the viewers) meet her. The girl is a czech concert pianist who is estranged from her husband and making a living in Dublin with the odd job here and there. She misses playing her piano, but cannot afford to buy one for herself, so she has to make do with playing occasionally in a club or in a music shop with a nice, understanding manager. When they meet, ""the guy"" is taking a break from his typical popular street-music set to perform his own music, a song that is both smart and soulful, but probably not popular enough to elicit any money. Their first conversation is funny and revealing, and serves to set the tone for their future interactions. There is a chemistry between them, but also a very sweet reluctance to go beyond the bounds of their relationship. ""Once"" is directed by John Carney (also of Frames fame) and shot by Tim Fleming, and the film style is mainly pseudo-documentary with a lot of hand-held shots and on-street settings that take place in the midst of the real world. I do have to say that Dublin and the seaside look great and there are more than a few great landscapes that will take your breath away. There are no big stars and only a few actors who might be recognizable by eagle-eyed Irish/UK movie buffs. ""Once"" is ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC, Glen and Marketa write their own songs and perform them in realistic settings, with nobody just breaking out into song in the middle of a scene, and without any cheesy dance scenes or spotlights. The soundtrack is catchy and soulful with some very heartfelt lyrics and easy to enjoy music. ""Once"" could almost be a documentary of how Glen (and Marketa, and Tim) hit it big; they are (were?) on tour in the US. John Carney does a masterful job of telling the story in a very appealing manner while avoiding a lot of the clichés that infest so many movies today. And yet, there are many familiar scenes where you almost know what is going to happen, but are still pleasantly surprised when it does. Especially touching for me was the scene where the guy plays his completed demo for his dad, nervously awaiting a verdict; great stuff! ""Once"" is the kind of movie that isn't widely publicized or splashed on the TV or radio at first, but then there is such acclaim from those who have seen it that pretty soon everybody is jumping on the bandwagon. 2007 is (so far) are really good year for movies, but I'd venture to day that ""Once"" is one of the best of the year. ""Once"" is worth see more than once. Tell your friends, neighbors and acquaintances to go see ""Once"", they will thank you for the tip ( and you will be able to go with them)."
"markyritchie","10","7","7","19 December 2007"," The Best Film of the Year!
","Once:<br/><br/>A movie that really is hard to put into words, but demonstrates that you don't need a multi- million dollar budget, A-list Hollywood actors/directors and special effects to make an incredible film. It does what any good movie should do, tells a story honestly and drops the viewer right into the action so as to feel you're there and care about what's happening.<br/><br/>In this case it's the story of a young man and woman who wound't otherwise have anything in common other than she has a busted vacuum and he works at a vacuum repair shop, or so it seems, until you discover that these two ordinary poor people actually have the same passion for writing and playing music, neither having the capacity to do so in the way they would like. For him it's playing songs in streets and his tiny apartment for anyone who'll listen but no one who can understand. Enter a woman who hasn't been able to outlet her own musical creativity due to a young child and failing marriage and you get an explosion of musical and romantic creativity.<br/><br/>John Carney's film is really an album on screen, and I have to mention that it is the music that drives the picture, but it's not a musical in the vain of people randomly breaking into song that drives normal people crazy (because no one ever does that in REAL LIFE) but he shows you where GREAT music really comes from and how it's created. Never once are you thinking 'Oh great there breaking into song again' because not only is the music incredible (mostly written by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) but it's given real time and they don't cut songs short but let you listen as if you were there in the store, studio, apartment, bus or wherever. <br/><br/>The movie just has so many perfect little scenes and touches like the banker who wants to play them a song of his own when they ask for a loan, or the scene when they finally get to record and it's abundantly clear that no one knows what they're doing. Lastly I have to mention that it is the treatment of their interest/relationship that is the best part of the film. It's refreshing to see romance done right, without sex or over the top cheesy melodramatic dialog, the type of crap that only happens 'in the movies', here it doesn't need to be said because like true romance it's not spoken, it's felt. Carney avoids the horribly overwrought sexploitation of male/female relationships in modern film and actually respects these two characters enough to end the movie right, with the viewer walking away just like the two smitten musicians...wanting more of their music and of each other."

","I loved how the movie stayed away from Hollywood stereotypical scenes. There were several places that had the look of ""insert tragic dramatic moment here"" but instead kept it real. The music is great and is now on my ipod. I have heard it said that you feel like you have a secret to tell because so few people have seen this movie. Its true. When I listen to the soundtrack I think, man I need to tell all my friends to go check this flick out. This movie has a lot of heart and was a pleasure to watch. It also leaves you with many things to think and talk about after it's over. That's cool. The bonus is my son was in Ireland last summer and came back saying ""what's the story?"" instead of his American ""what's up?"" I noticed that line in the movie. Ireland is cool too, especially along the coast."

","Watching ""Once"" is like sitting in on a jam session. It's mellow and relaxed. It doesn't amount to much, but it's pleasant enough.<br/><br/>The director has said that he set out to make a movie so simple that the story could be summarized on the back of a postage stamp, and he's succeeded. An Irish busker meets a Czech émigré, and both flit around the edges of falling for each other while recording a demo album of the busker's music. Both are struggling with the loves in their lives, he with a girlfriend in London, she with her estranged husband and father to her little girl. The resolution of their stories, what resolution there is, felt right and realistic. This isn't a fairy tale, but neither is it Shakespearean tragedy. Life simply goes on.<br/><br/>The film's biggest asset is its music, and indeed most of the songs in the film we see performed in their entirety. The movie isn't exactly a musical in the strictest sense of the word, since characters don't spontaneously burst into choreographed musical numbers, but like the best musicals, the songs in ""Once"" illuminate the characters and play an integral role in the storytelling.<br/><br/>A low-key little gem of a movie.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","If this were just a movie about a gifted young musician getting his career started, with no deep feelings, no romance, it would rate 9/10 or 10/10. Every detail is nailed, nothing is clichéd, and the music is extraordinary.<br/><br/>If this were just a romantic drama / comedy without music, it would rate 9/10. It would make a terrific double bill with _Before Sunset_, in fact. Like that film, there's not much to the story, but it's substantial nonetheless (especially emotionally) and it plays out unpredictably and true to life rather than following movie formula.<br/><br/>It is, however, both of these things simultaneously, the two aspects not just seamlessly integrated but, in fact, one and the same.<br/><br/>It's really pretty miraculous: a movie that moved me to tears and made me dance in my seat.

Every single scene that is shot seems to bring something amazing to the movie- overall it is one of the most heartfelt and sincere films I have seen.

"amey_sharma","9","5","5","14 October 2012"," Fall in love with this magnificent film more than Once!
","'Once' is a 2006 Irish musical film and is one of the best Romantic love stories I ever watched. Made in 17 days and at a cost of less than $150K, major points of the film are its simplicity, great performances and heart touching music.<br/><br/>I'd like to start with accolades to get the idea of its strong effect in general. One of its tracks ""Falling Slowly"" won the 2007 Oscar (Academy Award for Best Original Song). Two leads Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová composed and performed all of the original songs in the movie, although they both are musicians first and actors second. The soundtrack album has mesmerizing 15 songs which topped many charts worldwide. Film was met with extremely high positive reviews from critics. Film eventually earned another 16 wins & 21 nominations in major awards that year.<br/><br/>The Film is about two characters, an unnamed, thirty-something 'Guy' played by Glen Hansard, who sings and plays guitar at Dublin streets and an unnamed young Czech immigrant flower seller 'Girl' played by Markéta Irglová. Influenced by his music, she approaches him and they become friends while discovering their music abilities. They recruit a trio of musicians from the street and record an album in a studio even though both are struggling financially. Let me tell you, each and every song in this movie is situational and has power to make you cry and have goose-bumps as well. The film shows their beautiful relation while they meet, sing and share their life experiences.<br/><br/>There are various scenes which are lovely, but noticeably when they both goes for a small motorbike hike on shore hill and she reveals that she is married, though she's not in touch with her husband who is back in the Czech. Guy had already confessed her about his girlfriend who's left to London and she's the inspiration for his music. But you get so involve in these two lovely people, that in this scene when Guy asks if she still loves her husband, she answers in Czech, ""Miluju tebe"" which actually means ""It is you I love!"", you wish they should hug, kiss and go back happily ever after. But she smiles and declines to translate what she said. There is not a single kissing or intimate moment in whole movie, but still has such impact, which shows its greatness. Hat's off for that! Neither of the two leads is a trained or experienced actor; Hansard and Irglová are both professional musicians. He's 37 and she's 19 when 'Once' movie was made and their chemistry is so believable. They did become a couple in real lives though we wish they'd have become one in the movie as well. Cinematography and editing is excellent as well. Irglová's mesmerizing track 'If you want me' has been shot in one single take.<br/><br/>So overall, you can fall in love with this movie more than 'once'. It makes you laugh, cry, sing, dance and let you flow away with pure love. It's an experience worth memorable!"
"cjperisho","10","8","9","9 January 2008"," A film you MUST watch, and probably can't watch just ""Once""
","I watch movies. A lot of movies. Sadly, most end up not being worth the time it took to lift them off the shelf at Hollywood Video to read the back cover. However, when you basically shotgun the video store, a few golden needles are bound to ring out beautifully as they fall to the floor from the haystack.<br/><br/>The most recent gem for me was the film ""Once"". Set in beautiful Dublin, Ireland, complete with the delightful and endearing (though sometimes hard to understand) Irish brogue, this film pulls you in from the start. The two main characters remain unnamed through the movie (they are credited simply as ""Guy"" and ""Girl""). Guy is a charmingly scruffy ""broken hearted Hoover fixer sucker guy"" (his ""day job"" finds him working in his father's vacuum repair shop), though his true passion lies in singer/songwriter/acoustic music. We meet him right off the bat, out in the streets, guitar case open, playing his well worn, and beloved guitar, hoping to earn a few extra Euro. During the days, he plays covers in busy pedestrian areas because it gets him more money, but at night he lets the magic of his own writing echo down the alleys of Dublin. It is while Guy is playing at night that we first meet Girl. Guy has been playing to an empty street, his enchanting songs falling on brick and stone. Yet, while caught up in the moment of one of his songs, his eyes closed, Girl appears, applauding as he finishes the song. She is beautiful, captivating, quirky, frumpily dressed and the viewer can't help but fall for her blended Czech and Irish accents that flow from her lips like a song. When she discovers that Guy fixes vacuums, she begs him to fix hers. He tells her to bring it with her tomorrow, and find him on the street with it. Sure enough, she shows up the next day, dragging her vacuum (one of those with the little unit on the floor and the long hose that you hold, rather than an upright vacuum) like a little puppy along the street.<br/><br/>I'll not give away much more of the plot, other than to say that what ensues is a week or so of time spent together, Guy and Girl quit clearly perfect for each other, each wanting the other, but held back by their own broken pasts and the knowledge of the other's broken pasts. Their haphazard, awkward and yet lovable romance is really kindled through music. Guy and his guitar capture her heart, while Girl, who's father was in a Czech orchestra, plays piano masterfully and has a voice (much like that of Amy Lee, from Evanescence) that is haunting yet beautiful, and leaves Guy speechless when she first plays and sings for him.<br/><br/>During their week together, they sing, play, write and record music together, both for the joy of the experience, and in hopes of actualizing Guy's desires to get beyond fixing Hoovers, and make it in the music world. This pursuit is vital to the development of Guy and Girl's relationship. Additionally, though it takes up much less of the overall film, this pursuit is vital to the restoration of the relationship between Guy and his father. As is so common these days, Guy seems to feel a disconnect with his father, who frowns on his musical efforts. However, in a brief, but very powerful scene, Guy receives the much desired and needed strong affirmation of his father.<br/><br/>""Once"" is captivating in all ways. Dublin is the perfect beautiful setting, the characters tangible, believable, magnetic, the story well told. Everything about it has a genuine, earthy feel...the viewer can relate and is really drawn into the film. And the music...oh the music! It is fantastic! It's funny at times, serious at others, broken hearted, full of love, full of life and tells so much of the story. The music is the best part (so much so that as soon as I finished watching the movie, I went back to my room, hopped on the iTunes store, and bought the soundtrack, and its all I've listened to for the last three days since I've watched the film). Believe me when I say, ""Once"" is a film you don't want to miss, and one you probably can't watch just once..."

","There is much to love about the quirky little film ONCE: it is honest, simple, transparent, and made with a low budget and lots of love. The leading characters are gentle people who happen to sing as well as act and the love story they create is a fragile little tale that remains in the air as a nice memory after the credits are past.<br/><br/>A Dublin busker (Glen Hansard) is a songwriter and singer who plies his music on the streets when his is not helping his warmly generous father (Bill Hodnett) in his vacuum repair shop: his songs reflect a ruptured love affair and are sensitively poignant. Along comes a Czech girl (Markéta Irglová) who sells flowers on the streets but is impressed enough with the lad's music to stop, listen, and even put ten cents in his case. The two strike up a friendship (the girl plays the piano in a music shop during lunch hour) and in time these two bruised people interact in the wavelength of their love of music. The lad meets the girl's daughter and mother (Danuse Ktrestova) - the father of the child is still in the Czech Republic -, they all become friends, and with the help of a few fellow musicians they cut a recording that hopefully will launch the lad's career in a trip to London. The mood of the extemporaneous feeling piece is one of developing love that can only happen once, especially given the histories of each of the two musicians.<br/><br/>Writer/director John Carney demonstrates how a simple story can be made into a touching film for under $150,000. and on a shooting schedule of 17 days. The featurettes have just as much tenderness in outlining the production of the film as the film itself. The only problem with the film for this viewer is the music, which seems redundant and repetitive: for those who favor this type of music this will not be a 'flaw'. It is admirable that films like this are being made, restoring our faith in honest craftsmanship backed by warmth of intent. Grady Harp"

","It's hard to put into words why I loved this movie so much. Taking apart each element, there isn't much that you could say was really notable. It was a low budget movie, and it looked it. The sound was fair to middling. The camera was jerky. The acting was fair. And the music was decent.<br/><br/>But what a movie does well, when it does it well, is to combine all these elements to make an experience that exceeds the sum of its parts. Every once in a while, a movie does that so well, that at the end, you realize that you saw something completely new - something that moved you - something that may have had elements you've seen elsewhere, but never quite in this way. That is what ""Once"" has accomplished.<br/><br/>The story told in words is incredibly restrained. There is really not much drama to it. The drama, and the emotion is mostly in the songs. As the story fills out with this interplay of speaking and singing, we become a voyeur to a unlikely love story whose subtlety is a delight to behold. In this context the songs become beautiful and evocative and the actors become real people whose lives we care about well after we leave the theater."

","I'm more than a little tired of all the so-called ""block busters"" with big-name casts and mega$$$ budgets that, in the end, are devoid of anything even close to substance or entertainment. Unassuming and unpretentious, the characters and plot were revealed in layers, and with each layer I found myself identifying more strongly with each. The songs and lyrics provided me the clearest insight into the characters' motivations and, thus, the understanding and empathy for their respective situations. It struck me that as much as I wanted the ""guy"" and ""girl"" to end up together, the real magic was in their restraint and adherence to something perhaps bigger than love--the need to act as adults with real-world responsibilities; not always a romantic path to follow, but the path most of us do follow, which usually leads to much better outcomes in life. This little film is one of those beautiful reminders of what film making could/should be. I think it's a perfect film!"

","This independent Irish film is an extraordinary achievement. The performances, the direction and especially the musical score are amazing. One of the best things about the film was that it felt very real. It portrays reality as it is without over-dramatization. This realistic tone along with the moving performances of both lead actors make the audience relate to the characters and their own personal struggles.<br/><br/>What I liked the most about the film was the musical score. It's very beautiful and it fits perfectly to the movie. Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová make a great duo. Their musical performances transmit what the characters are feeling in a very sincere way. It doesn't feel forced like in other similar music films. The cinematography is very far from perfect. Most shots have a home-made style. In most films I would criticize this, but in this one it fits the plot and tone perfectly. The cinematography compliments the realistic tone of the movie to the point it doesn't feel like a movie anymore and you completely get immersed in the plot.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie (the performances, the direction, cinematography, music and plot) fits together perfectly and sets the mood for the story. There are quite a few moving moments in the film that almost everyone can identify with. And the ending is very real, relatable; in my opinion, it's perfect. It leaves you wanting for more, but at the same it leaves you satisfied.<br/><br/>Once is a beautiful film that mirrors real life along with its ups and downs almost perfectly. I give it a 10/10 and would recommend it for everyone. Even if you don't like this type of movies you will love the musical score and performances by both the lead actors. This movie is a proof that you don't need a big budget to make an extraordinary film."

","Whenever I watch Once, I'm always moved by the beautiful musics, places, story, and so on. Most of all, the musics and Ireland described in Once are just incredible. I still remember the scenery and people of Once by listening to all musics in it. And this movie is the reason why i decided to go on a trip to Ireland. I visited Dublin and Killiney, and got inspired a lot. dropped by the spot where Glenn played guitar and first met Marketa. There were lots of musicians who are very passionate about musics. The street was full of joy and passion toward arts. The movie just describes the usual and real Ireland as it is. i think this is why Once got loved by a number of people from different countries. <br/><br/>Oh and there is one thing i really want to mention. The Swell Season held a concert in Seoul around in 2009, and i was there. Before the concert starts, there was one korean independent band throwing their own small gig in front of the concert hall. It might be a kind of contribution toward the swell season, cause they played musics from Once. most people did not much care about them. Soon the concert started, and The Swell Season made their stages. After a few musics, they suddenly introduced the korean band to the audience and let them play on the real stage.. The Swell Season might have heard about them right before the concert and have been impressed, i guess. The band played its own song for a number of audiences, and the band looked so happy about it. And Last year, i found one article on a newspaper that the band made the independent film dealing with their amazing story about them having a chance to play on the real stage at The Swell Season concert, and the film was about to release.. I was stunned again with the thought that Once actually have inspired people all over the world. The Swell Season and Once probably got the band an 'once in a life time' experience. I must say that Once is truly beautiful because of that."

","Went in not knowing much beyond the acclaim it received at Sundance -- and left seeing that the praise was well deserved.<br/><br/>Done for less than 200k on a 17 day shooting schedule, with musicians taking actor roles AND putting out a wonderful soundtrack, and I tell you everything about to clicked for me.<br/><br/>The movie lacked the pretension and predictability that follows light-hearted romantic attempts, the ending was well done, and lacked the general silliness that (I think) hurts most modern attempts at musicals -- and it does so by using well placed music to tell most of the story, and letting the dialog (which is also well written) accent it.<br/><br/>Will you leave this movie with a life-changing experience? Of course not, and the hype surrounding this movie is a pity because nothing ever lives up to the expectations once that train leaves the station -- but if you enjoy movies you will leave the theater thinking you just saw a fine example of what happens when you filter out the big budgets, the egos, and the studios, and just let a fine writer/director and his cast deliver a very enjoyable film."
"arthera09","10","8","10","16 September 2007"," best film I have seen all year
","I do not like giving 10's out and it is a rare movie that I do, but this was just perfect. The one criticism I might have is that the camera is too shaky sometimes, but I realized it was supposed to be that way. The music was perfect and I since I have been listening to the soundtrack for a few weeks it just made it better. The impact of the songs really hit home because I knew a lot of the lyrics and what they meant. It just made all the scene all the better. From the standpoint of a person who once wanted to be a musician this was amazing. If you have never sat around a 8-track player with a friend and created music this movie may not speak to those who have, but it still does not stop the movie from being amazing. Both of the leads were amazing and I was waiting to hear their names and I never did and I love that. From the opening scene which set the tune for the lightness of the film and the funny nature of it to the emotionally driven end that sent shivers down my back. I think the fact that the two leads are actually involved really allowed them to pull off some of the most powerful moments in the movie. The frames (that are straight from a Ingrid Bergman film) where the two faces were both in focus and the looks on their faces were priceless. Especially when it is a profile of the ""girl"" and the ""guy"" looking at her one could really feel the emotion. I won't even comment on the musical tag that this movie received, except that one cannot let the tag discourage anyone from seeing it. I was also impressed by the father son relationship that was really well developed in a very few short scenes that were well placed and interactions that one might have missed. The fact that the father brings in tea for everyone when they are rehearsing was a nice little touch and said a lot about the father which made their final scene together a little more special. I think the ending was perfect and I was smiling so hard and had shivers down my back. I really like those movies that keep redefining what love can mean for two different people and had music at the core of the relationship and it was perfect. I think I could keep talking about this film but I better go and review another movie."

","Everyone seems to literally be in ecstasy over this film and it's just won the Oscar for best song. It went down a storm at Sundance receiving a standing ovation - even my best friends rate it highly. So many people can't be wrong? True, it's amazing that it was made on such a small budget, but in my opinion it is basically naff, hackneyed and tiresome. Maybe it's the Marmite syndrome, maybe it's the Emperors new clothes. I've watched it a couple of times thinking that I had missed something. But nothing - I was still bored and found the whole experience was exacerbated by the discomfort of watching poorly shot, unfocused and wobbly images. The music was just about bearable to me, nothing more. I don't believe there is a right way or a wrong way to make a film as long as it touches something inside you. I guess I'm perplexed and intrigued by the overwhelming and unanimous response that this is a brilliant and multi-layered work of film art and entertainment. It didn't move or entertain me and what critical faculties I posses were affronted by the cliché ridden self indulgence so poorly realised. The complete lack of any original technique 'verite' or otherwise and performers who lacked any ability to engage me. But the audiences bellow with praise and an almost religious fervour - I guess I will have to go watch it again or should I just trust to my instincts and leave well alone? You guys like Marmite, I just can't stomach it - it makes me wretch."

And we both happily enter into that shared experience of talking about how 'great' it was. As if all anyone ever wants to do anymore is to agree for once that something in this world is 'great', which in the case of this movie i'm really thinking means 'pure', not infected by the cheapness or cynicism of so much out there.<br/><br/>To accept this very sentimental movie requires a great suspension of cynicism. The only people I know who haven't liked this were unable to make this leap. But I always have the feeling they very badly wanted to.<br/><br/>And the music is great.

","I saw this film in a small theatre last evening (Friday Aug. 17) with 75-100 others and simply was enthralled. It is deserving of a severe rating for harsh and explicit language issues but the Restriction (""R"") is really missing the spirit of this highly commendable film made in 2006 to be targeted at a young adult audience. What the pop-rock music conveys is the skill and tunefulness and pride in one's creative juices versus the over-produced and technically questionable extreme loud general audience Pop music of recent years. The Dublin setting for ""Once"" comes across as noisy and authentic and the situations work well to link the songs in a way that other youth musicals gone to the movies (prime examples of which are ""Rent"" and ""High School Musical"") just don't ultimately succeed in persuading viewers of a certain sophistication. I am not quite keen of hearing to catch part of what happened in some of the sections of the movie where the dialect Irish accented people were given lines but the main character is easily understood and the female lead didn't always get her Czech subtitled. The Soundtrack for this film will likely sell lots and lots of copies later this year - - I am hoping that an Oscar nomination is in the realm of possibility for those music specialists in the Academy who are paying attention to small masterpieces like this 85-minute film!

Not quite realistic, as some pointed out--but you can feel the joy and love behind this film that is rare to find. It shows that a film doesn't have to be preachy to have something meaningful to share with the audience.<br/><br/>It's about an unlikely pair connecting through music, and understanding each other through music. Every musical performance felt like they were baring their souls and it felt like the same connection and goodwill pervaded throughout the audience, the girl, and the guy, and every other character on the screen. The shy, somewhat sparse dialogue in between the music were full of things unsaid, but understood.<br/><br/>This film gave, and I, as an audience member, gave back--sharing in the warmth as long as it lasted.

","'Once' is a film that could confound many who see it. There is an innocence and simplicity in style that captivates. The musical that lies within is tinged with an originality that comes straight from its street feel driven mostly by the flowing hand-held camera work. Because of this, it operates as almost an abstract, experimental film walking the line between verite and a pseudo-neo realism, but has this organic feel by centering on its core theme, love as the most important ingredient in the birth of music.<br/><br/>And most importantly, it presents a story of an unrequited yet fulfilling love that is more heartfelt and real than almost any requited love story I've ever witnessed.<br/><br/>That's what makes the boy's gift of a piano to the girl at the end magical. Their powerful lovemaking through musical creation would continue on in both lives even if they never met again.<br/><br/>I don't think a simpler film has ever made such a moving, profound statement about what's most important in our lives.<br/><br/>A lot of things to absorb. Most important in the end, however, is the soulful warmth you leave the theater with. I hope as many people as possible get to experience this. They all will be better for it."

It is not contrived by the heaviness of a script. Watch their eyes. Watch how they move in the streets. Watch how they deal with their emotions, not as actors do, but as humans do.<br/><br/>The music is not the genre I would normally be attracted to, but to see it created on the screen by two people in the process of getting to know one another, on a visceral level as well as a musical level, digs into your heart. The ending, where the Girl sits at her piano and looks out the window as the camera slowly pulls back, is so poignant it left me bereft."
"eytand94","10","3","3","1 April 2012"," Once: A Revolutionary Turn for Movie Musicals
","Campy and energetic are two words that come to mind when one thinks of musicals. ""Sweeney Todd"" and ""Les Miserables"" fall into a different category. But who says a musical has to be cheesy? What if we can watch a musical and not leave the theater dancing, but thoroughly mesmerized and stunned? John Carney's 2006 Irish film ""Once"" proves that.<br/><br/>Our two main characters are extremely natural. They don't even have names; they are labeled Guy and Girl. Guy is a street singer, banging away on his guitar and belting out ballads he composed himself. He only gets minimal attention, but then, Girl comes along and listens to his music. She is not from Ireland, but she is Czech, and Guy's music immediately grabs her. After fixing up Girl's crappy vacuum cleaner, they both wind up sitting down together and creating music. She plays piano, he plays guitar. But as they compose their songs, a love story begins to develop.<br/><br/>Before we get to the main reason this movie is so amazing, let's look at the characters. Both Guy and Girl are leading flawed lives. Girl lives with her mother and her baby, her husband away while Guy is alone after being dumped by his girlfriend. When they sit down together, they're not just making music. They're making love. Their affection for one another simmers inside of them through their songs. Is their love admitted in words? No. But that's not really the point of the movie, or the music wouldn't have as much meaning.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is the key to the film that all movie buffs are going to criticize after all the hype the movie has gotten over 6 years. The music is actually composed by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, our leads, and it is beautiful. None of these songs are toe-tappers, but aching, soul-touching ballads that get under the skin in the most positive way possible. The meeting of Guy and Girl results in ""Falling Slowly,"" a piano and guitar piece that is marvelous in its emotion and soothing in its sound. It perhaps may be one of the best love songs not on the radio, and that's a fact since the song got an Academy Award. The one that will really make you tear up is Irglova's heart-breaking tune ""The Hill."" The score demands to be heard.<br/><br/>If I were to come up with one word to sum up ""Once"" overall, it would be simplicity. This entire movie is beautiful in its ways of being natural, from a story so simple to the undeniably improvised chemistry and appeal of the leading characters, played wonderfully and effortlessly by Hansard and Irglova. It has stood the test of time and is quickly starting to reach the mainstream. How: it's now a critically acclaimed Broadway musical. There's no doubting you're going to love this film. Such a classic and influential movie with such a triumphant soundtrack only gets made ""Once."""
"tedg","Null","8","11","27 December 2007"," Our Soulmate Singing
","Here's a remarkable project. Its poorly made, with much of the incoherent elements hiding behind its presentation as homemade.<br/><br/>It has nonprofessional; actors and it shows. It has catchy songs that by themselves are forgettable. The girl isn't very appealing. It mixes elements from love stories that are extremely formulaic with those that are not, and the actors never understand where they are supposed to be in this. Theoretically its a mess.<br/><br/>But it works, and it works so well that I want to recommend it to you. Its almost the perfect date movie because instead of vicariously seeing the ""happy ever after"" ending and going back to your imperfect relationship, you know you would end your own movie differently.<br/><br/>And the imperfections work, because the tone between the world of the movie and the movie is folded perfectly. It isn't that the movie is close to reality, no.<br/><br/>There are elements that are real. The boy and girl are indeed friends, songwriting friends. Dublin does exist, or did. They did write what they sing. The story is about a ragtag experience of making a song that works out, the same as the ragtag making of the movie.<br/><br/>The songs really do weave into the story, no deeper. Usually it is the story that the songs compliment. Here, the whole world of the story is in the songs, their tone and their sharing. Its the sharing that matters here, and it transcends everything else in the movie that may distract us.<br/><br/>These two are soulmates. They were made for each other. They are meant to be together. We see it more than even they do, and that's the reason why this works so well.<br/><br/>Usually in romantic movies, we are bludgeoned with the romance. Here, we are simply exposed to the result of the coupling, and we invent the romance ourselves. What we invent around those songs and copious open space is far deeper than anything that could be shown.<br/><br/>The end is a bit perfect for this, because they both go back to prior romantic commitments and we know it is wrong. We force ourselves out of the movie and endorse the soulmatedness of the thing. In previous comments, I've remarked on the power of folding in storytelling. Here its perfect and complex, and I suspect largely unintended. That's because if you watch the DVD extras you'll see how the director stumbles about. I can only assume the producers were the ones with the intuition that matters. <br/><br/>So avoid those extras if you can. But one piece of trivia is a must. You must look it up in IMDb to know what she says in Czech to him. Its the whole film, hidden.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

I thought it was a bit cloying in parts, as when the main female character is lugging the Hoover around by its hose. But at least such touches were few and brief. In fact, there were many artificial touches in this movie, but they were well masked.<br/><br/>I also resent the kind of praise that thinks a movie is great because it is ""like life"" rather than like a movie, but again, I've got to admit this movie did a pretty good job of getting to that point.<br/><br/>And, again in spite of myself, I think this movie was very good largely BECAUSE it tapped in to one of the most important things on the minds of most people in ""my"" ""generation""--pop music--sappy and infantile as it all is--in a way no other movie I have seen has managed to do.<br/><br/>Good job, movie!"

","I doubt if I've seen a film more unabashedly romantic in the past five years, and this small-scale 2007 film is a musical to boot. Even with its Dublin-set working-class veneer, the story is basic boy-meets-girl formula, but director/screenwriter John Carney's real-world treatment manages to transcend the conventions, even if only fleetingly, through the aching pop ballads which make up most of the soundtrack and the sincerity of the two leads. The plot focuses on an Irish street musician who plays Van Morrison hits for change during the day but reverts to his original compositions at night. Written for a long-established girlfriend who has moved away to London, his open yearning and musicianship attracts the persistent attention of a young Czech girl. Despite his initial hesitation, they bond quickly over music. There is a lovely scene in a piano shop where he sings and plays his well-worn guitar to one of his songs, a stunning heartbreaker called ""Falling Slowly"", while she tentatively accompanies him on the piano. The story simply goes from one number to the next while uncovering facts about the characters that guide their fate.<br/><br/>It's been sixteen years since his memorable turn as guitarist Outspan Foster in Alan Parker's ""The Commitments"", but Glen Hansard, lead singer of the Irish rock group, the Frames, plays the forlorn busker with a searching intensity befitting a man not only broken-hearted from a fading long-distance relationship but also worried he will end up repairing vacuum cleaners just like his stoic father. Markéta Irglová has the quirky, endearing quality necessary to play the girl. But as musicians whose compositions supply the soundtrack, their acting is secondary to the music they play. Hansard's deeply felt music immediately brings to mind Damien Rice's and David Gray's melancholy folk-rock ballads, while Irglová provides a nice complement with a voice similar to Björk's plaintive style. I have to admit the low-budget production values (it was made for just $150K) does make itself clear with some shaky, hand-held shots and overly grainy film stock. But all in all, if you are a fan of any of the musicians mentioned and remain undemanding in cinematic story lines, chances are pretty good that you will enjoy this little film enormously."

","Watching the opening sequence of this film you might be forgiven for thinking you had stumbled into a screening of Jackass. Or Candid Camera (if anyone out there is old enough to remember that?) The Guy (Glen Hansard) is busking on the streets of Dublin, when a drunk runs off with his takings, sitting in his guitar case. Thrusting his guitar into the hands of a startled stranger, the Guy gives chase across town to retrieve his money.<br/><br/>The camera work looks like it was shot with a hidden lens, which it may well have been, and it sets the scene for the movie which has the feel of cinéma vérité. I can appreciate that it's not a style to everyone's taste, and there are certainly moments when the film has a distinctly amateurish feel, but this is not a movie which is pretending to be a Hollywood blockbuster or a big budget pot-boiler, despite the nominations and awards. It's a small movie with a low key, little known cast (little known here in the USA anyway), and the filming style gives it a naturalistic, intimate feel. Which I assume is the intention, so it could be considered a success, even if the style leaves many people puzzled.<br/><br/>The Guy sings popular songs during the day, interspersed with work in his dad's vacuum cleaner repair shop, but at night he sings his own songs. And that's when the Girl (Markéta Irglová) stops to listen to him. She is an immigrant, and is having the full immigrant experience, working several jobs, cleaning houses, selling flowers on the street and taking care of her baby and her mother. And her vacuum cleaner needs fixing. But superficial appearances are deceptive; she's a classically trained pianist, and, like the Guy, also a talented musician. Lacking a piano, she slips into a city music shop to play the instruments there. She left her husband back home in the Czech Republic to come to the West and try to make a success of her life. The movie follows the lives of the Guy and the Girl over the course of several days as they explore their burgeoning mutual, creative interests, her words and keyboard skills giving his songs depth. Their relationship centers around the music, but will it ever be more? His clumsy attempt at seduction is rebuffed, but it's obvious they have a mutual attraction.<br/><br/>Rounding up some other musicians from the streets of Dublin, they rent a studio to make a demo. Afterwards, demos in hand, the Guy goes off to London, seeking fame, fortune and his ex. But the Girl has responsibilities and can't go with him, having a baby and a mother to support. She enriched his creative process, but will probably be left behind now. Life intervenes. (Let's hope she signed a royalties deal..) I found it interesting, and fresh, and I enjoyed the opportunity to watch something just a little bit different from the usual cinematic fare. I quite liked the music, but on reflection I doubt we'll be humming it a year from now, (it is a little over wrought.) On the whole I thought this was a pleasant movie. It's not earth-shatteringly good, but it's touching, and an original look at the creative process and human relationships, shot in an unusual style. My husband thought it quite wonderful, and trotted straight off to the music store to buy the soundtrack."

","Two singer-song writers get to know each other in Dublin. Once you get used to their accents, there is absolutely nothing interesting about either one of them. They seem to write the same song over and over again with the same four-note motif played and sung over and over again. All the fuss and all the awards given this film are prime examples of people bending over backwards to valorize all foreign, indie films over ""slick Hollywood"" movies. This is my considered opinion as I've watched the film twice now . . . actually one and a half times as I got so bored with the low-key acting and the gratingly repetitious sound track the first time that I only made it about half- way through before giving up. Their tedious songs are touted as brilliant within the film, but I just can't buy into it; the songs are meh and then meh and then more meh. Garsh! They don't even end up together so there isn't even the pallid solace of a true romance."

I waited until last week, March 2011, to see it, but I have now fallen madly in love with everything about it, right down to the musicians who aren't expected to act as well as these two did.<br/><br/>The movie is about an Irish busker who meets a girl from the Czech Rep. and they discover each other's talent for music, as they begin to write songs together. As they write these songs, we discover a wider understanding of how their relationship differs from so many other clichéd movies.<br/><br/>You look at the cover, and the first thing you think is a couple who meet and bond over music, and eventually strike up a sexual relationship. If you thought the first thing, you're spot on. If you agree with the statement after that then, my friend, you're at a major loss. This ain't no love story, this a story about music, which made it so much deeper than it should have been. We delve into the despair of both characters, and the life they reignite in themselves with every song they write together. In countless movies such as the likes of the recent ""Country Strong"", the movies use the musical part of it to waltz their way into the twisted love of so many of the characters, making the music become very secondary.<br/><br/>I'll tell you this much, if you're a Jason Mraz, Joshua Radin, Mumford & Sons kind of person, then this is the film for you, for sure."

The story is very flat and contains no climax.<br/><br/>Another problem is the thick Irish brogue, which is often indecipherable. I kept having to ask, ""What did s/he say?"".

","If you've heard of ""Once,"" you know it got great reviews. I'm here to tell you that those reviewers were on the payroll of a multinational corporation with a devious plan for separating you from your money.<br/><br/>What is ""Once,"" really? Plague! Famine! Cholera! Santa Tortured On screen! 666! Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating, but, I've got to tell you, given that I just watched ""Once,"" I wish I had watched Santa Claus tortured on screen, and I *love* Santa Claus, and am firmly opposed to torture, in most instances. I'd make an exception for the makers of this film.<br/><br/>""Once"" is the story of a middle-aged, potato-faced Irishman with transparent eyebrows and buggy eyes who lives with his father, can't sustain a relationship, and whines/shouts  in lieu of a singing voice -- embarrassingly sophomoric, self-absorbed, simply bad singer-songwriter confessionals on Dublin sidewalks. Every lyric in this movie could have been copied, without editing, from the diary of that androgynous kid you knew in high school who had skin like a girl and who cried, but who was actually a guy. Lonely girls would think he was the most sensitive, special boy on the planet, because he stood on the sidelines during gym class, but he was actually a jerk.<br/><br/>The male man character  he has no name  giving characters names is so Hollywood! -- picks up a Czech girl who looks about 12. The actress was 17. The Irish guy was 36. If that's attractive to you, chances are you are an aging singer-songwriter looking for a teen girl who can really understand you and your deep, sensitive heart. Think that they might make a film about a 36 year old MALE potato-faced Irish singer-songwriter with transparent eyebrows who picks up a 36 year old FEMALE potato-faced Irish singer-songwriter? Naïve you.<br/><br/>The Czech girl mutters and slurs  she's trying to do a Czech accent. The actress, who was born in the Czech Republic, actually grew up in Ireland, and cannot imitate a genuine Czech accent  that's why she mutters and slurs. One would think that an ability to produce a Czech accent would be the entry level skill for the part of a Czech girl with a Czech accent. The director said that many viewers told him that they didn't care that they could not understand the dialogue. He thought that they were complimenting him.<br/><br/>Given the pointless, dreary, poorly lit, shaky images, the director was a toddler to whose diaper a camera had been strapped. Let us hope that this innovation is not picked up by other filmmakers.<br/><br/>Nothing else happens. The guy with the transparent eyebrows shouts out self-absorbed singer songwriter songs about how hard and painful his life is and how sensitive his heart is. The teenage girl slurs her words and is the on-camera teenage girl desired by a man twenty years her senior. The characters use the ""F"" word repeatedly. AND THAT IS ALL THAT HAPPENS. I'm so moved, it was all so poignant, I think I'm going to go puke."

","In Dublin, a guy works in his father's vacuum-cleaner repair shop while also pursuing his musical aspirations by busking on the streets. Late one night he meets an immigrant girl selling the Big Issue who likes his songs but also has a vacuum cleaner that needs fixing. He helps her out and gets to known her, finding she has talent on the piano as well. He has an girlfriend that has recently moved to London without him, while the girl has a husband back in Czechoslovakia and a young child with her in Dublin. While she helps him musically look to achieve his dreams, something more intimate and personal may or may not be developing between them.<br/><br/>I first heard of this film when it showed up on various ""best of the year"" lists and added it to my rental list and got it posted to me shortly after the film won the Oscar for best song. The first thing that I should say that is that it is my opinion that this film has been overly praised  this is not a criticism of the film but rather a defence, because the hype works against this film being what it is. That is to say, Once is a very low budget film that has it strength in the general charm and sweetness but it is not, to my mind, a fantastic film and certainly its inclusion on IMDb's top 250 just further serves to take away any remaining relevance I give to that list.<br/><br/>Narratively the film is simple as it mostly trades on the songs and characters, with the love story very much unspoken and on the edges of the picture all the time. In regards specific actions there are few and the characters don't develop much beyond where they are shortly after they are introduced at the start of the film. What tends to hook the audience (and me) is the way that the film is so raw, natural and charming and, in this way, it flies in the face of many mainstream romances with their contrived stories and sickly sentimentality. This ""breath of fresh air"" quality helps it a great deal and the Irish charm does easily appeal to many audience sectors I believe, because some of their work is done beforehand with their idealised view of artists within that country! That shouldn't take anything away from Hansard and Irglová, both of whom are natural and convincing as people  although the slight downside of this is that Hansard's ""Guy"" is a bit of a jerk early on, while it can be painful to see them never say what is in the background. Carney's direction of his script is solid; OK it is all very shaky and low-budget but it fits the material while also being admirable for making the film despite the challenges.<br/><br/>Overall then, this is a charming little modern love story that is refreshingly natural and free of sentiment. It is not perfect and it won't knock you off your feet in the way that many reviews may lead you to believe but it is certainly a lovely little film that is warm, musical and charming."

","I could never quite understand why Once got an Oscar for its music. But having missed it first time round, I thought it would be a nice relaxing Sunday night movie. Now although it has a certain magic if you don't find the music irritating, it's a big ""if."" As the music plays almost throughout.<br/><br/>Bearded busker-of-no-name (incredibly talented), meets sweet little Big Issue babe-of-no-name (also incredibly talented). They bond incredibly over his incredibly mournful songs lamenting the incredible departure of his last incredible girlfriend. Can I tell you a secret? The film lies. She left to get some peace and quiet.<br/><br/>Our opening few minutes has busker boy singing his heart out. You can predict the moment she will arrive almost to the second. The rest of the movie is fairly unpredictable (largely because nothing happens.) When you've seen the junkie try to steal his guitar case, you've seen the best bit. From there on, it's gooey painting-by-numbers that never gets properly started, much less finished.<br/><br/>We fast-segue into urban folk-tale mode, the penniless pair putting together a band of street musicians and get a recording studio for a mere two thousand Euros. The acting is OK. But if it beat Enchanted on song, it sure loses out on fairy-tale. Script is appalling (The story is unbelievable and most dialogue is replaced with music. Or else Issue-babe staring dreamily at busker-boy, asking adoringly about his dismal past relationship.) The songs nearly put me off my tea, even if the couple are indeed quite talented. Mournful, melancholy brooding folksy is not my bag. Some short a capella and more relaxing songs in a Dublin folk club provide a more pleasurable interlude. But too short. Then there's some nice shots of the countryside near Dublin. And a believable chemistry between these upmarket bottom-of-the-heapers. If only she might snog him, I think, just to shut him up. But then his songs keep going in the background even when his mouth is occupied. Relentlessly. So such plot development seems pointless.<br/><br/>As films of improbable musician meet-ups go, Once had me longing for the unpretentiously cheesy (and under-rated) Music and Lyrics (Hugh Grant). Which at least had the decency not to take itself so damn seriously.<br/><br/>Busker boy is played by Glen Hansard of The Frames , so if you are fan, this is good value. If you're not, it's maybe worth downloading a track from the film before deciding. There's an awful lot of the same. The film could almost be called the cheapo album video. His voice has lots of gusto. Passing him on the subway, it would be refreshing. Stuck waiting for a bus with him in the background might be wearing.<br/><br/>I am supposed to say it is sweet and tender and stuff like that. It's not. It's about two pathologically messed-up people who don't have the courage to move on. There's a nice bit of Irish charm that plays especially well in the States (From a budget of $150,000, it grossed almost $17 million). For me, I'm sad to say there was not enough charm for to dispel the queasiness.<br/><br/>A brilliant low-budget effort, but the repetitive songs are not charismatic enough to warrant more than a 20 minute short. Once is cheesy love-on-the-poverty-line. Cut-price cheese, the sort with lots of milk and fat. Passing itself off as indie-made, quality pizza. As much as you can eat for 85 minutes. Please don't choke. I admit that many people must have enjoyed it, which I don't understand. Unless you like being sucked in by such mush, it doesn't seem worth leaving the pub for. You could be enjoying a nice pint of Guinness instead. Or two . . ."

It's a tale of two souls, both incomplete and lost, and how their time together changes each of them.<br/><br/>As much as I loved everything else about the film, the cinematography was horrible. I don't know why they got the guy who shot The Blair Witch Project to do this... Seriously though, this small independent film is shot with a hand-held camera, and it shows. There's the constant shaking of the camera, the awkward zooms in and out at random intervals, the odd framing of many scenes, and some problems with perspective and keeping characters in focus. It looks like it was filmed by somebody's dad who just got his first camcorder. Even with this issue I'm still giving it an 8 for its beautiful characters, relationships, and memorable moments, so you can imagine how good the film could have been if it had been shot by someone who was competent."

","""Once"" is a story about a guy who works with his father in a vacuum cleaner repair shop, and when he's not working, he plays his guitar in the streets for money, until he meets a girl who's also a musician, and they start to play together and record songs. It's not about big time musicians or famous and rich people, it's a film about you, and about me. It could happen to anyone. I love how the main characters are not depicted by any name at all; it just strengthens this concept even more. The ""guy"" isn't anyone, and he might as well be anyone. If I had to sum up the whole movie in one word I'd say ""simplicity"". At least for me, simplicity and innocence are two main keywords to describe this film. From characters, camera work (most of the time the camera is hand-held and has a documentary feeling) and concept, it spells simplicity all over the place; all the characters are so straightforward and casual its weird for us audiences. Maybe because the ""guy' and the ""girl"" actors are not real professionals, but actual musicians. I might be wrong, or imagining things but one of the most remarkable scenes in the movie for me is in the very beginning, when the two main characters meet, and she finds out that Guy repair vacuum cleaners, and by coincidence, she had a broken on at home. She talks him into giving a look at it, and brings him to him next day. He says he can't repair it right there because he didn't have the right tools, and then they went to the repair shop, but first they go to a music store where they play together for the first time. This whole sequence is just amazing. As I already said, this movie is so simple, it comes of as being so trivial you can imagine yourself there, walking around the street carrying a cheap vacuum cleaner around. I don't know exactly why but seeing the ""girl"" carrying that thing around really got up to me. Well, I could do silly commentary about this movie for a whole day but I think it's better for you people to watch for yourselves and see what I mean. It's a great European romance, totally deprived of Hollywood clichés. If you want a low budget independent movie that'll make you think, look no further, and grab this one."

","Director/writer John Carney has crafted an exceptional film with ""Once"". Simply put: ""Once"" feels real. <br/><br/>Photographed in and around Dublin, Ireland, on a low budget, using hand held cameras, the film has a private documentary look and feel to it. ""Once"" is loaded with naturalness, sincerity, spontaneity, honesty and charm. It's one of the best films of the decade, outperforming most big budget Hollywood films with famous actors. This film is evidence that an inspired director and writer, are far more important to the success of a film, than the traditional Hollywood formula of big budgets and famous actors. By success, my meaning is, the film tells it's story very convincingly.<br/><br/>The story concerns a chance encounter between two musicians and follows them on their eventful weekend that follows. The two main character, identified only as guy and girl, are portrayed by two real life musicians. ""Once"" contains some genuinely beautiful original music and songs.<br/><br/>For me, there are really three key scenes, that help lift this film from lesser efforts of the genre. One, is the performance of the beautiful song ""Falling Slowly"" in the music store. Second, has the girl walking home at night with fresh batteries, listening to and singing to one of the guy's songs on the portable CD player he gave her. Third, would be the guy creating a new guitar song, while watching home movies of his ex- love, for inspiration. The ending of the film is brave for this genre and fits perfectly with the story telling style of the film.<br/><br/>Though deserving of more than one Academy Award nomination, ""Once"" is the not the usual choice of Academy voters (big budget, famous actors, epic story) for Best Picture.<br/><br/>About the R rating for the film. The f-word is used throughout the film., however, it's never used in a vulgar, aggressive or insulting manner. It's obviously the common language style of the common people portrayed in the film. Considering the context of the story and characters, I believe an R rating is unjustified. That's unfortunate for a low budget film like this, which needs to play in as many theaters as possible. R rated films earn less than PG or PG-13 films.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

For them the story is so unimportant that they just enjoyed the music and moved on with their lives (as we often do with films).<br/><br/>But I feel that those are totally missing the point. Sure, the music in this film is 99% of it's charm, appeal and enjoyment. But I found the background story of music much more meaningful and touching than just ""background"".<br/><br/>The writer and director John Carney chose to not name the main characters and they are called The Guy and The Girl. I think it's a brilliant and meaningful choice. ""Once"" is about specific period in life. It's a period when something happened in past and now you're just waiting, but you are so passive. You curse the past, you act bitterly and don't think about the future. Maybe because you're afraid, maybe because you're ignoring the life and maybe you just wait for someone to save you.<br/><br/>The Guy and The Girl are exactly those persons. Their meeting is touching because of the change they both can make, one thanks to other.<br/><br/>The music in this film is symbolizes their wish and will, their possibility of finding the right person for them but it turns out that they found much more than love. Love in this film is some kind of a miss, that what brings us to tears in this movie. But it's a miss that gives birth to become active, to change, to do something. The Guy decides to go to London, for his music, for his girl, for the hope. The Girl gives chance for her family life, for her husband, for stability.<br/><br/>The fact that Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová are not professional actors is a great gift and bonus for the film. They are just like every one of us, guys and girls who know what it's like to experience love as a miss, but finding a person who right on time for ""this kind of a period"".<br/><br/>This film stayed with me for long, not just because of the power of music in this film, but because it's really touching every one of us when we can relate to a certain period of life, when we need someone to make a change and believe. Even if it's love that we may sacrify..<br/><br/>Brilliant. 10/10"

","I just finished watching this movie with my mom. I loved it, but she didn't. I recommend you watch this movie alone or with your girlfriend or boyfriend. If you do so I guarantee you will enjoy it. This heartwarming musical is spectacular, with beautiful songs. I'm a 14, and I watch comedies and if I enjoyed a romantic, yet sad movie, you will definitely enjoy it.<br/><br/>I rate this a definite 10 out of 10 due to it's music and filming. Some of the music in this movie is exciting and all of them were filled with just the right amount of emotion. The filming was always taking the perfect views, and it accentuated the feelings you get while watching this film."

One of my saving graces, from my shallow film sensibility, is that I love music. And while August Rush was nice and Hairspray was also good... ""Once"" was simply fantastic.

The acting was great... it was the kind that makes you think that the actors weren't acting.<br/><br/>There are only a few bits, here and there, where the pace dips a bit... but that's pretty rare. Once you get into the relationship of the two main actors, Once is Always engaging. <br/><br/>Anyway even if this movie doesn't make it to the top of 2007, still I would certainly put it high on the 2007 best list; certainly top 10."

","I came across ""Once"" at Blockbuster while browsing through the selections, and vaguely remembered reading some positive reviews on it. So, ""28 Weeks Later"" went back on the shelf, and ""Once"" replaced it in my hand. I'd just seen ""Halloween"" (the 2007 version), and wasn't really in the mood for another gorefest immediately afterward anyway (not that there's anything wrong with a good gorefest). When I got home, I checked out the reviews for ""Once"" on IMDb, and though pleased to see the high rating, was also prepared for a bit of disappointment, as it is extremely rare that a well-rated movie meets my expectations. As the ending credits for ""Once"" rolled, I sat mesmerized. It was absolutely fantastic. The characters seemed so real that you almost felt like you were watching a documentary. This movie is not a musical in the usual sense, as the characters do not sing dialog to one another, but it is certainly full of music. The story is not a unique one, but it is well-told and very believable. While most out here obviously enjoyed the film, I do think those who do not like the music may not, so there will definitely be an audience of detractors. Most of us, apparently, are not among them, and I urge you to find out where you stand for yourself. If you hate the song in the music store (which happens early-on), then you may not want to sit through the rest of ""Once,"" but if that song leaves you wanting to hear more, you're in for a real treat."

","I was given a recommendation by a friend to watch this movie. It was playing at the local Angelika, which I always like going to. I have seen quite a few foreign movies in that theatre and love it for the quality of movies they show almost always and undoubtedly this stands out for its impact it had on me. Its the level at which the movie is able to connect to you. Very deep, intense, thoughtful piece of art and spiritual at the same time and thats what makes it so different. I read it in one of the fact-o-files about the movie that the songs in the movie were intended to replace the need for lengthy dialogues. The feeling and the spirit and the positioning of the songs is able to do not just right, it takes it to a sublime level. Actually the movie lets you loose and at a certain time you feel convinced that for whatever reasons this movie is at a different plane and the set rules can very politely be ignored for making a comparison. I believe this is about the heart poured out and if you see this angle you will be able to leave aside all the critical nuances which one is quite often obliged to weigh a movie on. The songs are like meditation, raising the soul and you seem to get lost in them and I have listened to them every now and then and the impact keeps on growing. Definitely enjoyable and not just an ordinary musical. Not to be misunderstood as a chick flick."
"oneloveall","7","3","4","14 December 2007"," Solid reworking of the song-intensive film
","As a musical film Once does wonders to reinvigorate the genre with some much needed realism and urgency. This effect is in no small part due to the faux documentary style breathing staying power into an already well composed Damien Rice-esquire soundtrack. The two lead characters are thoroughly convincing as a pair of struggling souls, trying to make ends meet, who happen to cross paths in a most ordinary and unassuming way. Though the script certainly will not garner any praise (minimal though it may be, subtitles may be required through thick Irish accents), a bittersweet longing, albeit of the mildly shallow variety, does prevail as the overwhelming spirit of this convincing and soulful songwriting romance."

","""Once"" is worth seeing, perhaps even worth owning, if only for the music. (Note: Take Dramamine before viewing if you easily contract motion sickness, as the camera is hand-held for most of the film). Markéta Irglová's character (the Girl) is friendly, open-tempered and penetrating - a good contrast to Glen Hansard's portrayal of the melancholic, brooding, jilted lover (the Boy). This not a Hollywood formulaic film - from the hand-held camera, to using musicians rather than actors, to the realistic way the characters relate to each other - all these things are why I love this film. And I believe that viewers will find it a refreshing change from most Hollywood tripe. Must see this film...more than once!"
"MacAindrais","Null","3","4","16 October 2007"," Once upon a time, a guy met a girl.
","Once (2006) ****<br/><br/>A minimalist musical. It sounds an oxymoron. Alas it is not, it is John Carney's charming ""Once."" Carney directs the picture with no more and no less than what is necessary. This is an admirable choice for an indie film - a category that has come to be muddled with flash and pizazz cinematography. It is also admirable in that Carney takes his seat at the back, unnoticed, and allows his two leads, Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, to take front and centre. The film belongs to them and their music. <br/><br/>The story opens as the guy (Hansard) busk's, chases a man who is apparently a friend stealing his money, and then after dark when he can play his own songs (for people only pay for what they already know) he is questioned by a young woman, Girl (Irglova). Names are never given. She asks him what the songs are about - his ex he says. Where is she, girl says. She's gone, guy says. Why don't you go get her in London, girl asks? He converses with her, to his slight annoyance, and tells her that his official job is working in his father's vacuum shop. Great she says, I will take you my hoover and you can fix it for me tomorrow. Sure enough she shows up, dragging her hoover behind her as if she is walking a dog. Its strange, amusing and surprisingly charming. <br/><br/>He tries to get out of it, saying he doesn't have his tools and that he is going on break. She persuades him to allow her to come along and he can just have a look at it. She tells him that she is a musician as well, a pianist, but that she cannot afford a piano, so she plays for an hour every day at a local music shop. They go, he listens to her, she persuades him to teach her one of his songs. This will be the first time they play together, and we get the feeling immediately that there is something special. <br/><br/>After fixing her vacuum back at the shop, at his fathers house where he lives, they go upstairs and listen to his tapes. He asks her to stay. Surprisingly she seems offended and shocked and leaves. After apologizing the next day, he finds that she has a daughter. After a motorcycle ride, he finds out she has a husband back in the Czech Republic. He asks her how to say ""Do you love him,"" in ""the Czech."" She tells him, he repeats it back to her as a question. She responds in Czech, and refuses to translate. <br/><br/>She persuades him that he should go to London, seek out his ex, and pursue his music career. First he must get a professional recording. After securing a bank loan, from an unexpected and hilarious loan officer, he recruits fellow buskers and girl to join him. The music they create is beautiful enough to sway the jaded producer. Their feelings become obvious to us - he asks her to come with him to London, she says she has to take her mother and child if that was the case and they both realize its not possible. They complete their recordings, the music acting as the medium into which they channel their emotions for one another, the guy buys his ticket to London with encouragement from his father on his music, and she tells him that her husband is coming to Ireland to work things out for the sake of their child. Thats great, guy says. <br/><br/>That Marketa Irglova and Glen Hansard fell in love in real life gives more poignancy to the story, and adds that much of punch by the time the inevitable must occur. The film breaks conventions not only of musicals but of romance. It is another example of how sometimes the most romantic movies of all can end up unresolved. Think of Wong Kar Wai's In the Mood for Love. In neither film will you see the leads kiss, and there is barely an embrace. But the emotion is there, and that makes them all the more powerful and painful.<br/><br/>Once is about the love you feel, but cannot express. Guy and Girl have the rare opportunity to channel their emotions through music. Right from the get go, it is established that Guy is a broken soul, he has been writing about and yearning for his ex. Girl shows up and represents something new, and we find too that she is a broken soul. Once breaks down the standards of movie musicals as bombastic and entertaining spectacles, and instead shows us how music can be at once the bemoaning of our pain, and the mending of our souls."

","It is the ironies that sets the movie apart from other movies of its time. Two people meet and fall in love. It is as if each completes the other, the irony is that neither has completed the semi past romantic relationships they are in with others, It will do no good to consummate their relationship until that work is finished.<br/><br/>Whether conscious or with awareness, each commits to the other, and then go their separate ways. We are left not knowing how they will reunite, but with the feeling that they surely will when the time is right.<br/><br/>I admire how this movie was made, the script although unpolished, is original. The acting is subtle and tells the story wonderfully. The director takes us on a journey that i think that we each wish we would take at least once in our life time. I find myself still remembering the music a week after seeing the movie. Well done."
"daniel-wolfgang","7","3","4","13 July 2007"," Very good!!
","A very good film that examines life in music. The cinematography lacks in certain areas, but the soundtrack is so astounding that it's overshadowing. A good movie about an Irish vacuum repairman who wants to make a living with his music. He plays on the streets, and, in the process, catches the attention of a beautiful, young woman. She, of course, also has been blessed with musical talent. A very subtle romance begins to build between them as the Irish man's music career begins to take shape.<br/><br/>Great movie. In my opinion, the all-time best soundtrack...just slightly ahead of Garden State."
"christyhoward","8","3","4","9 July 2007"," good soundtrack
","I really enjoyed this film. I think it was an amazingly executed simple story. It really captured some basic human emotion well. The soundtrack was really touching. It sort of reminded me of Damian Rice. Very folky and soulful. I definitely want to get the soundtrack. I think parts of the movie seemed like a long music video, but I didn't mind because there was so much emotion in the songs that there was not much need for a lot of dialogue. I liked the vacuum scene I thought it was very endearing. The side characters were good as well, although I couldn't understand a word of the guy in the opening he had such a thick accent. I would see this one again. It's a great slice of life piece and I found it very entertaining."

","As a skeptic when it comes to musical especially on film, I really enjoyed this film. Is was not so much a musical as a heavily scored movie. The songs were important and helped convey emotion, but it wasn't cheesy and they came about organically. It also helped that I enjoy that particular type of music, soulful folk. The acting was great it seemed very real. I liked the little awkward moments and this was actually a slice of life that was able to have a happy twist with out being unrealistic or predictable. I liked that it was shot in Dublin I like seeing people in there element. The vacuum part was really cute. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I liked that it didn't try to hard it just was. It didn't attempt to be fancy. It was simple. I think it's true sometimes less is more!"

I am definitely going to pick up the sound track. It was interesting to see Dublin it looks like a cool city. I liked the relationship between father and son and with mother and daughter, I thought those parallels were good writing. The scene with the vacuum was so funny and cute. I think this is one of the best films of the year. Everyone should go see it. It's not flashy it's just real and it leaves you feeling great it's definitely worth seeing!"

","I really enjoyed this film. I'm generally not that big a fan of musicals, but to me this was less of a musical and more a film where the soundtrack was turned way up. It really helped progress the movie; the music was good, not corny like typical musical music. It was interesting to see the writing process and the musicians jam out with each other. I think it really portrayed the raw emotions of loneliness and how amazing it is to just find a kindred spirit. Though the leads really had no acting experience, I thought they were great. They had great chemistry; their voices blended so well together in the music. I like the realism in the story. I think the music combined with a simple yet relateable story really makes this film special and definitely worth watching. I'm definitely going to have to get the soundtrack while I wait for the DVD to come out!"

The music is great and I am buying the soundtrack...It is impressive to see sort of a musical on these days that is not cliché or cheesy. I like the simplicity of the movie and how the story flows. The acting is very captivating and the screenplay keeps your attention to what is going to happen next. Interesting to see how two people can be ""perfect"" for each other at a particular moment in their lives but not pursue anything. It's a love story of some how platonic love yet beautiful.

"ptb4life","10","4","6","10 September 2007"," A Musical for people who hate musicals.
","Once is a musical. Before you go running from this review, let me explain to you why you should still give it a chance. Technically, Once is a musical, but it's not the kind you've ever seen before. There are no song and dance numbers, people don't burst into song for no reason (complete with an orchestra backing them up). All the music in the film serves the plot and flows quite naturally from the performers. The guy (he isn't given a name) is a struggling street performer, and much of the music comes from his performances. One day he meets a cute as a button Czech immigrant we'll call girl (again, never given a name). These two get to talking and in each other find their musical soul mate (and perhaps love). Most of the plot is moved forward through the songs, whether they are showing him writing a song in his room, or the two of them practicing a song in a music shop. So the movie is about the music they make together. It also about their budding romance and about their past lovers (the inspiration for much of their songs). I absolutely adored this movie. Everything just came together perfectly for me. The music was really great and moving (I bought the soundtrack immediately after the movie), and added so much more emotional depth to these characters. The 2 leads were just perfect, they were funny, extremely talented and real. You can't help getting attached to them and pulling for them.<br/><br/>I'm going to go into major SPOILER territory now, so you've been warned:<br/><br/>While watching the movie, I kept having a sense of dread that these two wouldn't get together in the end....yet the movie kept teasing us with the possibility. She has an estranged husband back Czech, and he has an ex girlfriend in London. Hopefully it's obvious to the viewer that they have fallen for each other, but it's tough for both of them to let go of the past. And in the girl's case, she wants her daughter to have her father (not to mention, the Guy told her he is going to go to London and find his ex). But they keep dangling the carrot in front you of, hoping that somehow they will end up together. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen (on screen at least). When the credits started to roll, I was pretty upset that it didn't happen. However, given time to think, I'm not sure it even matters. This is a story about a guy and a girl and the week or so they spent together making music together and falling in love. Like in real life, you don't always end up with the girl that changed your life. If you want, you can imagine that he comes back for her and they live happily ever after (hey, it could happen!). In a way, this movie is so much like Before Sunset (one of my favorites). It leaves things open and is beautiful. One last thing, there is a scene in the movie where the Guy asks the Girl if she still loves her husband....she answers him in Czech. I made a point to look it up when I got home and it brought tears to my eyes and just made me love this movie that much more <br/><br/>spoilers above. . . <br/><br/>Verdict: I would recommend this movie to MOST anyone, although it does come with this warning. How much you like this movie does depend a lot on how much you like the music. If for some reason you absolutely hate acoustic guitar and heartfelt singing, you should avoid this movie. Also, if you demand a typical Hollywood ending, you might want to go watch Transformers again or something. Everyone else, seek out this movie (it's still in theaters, but limited......or wait for DVD in Dec).<br/><br/>A+"

This film is rubbish, and I mean rubbish. Glen Hansard is playing the lead in this film, the same guy who wrote nearly all the songs played, and it is clearly some sort of ego trip or mad publicity stunt to try and get people to buy his music.<br/><br/>Let's face it, it is just the same 12 songs one after the other, often repeated, wrapped around a pretty lame story about boy meets girl.<br/><br/>This is not a musical as the songs do not fit together to form part of the story. So, when they start singing together it is nice, but do we really need to go through the entire song from start to finish? When they go into the recording studio, we know that they are going to record tracks, but they make us listen to them in their entirety. And so it goes on. Is this necessary? Of course not. They are just trying to promote this guy's music and make money by selling the soundtrack in my opinion.<br/><br/>Where do all these high scores come from? 8.2 out of 10!! Complete Joke.<br/><br/>Nice marketing trick, decent music, really bad film."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","7","9 April 2008"," Music and romance, both in best form
","Strangely, I associated ""Once"" almost immediately with ""Lost in translation"". It is perhaps not that strange if you really think about it. Although LIT does not have anything remotely musical in its content, both movies are also about two people meeting randomly, and then connecting, because of a common experience. One is music, and the other is loneliness. Even more than that, all four protagonists are coming from a troubled love relationship. In LIT, these relationships are approaching the point of failure. In Once, they have already failed.<br/><br/>I find it difficult to decide whether music or commiserating in lost love that is the stronger link between he and she (their ""names"" in the movie are ""guy"" and ""girl""). I finally decided that it is music. But when they first meet, when she listens to him singing in the evening at a deserted street corner in Dublin, she seems just as interested in what is behind the song as in the song itself. She keeps on asking him about his ex-girlfriend. It's a little later in the movie that he finds out more about her, how she has left her husband behind in Czechoslovakia and come to Ireland with her mother and toddler daughter.<br/><br/>It is however beyond a shadow of a doubt that they first really connect when they have a chance to play together, with the kind permission of a music store manager, during a quiet hour. After she has played a little Mendelssohn on the piano, he shows her one of his songs, in simple C major, and invites her to try to join in with the piano. After tentatively trying a few phrases and the chorus, she gets more and more into the song until finally guitar, piano and two beautiful voices sound like they have been playing together for years. I have watched not a few scenes in other movies that are musically superior, but none, not one, that is as beautiful.<br/><br/>This short (less than 90 minutes) and sweet (and sometimes bittersweet) movie evolves around how they make music together, how they talk about themselves and their feelings through music and the ""climax"" of their renting a proper studio and, together with a few other street musicians assembled, record a quality demo which finally allows him to get his musical career started in London. She gets a new start on her life too when her husband comes to join her to give their relationship another try.<br/><br/>With refreshing understatement, the brief romance, if we can call it that, between the protagonists is at once heartwarming and heart-wrenching. There is no pretence that physical (or sexual, if you like) attraction does not exist. Soon fater their first encounter, he invites her to stay for the night, which she flatly refuses but does not hold it against him after his sincere apology. Towards the end, after the exhilarating experience of recording all night at the studio and knowing that this will be the last day before he leaves for London, he asks her to come to his place to listen to the CD again. She says that as they have completed their musical mission, what is there left for them to do but ""hanky panky"". Smiling, she says, ""And they wouldn't be bad"". After his persistent plead, she says she'll come. She never did. Their musical union has transcended anything physical. Their parting in front of the recording studio in the wee hours of the morning, when she gives him a quick, light kiss on the cheek, is the last we see them together in the movie. And that is for the best.<br/><br/>Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglove are wonderful. My only regret is that I didn't get to watch the movie until after Oscar night."

","WARNING: SPOILERS ALERT! Great music by Hansard which is moving and beautifully performed. Also nice natural non-acting by the two leads. Some decent use of locations and street lighting. However the story is paper-thin and wouldn't fill a half-hour slot on the TV. I don't want to sound too negative - it's thoroughly pleasant as a watching experience - but I was neither moved nor convinced by the story, such as it was. My main niggle apart from this was the incredibly unrealistic recording studio scene. More niggles: why did he need to go to the studio anyway? Why did he need a band? Other niggles: would her husband really have been happy about a gift of a piano from a strange man? If she wasn't interested in Guy, why was she flirting out of character so outrageously during the bike scene? Do people who sell the Big Issue really own their own vacuum cleaners? Having said all of the above I'd still love to be involved in a film like this. This sort of project (not necessarily with music) is the future of non-YankeeDoodle film-making - cheap, lovingly made, each element carefully chosen, simple story but complex emotions, letting the camera watch what happens rather than overdirecting. A micro-budget film-maker has many advantages over a Hollywood serf: time to think, no need to make or maintain star status: that's two for a start."

","'Once' is a slight and charming film. And when it's over, the final scene captures a bittersweet tone I haven't seen since Local Hero. It closes a moment in these characters lives and sends these people away very respectfully, very nicely, which is completely in line with the rest of the movie. The pleasures were modest, and yet one misses the chance of further moments with such ordinary people instantly. Initially, as I watched, I was selecting places the conflict would come from and casting new faces as the villain... but this movie dispenses with villains, explosions, chases, false conflicts, false endings; underscoring what tired contrivances they are. It also dismisses iPods, style, attitude, bitchiness, conspicuous consumption... All of this crap proves to be extraneous. Reality sells itself. Human beings are back, front and center. How is it that Lars von Triers reductivist ""Dogme 95"" rules, which should result in simple, direct movies like this, instead yield his last 5 pieces of phony, over-mannered, art-schlock.<br/><br/>As soon as I was done I wanted to review certain scenes. The standard sincere contemporary Irish emo ballad (caterwauling) and the Irish tendency for rooms full of drunken people to break into awful songs, are not my cup of tea but it barely matters. The movie is very small and honest. Try pitching that to Hollywood.<br/><br/>You: ""I'd like to make a nice, small, honest movie"" <br/><br/>Hollywood: ""That's not what we do""<br/><br/>The supportive Irish family (There IS such a thing?), supportive friends, & strangers seem atypical to this Irish American. Where are the miserable, envious relatives undercutting your every move with crippling, defeatist remarks and guilt? (yuck yuck) I would love to see this movie win a boatload of Oscars to show Hollywood another, less grotesque, way to proceed. Unfortunately with the writers strike, the Oscars are likely to be canceled."
"cliffhanley_","6","4","7","13 October 2007"," Like the best songs
","The story of this little film, made on a budget of fifty quid, apparently, (most of the crew were doing it as a favour) is the stuff of film itself. One of the few prints made was playing at little cinemas round Ireland as a double bill with the two stars in performance, who then sold as many CDs as possible at each gig. This was 'big time'; until, at least, the film was shown at the Dublin Film Festival, and one of the Sundance Festival committee members happened to wander in while on holiday, saw it, fell for it, and took it home to Sundance, where it won a big gong. In a step further away from 'real life', the lead's band found themselves opening for Bob Dylan. I can imagine it: ""Uh, hi. This is Bob"" ""Bob who?""<br/><br/>Glen Hansard, front man of The Frames for 17 years and 'the guitarist' in The Commitments was approached by Carney after a Frames gig in Dublin in 2005, with an idea about building a story around some songs. And in fact, the film remains true to that idea: a few times, the guy, instead of speaking to the girl, picks up his battered guitar and croons, or yells, an 'impromptu' verse. So in a way, it's as much a traditional musical as an Elvis vehicle. None of the gloss of Hollywood production in this, though, and everyone was playing a version of themselves with only the most rudimentary idea of a script, or a good deal of improvising. That can have its drawbacks: the two central characters are so natural that they sometimes seem to forget to include the camera when talking, so much of their dialogue is lost, especially in the street scenes.<br/><br/>The Guy is working in his father's hoover repair shop and busking on the side, while nursing a broken heart after his girl ran off to London. The Girl is a Czech immigrant with a little girl, a mother to support and a fighting spirit. They are obviously wrong for each other, but their little orbits keep colliding, and they make beautiful music. Literally. Others play their parts - fellow musicians, the bank manager, but it's a tale of loving and longing which never really finishes. Just like the best songs. CLIFF HANLEY"

","When i watched this movie today i had high expectations since i had seen so many reviews in IMDb saying it was amazing. However i don't agree at all, i think this movie had extremely bad camera angles, a very boring story and the brightness throughout the entire movie was very bad. Sure the movie was made on a very low budget but i would still rather watch a well made movie that cost more than this one. Every scene in the movie ended up in the actors playing and/or singing worthless dull music. Maybe it's just not my kind of music since i couldn't enjoy it at all. Maybe if you're a fanatic of dull romantic music this movie would be great but i can't possibly believe almost all of the people making reviews here are such fanatics so i must have missed something very important that would have made the movie better but the impression i got is bad music, low brightness and overall a lame cliché story."

","Very slow and too much music. Certainly not worth 8.0. The story is developing incredibly slow and isn't really going anywhere. After a while I started skipping through the movie just to speed things up a bit. What an incredible slow movie. And I didn't particularly liked the music as well. It seems to take ages before the next scene comes. You are constantly waiting for a song to end so the next scene can start. The beginning is quite nice but after a while it simply gets really boring. You start to wonder if anything will happen at all, but disappointingly nothing really happens. I gave one star just to take the average rating down. 8.0 is way too high, if you ask me."

","A lot of these reviews seem to espouse the point of view that perhaps they didn't like the movie because they don't like emo 90's music. Well, they're wrong! I love emo music, I love whiny soulful disappointed lovers singing their hearts out. But the music in this movie was too much, even for me. Every single song was depressing and dramatic to the point of ridiculousness. This movie was also clearly made by people who don't know how to make movies. The cinematography was terrible. The scene where the girl wonders from the battery store to her house takes FOREVER, is lit terribly, and isn't visually interesting. I was also annoyed by how forced all the scenes w/ the boy and girl are-one in front, one behind-they're always angled in such a way so that they're both visible, but it's done so consciously it looks like a middle school play. Also, if you set yourself up as a romance and NOTHING happens between your two main characters, I don't call that brave. Alas, it's been done before, and it is always really disappointing. Why must we be depressed and unsatisfied? Why? Are filmmakers just trying to teach us all a lesson about life? Life can be disappointing, we get it-why torture us w/ the fact???? Also, every turn in the film was deeply predictable. Like, when they're in the studio and the techie is all bored, you know instantly that he's going to be deeply wowed by their work and learn to respect them. Yawn. And the scene where they're all running around on the beach...that's just ridiculous. Also, I don't understand how the guy's supposed to be this incredible talent who can set up a perfect studio session in less than a week...and this is only happening now. Was he just sitting there w/ his bush under his basket, waiting for that girl? Like, he never would have gotten the loan w/o her fashion expertise? Cause that's just crazy... The only thing I liked about the movie was that it took place in Dublin. It made me really want to revisit. But...that's cause Dublin is cool, not this movie. This movie has nothing to teach you or satisfy you, so don't waste your time."

","I think I remember seeing a trailer for this low budget British independent film, and I liked the look of it, and then I saw it listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was definitely going to see it. Basically the story is set in Dublin, where busker and unnamed Guy (Glen Hansard, from the Irish band The Frames) is a guitarist/songwriter/singer who makes his living fixing vacuum cleaners in the shop belonging to his Dad (Bill Hodnett). But his passion is in his songs, which he only sings during the night on the streets, he feels like people want to hear the more popular tunes, and his music isn't just for the money. He meets up with the unnamed Girl (Markéta Irglová) from Czechoslovakia, who does some odd jobs by day and takes care of her Mother (Danuse Ktrestova) and daughter by night. She also plays the piano, and is very intrigued by his songs that he wrote about the girl he loved, left him and now lives in London, she also happens to have a vacuum cleaner that needs fixing. Their music is what brings them closer together, and as they blend their talents together, the Girl is very interested to help him achieve his dream. Then the Guy gives in, and he agrees that he should make something of his songs, so he gets the Girl and some street players together, and they rent a recording studio for the weekend to record two demos. The studio manager is very impressed by the songs that the Guy has written, and they successful put the demos onto CD ready to take to a record label. Sadly, with the Guy going to London to get a recording contract, and the Girl expecting to reunite with her husband, they part ways, with him leaving her a new piano, and what could have possibly been a romance never is. Also starring Hugh Walsh as Timmy Drummer, Gerard 'Gerry' Hendrick as Lead Guitarist, Alaistair Foley as Bassist, Geoff Minogue as Eamon, Darren Healy as Heroin Addict, Mal Whyte as Bill and Niall Cleary as Bob. The two leads make wonderful music both in the connection they have and the songs they make together, you can tell with a very slightly shaky camera this was done for almost peanuts, but it doesn't need to have anything added to make it a complete gem, a must see musical drama. I wanted Take That's ""Rule The World"" from Stardust to be nominated an Oscar, but it never was, and Enchanted was nominated the Oscar for Best Song three times, which is completely unfair, but I am really glad the right song from this film was picked to win. It won the Oscar for Best Song for the brilliant ""Falling Slowly"". Very good!"

The chemistry between Guy and Girl is amazing, heartfelt. Everything about this film feels real, the music is touching and sad. Words cannot describe how Once makes me feel, with it's music and characters. It is ultimately a film about two people who meet each other, fall into a different kind of love, and then are forced to leave each other, even though the impacts they had on each other will never leave them. The ending is also absolutely heartwrenching, because I felt sadness and hopefulness for the love two people can bring each other. Everyone needs to see Once"
"paudie","9","3","5","12 October 2009"," Modern Musical
","After watching ""Once"" I read a few reviews that described it as a modern musical and that is a perfect description. I'm not a fan of the ""traditional"" musical where the guys and gals break into song and dance at every opportunity. The music may be great but the placing of the songs in the story always grates a little.<br/><br/>This film is full of songs (but no dancing) and it feels perfectly natural. The two main characters meet through music and are attracted to each other partly because of their big part music plays in both their lives. The songs are in the film as part of their story and don't feel shoehorned in.<br/><br/>The film is only 80 minutes long and the story is simple. A Dublin busker and a Czech immigrant strike up a friendship. There is a mutual attraction but their individual circumstances mean that we know they will not end up together, however much we want that to happen. Glenn Hansard and Marketa Irglova are excellent as the couple. Each of their stories is sad in its own way but not without hope. I won't give much detail as part of the beauty of the film is how their relationship develops as they learn more about each other.<br/><br/>From a musical point of view the Oscar winning song ""Falling Slowly"" is a classic in the making. I couldn't get it out my head for days afterwards. However some of the other Glenn Hansard songs are a bit too intense and earnest for me. Anyone familiar with the albums of Hansard's band The Frames will know what I'm talking about. Irglova's songs are easier on the ear and more romantic.<br/><br/>Even a cynic by myself couldn't help be touched by this bittersweet story that is always grounded in the real world.<br/><br/>A beautiful that I would recommend to anyone."

I was drawn in initially by a friend and the fact that this won an Original Song award at the Oscars.<br/><br/>I didn't even realize until the end that the characters didn't even have names. The DVDs have great commentary tracks providing further information that just makes this picture all the better.<br/><br/>A plot summary doesn't even suffice. It's two people who are both lonely in their own way and need each other so much but were just meant to be friends and came together in a great way at the right time.

","If you choose to see this movie which you most definitely should then i give you this one advice: see it then think about it, and then see it again with your eyes closed and mouth wide open. The reason being that the real story of the movie lies hidden in the lyrics of the songs which also carries the movie forward as you would have experienced the first time you saw it. The music is incredibly simplistic yet has struck a nerve with just about anyone I know who has listened to it. Also I highly recommend getting your hands on Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova's joint venture: The Swell Season. I have played music for 20 years and rarely find myself touched by music so intensely and easily as I experienced with this beautiful, soulful and honest music. This is a love story. A story about love of music, creating it, and listening to it!"
"nymovielover1961","10","3","5","20 March 2008"," Sheer Simplicity and Brilliance
","If you'll excuse me, the title of this comment is somewhat incorrect. What I should write, or type rather, is that the sheer simplicity of this film paves the road to it's brilliance.<br/><br/>I can say little about this film otherwise, besides the fact that it makes my heart tingle. From the gnawing feeling in my gut that these two, whose names are cleverly never exposed, are meant for each other, to the strange sensation that settles over me whenever I listen to the songs that so eloquently, poetically, and beautifully tell this tale, it is undeniably stealthy at worming it's way into your heart.<br/><br/>At the very core of this Irish masterpiece is the film-making strategy that the director and writer, John Carney, speaks of in the special features (which I have watched along with the countless times I've seen the movie). The methodical yet docile way of showing the world and melding of Marketa Irglova and Glen Hansard is an important and innocently metaphoric facet of the film.<br/><br/>Yet another amazing part of this movie is the music, obviously. My mother watched this movie with me the fifth time I'd seen it and her response was simply ""This thing's got no PLOT!"" I just said, ""Whoa-- listen to the music."" Not to sound to much like a Doobie Brother. The lyrics are, as best I can say, perfect in their loneliness. The use of acoustic guitar, and may I say PIANO, is flawless and endearing. The smart incorporation of a band into the plot in order to flaunt more musical diversity provides a new scope of the ""musical"" aspects to the movie. Overall, the music is a thing to marvel at and connect to, as we've all been there. Yet it's also something that smirks at the face of useless pop ballads, rap rants, inaudible death chants disguised as rock, the annoying twangs of country, and the meaningless beats of disco, dance, too-techno compositions, and junk like Fergie and Nelly Furtado. Songs like ""Falling Slowly,"" ""Lies,"" ""When Your Mind's Made Up,"" and ""Say It To Me Now"" are in a category all their own: mind-boggling/life changing.<br/><br/>I cannot say more than I have about this piece of art, except that if I could draw on this document, I would put two giant thumbs up to everybody who had a single thing to do with this film."

","Had James Joyce written and directed a musical, it could have been Once. Not only because this film is Irish and that the two lovers are both Dubliners, but this cinematic gem is definitely the most believable musical made in film. The actors do not break into song and dance numbers; there are no artificial and spectacular props in the background and grand historically accurate costumes that steal our attentions; and there are no special effects whatsoever. Everything in Once is stripped to its quintessence. The characters are real, very human--the cinematography gives a realistic tone with its hushed and raw images of authentic Dublin and its citizens. The performances are amazing--passionate and moving. And most importantly, the story zaps us back to reality without sacrificing important thrusts on the realm of human relationships. <br/><br/>The characters are nameless. The Guy is a gifted singer and composer who earns part-time singing in the streets. He sings about his failed relationship. One night, the Girl finds him belting out his emotions with his guitar while nobody pays attention to his song; she is very much impressed. She happens to be a daughter of someone who used to play in an orchestra. She knows good music when she sees--rather--hears it. The following day, they meet again, and she plays the piano for him. Then, they sing a song together, ""Falling Slowly."" The Girl inspires the Guy to get his groove back. The Guy falls slowly for her. And the Girl does for him, too, though not obviously. But then, they are both tied to their past--and when they sing, they sing of their past relationships. <br/><br/>The tagline of the movie probably sets us in the mood: How often do you find the right person? Does the film's title answer this?<br/><br/>According to IMDb.com Trivia section, ""the title refers to the many very talented artists that John Carney (the director) knew who put off their career by saying 'once' they get this and that sorted out, but never succeed because they've put it off too long. This describes the lead character, The Guy.""<br/><br/>The Girl gives him his inspiration. This is the 'Once' which the Guy has been waiting for in a long time. Then, they made music. Brilliant music.<br/><br/>Classic musicals have three aspects that made them classics: an immediate LSS inducing- repertoire, an addictive vibe that makes you want to watch the movie more than three times in a week, and memorable songs which you will memorize eventually. Once has all of these qualities... which is paradoxical if you consider the title of the movie and all of these habit- engendering aspects."

The music in the movie is of the adult alternative style and is sung so amazingly well. The acting was without a doubt above and beyond, there was this sense that I wasn't watching a movie but rather that somewhere some guy with a camera was following these people around filming their lives. Everything in it felt very, very real and genuine. Throughout the entire movie I had this sense of deep sadness though there was nothing specific in the film I could point at and say ""thats what's causing all this emotion"", quite an achievement really. The fact that the two main characters were the actual musicians and not actors is completely fantatsic, why can't professional actors give this kind of performance?

Their possible relationship is cleverly uncertain. The relationship between Hansard and his Hoover Repairman Father is also charmingly balanced.<br/><br/>But for me the music grates after a while.

That isn't to say that this is a musical. It isn't. It's a romantic drama with a lot of music in it because the two principals are singers and writers and the story revolves around their writing and singing, but it's not a musical in which dialog is sung, not at all.<br/><br/>The important thing to realize in this story is that it is actually about two people who are leading their separate lives, but spend a week working on their music together and inspire each other to take right paths in each of their lives.

","Words can not describe what I felt when the credits began to roll after I had finished the movie. I'm guessing it must be love. AND I LOVED THIS FILM.<br/><br/>Some might question what the big deal is about the movie. There's barely a story, the direction is not masterful, and its too simple. But that is the thing. Once is so simple a film that it catches your heart. It shows that love does not have to be romantic or sexual, but it can rather be by the music two people share.<br/><br/>The two stars have great chemistry too for no acting experience. You feel rather instead of watching a film, this a documentary. But it isn't, and it still feels raw and real. Glen Hasgard (lead guitar for The Frames) has a great singing voice and has some charm, if not a lot of charm. His singing in some of the songs make you feel good.<br/><br/>And what about Marketa Irglova? She's so beautiful she makes the cruel and cold hearted people have their hearts melted when she smiles. She's only 19, and she sings like a pro.<br/><br/>But in the end, they split their paths, but you can tell their music still keeps them together, and keeps their love. Just like me, and any other viewer will continue to love this movie."

","I had read great things about this little independent Irish film and so was thrilled when I came across it to rent, though perhaps also aware of the hype surrounding it. Was this hype justified? It certainly was....<br/><br/>The movie was real and natural. Nothing felt forced or cheesy (as romantic movies often do.) It was funny and yet moving. Sweet but not sickly. I thought the leads were terrific and wow what voices. Though I am Irish, I've never taken much notice of the Frames, simply thinking they were standard singer-songwriter fare. But Hansard has a gorgeous voice and a real way with words. Irglová too had such a quiet yet beautiful sound and the two together was magic.<br/><br/>If you like independent film (or just like music)but can't remember the last time you were truly engaged with an indie flick, well take a look at 'Once'.<br/><br/>Simple, quiet and real, it features a cracking Irish soundtrack and wonderfully natural acting and direction. Just Gorgeous."

","I often watch movies, good, bad, I just want to kill time after supper or after sports before. But I haven't met a lot of good movies yet, in fact, zero, in my mind. To me the worst book I've ever read is better than the best movie I've watched. When I browse the Amazon bestseller list, I skip the movie category no matter what is hot in it. I was totally disappointed with these Hollywood potboilers. I hate wasting time in selecting-watching-being-disappointed format. I love music, I spend a lot of time on Amazon music section. As far as I can tell, since last summer, Once has been always in top 100, maybe top 50. But I didn't even try the sample, because I've never heard of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova.<br/><br/>Yesterday, when I'm doing my routine browse on Amazon, the CD finally caught my eye. I clicked the link then found it was the music from the movie Once. I listened to the samples, then decided to watch the indie(though only 4.5 stars on Amazon, but the samples from OST added another .5). It's only 86 minutes, It won't take a long time.<br/><br/>I didn't budge an inch on my chair during the movie, even the credits began to roll. I couldn't even believe when It ended. How can it end so fast, what's next? The movie is just incredibly beautiful, I know that foreign movies are much better than Hollywood's(Whale Rider, Pan's Labyrinth, the Sea Inside), this one is another find in 2007, I just don't know how to simplify my feelings.<br/><br/>The story is simple, the friendship and chemistry between two main characters are convincing and touching, the performance was down-to-earth, no exaggeration, no special-effect of course, but full of warmness and sincerity. The music is passionate and delighting. So what else do you want for a movie about real life? Conspiracy?<br/><br/>Please go to see this movie."
"Philby-3","9","3","5","23 September 2007"," A musical for people who can't afford musicals
","This is a pleasant if slightly poignant love story about two people whose bond is music rather than lust. It's also one of the cheapest musicals ever made. Guy (Glen Hansard from the band Frame) is Irish, a repairer of Hoovers (vacuum cleaners) who busks with his guitar and voice in Dublin shopping streets in his spare time, nursing the hurt caused by his ex-girlfriend who has left him and gone to London. Girl (Marketa Irglova) is a young mother who has left her husband and her country, the Czech Republic, to seek a better life in Ireland (the film is set a few years back before Ireland became top of the GDP per head pops). Both are writers as much as performers and it is not long before they are recording their own stuff. She clearly likes him, but she rebuffs his advances. No matter, because they make beautiful music together.<br/><br/>For a movie without a great deal of dramatic tension (it is almost documentary-like at time) it is remarkably absorbing. The music is what you'd expect  sentimental pop, but not pap, and generally easy listening. There's not a nasty person in the film, save perhaps for a heroin addict who tries to rip off Guy in the opening frames. The hand-held camera gives immediacy  you might almost be walking down a crowded Grafton St, where this correspondent's grandfather used to ply his trade as a high class Ladies' Draper (Newell's of Dublin, a site now occupied by the more downmarket Dunne's). Glen Hansard is not an actor by profession (though he had a small part in ""The Commitments"" 15 years ago) but he's fine here, with the right amount of anguish for Guy. Marketa Irglova is just brilliant as the Girl. Casting often means young actors have to appear younger than they actually are, but here Irglova at 17 manages to convince us she is in her mid-twenties, as well as writing and playing a good deal of the music.<br/><br/>This movie was shot in 17 days in and around Dublin and cost about $US 150,000. Much of the music is original and the performers are mostly musicians, not actors. It's a slight piece but it holds together well despite the lack of dramatic tension. You come out of the theatre in a cheerful frame of mind. Perhaps it does help if you like folk-pop music but this is pleasant, accessible stuff. I'd like to think that Granddad wouldn't have rung the Garda to have them moved on."
"christian94","8","3","5","10 July 2007"," Memories & Dreams -- Memorable Movie Night Part 2: The Musical
","This simple film won audience awards at both Sundance and Dublin Film Festival where the action of the film takes place. Action is a big word--besides a hilarious chase at the beginning of the movie, there is not much action--, yet this movie is sure to captivate engaged audience everywhere. The music is dominant and I did not adore or hate it. I found it good and to shine on occasion. The story is pretty straightforward, but this movie is all about the details, about finding beauty and truth in the ordinary. A bit like Americain Beauty (1999), but much more subtle, never overt.<br/><br/>John Carney writes and directs, and finds pleasure in the realism and flaws of his characters and story. A story that looks at the past and future with equal restrained, yet nostalgic gaze. A musical mixture of past memories, fantasies and desire for new memories. An acceptance of the world, an assured happiness in relatively uncomfortable social conditions. A human bond. A share experience.<br/><br/>The music has nothing earth-shattering, but the directing & editing do. The camera-work is shaky and disturbing at parts, but the whole approach to filming is welcomed and has some novelties in film. A song where the girl sings at night in the street brought me right there with her and her music. The clever montage of the guy's past lover was the best I've seen in any film yet. You did not feel you were watching some flashback-type plot device, but actually getting a glimpse at an intimate couple's life.<br/><br/>Above all, this film remains simple, but when I say simple, I also mean true to its vision, true to its characters & story, and true to the essential. This movie's main takeaway in my opinion is to remind ourselves of what is really essential in our lives. It encourages us to appreciate and cherish. Well John, I appreciate. Thank you."

","A very simple, but roughly elegant and charismatic story of a poor busker in Dublin striving to make it in the UK folk/rock music biz, and of his short but very sweet interlude with a musically talented eastern European immigrant girl who helps him with his music but also has her own musical vision. His vision is different and much more ambitious, whereas hers is more familial, personal and introspective. Even though they differed greatly in their need for and of artistic expression, sensitive and unselfish gratitude was shown on both sides for the help they gave each other on the way.<br/><br/>Great Frames music throughout, as the soulfulness and pain of love is expressed so tenderly and sensitively, but with great power, by the impressive lead singer of The Frames, Glen Hansard. In real life, The Frames fly well under the huge radar of that ""other"" Irish group U2, but it also has its own charisma working well here in Hansard's music. Just excellent songwriting and singing in a perfect blending of Hansard's talents. I was very impressed with him and enjoyed the story and his music immensely(bought the soundtrack).<br/><br/>From our typical expectations at film's end, it just proves so well how much Hollywood has influenced us about romantic movie endings as we all wanted the two leads to get together at the end. Life is not Hollywood, and thank heaven for that. As a result, it was a much more realistic story.<br/><br/>My best 3 films of the year so far in this order....Waitress, Ratatoille, and Once.

","Here is another take on the boy meets girl, boy wins girl heart, and boy is left... There is a lot to like in this film of a struggling artist who meets his muse only to discover that there might not be much of a chance to go past the original spiritual connection. For thousands of years, people have ""fallen in love"" and enjoyed themselves for a while, only to discover that it might not have the real thing. In ""Once"" we follow our two protagonists as they begin to explore the possibility of finding something deeper and extraordinary in their lives.<br/><br/>Through the use of songs, quiet moments, deep conversations, and simple camera-work, we witness how much closer they become. The two lead characters are very likable, ""guy"" shows an edgy, soulful side as he writes melodies and lyrics for what is unable to express otherwise. His dialogue is quite limited, but his songs are pretty expressive. ""Girl"" is an immigrant who by all means shouldn't be able to communicate this well, but transcends that limitation with her appreciation of music, her own, and others'.<br/><br/>The camera-work is not very exciting, and there is plenty of natural light here to emphasize the fact this is a quiet and simple exploration of a simple relationship. The result is extraordinary as we are moved and are able to feel some of the same emotions that ""guy"" and ""girl"" are experiencing. It's a sweet and lovely film."

I was wrong.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with some dude playing one of those three-chord acoustic guitar and unpleasant vocal songs, just like the hundreds of songs I've had to sit and listen to during my early days when I performed in open stages, coffeehouses, and talent nights.<br/><br/>Then something happens, and it's night-time, and the same dude is singing again; this time with somewhat more interesting guitar chords, but the voice is even more irritating.<br/><br/>Then he talks with a chick for a few minutes; turns out he is a vacuum-cleaner repair person, and she just happens to have a broken vacuum-cleaner, and they agree to meet the next day (yeah, right).<br/><br/>He goes back to his apartment and starts singing and playing his guitar again.<br/><br/>Next day, she meets him on the street, pulling her broken vacuum-cleaner behind her by the hose.

Since he can't fix it there, and it would make way too much sense to take it to the repair shop, they eat some food and go to a music store where she can play the piano (which must have a few broken keys, or else she goofed up the same couple of notes twice) and -- you guessed it -- he sings again (so does she).<br/><br/>Then they're sitting in the back of a bus, and he starts playing the guitar and singing again -- at this point, I got up, left the theater without turning back, and drove home.<br/><br/>I suppose it might be interesting to know what ever happened between the two of them, but the thought of sitting there for another hour or so of three-chord acoustic guitar songs with unpleasant vocals was simply too much for me."

","I was unfortunate enough to see this at the Sarajevo film festival, and it was easily the worst film of the selection shown, and one the worst films I have ever sat through. The story is horribly clichéd, and I found the characters completely dull and predictable. Perhaps the most grating aspect of the film was the music, which was cringe worthy. Basically, John Carney has filmed an 85 minute James Blunt video, a crime that should be punishable by law. I was expecting the film to take a u-turn at some point and reveal some deeper commentary on the music industry or perhaps present a refreshing twist on a love story, but instead it plods along with a level of sincerity that is both naive and superficial.<br/><br/>Once is wholly conventional and unrelentingly smug; perpetuating stereotypes of the music industry that any intelligent film maker would challenge or subvert. The film's soundtrack (apparently written by the two stars) is repetitive and shockingly bad, doing nothing to flesh out the characters or tell the audience anything we don't already know. Another film I saw at the festival, Gus Van Sant's Paranoid Park, would be a prime example of masterful utilization of soundtrack and score, whereas this was merely offensive and self-indulgent. If anyone wants to see this kind of film done right then I suggest you see the popular Lost In Translation, or the stunning work of art that is Hiroshima Mon Amour."

Rather, it stirs one to think - ""My life is more interesting than that! I should offer it up as a screenplay."" <br/><br/>This film is about relationships with a strong infusion of music. The music left me with so little impression that I doubt that I could recognize it; the boy/girl relationship reminded me of a Harlequin novel.

We don't notice this. It's not to show off a stylistic choice. What do we get from their names?<br/><br/>The film doesn't spend time on particulars. It alludes to the character's respective past, and the predicaments of their situation, predominantly from their music. Nonetheless, the conversational narrative is charming. From the get go neither character pulls any punches in what they think about the other. In a Dublin town centre Her questions Him why he doesn't play the song he's performed at daytime. Him tells her that people want to hear familiar music and the ten cents she gave him evidences his point.<br/><br/>People may question Marketa Irglova's accent as she is a Czech immigrant living in Ireland. Although at times the Irish accent came through a little forcefully, it truly appeared indicative of someone who had moved to an alien country and was learning from imitation."

","There is a scene in the Irish musical 'Once' in which our nameless characters--our Guy and Girl--play a song in a music store. Guy sings lead and plays guitar while girl plays piano and sings backup. Clocking in at just over four minutes, this song is so emotional and enchanting that we feel the effects of that one tune long after it ends. Sometimes one scene can define a film. To me it was our two stars singing the song entitled ""Falling Slowly"".<br/><br/>'Once' could have been made with a big budget, but the director chose to make it micro budget and left the script skeletal. This allows more authenticity and takes us closer to the leads. The home video camera look makes this feel like a documentary, plus the immersiveness into the characters' lives make the viewer feel like they are watching old home movies of their best friends.<br/><br/>'Once' is a love letter to music. Music is a universal art that is so personal and speaks to the soul. With music, so many people feel that their lives make sense. Director John Carney shows on film exactly how this can be. Each song in this movie is very emotional, but getting to know the characters on screen increases our affections. And the characters are developed pretty well in a short amount of time. Guy is a busker who also works at his father's vacuum shop. He recently broke up with his girlfriend, but he still loves her. Girl is a single mother in a townhouse who is separated from her husband. She wants her daughter to grow up with her father. Are Guy and Girl the perfect couple? In a romantic sense, no. It crossed their minds to get with each other, but their relationship is platonic and purely musical. She helps him with his music career (which includes getting a professional demo) and motivates him to get back with his girlfriend. Their intimate relationship does not need to be romantic.<br/><br/>Listen to each song. Pay attention to the lyrics and the heart that Guy and Girl are pouring into them. The songs reflect their lives in such fascinating scenes. The simplicity of a guitar and a piano can go long ways.<br/><br/>See this passion project and download all of the songs.

Love, for him, does not always mean grand gestures or even two individuals with the fairytale ending. He realizes that, often, love is in the small things.

It was obviously filmed on a very low budget, in that cold Irish weather. I like how The Guy and The Girl are struggling musicians. But I can't help compare Once to The Commitments. The latter was spirited, smart and sarcastic, and about 5 times better than Once. Once is very earnest and serious - where is that famous Irish humour? Its music is nowhere near as good as The Commitments, and its script and plot is rather dull. To me, there is no sense of tension or passion. I didn't find the songs tuneful and I didn't like the lead guy's voice when he was shouting. It is far more focused on the songs than the story or romance, so it seems more like a band documentary than a romantic film. It's a musos' film.

There had to be an interesting story there. But until a few days ago I had no idea they made this movie. They even won an academy award for it!<br/><br/>What a gem. It's a love story that discards the usual Hollywood payoff. On first viewing I wondered what was the point? The movie was drenched in music and the boy doesn't get the girl at the end. Is this a romance or a music video?<br/><br/>It turns out it's both and each holds up the other quite well. The ""guy"" is a Dublin street musician who churns out one song after another lamenting a busted relationship and yearning to get past it. The ""girl"" is something of a mystery. A Czech immigrant and mother of a toddler who has fled to Ireland to escape a difficult marriage and a family tragedy.<br/><br/>In the course of the movie both shed a bit of light into each others world. She sees quite clearly at the beginning that his music will win his old flame back. And he refuses to believe that, feeling fiercely that she's the answer to his pain. In turn his furious creative outlet gives her an opportunity to do what motherhood and circumstance have made difficult - creative expression through music.<br/><br/>In the space of what seems like a week or two they make music together in a music store, a cramped bedroom, dinner halls and a recording studio and over that time come to terms with the knotty relationships in their lives. The movie ends on a very satisfying note - not necessarily for the audience but certainly for the characters. The ""guy"" finally gathers the strength to seriously pursue a music career, patch things up with his old girlfriend and move beyond old betrayals. The ""girl"" receives a gift from him in return and the confidence to move forward with her musical talent while juggling a reconciled marriage, motherhood and finding her place in a foreign country.<br/><br/>All good love stories are about chemistry between two people and this one is no different but the Hollywood stories we're used to almost all end with consummation. This film avoids that well-worn path in favor of something more satisfying I think - that of old difficulties resolved and the creation of art which speaks to that journey.<br/><br/>A triumph of incredibly low-budget independent film."

Do not have a perfect argument, we can find several gaps that are critical to the development of the film and therefore may feel empty, but still must be seen from the perspective of true friendship, art, where it fails. It's nice to see some cool scenes with opaque colors such as life and where the development of the scene depends on how you get to her but what it can offer to the future of history, an interesting work of this totally unknown director in my country."

","Once is a tender and charming romance that centers around two struggling musicians, played by Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová, who form an innocent friendship built on their mutual passion for music. The movie is written and directed by John Carney, and on a budget of only about $160,000 and a 17 day shooting schedule, the film was a major success grossing over $20 million worldwide. It's not hard to figure out why audiences fell in love with this film.<br/><br/>The basis of the film is simply this: the guy meets the girl. They meet each other one night after Hansard's character finishes performing an original song, and there is an instant chemistry between the two characters that we notice as something real and genuine. It seems even as if it could be Hansard's first time talking with someone other than his dad in a long time.<br/><br/>They are both working odd jobs to pursue their true calling, which is music. And the music they perform throughout the film is absolutely perfect. All of the songs are originally composed and performed by the two leads and that is for good reason. To describe how good the music in the film is, I will just say that there is not one song in the movie that I wouldn't want to listen to again.<br/><br/>John Carney does such a brilliant job of not over-directing. It would've been easy for him to try to do too much with such talented musicians, but he makes the right decision by letting Hansard and Irglová do most of the work. He realized how good they were together and let them steal the show. It is a smart film that knows what its purpose is and never strays off course.<br/><br/>Their performances, both by non-professional actors, really do complement each other perfectly. Hansard sings with such passion and intensity alongside Irglová's calm, laid-back demeanor that it seems like they were born to do this together. To watch them perform is complete magic. Arguably the best sequence of the film is the scene where they perform ""Falling Slowly"" together, and I would say that it is one of the best scenes I have ever seen in a musical.<br/><br/>There is not much more I can say about the film in this review other than you just have to see it. And if you have seen it, give it another viewing. In a running time of only about 80 minutes, this movie has so much to like and absolutely nothing to hate. I dare anyone to come out of this film not humming the music and not feeling better about themselves. It is a movie that simply makes you smile. It's tough to compare it to the bigger, darker films of 2007 such as No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, and Michael Clayton, but this is a film that is just as satisfying, if not more satisfying than all three I just mentioned. I'm probably beginning to sound like a broken record, so I'll just stop at this: Once is one of the best films of 2007"

","This movie captivated and impressed me in the greatest possible way. Why, you ask? Let me explain.<br/><br/>I have seen a lot of so-called ""romance"" movies and every time, especially with the movies that are coming out of Hollywood, I am completely underwhelmed: tidy, but generic plot lines, corny and ridiculous set-ups and obvious ""acting"" that, whether good or bad, seem artificial and ""put-on"".<br/><br/>What makes ""Once"" so endearing and appealing is the fact that the main leads seem so genuine and believable: their affection for each other is delivered so naturally and with such coy innocence that I was completely won over. It is as if though we are made privy to their lives in a moment in time in their lives, and we as an audience are emotionally enriched for it.<br/><br/>The main leads are obviously accomplished and talented musicians. To be sure, there are great songs on display in this movie. If you are not moved by some of the ""musical"" scenes in this movie, you are either pulse-dead or completely lack humanity. I hope to see these actors, hopefully together again, in the future.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","One of the best feel good movies ever made. Every couple in love and music fan should watch it. The story is life in its purity. The way the songs are ""introjected"" as part of the script gives the musical genre a new style of storytelling. The formula is perfect and adds beautifully becoming a truthful masterpiece. We see elements bumping into one another, from Neo-realism, Auteur cinema, cinema vérité, till the most commercial Hollywood romance-comedies (which doesn't do any harm here).<br/><br/>Everything lies perfectly in this bed of charming fluids and senses, and the final result must be compared to one of the best wines ever made or tasted.<br/><br/>Some references for previous works: John Carney's On the Edge, with Stephen Rea and Cillian Murphy (not to be compared, but OK to watch); Glen Hansard plays guitar in The Commitments, Alan Parker's entertaining musical comedy.<br/><br/>Much said, the song ""Gold"" played on the restaurant scene gives the film a fine treatment defining Marketa's performance, for I believe no one would trade her sweet self for anything."

","I'd heard about this film, passed the marquee daily to and from work and had wanted to see it in the theater but for whatever reason I didn't. Boy, am I kicking myself now! What a great film this is. And how much greater would it have been in the theater! The Dogma-style film-making, whether intended or not, was a wonderful surprise. I loved feeling like I wasn't really supposed to be there, that I was witnessing something so private and pure. I am a fan of Richard Linklater's Sunrise/Sunset as well as Julie Delphy's (obviously Linklater inspired) 2 Days in Paris and, of course, Lars Von Trier. But there was something so pure in Once that separates it from the others. Maybe it was because even though their relationship was complicated it played out so smoothly and without force. They loved one another enough to realize that no matter their pasts or their individual futures they had that week and even a tangible memory of it. Both actors were honestly believable. Highly recommended to anyone who loves a good story, good music and isn't afraid to let their emotions go."

","I watched this at a friend's house last night and we were all amazed with the film. The music is very poignant and uplifting, in a moody, melancholy way. It is the kind of film that, if you are an aging musician, will remind you of your best days hanging out with strangers, creating great spontaneous music and meeting interesting people while you wander and travel. My friends who are not musicians said it made them appreciate music more as an extension of a persons character. Also, I will second what someone else said here that it has a great non-Hollywood non-cliché ending as well. Kudos to all involved in the film for a job well done."

Great music, great, simple story and wonderful performances.<br/><br/>What makes this film even more extraordinary is that it stars musicians, not actors. But looking at the film, you would think Marketa Irglova and Glen Hansard had been acting for years. Such was the chemistry between the two in the film, they are now actually a couple.<br/><br/>Once is set in Dublin and tells the story of a busker who meets a young immigrant.

The soundtrack is incredibly soulful and the lyrics will blow you away with their laments of love lost. One of the songs that isn't on the soundtrack is the opening song where Glen is singing in the street for money and he sings the song ""And The Healing Has Begun"" (Written by Van Morrison). You can hear the desperation in his voice as he painfully sings out the lyrics as if he is begging for love's mercy. Does anyone know where I can get a recording of Glen's rendition? I will beg mercifully for it!!! The other songs not on the soundtrack include ""Song Without Words"" performed by Marketa Irglova, ""The Fair City Waltz"" written by Hugh Drumm & Adam Lynch and ""Whiskey In The Jar"" which is listed as a traditional arrangement.

But this is no Hollywood film in the first place, and any of the reservations I had for this movie were pushed away rather quickly. This movie isn't Hollywood at all; it is raw and very real, and heart wrenchingly beautiful.<br/><br/>However much the movie is about creating music (the music here is not for the majority, but I enjoyed it immensely), it's also very much about finding a soul mate. There's a certain magic and intensity about those aspects and they're done incredibly well.<br/><br/>Sometimes, I'm often put off by ""indie"" movies, as this one is. The pretentiousness, mainly.

","Local musician meets foreign working girl. Professionally they are a perfect match, both talented musicians who write songs. Personally, they are tied to another, so though smoldering love is in the air, no fire can be ignited. The backdrop to both musicians (unnamed guy and girl) is a strong family connection which resonates throughout. Odd to see a real love story without sex, but this is one (call it an unrequited love story). However, great music throughout the movie and it is the music which drives the scenes. Maybe love of music is the story. She is a smart bargainer, able to professionally manage the guy's budding music career. The studio scenes, with musicians I would assume from the band Frames, could have been longer and involved more songs. But the musicians are picked from the street, and the city streets are the real studio. Incredible emotion in every song. Was there no soundtrack?!?!"

","Describing what this movie is about is not enough to draw an average person to see it: after all it is basically about a guy and a girl who are brought together through the power of music, and a little help of the hoover vacuum. Naturally there is more to the story- and that something is the chemistry, honesty and the beauty of music which people have to see and feel for themselves. <br/><br/>'Once' is set in Ireland and revolves around a busker/artist (Glen Hansard) and a slightly eccentric girl (Markéta Irglová) who while passing by is drawn by his heart-felt voice and song. The guy and the girl clearly share a connection and a crush, but we learn that both have a history/ issues that prevents them from starting a romance- He is still in love with his ex gf who lives in London, while she is actually married and has a daughter. Still they continue their friendship and musical collaboration which results in his debut album. In a way, the movie is very realistic: Sometimes love is not enough- and most times love is just too complicated. Still, love can be beautiful when true emotion is felt. <br/><br/>To say that Once is an independent movie is an over-statement: budget must have been under $200,000 but its shooting style and ambiance honestly made the experience that much more real and personal. The music was heartfelt and really beautiful- the two main characters are both actual musicians who wrote and sang all of their songs in the movie and on the album. Another tidbit of information I learned after watching the movie was that the guy and the girl fell in love during the shooting and ended up dating afterwards! That just makes the movie all the more special and realistic: real heart-felt music and real romance, what can be better? (Free popcorn perhaps ;)"

","Seems some people want to call this movie over-hyped, but I don't believe so in a day of multi-million dollar advertising campaigns and big time,well paid movie stars. The reason why this movie has received such great reviews is the fact people can identify with the emotions shown here. When Guy sings you can see and hear and feel the emotions and feeling invested in the song. You can identify with his passion from past events in your life. The anger, the joy, the sorrow, the loneliness over a love lost is very identifiable for anyone that has been through it. The songs from this movie evoke strong feelings/emotions/memories in me. I also have to say I find it strikingly beautiful how the two main characters never get together. Yes this movie lacks a ""love scene"". It's more like a ""love act"" in the fact from the time the guy and girl meet you can feel this tension build and build until it's ready to burst, but it never does. I think many people can identify with this movie and its emotions and that's why I think it has been so ""hyped"" as you want to call it."
"bradtjennings","10","2","3","17 October 2007"," A complete original
","I was skeptical of a movie that was based on the repertoire of established musicians. That it seamlessly provided their wonderful music into an engaging fictional landscape is commendable. However, ""Once"" is not simply a film about music. It is an engaging film about the promise of a chance encounter, the recognition of talent, and the faith that talent can engender success. It also makes us care profoundly about the characters that inhabit it. Never before has a film incorporated music in the manner that ""Once"" has, and it resonates. That it was made on a $150 thousand budget is incomprehensible. That it has maintained a place in art house theaters for months since its release proves its power on its audiences. Hopefully, critics and awards voters will remember its importance at year's end."

","Wow. If I say that I am beating myself up for not getting tickets to the special screening with live performance and cast Q&A, followed up by hours of searching online for tickets to the next Frames gig, will that tell you what I think about this movie? <br/><br/>Documentary style love story between a young Irish busker, a ""Hoover-fixer, sucker guy"" and 19 year old Czech immigrant will leave you longing for the unrequited love in your life. He plays guitar and writes songs trying to earn a few extra Euros in his father's Hoover fixing shop. Playing people's favourite during the day he delivers an emotional performance at night performing the songs written with his lost love in mind. This attracts the sympathetic ear of a lonely Czech girl who works in Dublin trying to make a living for herself and her daughter, after her own marriage broke up. The story revolves around their respective search for healing of their broken hearts and when they pair up in a powerful and soulful duet for the recording of his demo CD we see them find hope and rekindle their prior relationships. The music is beautiful and the great performances from Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová are truly wonderful  the actors are actually the band members the story is about. Their acting and the movie format make it such a truthful experience that you cannot escape but feel the emotions the movie is dripping with. <br/><br/>A feast for music lovers, this award winning movie is a must see. It would not be a surprise if we hear about it again closer to the Oscars or Grammy awards. Not only that, but the band The Frames, should better stock up on their delicious, heart-warming musical jewels because they will have people knocking doors down to get a piece of them."

","We were lucky enough to see ""Once"" at a free screening, at Bristol's Watershed Media Centre. It was actually a bit like going to a premiere, because the stars Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová were there. It's actually hard to believe that neither of them is an actor - the interplay between them on-screen was a joy to watch. There's also a lot of very natural humour, so a good laugh is guaranteed.<br/><br/>After the film, they answered questions from the audience as well as from the Watershed's Programme Director, Mark Cosgrove. During this, it transpired that the director originally intended to cast a woman of around 35 for the 'female immigrant' part, but wasn't able to find anyone. So it was Glen Hansard who suggested Markéta Irglová, whom he had met a few years earlier.<br/><br/>They then performed some of the songs from the film, using Glen's rather well-used guitar and just a microphone each. Even playing as live and un-produced as you can get (no mixing desk or anything), they sounded as brilliant as they did in the film, Markéta's voice sounding especially haunting when she sang a solo.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a film I would been happy to pay to see."

","Describing this movie by using a genre is problematic, because if you use the phrase ""musical"" or ""music video"" there are a substantial number of people whose eyes will glaze over as they back away from you. But that is essentially what is being done here, in terms of technique: It takes the too-cramped promise of the self-contained ""story"" music video and unfolds it to a series of effortlessly connected segments that, on paper, would be called a ""musical."" The unfortunate baggage that accompanies both of those genres is why my favorite way to recommend this movie is ""See it! See it! SEE IT!!!!"" <br/><br/>""Once"" avoids both Hollywood and Broadway while managing to capture something elemental and deeply moving about the art of creating real music, the understandable dangers that can erode the dreams of creative people and the sacrifices that may be required to keep yourself on the path you believe is right."

She belongs at Woodstock, too, but she has to forgo the concert altogether as she's been booked on ""The Dick Cavett Show"".

","A lot of songwriters don't like to talk about their music. They prefer to play it. This movie understands and depicts that. Sometimes the camera work is a bit shaky (handheld) I guess to suggest a documentary quality.<br/><br/>The script understands that characters and the cast definitely does. The characters speak best through their music. The Guy could write and sing lyrics that make you feel as if the fate of the whole world weighed in the balance of how well he sang on each and every song, but sometimes can only say a simple, plain ""Cool"" in conversation. Then their are parts that musicians will get a laugh out of that others will miss entirely. I'm thinking of a particular ""uh, I can see that"" said by The Girl about the key of a particular song. Also, I liked how intently the characters watch each other when one performs a song for them for the first time. Sure, they hear the music but they also are interested in how it is played. <br/><br/>The supporting characters do their job with dexterity. The movie tells a story very well and believably.<br/><br/>Note: That acoustic guitar that The Guy plays is his in real-life. It's not some prop to show he's poor. The guitar is so beat up, but also tells you how indispensable it is to the musician. In a beat up guitar competition, Willie Nelson's guitar may have a challenger."

","Although I was just happy to go see a movie where no one dies I was expecting something wishy washy and contrived. I am even happier to say this is a gem of a movie and a great advert for Ireland. The two main characters are musicians from very different walks of life. Music brings them together and through it they give each other the strength to face their demons. The characters are very real and endearing and the dialog is equally so and very far removed from the contrived half-witted witticisms of the Hollywood variety. Just as surprisingly everyone they interact with is a person I would happily share a few beers with. The whole movie industry these days seems to be about hate and death.

The direction was sharp and tight. The cinematography was excellent. It is a great film except for one big problem the sound mix was horrible.<br/><br/>For a musical, it is unconscionable to have flat, high-tone sound. Marketa Irglova, the female lead, has an extremely thick Czech accent mixed with hints of Irish brogue. This makes a clear sound mix vital to understanding her important dialog. I have top notch hearing. If you have anything less, this may make listening to the film a very real problem. You may want to wait for the TV release so you can view it with closed captioning.<br/><br/>The music was excellent, and Glen Hansgard sounds incredibly like Cat Stevens. Close your eyes and listen.

","If you have struggled to become an artist, or even wonder what that kind of life is like, you will find some real meaning in ""Once."" The passion with which The Guy plays on the street from the outset is a tip-off that this is going to be a special film. Hollywood would have made a much different, glossier version of this film (and still may, since it has all the elements.) I loved the ragged edges of the story and the unresolved questions: will The Guy make it in London? Will The Girl's marriage work out? Will the band stay together and sell records? Will Paul McGuinness discover them and have them open for U2? <br/><br/>The setting is a grittier Dublin than seems to now exist, so that in itself is a treasure. (I still half-expected Bono to appear in some fashion but there is no trace of him.) My main quibble with the film is that the production values in parts are simply awful, especially during the long flashback scene where The Guy is thinking about The Girl That Got Away. It is more amateurish than it needs to be, especially since parts of the film look just fine. Still, this is a movie for film lovers and music lovers and anyone who wonders if there's a world beyond Pop Idol or American Idol."
"aram81","9","1","1","2 February 2020"," A little gem of a movie
","Once, an indie musical, made with a reported budget of only 150 thousand dollars, is an odd little film. It is a musical where people just do not spontaneously break out dancing and singing for no real reason. All of the musical scenes make scense here. It is a love story without any real romance. Even though the tension is there between the two protagonists, the only ""sexual"" scenes we get are a kiss on the cheek and an awkward moment in guy's apartment. The film centers around two young and talented musicians who love music but lack the confidence to pursue their dreams. It is their chance meeting that brings out the best in them. In a perfect world Guy and Girl, played brilliantly by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, would be soulmates and live happily ever after. But John Carnet is not interested in Hollywood love stories. Life is not that simple and neither is this film. Some people might not like the bittersweet ending. Speaking for myself, I think the ending made perfect sense. I do have to point out that even though I loved the film, it is not without some drawbacks. Not all of the musical scenes hit the mark. But the scene where Girl comes out of the store in her pajamas, with walkman in hand and singing through the night, was simply magical. This little gem of a movie proves that you do not need big budgets and big name stars to make a good movie. And Once, is a really good one."

"tavdaniels","9","1","1","25 January 2016"," A unique love story about something much deeper than romance alone
","From the rough and uncut opening image and the song being sung, it was clear this was a different kind of movie. So many love stories are about tired and overused clichés that focus on the most superficial forms of human relationships. This is light years from that.<br/><br/>It's about two lonely souls connecting at a level that is far too rarely seen in films these days. Add to that a soundtrack that is full of passion and skill (not to mention an authentic Irish vibe that feels both immediate and vibrant) and it creates an experience that is truly life-affirming and life-giving.<br/><br/>I've seen a few of the ""hater"" reviews and it's like they were watching a different movie than I did. Just don't get it. To each, his/her own, I guess."
"svenrufus","8","1","1","17 December 2015"," A wonderful quiet love story
","I've just watched this again yesterday after a few years since I first saw it, and then watched it again tonight because I was so completely captivated by it. This is exactly what happened when I first saw it too, and now I know I'll be listening to the soundtrack on hard rotation for a few days at least.<br/><br/>For me, this film doesn't put a foot wrong. It's perfectly paced, to match the pace of the developing love story. The music is mesmerising at times, heartbreaking at others. The acting is subtle, but spot on. The filming is beautiful, even with the jerky camera work, it matches the rough edges of the lives of the characters. All the things that I've seen people criticise this film for, I would argue are things that work perfectly for this film, this story, the love affair and the struggles.<br/><br/>There is something about this that puts me in mind of Brief Encounter - I don't hold it in such high esteem, but it is a wonderfully pitched story, that asks you to look deep into it to understand what the characters aren't saying, what they aren't doing, and to be able to reach an understanding of their choices while feeling the turmoil their own brief encounter puts them through.<br/><br/>Life rarely gives us the Hollywood plot line. The twists and turns of our daily encounters mean that choices aren't always clear cut, but are so often compromises. Guy and Girl here face those compromised outcomes - what might have been, have they got all they could or could have hoped for. All of this is clear when you look at them through the film, and the music supports that understanding, sometimes driving the point home like a knife. This is genuinely one of the most beautiful and gut wrenching films I have seen."

","On a street, one man sings favorite songs in the daytime, but at night he sings his original songs. At one night one girl gets interested in him. She can't afford to buy a piano even she is also a musician. It's because she came from Czech and brings up her child without her husband. They become friends and begin to compose songs together. He asks her to make their demo tapes. Gradually they falls in love. The camera work like home video and the sad melody match the atmosphere of Dublin. Audiences feel sad and painful from their songs. However when the film ends, we feel happy. It's wonderful and so beautiful film. I would like to listen to their songs in rainy or cloudy day."

","""Part of me / Has died / And won't return / And part of me / Wants to hide / The part that's burned"" – From ""Once"" song by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova.<br/><br/>This passage from the title song's lyrics finely describes all the things that would happen on the screen. And not only in the movie but often in our lives as well. You might know that feeling when something new is going to enter your life while doors to the past are still not closed. But let's not get ahead. To my surprise, it is hard to write review for a movie that I've seen many times. Despite the fact I lived through every detail several times, it is rather difficult to bring it all together.<br/><br/>Well, this is a story about middle-aged Irish busker and young Czech woman who meet each other accidentally on the streets of Dublin. We don't get characters' names, they're just a Guy and a Girl for a film viewer. The guy is repairing hoovers at his dad's workshop or busking on the street with an old guitar, while the girl is trying to earn some money by selling flowers on the street, or by cleaning apartments. Both have personal romantic problems and experiences behind them. They get know each other better through music. They share songs which represent their emotions. They're undoubtedly falling in love with each other, but this love finds a way out only through a music co-creation. In the end of the plot they say goodbye each other. The meeting of the Guy with the Girl pushes their lives in the right directions.<br/><br/>The movie is made on a tiny budget. It is filmed on hand-held unprofessional camera. Even actors are infamous and inexperienced people. But all these components make the movie more natural and breathing. Formally this is a musical film but it isn't musical in the stereotypical sense when some common story is told through songs and dances. Glen Hansard, who is acting the Guy, is a famous Irish singer-songwriter, front-man of the band, ""The Frames"". His sincere and touching music goes along with the story which seems very organic as both main characters are musicians. The soundtrack won a Grammy award and this fact speaks for itself. <br/><br/>The circumstance that the characters are unnamed and even that the movie is named ""Once"" tells us that this story is not unique. Our lives and the lives of others are full of such a bittersweet love stories. The warmth and the honesty with which ""Once"" is told, makes this film so heartwarming and loved by many. The Guy, ""broken-hearted hoover fixer sucker guy"", is a romantic dreamer feeling alone. The Girl is in a difficult life situation. That is to say, both main characters seem they've gone astray in their lives. Paradoxically, their unspoken love gives them a strength to find themselves and gain confidence to make important decisions. I like that this love story goes without intrigues and vulgarity. Marketa's character says that it would only result in ""hanky-panky"", which is a bad idea. The characters are mature enough and they don't rush to extremes.<br/><br/>It's a love story which has nothing in common with Hollywood's sugary production. As for me, it is just a beautiful, simple and sincere movie with the fantastical soundtrack that certainly leaves a viewer with bright and deep emotions. I would recommend it to everyone who loves music and who still has ability to feel."
"eliastukonen","9","1","1","19 September 2014"," Heart touching musical
","Once is a heart touching and heart breaking Irish musical. It tells about a relatively poor guy who's making money by singing and playing guitar on the streets, and occasionally fixing hoovers.<br/><br/>WARNING SOME SPOILERS MIGHT BE INCLUDED <br/><br/>""The guy"" is very talented singer-songwriter and draws attention from a Czech ""girl"". They start to hang out and spend time together... Well you know the drill. They also share the passionate interest for music, and in the movie they play beautiful songs together a lot. <br/><br/>This movie was not an original musical, but music is still the biggest part of the movie. I would recommend this movie for everyone who loves musicals and music. It is also a beautiful story about ones who started from nothing.<br/><br/>I will most definitely give this a 9 out of 10."

","Now that that's said time to talk about the actual movie.<br/><br/>Sure, some songs were nice but the actual story wasn't that nice in my mind, some people may call me a madman but that's just the way I see it.<br/><br/>----SPOILERS AHEAD----<br/><br/>They don't get together, and at least I tough it would end up like so but No. The lady has a man in Czech republic and he's coming over to Dublin, anyways the man was also going to meet he's ex girlfriend over to London, he actually asked the lady to come with him to London, But I don't get it why would you take someone who is so close to you, almost got together and then take her to your ex? Makes no sense !<br/><br/>So! How did it start? -The guy, Glenn is a street artist who plays guitar for money, one late night a mysterious lady comes and walks next to Glenn, stands there and listens for the song, after the song she gives him a 10cent, so Glenn asks. -A penny? -""Yeah it was really nice"" I can't remember anymore of the words but the lady, Marketa asks why won't Glenn play these songs in the day?, He answers that people want to listen some songs that are familiar, or that's how I got it. So then they have a friendly talk about their lives and make a band together ! Yayyy.<br/><br/>This was Mipezzu."
"cleary-joshua","8","1","1","4 June 2014"," This has great songs, beautiful romance, and is just a really great film overall...
","When a movie has a minuscule budget, often sacrifices have to be made which can change the overall look or feel of the film. Things like special lighting and special effects are kept to a minimum, while locations are very simplistic. And often, this can be an extremely positive thing for a film, adding to its charm because of its simplistic nature. This is precisely one of the things which make ""Once"" such a charming and wonderful movie – the constant realism which flows throughout the film. It's got great songs, beautiful romance and is just a really great film overall.<br/><br/>When the 'Guy' (Glen Hansard) is out busking one day, he meets and gets talking to the 'Girl' (Markéta Irglová), a Czech flower seller. There is clear chemistry between the two, and they meet again the next day and play music together. The nature of their relationship is always kept at a distance, since the Girl is married but her husband lives in the Czech Republic, and the Guy wants to get back together with his ex-girlfriend in London. Therefore, the two, along with a band of buskers, record a demo album so that the Guy can show it to the ex-girlfriend when he meets her. The ending is both incredibly daring and very satisfying, not falling back on classic Hollywood romance clichés.<br/><br/>However, plot in ""Once"" is not as important as the songs which feature throughout, a mixture of ballads and folk songs. ""Falling Slowly"", the film's main song which ended up winning an Academy Award, is a beautiful song, and its context within the movie is both simple and beautiful. The songs are all played naturally in the film, with one exception in ""If You Want Me"", a heartbreaking love song which the Girl sings with headphones in while walking down the street, and with the singing voice of the Guy played in the background. It's a bit more like a music video in that scene, but it's well shot and a brief moment of suspending the audience's disbelief.<br/><br/>The two leads are not professional actors, and neither are the majority of the supporting cast, but this merely adds to the naturalism which the film exudes. Director John Carney shoots it in a very natural way too, saving up any fancy camera-work until the very end. The film is brief, with a running time of only 86 minutes, but it fills that whole time with interest and never feels slow. Ultimately, ""Once"" is a beautiful and heartbreaking love story, with songs that you won't be able to get out of your head for weeks afterwards."

I felt impressed. the emotions of the two just wow, just the fear of falling in love again, because you are afraid of losing it again, while its obvious the two are meant for each other, how they get connected to each other and how they build a relationship, how they secretly fall in love but both are afraid, because they already lost too much. also the song ""falling slowly"" which s the song they first play when they meet each other, right there I felt the emotion, but when they played it during the ending, the lyrics just grew into the two of them, and the songs tells a whole other story. just beautiful and sad.<br/><br/>this is how a musical/movie should be made, deeply touched<br/><br/>10/10"

","One of my all time favourite movies. Didn't like it at first. Must of been because I watched it late at night with the volume very low. Then the next day I found myself unintentionally humming a few of the songs. Watched it again on the surround sound with the sound turned up. Have watched it a few times since. Great movie. Didn't like the first scene very much cause of the cursing, so probably not suitable for children because of this.

","I really enjoyed watching this film. I think this film is a peaceful piece of work. All of songs which played in this film are fantastic. Actually, I wasn't impressed this story. However, I really impressed these songs from the bottom of my heart. These songs are beyond my expectations. After watching this film, I can't get these songs out of my head. These lyrics are wonderful, appeal very strong feeling and express heartrending sorrow about love. Not only songs but also singers' voices are so nice. They have painfully sad singing voice but they also have strong and attractive voice. This story is not full of happiness, it always has something feel sad. However, after watching this film, I feel warm-heart feeling. I really recommend you watch this film from the bottom of my heart. I wonder why this film is not popular in Japan.

","Grafton St, Dublin, Ireland. A few years ago you could find Glen Hansard playing there his consumed guitar, playing covers during the day and risking his own lyrics at night. Once, Marketa Irglova stopped by amazed by his music. Glen came to Dublin to help his father out with his hoover business, after being left by his girlfriend. She came with her mother to Dublin from Czech Republic after being left with .her daughter by her husband. As he played the guitar and she the piano, they immediately got along very well. Among good and more awkward moments, they develop quite a duo. Suddenly, Glen decides to go to London in search for his ex-girlfriend, while Marketa's husband was coming shortly back to her and their daughter. Glen had the idea to record some of their works after leaving Dublin. And that's exactly what he does and what a success did he turn out to be. The worst is definitely the end. This movie was asking for a total different ending. And I don't just mean an Hollywood ending, but something more, especially after discovering the meaning of Miluji tě. Glen is great, obviously I'm not talking about his acting, that because of his musical quality is driven to second layout. His music is really good, very close to Justin Vernon from the Canadian band Bon Iver, in his Irish way. The most incredible feature of the movie is how John Carney managed to film it with only 130 thousand euros! (Avatar costed 237 millions). Anyway, it's a great way to fall in love with Dublin. Since the very first second where Grove Street is shown before Glen chases a tramp into a park whose benches I remember to sit in a couple hours after heading to the UEFA Europa League final in May the 18th. Memorable and recommended! I ended up not knowing what was true about the movie and what was not, but Once is perhaps one of the best music related movies I've ever seen. 8/10"

"RResende","Null","1","1","17 June 2011"," not touching
","Several interesting comments on this film have already remarked many of the good things you can get from this film. Something to do with the mood of the suggested love story, the power of its simplicity, indeed of the simplicity of the whole production, from acting to sets. The story moves you, because you can relate to it and there are not sophisticated apparent devices nor worn out conventions that these guys use to get to us. So this is ultimately a direct honest film. It's not real, and while in Linklater's similar experiments one might wonder whether the film is sprinkling out of real life, here the musical insertions don't allow you to think so. But this is incredibly direct and honest storytelling, and that's rare and rewarding.<br/><br/>There are a few things worth noticing beyond that. One has to do with the love relation we see on screen. We know it to be implicit, and never assumed all the way. Different languages. The closest we get to an effective conventional date relation is when the girl assumes her love in Czech, a language the boy doesn't understand, and which the filmmakers assume the majority of the spectators won't either. That's the sublimation of the story, more than any musical number, it's that moment. On the other end of the stick, we have the boy's attempt at a one night stand. The good thing is how the two different personalities, cultural differences, and postures, are mirrored in their musical backgrounds, and how that merges on screen. The love is in the music, is in what they come up with, how they work around their artistic differences towards a common end. This is truly a beautiful concept. That's why it was so important that the facts of the story didn't stop you to appreciate the beauty of the underlying concept. So powerful that these actors (who actually created the songs!) became lovers off screen, in real life. This is a very good case of an on screen relation: it hasn't happened yet, we see it coming, we are witnesses to it.<br/><br/>Dublin is a witness as well, it's a great place to film, one where suitably music is an important wheel in its spiritual routine. The sense of place is strong and well achieved here, despite relatively average production values. <br/><br/>The best films, indeed the best art is that connected to powerful ideas, the kind that runs underneath your skin. This is such a film, if the music was truly powerful instead of merely engaging, this might have proved an explosive experience.<br/><br/>My opinion: 4/5<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
"Philippe277","8","1","1","15 May 2011"," Wonderfully Peaceful
","This is a movie that just seems like.......real life. The music is very folksy and down to earth, and so is the story. And then learning that the actors are the actual band members almost makes this documentary-like.<br/><br/>Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova make for a very nice couple of friends, and they have the on-screen chemistry together to make you think there just might be something more..... Any typical film would have had these two pairing up by the end and making out somewhere in the middle, but Once really is one of those films that comes around once in a long while in how realistic it is. At the end, Glen doesn't even get a chance to bid farewell to her, and ends up buying her a dream gift -- the piano she'd played all the time in that music shop. The two remain friends by unspoken rule. How great is it that the male lead doesn't get the girl in the end?! What a breath of fresh air this is.....this plot and all the wonderful scenery we're also treated to.<br/><br/>This must be the only Irish movie I can ever remember having seen.

The pretentiousness and naivety of western consumer culture is lovingly juxtaposed with the love story of the struggling musician and immigrant girl trying to make their living in a big city like Dublin. Themes like ""friends are the new family"" are lovingly portrayed with house parties where everyone drinks foster beers and the deep struggle of these modern day heroes to stay in touch with their true selves as human beings and nature is again nicely contrasted by trying to make it in the coolest business of all: The music business. The main character even uses one of those laptop machines to write his songs (of course he also uses traditional pen and paper) and he's awe inspired when he enters the music studio with the big mixing console that has produced so many stars and such amazing music.

Watching the trailer, you'd think you'd be in for a nice romance (I don't care much for romantic pieces, except when they're low-key and honest a la ""Before Sunrise/Sunset""). The trailer felt like magic. And truth be told, the film does start out very nicely. I loved the first song they played together in the music shop. There was chemistry, and I thought this was well on it's way toward greatness. But to my dismay, it fell apart. Why? Well, going back to that trailer (and even the film's poster) - you're set up to think these two are going to really hit it off. But the fact of the matter is that after the guy learns she has a kid, things slid downhill fast. For one thing, he is way more in to her than vice versa. She's still married, and she wants to see if things can still work out with her separated husband. One wants to slap the ""Guy"" across the face and say, hey mate - you're wasting your time! Not only that, but there's one song that plays to completion where the ""Girl"" walks around the neighborhood block at night in one seemingly uninterrupted take - it went on too long. After awhile, I felt like this film was more about the love of music and performing than a love story between the two. That bothered me. I must say this though: there are some very good songs; that's the film's strength. Again, the ""Guy"" began to get pathetic. The loving feelings weren't mutual it seemed, and that was disappointing not to mention a tad dull. At the end he gets her a piano?!? Please. Ugh, I felt cheated."

It's cloying, fuzzy, vapid crap for middle-aged hippies who sit around in their sweaters smoking weed and drinking red wine. The music was also awful and quite repetitive. Want to watch a good movie with the same themes -- try ""Almost Famous"". Maybe the reason it works -- the lead characters are teenagers. It might have worked had that been done here. Seriously, what's with middle-aged guys who wear scarves who sing about how bad their life is and are still trying to become famous? The music was too much. It was like Coldplay but worse (I'm not kidding).

"fwomp","8","3","6","8 February 2008"," A Sucky Hoover Vacuum Repairman Follows His Musical Dreams
","With multiple film festival award wins (and a recent Oscar nod) and produced on a shoestring budget (in just 17 days), ONCE is an independent movie marvel. But this isn't what should draw you to it. The draw should be its quirky humor, its incredible music (nearly 2/3 of the film is entirely music), and its intimate portrayal of two people making music while forming a strong bond of friendship.<br/><br/>The main actor and actress aren't even given names; there's no reason to as this Guy (played by guitarist extraordinaire Glen Hansard) and Girl (pianist Marketa Irglova) could be anyone off the street. Anyone with an incredible gift for music, that is. Both Guy and Girl work differing jobs than their hearts desire, Guy as a Hoover vacuum cleaner repairman and Girl as a house cleaner. But both have aspirations toward music, Guy more than Girl ...initially. Guy, on his off-time from the Hoover shop, panhandles on a street corner, belting out known songs during the day and his own at night (when no one's around). Girl discovers him and asks him why he doesn't play his own music during the day, and thus starts a series of events that speed this short film to a satisfying conclusion. I say ""speed"" in the sense of how short and sweet the film is, not because it is an action or speedy-type film in any way, shape, or form. In fact, if you were going to ding the film for anything, it would be its pacing. Sometimes achingly slow, the story nearly stalls at several points, but thankfully never falters completely.<br/><br/>The music is what makes Once what it is, and rightfully so. This is a story about musical wishes and dreams, and how those dreams should never be let go of no matter what the circumstances. Sometimes it takes a wallop upside the head to get you back to your dreams, and Girl is exactly the smack Guy needed in order to accomplish his. Her enjoyment of his songs and her persistent requests to hear more and more from him drive Guy to higher and higher levels. Although much of Guys' songs are based around a former relationship gone sour, it is Girl that opens his eyes to the fact that he still loves his girlfriend and his music ...and this awakening is all thanks to a platonic relationship with a stunningly pretty Czech (Girl).<br/><br/>Although Girl gives Guy what he needs, he too gives her something in return. Both come to understand how important their friendship is and what it will eventually mean to them, even should their dreams fail. Chasing after them no matter what the cost becomes all too evident as the film winds to a close.<br/><br/>You can't comment on Once without noting its camera work, too. It is very amateurish, almost as if someone were filming an episode of Wayne's World (in Wayne's basement). But it is the amateurish nature that binds the audience to the characters. You feel like you are the camera, peeking at these peoples' intimate lives from behind this corner or through that window.<br/><br/>And the music; it's impressive in the extreme, so much so it got nominated for Best Achievement in Music via the Oscars this year (2008), something of a shock for such a low budget film (much smaller than any previous nominee). Glen Hansard has ""the voice"" and his co-actress, Marketa Iglova, is no slouch either. Both are musical talents that can make you laugh one minute and nearly bring you to tears the next. And since over 60% of the film is music, that's a very good thing. In fact, for Once, it's the only thing."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","3","6","30 January 2008"," Charming and honest ""Once"" is a soundtrack with a movie instead of the other way around
","""Once"" touts itself as a ""contemporary musical,"" but that term doesn't quite do it justice. It is a film that is centered around and supported by its music all at the same time. The songs don't help tell the story so much as enhance it much like a soundtrack would. In that sense, ""Once"" is more like a brilliant pop/acoustic soundtrack with a story mixed in.<br/><br/>The film is about a guy who lives with his dad who when he's not helping his dad fix vacuums, is out on the street playing music and at night he plays his own songs. When a girl stops by and listens their different lives become uncontrollably intermingled by their love of music, which they begin to create together.<br/><br/>Perhaps the truly great thing about the film is that it doesn't give in to the romance story that the viewers mind is undoubtedly wrapped around. Their relationship and attraction is central to the story, yet creator John Carney finds a way to make it enjoyable while not indulging in the simple pleasures of Hollywood romance cliché. It makes the film very honest, respectable and perhaps praiseworthy while retaining a lot of charm.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it though, the film is about the music and it is truly beautiful music for anyone that has an appreciation for acoustic pop. It does have a mildly indie sound, but it's definitely capable of being mainstream. The songs aren't only good, but they make the movie interesting - you can see the inner-monologue and the emotions when the footage is simply just of the two of them playing. What's even better is when Carney keeps the audio of the song rolling and continues the film visually. It creates some seamless transitions and shows just how much the music really acts as an appropriate soundtrack too - something that brings out the undertones in the story.<br/><br/>""Once"" is a triumph of independent film and a unique venture into experimental genre. It does leave a little left to be desired and dances around some potentially dramatic moments, but we're not talking about a major studio picture, so considering the limitations I'm awfully impressed."
"D_Burke","10","3","6","28 January 2008"," One of my Favorite Films Released in 2007
","You can say a lot about 2007 not being a great year. On the political side, the economy crumbled a bit, oil prices skyrocketed, New Orleans is still in a wreck, and the Democrats in office were unable to make progress because of President Bush's stubborn ways. With all this chaos in today's world, one turns to entertainment. However, scripted TV shows halted due to the writer's strike, and the music industry in spite of sagging CD sales had not been churning out particularly good new music. Fortunately, after a creative slump, movies are the one medium that are bouncing back. ""Once"" is no exception.<br/><br/>I went to see this film on a whim earlier last year when it was playing at an nearby independent theater. It had gotten a pretty good review from Peter Travers of Rolling Stone Magazine, so I admittedly went in with expectation that the movie would be good.<br/><br/>Fortunately, it was good, but in a different way than I could have imagined. I didn't expect a musical of sorts, and I got an unconventional one filled with original and awe-inspiring songs. It sounds very hackneyed when I write this, but the music was truly moving, especially the song ""Falling Slowly"" which has fortunately been recently nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song.<br/><br/>The storyline was also intriguing, and the dialogue was pretty good considering most of it was improvised. The ending, which I won't give away, was just the right touch for this film, and the replay of the song ""Falling Slowly"" could not have fit better into the end sequence.<br/><br/>It's a fault of the MPAA that this film was rated R. It really shouldn't have been. There was absolutely no violence, no nudity, and most importantly, a heart-warming story that people of all ages should be exposed to. If anything, the film should have been rated PG-13. It's just another example of the MPAA's flawed and inefficient rating system. Don't let the few F-word's in this movie fool you. If you have kids, and they want to see this movie, let them! Period."
"mrtimlarabee","10","3","6","28 January 2008"," Like a musical Before Sunrise
","The Hollywood musical machine is back in full form with colorful designs, elaborate sets, and big name stars here to take Broadway to the big screen. Yet as combination of jukebox musicals and movies turned musicals turned movies yet again barrage the big screen, it's a simple little tale called ""Once"" that takes an entirely different approach.<br/><br/>""Once"" is probably more minimalist than the Hollywood musical format. It has an interesting approach, in that the music in the film are mostly performance pieces. Yet they forward the story along more than most of the current crop of musicals.<br/><br/>The story is quite simple. A Czech immigrant and poor Irishman meet and realize they share a fondness of music and start writing music together. Like any partnership, we see how their music progresses as well as their personal relationship.<br/><br/>But this isn't some cheap love story or rags to riches story. Rather, the characters share their stories, their desires, and their feelings in the ever so brief but affective spoken dialogue, and flesh them out in their songs. It doesn't have any sugar coated artificial sentiment either. There's a sincerity that flows in the characters throughout the film.<br/><br/>The characters in this film seem very real. Perhaps its their struggling nature and that they aren't larger than life characters. One of my favorite scenes in the movie summarizes both the normalcy of the characters and their sincere passion towards art. There is a scene where the girl is listening to music and trying to think of words to write for it and is so caught up in it that she gets frustrated when the batteries run out on the CD player and scrambles trying to find them. It's a simple yet beautiful scene that captures the spirit of the film.<br/><br/>What makes the film such a fantastic feel good film is the friendship between the two main characters and the special bond they have. The chance encounter and how they accomplish much in such a little time reminded me very much of Before Sunrise. I have a feeling if that were a musical, it might look something like Once, an excellent, simple feel good musical."
"marissas75","8","3","6","15 January 2008"," Lost souls in Dublin
","Descriptions of ""Once"" as a modern-day musical are all well and good, but to give a better sense of its mood and style, a comparison to ""Lost in Translation"" seems to fit. Both movies depict a wistful friendship-slash-romance between a rumpled, sad-eyed guy and a dewy younger girl. In ""Lost in Translation,"" Bob and Charlotte's connection grew stronger when they sang karaoke together--""Once"" takes this idea and runs with it, focusing entirely on how music unites the two nameless protagonists. A busking Irish guitarist (Glen Hansard) and a Czech pianist (Marketa Irglova) meet by accident, discover their shared love of music, and quickly become songwriting/recording partners.<br/><br/>The best scene in the movie is definitely their first song together, ""Falling Slowly."" Irglova gaining confidence and starting to harmonize with Hansard, and director John Carney finally giving us a close-up of their two faces singing, are both beautiful moments. Wisely, this same song closes the movie--and though the characters are now at a very different place, the lyrics take on new resonance. The other musical highlight is a long tracking shot of Irglova walking along a street late at night, wearing pajamas, singing some lyrics she has just written. Other songs are more generic ""singer-songwriter"" stuff, even though the lyrics match the characters' emotions and the music sounds like what they would write.<br/><br/>Rock musician Hansard's falsetto voice and twisted-up facial expressions when singing convey his character's sensitive side (he just broke up with his girlfriend). Irglova was just 17 when filming this movie, but she is an old soul (rather like Johansson in ""Lost in Translation""). Her character is strong and forthright so much of the time, yet afraid to confront her own feelings.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I prefer ""Lost in Translation"" because the incidents it depicted were more varied and amusing; ""Once""'s total focus on the music means that if you don't like the songs, you're out of luck. Also, scenes like the rather contrived meet-cute don't stand up to scrutiny. Still, both movies are fine examples of how sometimes our most memorable, life-changing relationships happen by accident and last only a short time--and certainly don't conform to Hollywood norms. As it should, the ending of ""Once"" has the right bittersweet effect."
"Buddy-51","9","3","6","13 January 2008"," a uniquely beautiful film
","""Once"" is a story about a man and a woman who conduct a courtship almost entirely through song. Music being the primary medium in which these two individuals move through life, it is only appropriate that they should express their love for one another through music as well.<br/><br/>Glen Hansard plays a struggling songwriter/musician whose recent, emotionally devastating breakup with the girl of his dreams now serves as the inspiration for most of his lyrics. Marketa Irglova is a young woman who recently emigrated from the Czech Republic with her mother and daughter to begin a new life in Ireland. She, too, is a composer of music, though she is less assertive and confident about exposing it to others than he is. The two meet on the street one night while he is performing one of his original compositions and they begin a slow, tentative relationship based largely on their mutual love of music.<br/><br/>""Once"" is a beautiful, lyrical and heartbreaking film that has understandably garnered a passionate cult following since its release in early 2007. It is an utterly unique and spellbinding work in which the music is every bit as important as the dialogue. The plot, though basic and uncluttered, still manages to throw a few curveballs our way in an acknowledgment that romantic relationships do not always work out in the way we'd like. Filmmaker John Carney keeps it as simple and intimate in his directorial style as he does in his writing, utilizing an unobtrusive and relatively steady hand-held camera that nicely matches the rhythms and beats of the music playing in the background (and often in the foreground). The scene in which the camera, in a single unbroken shot, moves ahead of Irglova as she strolls along the streets of the city singing an original composition is one of the truly transcendent movie moments of 2007. And the music itself is lovely, flavorful and memorable - reason alone, I'd say, for seeing the film.<br/><br/>In addition to their obvious talents as singers and musicians, Hansard and Irglova give performances of such poignancy and subtle emotion that they draw us instantly into the hearts of their characters.<br/><br/>If ""Once"" reminds us of any film, it is probably the French classic, ""A Man and a Woman,"" another work whose tale of romantic love was intimately woven through music (although, in that film, the characters themselves were not singing or composing works). That's not a bad template for a romantic movie, when you get right down to it.<br/><br/>Since ""Once"" is a film that it is much better to experience than it is to read about, I suggest you try it on for yourself. You won't regret it."
"Superunknovvn","8","3","6","6 January 2008"," Musical without being a Musical, moving without being overly dramatic - in other words: fantastic!
","I really didn't know what to expect when I started watching ""Once"". All that I had heard was that this was supposedly one of the best movies of the year. It starts out with a busker singing in the streets. A guy with a thick Irish accent appears and I thought, wow, I'm going to be lost. Thankfully, the main characters were speaking more comprehensibly as the movie progressed. The singing part remained, though. To my surprise that didn't bother me at all, but the songs actually turned out to be so beautiful and interwoven with the movie so naturally that they became the heart and soul of ""Once"".<br/><br/>Leading actors Glen Hansard (frontman of The Frames) and Markéta Irglová not only played their roles to perfection, they also wrote and performed the soundtrack, which should win them all sorts of prizes and get them worldwide recognition. Their performances are really quite an achievement.<br/><br/>The story itself is unagitated and realistic up until the very end, which is what makes it so moving. ""Once"" isn't a fairy tale, but a snap shot of a romance that breaks through all sorts of bleak circumstances and sheds some light on the hard lives of these lovely people. It's a movie that genuinely deserves to be called ""romantic"" unlike so much nonsense that's listed under ""Romance"" on IMDb. This one is the real deal. Get the handkerchiefs out and be sure to watch this with the one you love. It might be too sad otherwise."
"Polaris_DiB","2","9","27","10 January 2008"," Good music and a story makes a concept album, not a movie. Imagery makes a movie.
","This movie has been getting a lot of attention, and has even made quite a few best-of lists. In a way, it's perfectly understandable: this movie is about music, it has good music, and mostly importantly, the good music it has is about the emotional ambiance of the characters, something that can be totally felt from the music. As an inspirational art-piece, it allows the creative desire for music and the expressiveness of music to wash through the viewer.<br/><br/>However, I'm a film critic. I admit that sometimes that means that I have quips with a movie that possibly don't deserve it. Sometimes I worry about craft and function where it doesn't matter, where the point is only to tell the story or relate a certain sensibility, which is what I gather this movie is trying to do. But let's face it, as a movie, this movie sucks. The music is wonderful, and with a few bits of the dialog thrown in it would make an interesting narrative concept album. At any rate, it's quite the audio experience. It's visual aspect, however, goes beyond ""leaving a lot to ask for"". Its cinematic-ness, the visual storytelling of it, is completely inept.<br/><br/>Here's the thing: it's a cheap production with hand-held cameras, but that's not why it's bad: it's bad because the production never rises above its limitations. Almost 60% of this film seems to be the camera-person just trying to find a place to set the camera so that the image doesn't just sit static or eventually become boring. You know, a good cut could possibly help, but unfortunately the filmmakers are much more interested in long takes, long takes that basically involve shifting perspective for no real reason but that they suddenly realize ""oh, oops, this is a movie, better get a different angle."" Forget actually setting up a scene or telling a story visually--this movie lays its emphasis so much on the music and dialog that almost all of it doesn't have to be watched at all, only listened to.<br/><br/>And that is what I consider to be inappropriate. A movie about music can rely on its music to make most of its statements--that's fine. A movie that relies on its music to make most of its statements, however, cannot forget that the audience is watching. We need something to look at, something to engage with. I'm not talking fast cuts or unique editing or anything particularly special. I'm talking about something that doesn't involve the cameraman walking the camera from one side of a piano to another. I'm talking about needing some level of craft or design that helps bring the audience into the music instead of making them steadily stop watching the movie and just listening to the music solely. I'm talking figuring out how to express, in imagery, the same feelings the music is supposed to be expressing.<br/><br/>This film doesn't do that, and thus this film fails as a film. The drama and performance is there, but not captured. The beauty and emotion is told, not shown. That is why this is not a very good movie.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

In every movie with even a great soundtrack of music, the music is always secondary to the plot and story - not so here, as we must listen to music that strives to be mediocre at best (or worst).<br/><br/>As if the music isn't unendurable enough, the story is incomprehensible.

","The Guy (Glen Hansard, lead singer of The Frames) is a street musician who lives with his father and sings on a mostly empty Grafton Street in Dublin after working his day job repairing vacuum cleaners. Outwardly cheerful, underneath he still pines for the girlfriend (Marcella Plunkett) who left him and moved to London and his plaintive songs speak about lost love and regret. His performance attracts a street punk who makes off with his collection but also beckons a young Czech immigrant known only as The Girl (Marketa Irglova) who works as a flower seller and they slowly develop a friendship that deepens when he discovers that she is also an accomplished musician.<br/><br/>John Carney's ""Once"" has charm written all over it and has received many accolades from critics who have called it ""simple and unpretentious"", ""a perfect film"" and ""enchanting"". Unfortunately, it did not win me over completely. To be fair, part of the problem may have been the shrill sound system in the old theater in which I saw the film. However, in a film that is presumably about the struggles of young musicians, the songs are so perfectly realized and so professionally performed that the entire premise felt very contrived.<br/><br/>Since he repairs Hoover vacuum cleaners, of course, she just happens to have one in need of repair which she drags down the street as an excuse to meet up again with the singer. When they take the bus to have it repaired, he sings to her that he is a ""broken-hearted Hoover fixer sucker guy"" and she learns a bit about his troubles in the past. In their budding relationship, she is the pursuer and he the pursued but when he asks her to stay the night, she backs off and we soon learn that she also has a back story. Recently separated from her husband who is in the Czech Republic, she lives with her mother and has a young daughter, clinging to the hope that her marriage can be revived.<br/><br/>The songs, mainly written by Irglova and Hansard and taken from Hansard's solo album ""The Swell Season"", are the centerpiece of the film and they are sung with passion. One of the nicest scenes in the film takes place at Walton's music store where they join together in a sweet song called ""Falling Slowly"", realizing for the first time that they could make beautiful music together. Astonishingly, they qualify for a bank loan to finance a studio recording of their music because the Credit Manager is a would-be singer and because rejection is not part of the script. With their newfound cash, they rent an expensive studio for the weekend, pick up some additional musicians who just happen to be playing on the same street and throw together a professionally accomplished CD.<br/><br/>It all goes very smoothly, no trial and error, ups and downs, or rejection slips. While the relationship does have its moments of charm, what could have been a story that had something new to say about the immigrant experience or the difficulties of the creative process ends up being little more than an extended music video (Carney calls it a ""video album""), almost a promo for the sincere but banal soundtrack. And with her barely discernible Czech accent and his thick Irish brogue, much of the film left me wishing for English subtitles.

Because the movie was so dependent upon the music and I found the music one long droning whine, it just didn't work for me. ""Falling Slowly"" is an AWFUL song (Oscar noted and notwithstanding) and it was the best of the bunch. The performances were fine within their limits, the story was sincerely written and the scenery was lovely. But I just didn't get it. I didn't see the duet in the music store as transporting. I didn't really see them ""falling in love."" I also found the dialog and plot hard to follow. I can only assume this is a musician thing -- a movie for professional and amateur singer-songwriters, wanna-be's and their fans. But I found both the film and the music downbeat and sad. I don't at all understand those commenting that it was an uplifting slice of heaven worth an A grade."
"thehotttrock","5","7","23","11 July 2007"," Most overrated by critics - Warning Spoilers
","I was really excited to see this film. It has already been making top lists of the year and no one seemed to have anything critical to say. I enjoy independent film and love foreign cinema, and I love romantic films. But I'm really getting tired of all the kudos this film is getting as I found it to be extremely disappointing.<br/><br/>The film is boring, first of all. I have no problems seeing slow films, especially if the cinematography is beautiful and interesting. However, this film had no storyline and the mise-en-scene was pretty non-existent. At times it felt like watching a music video, a really boring music video. Without a solid plot line, no character development, and coincidental situations, there was only one thing holding this movie together: the music.<br/><br/>I found the music to be just as redundant as the lack of dialogue. The same chorus lines are repeated, there's emotion for a lack of reason, and it sounded one step above any mainstream band or artist currently being played on the radio.<br/><br/>The one attribute I am especially tired of hearing about is the realism in the story. I found it to be extremely unreal. Everything seems to work out for the characters - she has a piano she can just play on for free, he jumps in with his music, they sound so great together, they get a loan to rent a studio, studio technician loves what they do, they manage to record their first song practically perfect, the characters fall in love despite him getting over a broken heart and her still being married to a horrible husband, and then it doesn't work out.<br/><br/>I'd like to know why? It seems like the love of his life stomped on his heart and her husband, who is in another country, doesn't appreciate her. After spending only one magical weekend recording their perfect demo, her husband suddenly comes back the next day. That seems as coincidental as them meeting on the street. And he decides to go to London, armed with his demo, to win back his ex-girlfriend. How is any of this realistic?! I am not unfeeling, I just have better taste in movies. I feel like many critics viewed this film at a festival and swooned over the energy that sometimes exists at these types of events. If someone wants to see an independent film, go see ""Paris, je t'aime."" It's more worth the money."
"piffkin","2","2","4","21 January 2018"," Disappointing
","I am unable to join - or indeed to understand - what seems to be the universal chorus of adulation for this film. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing the matter with the acting, or the cinematography - the problem is, the plot. There isn't one. It is about a busker who decides he wants to make a demo CD, he gets together a scratch band and they record it. That's it, really. Along the way he befriends a married Czech woman who is waiting for her husband to join her in Dublin, and who plays keyboards in his band. At the end, the busker goes off to London to rejoin his former girlfriend. That's it. End of. The only moment of drama in the whole film comes right at the beginning when a thief tries to take the busker's takings and there is a chase down the street. Aside from that, nothing really happens. Was the demo CD helpful in promoting a musical career for the busker? We never find out. Having made the whole film revolve around the busker's efforts to record this demo, once it was made the director then seems to have lost interest in what happened to it. I don't know if maybe the only point of the film was supposed to be to showcase the music? Well, you either liked that or you didn't. Personally I didn't care for it."

","The story is honest-to-God boring. It starts out interesting enough I suppose - Guy playing a guitar and singing and then someone 'tries to rob' him. The Guy goes back to singing again and this time a Girl appears to be staring at him and complimenting his music. The Girl tries to make the Guy famous and analyzises his reasons for writing songs. Both probably want to bone each other - or at least the Guy who lives with his father wants to bone the Girl. In the end, they separate and that's it.<br/><br/>The plot is not in the slightest original - I guess that's the point of it. A Boy meets the Girl and it all seems like they'd end up together, but instead they separate. That's why so many probably reviews this movie as good, because it's 'emotional' and 'normal'.<br/><br/>Considering how neither of the singers were in fact actors and that the budget was so small/they didn't really have good camera-work etc, it probably was a good achievement. Wouldn't know, never made a movie.<br/><br/>Half of the movie was singing, and the other half was just clips that somehow linked to together. I don't really mind the singing since it was okay imho, but for love's sake the story sucks.<br/><br/>The movie couldn't even hold my attention more than a few minutes at a time. It was truly - and utterly - boring. I don't recommend watching it."
"secondtake","7","2","4","14 November 2012"," Utterly sweet, very low budget, honest and also very limited.
","Once (2006)<br/><br/>This has the best of cinema and worst of cinema. It's heartfelt and honest with a leading pair of actors who are as pure as snow in a world that is a blur around them. And it's also a slow tale filled with songs that start to sound the same and that's filmed without either panache or grit.<br/><br/>I went into this intending to love it. An Irish busker in Dublin falls in love with an immigrant single mom, and these two people who really are suited for each other try to find a way to make it work. Or if not quite try, they see that they are living in a moment of magic together and want it to stick. This movie is about that magic. Brief, beautiful, idealistic, and filled with some really good singing and songwriting.<br/><br/>That's what people love about this movie and why it has such a good following (and rating, if you pay attention to the starts). Watch it on that basis.<br/><br/>If you are looking at the film at all as a work of art, as a piece of collaboration between writer, actor, photographer, director, and so on, you're bound to feel it coming up short and shorter. As much as you love the main guy's utter kindness--a profoundly great model of kindness--you notice that things drag a bit, and that a few clichés appear, like the moment on the beach, meant to be lyrical happiness and it reads as meaning to be more than really conveying. And that songs start to be similar, and are even repeated. <br/><br/>On some level this is a huge music video, because most (most!) of the movie is made of songs set to various situations, and new situations are brought in so that new songs (or old ones) can be performed. It's easy to love the music but also get enough of it.<br/><br/>Another way to weigh all this out is to compare to a movie I saw recently at a festival, an equally low budget affair about a singer-songwriter looking for love and meaning, ""I Am Not a Hipster."" Now that is a truly inspired affair: complex, beautifully envisioned, off the beaten track. None of those descriptions apply to ""Once.""<br/><br/>But then, ""Once"" has one of the best bittersweet endings I've seen. It's the last five minutes that will mean the most. And maybe seem familiar, those things that mean so much that you don't quite keep. Except in your heart forever."
"mark.waltz","8","2","4","1 November 2012"," The lovers are ""Falling Slowly""; This viewer is ""Falling Fast!""
","That goes for this and the new Tony Award Winning Broadway musical based upon this sweet movie about what relationships really are all about. This independent art-house film is a winner in every way, utilizing sentiment that is slightly bittersweet yet never sappy. A troubled songwriter gets help from an unexpected source in a very independent young woman, and their friendship develops into a love that does not involve sex, but loyalty, understanding and compassion that is never patronizing. Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová show more humanity in 85 minutes than most Hollywood stars show in their entire careers. They are both real, extremely likable people, and Irglová's character should be a candidate for sainthood. There is only a small amount of cursing; He makes an unwelcome pass that is more out of loneliness than a sexual need, and you get the feeling all he wanted was some cuddling, not fornication.<br/><br/>The Broadway musical goes deeper into the music than this does, but no matter how many times this movie repeats its Oscar Winning song, ""Falling Slowly"", I never get tired of hearing it. I saw the musical early last spring not knowing anything about the movie, only slightly recalling the song from the Academy Awards the year it won. I warned others asking me about it that they would need a package of Kleenex, and the same goes for this movie."

I loved the way the sound engineer went from thinking they were a waste of time, a bunch of oddballs, to recognizing that there was something special happening here.<br/><br/>It has been days since I saw it and I'm still thinking about it, I want to hear the songs again and add them to my music library.

","In 2007 a small, indie film from Ireland was able to dominate the critical world, and from a small budget made $20 Million worldwide. It was so successful in the critical world that it was in the top 10 best films of 2007 lists. It has a high rating of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes.<br/><br/>Once is a love story between ""Guy"" (Glen Hansard), a busker on the streets of Dublin, and ""Girl"" (Markéta Irglová), a flower seller from the Czech Republic. The two have an instead connection when ""Guy"" plays his own songs and ""Girl"" asks him about them. They make beautiful music together and ""Girl"" encourages ""Guy"" to make a professional demo and move to London to re-connect with his ex-girlfriend. The two are drawn closer when performing music, but both have complex pasts.<br/><br/>What must have made this film a success is it's quirky spirit, having a mix of drama and wit. It attempts to be the musical for people who do not like musicals. People do not just burst into song and the music has a folk/indie sound to it. The director John Carney keeps a low-key tone throughout. The pacing is slow and the feel is natural. The music comes out naturally and sounds like something good songwriters would write. Carney keeps characters down to a minimum, with the focus being on ""Guy"" and ""Girl"". He wanted to make it as a character pieces and the characters are fully drawn out. This is a down to earth film. Carney even makes Dublin a character in his film, showing that Dublin is a lovely historical city with a charming character to match many European cities. The song too are very memorable and people who like good singer-songwriters will enjoy them.<br/><br/>The acting from the main two actors is very good. They are believable and both offer a low-key, organic performances. This is even more impressive because there are not professional actors, and Carney does get a lot out of them. They are professional singers and their ability shines through.<br/><br/>Despites the positives involving the direction and the acting, the film itself was a hollow and felt like it was lacking a spark. They was not much of a drive in its story and made a film a little disengaging at times.<br/><br/>But overall a worthy film with a charming character, but not everyone will like it."
"ajs-10","8","2","4","20 March 2010"," A Bittersweet Romance with Some Really Great Songs...
","I remember this film winning the Oscar in 2008 for Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, Original Song. The song was called 'Falling Slowly' and I recall seeing a clip from the film of the song being played live on guitar and piano in a music shop. It didn't have a wide release here in the UK, but thanks to digital TV, I have finally got round to seeing it. I wasn't disappointed; it's a really good film with some truly great songs, so great in fact that I bought the soundtrack! Set in Dublin it tells the story of a busker and the immigrant Czech girl he meets.<br/><br/>One evening the Guy, the busker, is playing one of his own compositions when he meets the Girl, we never know their names. She says she's seen him before, but not playing his own songs. He says that during the day people won't pay to hear his own songs so he plays well known songs instead. The get talking and she meets him the following day when she takes him to a music store where she's allowed to play piano for an hour a day. She persuades him to play one of his songs, 'Falling Slowly', and she accompanies him on piano. The story goes on to tell how the relationship between the two is affected by events in the past. I really don't want to give too much away because it's so much better to watch when you don't know too much about it.<br/><br/>Tremendous musical performances from both Glen Hansard as the Guy and Markéta Irglová as the Girl, although I don't think speaking dialogue really came naturally to either of them. Honourable mentions go to Hugh Walsh as Timmy Drummer, Gerard Hendrick as Lead Guitarist, Alaistair Foley as Bassist, Geoff Minogue as Eamon, Bill Hodnett as Guy's Dad and Danuse Ktrestova as Girl's Mother.<br/><br/>Over all, a really engaging film with some really great music. If you love ballads, then I can guarantee you a most enjoyable watch. Most of the music is either played live or is integrated really well into the narrative. In fact this bittersweet tale is mostly told through the songs which are interspersed with short pieces of dialogue. If you're not a romantic or a lover of music, then this is probably not for you. However, it's definitely recommend for music lovers and romantics alike.<br/><br/>My score: 8.2/10"
"Boba_Fett1138","8","2","4","22 November 2009"," ""Once"" is very pure.
","""Once"" is simplicity at its very best. It's a movie made with limited resources and with a small cast & crew, consisting mostly out of inexperienced persons within the business.<br/><br/>It's perhaps a movie that sounds like a very amateur like movie but yet its a movie with some real class. It has a good and simple story, likable main characters and it's all being build up and handled nicely. It's story progresses steadily and often without the use of needlessly many words. The characters and the main plot line tell all of the story. The movie is great in its simplicity really.<br/><br/>It's foremost also really a movie about music and choosing between living the life you want to or living the life the simply have to. Both main characters sort of struggle with this and they have their dreams but also their obligations toward other people close to them. None of them thought about actually chasing their dreams and do what they like most until they happen to meet up on the street.<br/><br/>It's a movie that works through it's simplicity, music and likable characters. But fair is fair, it needs to be said, to me it seems ridicules that Markéta Irglová is being praised so much for her acting performance. Do people somehow confuse amateur and weak acting for a natural performance? It's crazy, I just couldn't get over the fact how horrible her acting was at times, even though she has been praised basically everywhere for it. It's fresh that the movie uses some non-actors in it but really there is a reason for them not being actors. Also simply no way that these people are going to cast in anything else really but somehow I think that they also wouldn't mind this though, since there are more into music really anyway.<br/><br/>Still it's of course amazing for a movie of this size to receive as much recognition and praise as it did. A true accomplishment I bet no one involved ever expected. But it's not hard to see why it has reached such popularity, fore ""Once"" is an unexpectedly well made and put together movie, that is good looking, benefits from its simplicity with its story, atmosphere and characters and has some nice music in it as well. it's a movie that with its themes should appeal to everybody and it's just hard not to like this movie really.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","There are many reasons for me not to like this film. I hate musicals, and while this is not a musical (in a strict sense), music plays a very important role in it. I do not care for Glen Hansard's singing voice; Markéta Irglová is OK, though. I have the impression that the whole movie was shot using a steadicam (many shoots made me feel like I was watching a documentary), and you can see that this is a really low-budget film.<br/><br/>After watching the first scene, I thought that I would probably not finish the movie, but the longer I watched it, the more I was drawn to the characters and the story. With the exception of continuous repetition of the ""F"" word, it is very innocent. Music is great (if you like this kind of music). Characters are very real (it's like you watch them living, not acting). Absolutely no clichés. I enjoyed subtleness of the movie and performances of other characters: the Girl's mom, the young guys who come to her flat to watch TV, the guy from the recording studio.<br/><br/>A few scenes almost made me cry: the one when Guy takes Girl for a bike ride and asks if she loves her husband (although, I do not speak Czech, I understood the answer), the other when Girl could't finish the song, and there were more. Very emotional. I'm surprised how much I care about the characters, even though I don't even know their names. After watching the movie for the first time, I replayed a few scenes (the one in which Girl sing ""If you want me (satisfy me)"" and the first performance in In the recording studio), something I normally do not do.<br/><br/>I suspect that this is not a movie for everyone. If you are more into special effects, typical Hollywood production, action movies, Star Wars, etc, I suspect you will not like it (and I may be wrong here), but if you like real stories, real people, good music, you may enjoy it."

","After reading all the articles, I'd totally agree with the greatness of the film, but I'd also like to encourage the audience to acknowledge the very essence of this film and its eternal meaning. I am quite a movie observer myself. I watch each and every movie that I do, with a great deal of attention and for any scope of lump. I have to admit that ""Once"" is one of kind movie. Unlike any other piece of motion picture which I have ever witnessed while I respire. It's a wonderful piece of craftsmanship on reel. I think though the music got the recognition it deserved, there are only a few who are acknowledging the acting performances given by our Guy and Girl especially against the fact that they took no formal training of any sort for their respective roles. I mean I have my own list of great movies, which I keep recommending to people around me ( Nd sometimes force them to see ) but Once had some superb acting performances which totally gel with the movie's theme. Since the movie was shot with handy-cams and essentially was depicting life in reality on the streets of Dublin, this is where the actors did their job to perfection. I mean a girl 17 years in age who never acted in her life, was playing a single mother, who doesn't have enough money to take hold of her difficult life. How often do we see such naturalism in the acting done nowadays. Even glen's part was good, he made it natural, and easy on the roll; this is where the movie was one of a kind, there's just not anything bad about it ?<br/><br/>I am sorry, but I never intended to write this much, but as I said, I love this movie so much, I have gone morbidly obsessed with it.

It's not that I think the songs were too shallow or that I was expecting something along the lines of musicals like Dreamgirls - I just felt like the story was going nowhere, and although I quite liked the ending, I didn't fall in love with the film. I think that in this case you have to love the music to love the film, and these just aren't the kind of songs I go for. Also, I like watching actors in films. I'm not saying that they should've cast Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt, just that maybe I would've liked it better if they had cast actors that could sing (like in Across the Universe) instead of musicians that try to act. I've seen far worse, and I can totally see why people like the two leads, but then they've just got different taste in what they value most in a film. As to the simplicity of the story, I agree that it's fitting and works most of the time, but that one scene at the bank seemed very out of place to me. Once really plays like a feature-length music video, so if you would like to watch these two musicians performing a few songs with a nice little story around that, go for it, I'm sure you'll have fun."

There's no big Hollywood productions - everything is more natural. This extends to the songs, also - they're not too synthetic or over-produced, and thus fit the realistic setting very well. And they're also terrific. They advance the narrative, express the character's thoughts, evoke emotions from the audience, and sound fantastic to boot.

The moments it captures seem so delicate, but they can't be or John Carney would never be able to make this film. And it's not really a musical as much as a movie deeply entwined in music. In a way music is its real topic. Music weaves a bond between first two people, and then a small group. And it's as if the music is completely guileless and unpretentious, like the people who are attracted to it, who like the people in 'Across the Universe' are really children of the Sixties though they're far too young to have been directly influenced by them. This is probably the most pleasurable movie I've ever seen, and I don't mind that I won't forget it anytime soon.

The entire film has an authentic, realistic feel to it. Markéta Irglová is a fine musician, and turns out to be an excellent actor as well. (This is her first film.) Carney picked bravely and well when he chose Irglová. She's attractive, but not in the supermodel style of Paulina Porizkova. Irglová looks like the character she portrays--someone who may be selling flowers on the street, but who is a talented and sensitive musician at heart."

","ONCE (2007) **** Irish filmmaker John Carney's lovely, documentary-like drama about a 'busker'  street musician  and a young Czech immigrant known only as ""guy"" and ""girl"" (Glen Hansard and Mrketa Irglova), forge an unlikely bond in sharing musical talents and appreciation, when the two new friends decide to record an audition tape, possibly changing their present for a brighter future. A unique love story, artist-on-the-cusp-of-something- big fable and a wonderful look at the human spirit with the underlying theme of the universal language of music. Humorous, heart breaking and human; also has one of the most heart- in-the-throat codas in recent film history: if you don't shed a tear then you my friend are not human. The sleeper of the year; one of the year's best. And my hope for a Best Original Song with the ethereal ""If You Want Me""."

","Loaded with so much interesting and original music, this film qualifies as a musical in a unique contemporary style. When Girl (played and sung by Markéta Irglová) strolls down a dimly lit street singing aloud to the music flowing into her earplugs, her song moves the plot along in ways new and sweet to 21st-century musical films. When Girl meets Guy (played by Glen Hansard), the no-name couple come together over his music in the streets of Dublin and discover each other's longings and disappointments. Eventually Girl, who happens to be an extraordinary piano player, helps Guy make a demo disc in the hope of landing a music contract. During the same short period in their complicated lives, more songs reveal the ways in which Guy and Girl are working through their past loves and their feelings for one another. What's even more impressive is that most of the songs in the film were written by Irglová and Hansard and ""Falling Slowly"" garnered the duo an Oscar for Best Original Song in 2007."

Romantically, there are impediments...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this more than I eventually did. The plot was sweet and had heaps of potential. However, there is actually very little in the way of plot development or substance in the movie. It is short - 80 minutes or so - and then a large portion of the movie is taken up by music. Not only does this leave not much left for drama, the songs halt any momentum in the plot.<br/><br/>In the end it felt like a short, padded with heaps of music.<br/><br/>The music, almost entirely written by the two lead actors - Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, is okay, generally. Some pretty good songs in there, some quite weak.<br/><br/>Good performances by Hansard and Irglova.

I think we can't call it a love story because the characters did not actually fall in love for each other but it's kind of evident that exists ""chemistry"" between them. At the beginning we expect a love story between them but in the end we figured out that they have other soulmates.

","He is, like in many indie feature before him, a struggling musician with enough street smarts to know and play what the crowd wants to hear during the day, and then sing his heart out at night when no one listens and his voice is at its most sincere. His well-worn guitar has a great big hole in it, but that does not make the music any less from the heart - any musician whom has played and treasured an instrument through many periods of their lives will find this sigh familiar. And he is guarded too, so when he is asked a pointed question about past loves, he answers through half-mocking tunes because he knows he cannot commit emotionally to a fully sincere explanation. He hides behind the only thing he knows and can rely on. <br/><br/>She too, has fallen into the same routine. She has her own emotional baggage, but it isn't quite as evident, because she doesn't just shoulder her own burdens, but also those of her non-English speaking mother and young daughter. She cannot afford the time to be busking her heart out, but puts aside an hour each day to quietly play at the local piano shop. But does all this mean they are destined together? Certainly Hollywood has told us before, and even the tagline misleading suggests this (no doubt a producers request - Glen Hansard did well to adamantly go against an eventual romantic ending). And the viewer too, has been conditioned to want this. When she replies to him with a cryptic declaration of love, there are no subtitles for the Czech language, because it is a way for her to say those words without actually committing to them. By the end of the film, they both know that although there is a feeling there, the time and circumstance is not right. If you look closely you see two people who are not emotionally healthy and stable to end up together. They want and are headed in different directions; he to further his music career, her to mend her family. <br/><br/>With a shoestring budget, skeleton crew and amateur actors John Carney has delivered something rare and magical. The style takes a bit getting used to; certainly the way that passers by don't even acknowledge the hand-held cameras is disconcerting at first, and the lack of lighting setup is a altogether less glamorous look than we are used to. And yes, there are some cheesy moments. The first harmony comes together so perfectly that it does betray the story a little (and yes although harmonising is not as difficult as it looks it is what the scene suggests of the pairing). Then there is that moment at the bank where the small loans manager inexplicably reveals that he too had a musical calling, but has kept it hidden away inside. And then the predictable turn of opinion from Eamon as he scoffs over the phone at these 'oddballs', puts his feet up, and the then ragtag band proceed to play a near perfect rendition of the first track. Oh, but the best films are able to overlook these issues. When Hansard first hits that high note on the ""time"" of Falling Slowly, I got chills on my arms, and that isn't something of a logical or rational reaction at all. I knew at once from experience that it would be the lead song of the movie and that more renditions would be coming, but then when it comes it hits like a train and wow, what a story these lyrics tell."

","Yesterday I watched a marvelous Irish film 'Once'. This movie won Oscar in 2007 for the best soundtrack. It's really merited price. I liked pleasant and melodic songs of this motion picture very much. But why am I talking about music firstly?<br/><br/>Actually, 'Once' is a musical. But this is not that typical one with lots of strange dances and sudden music compositions. All the tracks are the organic part of the story. And this story is about two musicians – not the professional ones, but very talented and sensitive – who meet each other at the right term of their lives. <br/><br/>You might think it's an average love story with the corny happy-end and all, but it isn't, as a matter of fact. The characters have their own life paths with some hardships and troubles. They impact on each other's fates positive way and split up after all. It's kind of sad, but very natural anyway. <br/><br/>This movie is cozy, warm and realistic. It's about the everyday life with little surprises and wonders, the good people that maybe haven't enough powers and confidence sometimes, and about events that happen just once."
"CharlottaG","8","0","0","15 February 2016"," It's just so... genuine
","So I really didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie. Like, is it a tacky musical? Can anything good come out of a budget that low? What's the reason behind all of this commotion? <br/><br/>And well, I got some pretty good answers. <br/><br/>First off; no, it's not a tacky musical. It's a beautiful movie about two hopeless musicians who fins each other and make some darn good music. Yes, there are quite a few songs in this movie, but they're more like ''a scene where they happen to sing a song'' and not so much ''this is a really weird dialogue that could've never happened in real life''. So if there's anyone with the same stupidity as me out there, it's a music film, not a musical. <br/><br/>Second up; yes, good things can come from a budget like this. It is, of course, at times obvious that they had a limited budget making this movie, but the latest techniques and tricks shouldn't be your reason to watch and enjoy this movie. As a matter of fact I think that the low budget helped this movie become what it is and to achieve those qualities that I so love about it; that it's genuine and down to earth. It just wouldn't have been the same with a lot of fancy extras and some fancy cameras. This way, they've had to focus on the main things that they want to communicate which I think is that life moves quickly you just gotta hop on, see where it takes you and be alright with the fact that you can't have it all. <br/><br/>Lastly; I now get the commotion. 'Once' is a beautiful movie tackling some big questions that we all have in life. It has an authenticity that comes both from the actors, environments and that low budget feel that sometimes sneaks up on you. <br/><br/>Great movie, do watch it."

","If you are the type of a person to watch movie to judge beautiful cinematography or look for masterful direction, don't look here. Thats not the only problem with the movie, editing is choppy, the camera setup is boring, blocking is very simple, and it is clear that the stars of the movie Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are not professional actors. So why does this film work so well? Perhaps it's because of the soundtrack recorded by the two stars. Their voices compliment each other perfectly in their tunes and it fits the story. The rough edginess of Hansard's voice blends with the soothing nature of Irglova's. However; if only the songs are what makes ""Once"" what it is, it would've not have gotten the accolades, awards, and nominations from variety of sources which made me be interested in the movie. So once again, why does this film work? Because of it's mistakes. Once is a romance, and usually movie industry does a poor job in conveying what romance really is. In movies love is too perfect, and beauty is above the truth. In here love is not beautiful, it's awkward, choppy, and unprofessional, that's why it works. The movie does not lose anything because of it's lacklustre qualities, in fact it gains something which many Hollywood movie can't even create, rawness. I heard that the director's next movie ""Begin Again"" with a similar premise but a bigger budget did not fare as well. While I haven't seen the movie yet (and would love to compare those movies) I assume that the bigger budget got rid of the rawness prominent in ""Once."" <br/><br/>As a film, it lacks a lot. If you show this to your film professor, they will undoubtedly discredit the movie. However; we should not focus on it's lack of cinema techniques and look at what the movie revealed to us. Truth."

","John Carney shows with Once that a great movie can be made with only three things: A good idea, a camera and the will of making it work. From scene one this movie touched me, 'cause it felt so real, unlikely most of big budgets movies. All the long shots, showing the real movement of the city. Terrific, there is no other words.<br/><br/>Despite being amazingly done, Once is not flawless. I felt that John Carney wasn't comfortable using the camera in the beginning, I felt like he couldn't find the right spot. The first duet shows it clearly. But he started loosing up, relaxing and he find himself a couple scenes later.<br/><br/>Talking about flaws in the movie, this is one of a few movies that feel completely organic, alive, a movie that flows. That said, the scene during the break of the recording session, when the protagonist go to the room with the piano, couldn't be more artificial. I wont lie, I was ashamed with that simple scene. The girl walks randomly through the studio and end in a dark room with a piano illuminated by a lamp. C'mon! There was many other better situations to create that particular scene, without losing the organic feeling.<br/><br/>As I said above, this movie feel so real and organic, mostly to someone in the ""amateur"" music, that one can see himself in some scenes. Like the rehearsal of the five members band in a little bedroom, or the big dinner party with all the parallel conversations and music jam. The montages, the walks, the talks, the characters. ALL SO REAL!<br/><br/>Casting non-professional or at least no high profile actors, made all the difference. When there is no spotlight in the actors, it is easier to fall for the story. I mean, if a actor that I like is on the movie, I'll wait for him to be on screen, I'll go for the detail in his performance, maybe even taking a side before the development of a discussion. That affects the viewer. But this movie doesn't have this problem!<br/><br/>The whole story is credible. Is not a fairy tale, or a cliché-novel, it is a story of two completely strangers who find themselves in the world and become friends. From scene one to the end credits, is a lovely story of someone you could know or even be.<br/><br/>I wont lie, I wanted the two to end together. But there was the ex's, to who everybody want to get back and try to make it work. That felt so real, like it had happened to me. Oh wait, it did! Anyway... Although, the movie wouldn't be that great movie with them together in the end. Buying her the piano wouldn't be such a big deal if they were together. It would be a big present, but not THAT BIG DEAL.<br/><br/>And the music. What can I say? I love Singer-Songwriter stuff, like Damien Rice and Laura Marling. I'll buy the soundtrack as soon as possible. And I need to learn the jam of the bus. ""F*CK HER, F*CK HER... F*CK HER, SHE'S GONE!"""

Yes, I saw the sound boom in the studio reflection and yes I saw the street kids following the camera but you know what I couldn't care less because I though I was 'watching something real'. The way they look at each other and listen to each others words and playing tells you this is something real. They are either the worlds greatest actors or we were watching something real? You decide for yourself. The problem with IMDb is it attracts comments from people who haver nothing to say and no doubt they'll try and throw that back at me but you know what I couldn't care less.

Perhaps if I had I wouldn't have gone for it which would have been a real shame.<br/><br/>I don't know whether it's because Hansard and Irglova are effectively playing themselves (and within their own musical comfort zone) but the grittiness alongside the musical chemistry (chemistry that all happens rather quickly!) makes the film.<br/><br/>I hesitate to use the word charming, as I'm sure it has been written in about 99% of all the critic and user reviews, but it really is a lovely little film that feels like it (and did) cost almost nothing to make.

","I have never seen a film so utterly forgettable, mind-numbingly bland and aggressively dreary as ""Once."" This independent Irish musical drama is a meandering, dull and drab affair filled with tedious characters and featuring a storyline that leaves no impression. ""Once"" is a plume of smoke of a film, it drifts in front of you before vanishing without leaving any trace. I can't say I hated ""Once"" as the movie didn't fill me with a single emotion (aside from weariness), but I have nothing nice to say about this mediocre grey speck of a picture!<br/><br/>The cast in ""Once"" do an okay job of playing some of the most uninspiring characters I've ever had the misfortune to encounter. Glen Hansard as the protagonist Guy is fine I guess, he screeches during the singing sequences and mumbles the word ""cool"" in every single dialogue scene, but as the script gives Hansard next to nothing interesting to do, I don't blame him for this dismal attempt of a character. Markéta Irglová suffers the same fate, whilst she is admittedly a much better singer than Hansard, her character is so unexciting and insipid that I can't gauge whether her performance was good or not.<br/><br/>The plot (or lack thereof) in ""Once"" is what killed this film in my eyes. I believe that any good film, whether it be a billion-dollar blockbuster or a low-budget indie hit, should tell an engaging story and take its audience on a journey. We watch characters grow, overcome obstacles and ultimately reach a satisfying conclusion that makes their entire arc worth watching.<br/><br/>However, ""Once"" clearly thinks that these tried and tested ideas are nonsense. This film instead takes us on a journey with no satisfying conclusion, with characters that we don't care about and arcs that don't make us feel anything. We watch the central musicians ramble and mope from one drab scene to another, but just when you think something will finally happen in this awful movie, it abruptly ends.<br/><br/>The story doesn't seem to have a clear end goal, is it about Guy becoming a professional singer or about him and Girl becoming a couple and caring for Girl's mother and daughter? Well apparently it's about neither as the movie shoots down both ideas in favour of wrapping-up both plot lines in the most brusque and curt ways imaginable.<br/><br/>Visually, ""Once"" is nothing to write home about. It seems to have cost about 10 euros to produce, giving it the unflattering look of both a bad student film, and a third-rate documentary about two average people that have hum-drum lives and aren't that noteworthy.<br/><br/>In summary, ""Once"" is the epitome of boredom. It's a film that got so lost up its own behind with its ""naturalistic"" aesthetic and ""realistic"" characters that it completely forgot to tell a compelling story! The characters are weakly written, the narrative is predictable enough that even a toddler could work out what was going to happen next and the unceremonious ending is so offhand that it makes you question why anyone would bother to make such an aimless and unambitious film."
"CountZero313","10","2","5","16 March 2009"," making music with the Irish, both traditional and new
","Breath-taking. Life affirming. Are there any superlatives left unwritten for this film? A Dublin busker comes across a Czech woman selling flowers and The Big Issue. She has a broken Hoover; his Dad knows how to fix such appliances. He writes his own songs; she has access to the pianos in a musical instrument shop. And a flair for making canny business deals. His heart has been broken, her dreams have been severely corrupted by life's realities. We never know their names. But more importantly we get to know their music.<br/><br/>Like Before Sunrise, this film takes two wanderers and anchors them for a short, magical time in each other, before setting them apart once more. Like Hedwig, it weaves a simple story around some great songs. But Once is a stand-alone film, an absorbing, moving tale, full of great music, interesting characters, and acutely observed moments. At one point the busker plays his demo tape to his Dad as a prelude to leaving home. Dad loves the music, and practically shoves him out the door. His heart is breaking with love and pride, but it is all left unsaid. The girl makes one declaration in Czech that says it all (you'll look it up - everyone does). That the busker has no idea what she said is symbolic of what makes this film so delicious.<br/><br/>If there is a God, all films will be like this from now on."
"jpschapira","8","2","5","31 March 2008"," ""Take this sinking boat and point it home...""
","""At first they are flirting, and by the end they're f***ing like animals"", says writer/director John Carney of the scene in ""Once"" where the guy (Glen Hansard) and the girl (Marketa Irglova) sing ""Falling Slowly"" for the first time. It's a beautiful song, understated like the whole movie; and it's not only a beautiful scene, but also one of the most truly moving cinematographic scenes I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I know the feeling; I've sung with people I didn't know whether they could do it well and been amazed beyond words; I've fallen in love playing music. It's not the romantic relationship kind of love; it's something from a completely different universe. Anyone who says ""Once"" is a bad film has to be either a music hater ora music hater.<br/><br/>Once in a lifetime you'll watch a movie like ""Once"", because from now if you experience something similar it's going to come from here. Carney and his team, the emotional photography of the digital camera and the austere use of light; Hansard, his earnest voice and uncompromising songs; Irglova, her unique smile and the mystique that surround her; they might have created a completely new film genre I wouldn't dare to give a name to.<br/><br/>I regret some unnecessary moments where Carney takes the viewer for granted by showing characters smiling when they listen to the music this guy and this girl play. We don't need to see the typical shot of the 'approving face'; we like it and we approve it and that should be enough.<br/><br/>You want to laugh? You will, watching five musicians getting into a studio and not knowing what to do. You want to rejoice? You can close you eyes and listen to the music that, even when it shares some similarities with my beloved Damien Rice, comes from a parallel world that (I'm starting to think) only exists in Ireland. You might cry too, but that's depending on how sensitive you are.<br/><br/>One last thing: this is not a romantic comedy and it doesn't even come close to one. But if it were, I would hand an immense compliment to the story because it is, yes, very romantic and unlike anything you've seen. Free of clichés, formulas and (predictable or not) convenient endings. Don't lie to yourselves, because you know those are the main characteristics of a rom-com and you wouldn't like them if they were any different.<br/><br/>""I don't know you but I want you even more for that""  from ""Falling Slowly"""

","At Gitmo, one of the things the interrogators do to 'break' prisoners is to subject them to prolonged exposure to songs from TV's Sesame Street. It turns out that even when it's designed to be benign or even therapeutic, being forced to listen to certain music truly is torture. Also at Gitmo, if a 'detainee' tries to end his suffering by means of starvation, the U.S. military will force feed him so as to prevent this. By the time I had sat through 'Once,' it seemed like I could vividly imagine just what those experiences must be like. <br/><br/>'Once' is a force-feeding of folk music.<br/><br/>The musical performances in 'Once' are characterized by an affected earnestness and a self-styled soulfulness. They are self-conscious without being self-aware: in other words, a pre-ironic mindset. Watching them made me uncomfortable in the way that one is uncomfortable when a naïve, sensitive, and bad poet insists upon reading you his work and asking for feedback. <br/><br/>This film is photographed with a blurry, hand held camera, and to say that the script is minimalist is an understatement. It is possible to momentarily forget that this film is fiction, that someone scripted this. In my opinion, this is a deliberate cheat, a gimmick to conceal the thinness, corniness, and improbability of the plot. <br/><br/>This is 'The Blair Witch Project,' but with music.<br/><br/>There is a sense of arrested development with Glen Hansard's character, a self-pitying 36-year-old still living at his father's house. It's creepy to know that when this movie was made, Marketa Irglova was just 17. The pair are reported to 'dating' nowadays, and it is reasonable to suspect that the relationship was probably not 'platonic' when they were composing and performing together prior to filming. <br/><br/>In short, this film feels like the fantasy of a college sophomore, neglecting his classes in hopes that music will be his ticket out. If you have ever wondered what it would be like to have a street musician move in with you, I strongly recommend this movie. It makes 85 minutes seem like a month."

Lets swear and cut to yet another song, that sounds very much like the last one. The editing was bad, the pace was flat, but like I said, you need more story to work with. There's no climax at all. So, the film is about songwriting and musicians? OK, lets compare this film with...""The Commitments."" ""Hard Days Night."" ""Shine."" ""Amadeus."" Or even the more trite ""You Light Up my Life"". It pales in comparison. I guess you can film in Ireland, say 'foock' a lot and get a high rating on this site. (See quotes page). Oscar for best original song...sure. I'm OK with that.

","This highly successful, low budget Irish film has struck a chord across the world and the reasons why remain a complete mystery. Yes, it's nice. Yes, it's vaguely heart-warming. However, there are far better films out there and this film provides little insight into love or the human condition and commits one of the worst crimes of all  it's dull.<br/><br/>Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova produce two adept performances, whilst their songs are of a high quality and the film itself clearly has its heart in the right place. But it just doesn't work. The pace is glacial, with much of the romantic suspense being done away with in the opening half-hour. In the end it feels like an extended music video and is hardly cinematic.<br/><br/>Pleasant as far as it goes, but there really are better things to do with your time and far greater films that deal with the subject of unrequited love."

The photography is distractingly bad, the sound (for a so-called musical) is mushy and lacks dynamic range, and the performances are somnolent. If you want an ""Irish musical"" with fire and characters about whom you can care, rent ""The Commitments"".<br/><br/>I don't know John Carney or Glen Hansard or any of the back-story to their relationship, and it shouldn't matter -- the film stands or falls on its own merits and in my opinion, it falls, with a whimper, not a bang. The characters don't grow or change, or come to mean any more to each other than they do to us.<br/><br/>Faint praise: I hope the image of a girl wandering the streets dragging her Hoover about by its hose was intended sexual humor."

Even though this was a low-budget film, the cast and crew clearly worked so hard to make this film such an inspiring story. It is so down to earth and deals with some of the most moving themes. The story is so simple, but you get taken on this crazy roller coaster ride of emotions.<br/><br/>The songs are also some of the best songs I've ever heard.

"SquigglyCrunch","5","1","2","3 May 2017"," Fantastic Music and Weak Acting
","Once follows two people: a busker/songwriter and a young woman with a broken vacuum cleaner. <br/><br/>As expected of John Carney, the music is great. And similar to his latest film, Sing Street, he is very aware of that and spends at least a solid 1/3 of this movie in song. Most of the music is heard all the way through, and thankfully the music is good so it makes it just that much easier to sit through. While I didn't like the music as much as Sing Street and I think that it did get redundant after a while, thus reducing its rewatchability, it was still good and it's a soundtrack that I plan on revisiting. <br/><br/>As for the writing and directing, both were kind of off and on. While the hand-held camera use was suited to making the movie somewhat more lifelike (like a documentary), it could be somewhat nauseating and difficult to keep up with. The directing also seemed like a cop-out for the often faulty writing that proved to be rather unconvincing and awkward at times. But at the same time the music is well-written and some of the dialogue is really good too. <br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie, however, was Markéta Irglová. Her acting ranged from fine to just plain stale. There were so many points where I audibly remarked on how bad her acting was, despite being completely alone on my couch. The rest of the acting is mostly fine, but she was just so wooden. Her lines were delivered with no emotion or tone or anything whatsoever most of the time. It was as if she was just reading her lines off a nearby sheet of paper. Her best acting seemed to come from when she forgot her lines and stumbled over them, which at the least added some naturalism to them. <br/><br/>Overall Once is good, but it's ultimately weighed down by inconsistent writing and directing and some poor acting. Sure the music is great, but as a movie it's okay. It's like John Carney didn't know how to get his music out into the world without performing it, so he made a movie about it and didn't hold back. In the end I would really only recommend the movie to select people, specifically ones who would like the musical aspect."

","An Irish busker (Glen Handsard) has had his heart broken. The lady in question moved to London and now he sings on the street corner, belting out songs of love gone wrong. Its not his only job, as he works part time repairing ""hoovers"" at his dad's Dublin shop, which is also their abode. One day, on a Dublin street, a beautiful young lady stops and is so captivated by his performance. She gives him ten cents, which he laughs about, but the truth is, she is not wealthy. A Czech immigrant, this girl (Marketa Inglova) sells flowers on the street while her mother takes care of her young daughter. Yet, she also plays the piano and sings, which is why she is enchanted by the busker. Soon, when she learns he fixes vacuum cleaners, she brings her's to his shop and, later, the two stop in at a musical instruments store, where the owner knows her. Together, these two begin to make beautiful music together. But, there are problems. When the guy makes a pass at her, she tells him about her estranged husband, back in the Czech Republic, and her daughter. Meanwhile, the guy tells her about his former flame. Continuing to see each other and, finally, making a recording as a duo, is a platonic relationship really all there is to be? This lovely, very melodious movie is a gem. You may want to see it more than once! Hansard is already an established Irish singer, whose soulful ballads are a modern update of Irish folksongs. Inglova, too, is very talented and, together, they are dynamite. No matter that neither one is an actor, their work here is touching and true. Then, too, the scenes around Dublin are most beautiful while the photography is great as well. A good deal of the tunes are played while either the guy or the gal is walking, shopping, or otherwise engaged, making it different from other traditional musicals. Costumes, script and direction are all wonderful as well. So, here's the advice. Get Once at once!"

It didn't have a nice little ""happy ever after"" ending, and I think that that must have really confused the people who trashed this film. And while I really hate people who throw around expressions like: ""Anyone who didn't like this movie really didn't 'get it'"", I feel that in this instance, it's justified. <br/><br/>This was an extremely well done, low budget movie. Obviously, it relied heavily on the music, and if you don't like the music, you're not going to like the movie. But to say that this movie had nothing meaningful to say is really missing the whole point.<br/><br/>Hansard and Irglova achieved some of the greatest musical harmonies I've ever heard, while creating a naturalness that is rarely if ever seen in so-called ""blockbuster"" type movies. I for one absolutely appreciated that naturalness. And if there were an unevenness to the film, I believe it's because LIFE is uneven. Relationships are uneven. Emotions are uneven. And I fell that this film reflected that type of unevenness perfectly. That's not to say that the film was perfect -- it had its flaws.

"MuchTooDutch","9","1","2","19 August 2008"," A Wonderful First
","By Bryce VanKooten<br/><br/>It isn't very often you can see breathtaking film making joined with realistic reality. Often times, one leaves a comedy with little more than a laugh. Exits a musical with nothing more than a tune. And frequently realizes that what they just saw can in no way, transcend their life. Let me tell you; today, its happened Once.<br/><br/>If I were to tell you that I am an above average moviegoer, you would label me an elitist. If I were to qualify that statement for the next hundred words, you would call me a blow hard. Here I stand: I am an above average moviegoer. I say that not to separate myself from the gawking masses, but instead to identify my pessimism regarding Musicals. Like Hitchcock watches student films, so too do I watch Musicals. With an opera singer for a sister and more music packed in 23 years than calories in a frappuccino, I don't bring joy to Musicals; I bring expectations. After sitting through a half hour of Once, all expectations had left my ears, all judgments laid rest until the credits appeared and I relished in my moment: sweet reality, lived one string at a time.<br/><br/>Once is a simple film. Simple in the eyes of the Director and simple in the eyes of most watching, including myself. Its initial simplistic attitude can been seen in the leading character's names. While creating the film, Anton (Glen Hansard) was referred to as 'Guy' while his counterpart (Marketa Irglova; never given a name in the movie) is referred to as 'Girl'. From the very beginning, with names that any of us could take, we enter into a story that any of us could have. A simple story of deep pain, profound healing and true friendship, joined by the sweet melodies of an Irish tune. Guy and Girl meet one night on the streets of Ireland, both poor, both hurt, both keenly drawn to each other to form a friendship that blossoms. Very seldom do we get to see great films depict friendship for what it truly is. No scene speaks to this more fervently than in the piano store (a scene that goes down as one of my favorite cinematic moments in a long, long time). After just meeting, Girl tells Guy that she plays the piano and after some convincing, they briskly make their way to the store in hopes of catching a moment of silence that would allow them to play. Only a few seconds later we find ourselves Falling Slowly (as the song so eloquently sings) as the music joins the ensemble and remains beautifully in the leading role.<br/><br/>I don't know you, but I want you all the more for that. Words fall through me and always fool me, and I can't react. And games that never amount to more than they're meant, will play themselves out.<br/><br/>Take this sinking boat and point it home We've still got time. Raise your hopeful voice you have a choice You've made it now.<br/><br/>We stay with Guy and Girl through the rest of the film, rarely meeting any new faces outside of brief family moments and a quick ride to the ocean. The music guides us at a wonderful pace, along the journey of two very different people joined together by one beautiful sound. Once, a movie that dared to use kindness as motivation and music as consummation, showed two people, not in love with each other, but committed to one another. How truer of love? Worn thin by the pressures of life, yet confidently upbeat about the journey to come, it showed us that love is best displayed in our desire to truly care for another. In our conscious ability to lay our agendas aside and do what's best for someone else. Some may call this story too simple, others, too musical. I chose to recede to the depths of my couch, eyes closed to the music, relishing in both its breathtaking lyrics and simple harmonies, and call it wonderful"
"camandem-1","10","1","2","21 May 2008"," The best film I have seen this decade
","I had wanted to see this film for weeks since I first saw it in the local video store and finally had a chance to watch it. It is a very simple film that breaks almost every Hollywood convention. It is shot on DV cameras and the editing is simple, some shots are longer than five minutes in length, but what makes this film incredible is the passion and emotion that drives the story. A guy meets a girl and they make some songs, some really great songs, and eventually record them. It is a simple enough premise but Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova bring an enormous amount of power to the film - not with their acting ability (neither of them have ever acted before) but with their musicianship. This is a film that anybody with a dream should see. It will inspire, uplift and encourage, and it is quite simply the best film I have seen in the last ten years. I have watched it over and over and I don't want to return it to the video store because it is too good to let go of."
"laurajwillows","10","1","2","20 May 2008"," Once - my new favourite film
","I think I just watched my favourite film, ever. <br/><br/>ONCE tells the story of a talented singer/songwriter, and his journey to releasing his creative potential. The character is played by Glen Hansard of The Frames who are, incidentally, one of my favourite bands ever. He fixes vacuum cleaners by day, and busks on the streets of Dublin in his spare time; fending off local drunks who try to steal his takings, and only singing the songs he has written when he is sure no-one is listening.<br/><br/>He is spotted by a young Czech girl (Marketa Irglova) who stands alone one evening applauding his song, and proceeds to fire off a long list of pertinent questions about who he wrote it for, is she dead? and if she's not dead why he is no longer with her. He is initially taken aback by her direct line of questioning, but she is not deterred. Delighted to discover that her new friend fixes vacuum cleaners for a living, she returns the next day to the same spot with her broken hoover in tow; cue me falling in love with the film.<br/><br/>One of the most moving scenes takes place in her local music shop, home to ""the perfect piano."" They sit together - broken hoover abandoned behind them - and run through the chords of a song he has written. He asks tentatively if she can accompany him, and after a nervous slightly shaky start, the song Falling Slowly takes on a life of its own. <br/><br/>I watched this bit three times.<br/><br/>Falling Slowly scooped an Oscar this year for Best Original Song. As she was about to make her acceptance speech to Hollywood, Marketa Irglova was abruptly cut off by the orchestra, but returned to the stage moments later with a poignant speech applauding those who dare to dream; cue me falling in love with the film for a second time.<br/><br/>ONCE was made in three weeks, with two digital cameras. It isn't slick or polished, but quite simply, brilliant."

The simple story is enhanced by the lack of character names, and allows us to connect with the person rather than the character they are playing. The two leads are fantastic and deserve huge amounts of praise for their efforts.<br/><br/>The music is amazing - the soundtrack fits the film perfectly. A well deserved Oscar!

"stlwrkr4889","10","1","2","16 March 2008"," A film to watch over and over
","Once, is a brilliantly written musical/movie. Set in Dublin, it is the perfect backdrop for the central, working-class hero characters of the story:""Guy""(Glenn Hansard) and ""Girl""(Marketa Irglova). Once follows the characters from their initial meeting, through their whirlwind week together. Both struggling in their personal, as well as their musical lives, Irglova pulls off her inherent optimism of something better being out there, and it seems to rub off on the older, and more cynical Hansard. From the first time they hear each other play their music, a bond begins to slowly form, and the more they collaborate, the easier it is for them to tell their stories through their music. Unlike most of the bed-hopping two minutes after they meet material that has become the norm in modern film, Once uses a solid story line and the believability of its two main characters to make a story that, outside of a few curses, remains pure and enjoyable. Even the most cynical of sorts will be rooting for ""Guy"" and ""Girl"" to live out their dreams, and maybe even fall for each other. If you like good, folk-minded music, with some catchy beats, and excellent story telling, Once is film for you to see."

","I found this film charming, both characters were well developed and to me likable, the dialogs between them you could relate to, and the actors do a great job for actors with little experience. However,i found myself very invested in the characters that towards the end i was disappointed it wasn't more conclusive where the guy's music career went, and the future of the characters. But the main reason for not giving this film a 10 is that the performance of the songs drags on a bit and sometimes played a few times unnecessarily, although the music was quite good it's a shame the time wasn't spent more on the character's lives. Other than that well worth watching. 9 stars."

","This film proves that you do not need a multi million dollar production, to tell a story about love, in a real sense, full of passion joy and heartbreak. ONCE speaks in truths. Truths do not need fancy settings and camera work. They need inspiration and honesty. For ""ONCE"" a film has given us that. Along with incredible music and performances. This film is hardly all about the hype. In fact I had never heard of it until the other night when the Academy Awards were on. I was in another room and the beautiful performance of ""Falling Slowing"" was rolling through my television and I was drawn to my television set to see who was making that incredible music.<br/><br/>I feel for those who dislike this film. Their hearts have grown cold."
"vovazhd","8","1","2","28 February 2008"," A musical I actually enjoyed
","I'm not particularly fond of musicals. In fact, I think its safe to say I hate musicals. Once proves that there are always exceptions. It is an Irish film about two struggling musicians that cross paths. They find a common interest in music, which allows them to help each other out with their personal difficulties. I could have easily imagined this film going a little too far and losing its meaning, but it shows incredible composure and consistency in its themes.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent from both significant and minor roles. The two main characters are acted by real-life musicians Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. They are simply known as ""Guy"" and ""Girl"" rather than having actual names, which I think was a great decision. You can feel a relationship form between them, but at the same time that relationship is a practical impossibility. Their performances are extremely believable.<br/><br/>The key part of any musical is a good music selection. Once certainly satisfies in this category; ""Falling Slowly"" deserves its Oscar and most of the other songs are nearly as beautiful. The film avoided cheesy or silly editing for the music segments, which I felt made it multitudes easier to watch than most other musicals.<br/><br/>Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Once. I came in skeptical, but at some point (not exactly sure when) it won me over. I must add that the ending sequence is flawless, especially the last camera pan. I genuinely cared for the characters. You will not regret watching Once at least once."

And the acceptance speech by the the two lead characters was most sincere, authentic and charming. And this single, little song was up against four others, including three from just one movie, so the odds were against them winning at every turn in the road. <br/><br/>Oh, to see authentic joy instead of some weepy ""actress"" getting up and saying, ""Oh, boo hoo, I just can't believe this"" - I'm sure these two never did believe it, but accepted with grace and wonder and humility. Yea for them and every one actor out there who pursues their dreams."
"kparchman","9","1","2","24 February 2008"," Once wasn't enough
","Independent films have the potential to be entertaining, wise, interesting and thought-provoking. They can also be a waste of $7 and a couple of hours out of one's life. Picking up the movie, ""Once"", was a risk worth taking. Starring Glenn Hansard and Marketa Irglova of ""The Frames"", the movie shows the intensity of drive when one is compelled by ones art. Glenn Hansard, in the opening scene, is busking in his home town of Ireland in between other jobs. His first love, music, drives him to this street corner to sing; it is also where he meets ""the girl"". She is both gifted and mysterious: with her persuasive demeanor, he discovers healing from a devastating romantic loss as well as the magic of recording his own music. In their relationship, he discovers the self he seems to have lost.<br/><br/>The transcendent nature of this movie is found in both the relationship between the two lead characters as well as the music he writes. The song, ""Falling Slowly"", is sung with such melancholy at the beginning of the movie. Finding his voice  both musically and personally  he sings this song with passion and joy as he leaves for a season to go to London. The opening words of the song speak to longing for that which most people seek: ""I don't know you, but I want you all the more for that"". The seeking that these characters are doing model a spiritual journey that most of us find ourselves on when faced with loneliness, despair, brokenness. It's worth the exploration of discovering faith in the midst of darkness and music in the midst of silence: it's usually where God shows up.<br/><br/>This is a small film with a beautiful story and worthy of the 86 minutes of viewing time  at least once."
"TxMike","Null","1","2","2 February 2008"," A small movie about a guy and a girl who love to make music.
","In the DVD extras we learn that this movie was made on a very small budget, with a small crew and much hand-held filming. We also learn that the two main characters are musicians, not actors, and there was quite a bit of improvisation. That makes it all the more fun to watch.<br/><br/>Glen Hansard, 30-something, on his own a famous and successful Irish musician, is the Guy. By day he works with his dad in their shop repairing vacuum cleaners. By night, and part of the day, Guy stands on the street playing his beat-up guitar and singing songs he writes, hoping passersby will drop some loose change into his case. In the opening scene we see him chase a rogue who steals his soft case with money in it, but after he catches him has a soft heart and gives him the money anyway.<br/><br/>The Guy is heartbroken because his girl is off to London, and he believes she has cheated on him and says she is forgotten. But we know by the songs he writes that he still loves her.<br/><br/>Markéta Irglová, a teenager, is the Girl, recently from the Czech Republic, who happens by as she sells roses on the streets for a little cash. She listens to him, and they strike up a friendship, as she knows music and she has a vacuum cleaner that doesn't suck anymore. She has a mother and her small child at their apartment shack, and the Girl rejoices when she gets a job cleaning other peoples' homes. She has a husband back in the Czech Republic, but she talks as if it is over.<br/><br/>The Guy seems content to compose and sing on the streets, but the Girl urges him to cut a CD of his music so that he can get a contract and make real money. Together they get a loan and get a weekend of professional recording studio. Some of his street musician friends provide back-up.<br/><br/>As it turns out the two main actors were already friends, and their working ""chemistry"" is great. Over half of the movie is music and/or singing, so it is virtually a musical. Very good music. Very nicely done, with a good resolution.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Even though the Guy and the Girl became close friends and had a great affection for each other, they never became lovers. Eventually she helped him decide that he needed to go to London and look for his girlfriend, and also the Girl's husband decided to come to Ireland and be with his wife and young daughter."

","I went to this movie with high expectations because of the overwhelming critics that I had read, and I must say it did fulfil my expectations - at least to quite some extent. The music is powerful, the emotions pure and natural, the handcamera is sometimes a little painful to watch (feeling like on a roller-coaster) and the romance theme works well as this is yet another movie where a love (or beginning love) remains unfulfilled. For my taste though, the beginning emotions should have been stressed a little more to make the end even stronger - as, for instance a movie like ""Before Sunrise"" has managed to do. Good piece of work though."

","I tend to think of myself as a movie critic. I do things by the four star system and you know what, it's rare I give movies four stars for the mere fact that you have to be perfect in every aspect. ""Once"" did just that and for this sole reason only, simplicity.<br/><br/>An Irish singer (Glen Hansard)and a closet Czech pianist (Marketa Irglova) happen to meet on the streets of Dublin and together they start making music together. Both are dealing with personal relationships in their lives but they both connect for the mere fact that they both want to play music together.<br/><br/>Like I've stated before, simplicity is the key. Director John Carney does do anything grand, he keeps the story very small, even to the extent where the leads could be referred to as ""he"" and ""she."" What makes this the best musical of this generation? Very simple, for the first time in as many years, I've never seen music forced into a script. What I've always hated about musicals is the idea that the script have to fit the songs that are at hand. Sometimes, that leaves stretches in where you wonder if the movie is going to a point of ridiculousness. But in ""Once,"" it works the other way around. The music complements the script, which makes this movie all the more special.<br/><br/>The acting was Oscar-worthy but there had to be a connection between the two leads, which both Hansard and Irglova do provide. Their accents sometimes made it all the harder to hear what they might've said to each other, but at this point, you really don't care.<br/><br/>For all the bashers out there, wanting to give negative ratings, I'll say two things to that. One, if you watched it and genuinely hated this movie with all your guts, then fine, I can accept that because your views sometimes just don't align with mine. But for everyone else that just bashes it, and I've read comments where it looks like that haven't even seen the trailer of this film, don't comment. This movie isn't going to be for everyone because honestly, maybe less than half of America might be moved for musicals, who knows. All I know is that if you give this movie a chance, it will be not only the best musical you've seen this year, but for the past 20 years."
"Bruce-49","9","1","2","17 December 2007"," Brief Encounter - the Musical
","In many ways, Joe Carnahan's ONCE is a musical version of David Lean's BRIEF ENCOUNTER. The simple story of an aspiring musician and a Czechoslovakian cleaning woman who meet on the streets of Dublin and literally make beautiful music together is both conventional and original. ONCE is original in the way that it addresses the awkwardness of characters breaking into song. For the most part, the music we hear is being performed. It isn't something that only the characters hear. This prevents the tunes from clashing with the naturalistic setting, the gritty locales, the hand-held camera work. It's also just disarming enough to help us overlook that the story being told both apart from and through the music is essentially a romantic fairy tale. The title should clue us in to that."

","This was the most unusual movie I'd ever give an ""8"" rating to. But that would be in following with Ebert's rule that guides us to the belief that a movie's worth should be judged by ""not what it is about, but how it is about it."" This wasn't so much a film, as much a very long, very boring music video. But the music.... holy singer/songwriter, Batman! The music was fantastic! However, I don't think I would ever recommend going to see a movie because of the music alone. Unless it was a concert film or course. Once had as much music as a concert film, but chose to show it in Story Mode.<br/><br/>--POSSIBLE SPOILERS--<br/><br/>For a movie with almost no plot or story, ""Once"" still had me scratching my head at times. My concern is purely one of finance. None of the characters appeared to have wealth of any sort, yet the Guy was able to pony up $2000 for the recording studio for the weekend? And was then able to buy Girl a brand new piano as a parting gift? So the busker with a beat up, holey guitar, well-worn clothes, and a job in a vacuum cleaner repair shop has several thousand dollars stashed away in a coffee can somewhere? How does a movie with no plot still have plot holes?<br/><br/>--END SPOILERS--<br/><br/>You could sit through this movie with your eyes closed and not miss a single thing of significance. Your ears will thank you, and your eyes won't care.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/>I have never done this before, but I need to revise my review. ""Once"" is now out on DVD, but for the record I haven't seen it since my first viewing in the theaters back in October 2007. So what's changed then? Simply put, I haven't really stopped thinking about the film since I've seen it. None of the Hollywood spectacles I've seen since have been as moving or memorable. The pure simplicity and emotional honesty of ""Once"" lasts a lot longer than its 85 minute runtime. I guess I initially underestimated its impact on me.

Other times you get AT LONG LAST LOVE.<br/><br/>And then you get the ones that work and become something special...Something the likes of which you've never seen before. Nothing too loud, or precious or sickeningly sweet, but a rare combination of simple beauty and creativity taken to a place that touches the heart like nothing else can.<br/><br/>ONCE is such a film, I am so happy to say. Not a lot of people are going to like it, because it's as far from being a ""Hollywood"" film as you can get. No explosions, car chases, BIG dramatically ""actor-y"" moments or a soundtrack done by the latest chart-toppers on Billboard's Hot 100.<br/><br/>This is the story of one Irish Guy (Glen Hansard) and one Czech Girl (Marketa Iglova), who meet, write songs together, bond and fall in love. That's all. Well, no, I need to take that back. It's a story about the connections we make with one another through the things that make us similar, and how it leaves a mark on the heart and soul that can never be erased. And how music is the most powerful and profound way we can make that connection. <br/><br/>I saw the Oscars the year that the song ""Falling Slowly"" won for Best Song, and though I really liked it, I had no idea why it was chosen. Having seen ONCE now, I'd say the honor was very well-deserved, and it's a shame that it didn't receive more nominations. Hansard and Iglova give wonderfully natural performances, and when they're singing? The movie doesn't get any better than that, whether they duet or sing alone. <br/><br/>Writer/director John Carney made a brilliant decision to keep things simple, and the movie clocks in at just under ninety minutes. Funny thing is - when it was over, I didn't feel like I was cheated or that it should've been longer. I won't say how it ends or whether the Guy and Girl's romance is ever consummated, but let's just say the conclusion is...'note-perfect.' (I couldn't resist throwing that in there.)<br/><br/>Anyone avoiding this film because it has music or because they're allergic to ""chick-flicks"" should be prepared for a pleasant shock.

","This low-budget film about a Dublin street musician who connects with a young Czech woman has much to recommend it. The guy and girl (they are never given names) share an appreciation for music; the guy is much more attuned to pop music whereas the girl has a broader appreciation. All things being equal she tends toward playing classical piano, but she bonds with the guy to the extent of working jointly with him on pop compositions and performances.<br/><br/>The two protagonists are of meager means, so I guess it is fitting that the filming is lacking in high-end production values. Indeed much of the film has the effect of home video footage. This is all well and good, but the poor lighting and hand-held camera work ultimately wore on me. There are some sparks of creativity, particularly in the scenes where the guy flashes back on memories of a previous girlfriend and in the very final scene, but overall the filming is pedestrian.<br/><br/>The tentative and delicate nature of the relationship that develops between the guy and girl is touching. The vagaries of human interactions are illustrated well and the ending seemed real to me. <br/><br/>I admired the sincerity and determination of the performers - their devotion to their craft came across strongly. Most of this movie consists of performances. And that was the most difficult obstacle to my truly bonding with this movie - I didn't like the music. It struck me as amateurish and something I would not seek out. If you like the music, then this movie will most likely have a stronger appeal to you than it did for me."

He will learn later she is Czech, married, has a child and is living in Ireland with her mother and her child waiting for her husband to join them.

Charming story in which artistic gifts and desires are not always expressed, do not always find their way to some audience, and may be completely wrecked by some horny or kinky illumination.

","Once in a while a musical is fresh and new: Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You was attention-getting when his ordinary actors broke into song as if they were off the streets of a 1930's musical. Baz Lurhmann's Moulin Rouge! took the genre to expressionistic flights. And now back to earth in John Carney's Once, a realist drama/musical set in contemporary Dublin; here a street singer seems to fall in love with a passing by young woman with Hoover vacuum repair needs, which he can do in his day job.<br/><br/>And that's about ittwo lonely people, one separated from his unfaithful love and the other from her Czech husband. This 2007 Sundance Audience Award winner never strays from the documentary style while, as in Woody's film, songs break out but with much more natural flow. The truthfulness comes from Glen Hansard, lead singer of the Frames, and Marketa Irglova, a Czech musician he has known and worked with before. Their love and respect for each other make their performances two of the best this year.<br/><br/>Neither lead has a name, so it's easy to universalize their experience: the uncertainty of love, emphasized by her unsubtitled Czech response to his question about whether she still loves her husband or not, and the unglamorous ties each person has to a mate, albeit estranged as in this case. The love that has grown for these two impoverished artists is expressed in the songs, first about lost love and then about present love. Hansard has charisma that demands you listen to the lyrics while you enjoy his melody; Irglova's accompanying piano and voice reveal the heart of a poet and the pluck of a heroine.<br/><br/>Director John Carney was a member of the Frames, so his understanding of their Gaelic themes and Hansard's talent makes an engaging musical romance. The additional touch of documentary style (some hand held, jittery camera; some blurry close-ups) gives cred to the everyman aura of two talented people finding love without making love and finding song to express that maddening occurrence of being beholden to someone else and determined to do the right thing, not a recipe for lyrical music but a sweet, melancholy score just right for a true romance."

","Don't let anyone fool you. As sweet as Once is it is certainly not a Musical. What it is, is one long and boring audition video with a weak story thrown in. Granted, the male lead has great moments of both acting and singing, but to call this film a great love story is pushing it. Slow does not come close to describing this semi noble try. As a TV docudrama it might work on a small screen, but the quality of the film making here does not warrant a big screen. For all the hype and fuss I certainly expected much more.<br/><br/>There is even a scene where the male lead shows up with a huge hickie on his neck. This during a love story where the two supposed lovers have not yet been intimate.So, who was asucking on his neck????<br/><br/>Maybe the film was meant to be a mystery.LOL<br/><br/>I had always thought of a musical to be a story in which the musical pieces advance the telling of the story.

There is little story, since most of the movie is made up of people singing, sometimes while sitting and sometimes while standing. The songs themselves are not especially interesting; the only one I liked at all was the first one sung together by the two leads, and even though it was nice enough, it's not like I would actually pursue listening to it again.<br/><br/>Basically, people meet, write songs, sing songs, talk about writing songs, and that's about it. Yes, there's the occasional talk about something other than songs, like relationships, and there is some stuff unspoken that might appeal to people who like things that are unspoken, but you have to really want to see a movie where people sit around and sing bland songs to fully enjoy this."

It's straight out of ""The man who wasn't there"" of course, only hoover fixer and his date have traded places with Billy Bob Thornton and Scarlett Johansson. But ""Once"" is the kind of movie you can't possibly stay angry with for very long. The script doesn't do much explaining, which I think is a good thing. I also liked the fact that it doesn't have a proper ending. Like a true story, it's just sort of fades away. Unfortunately, the sound is terrible, especially for a film that is all about music, and what the Irish seem to think of as English will leave most audiences dumbfounded.

","It's hard for me to not like a music-related movie, but this guy's songwriting and singing/playing ability was so lacking that it was hard to watch. I cringed every time he opened his mouth or took the guitar out of his git-bag.
There is no way that a woman who plays as well as she did would ever become interested in such talentless music. After the scene at the music instrument shop, when he stood there wide-eyed while she played, I was hoping that when she finished, he would beg her to make him a better musician.
Then, they walk into a record company with a cassette in a portable desktop unit and actually have the nerve to play it for the guy. Absolute rubbish.
There is no real chemistry between the two, no real romance or showings of affection. He did want to boink her, and I'll give him a half point for that, but he shot and missed.
The potential for so many good scenes were missed in this movie. As it is, the dialogue and screenplay are abysmal. I don't know who is a more talentless hack, the singer/guitarist or the producer of this movie."

","Minor spoiler: I thought the beginning was a bit difficult to understand because of the Irish accents, but as the movie went along, I was able to pick up what they were saying. There were sporadic times when I couldn't understand what they said, but I got the main point and gist of the plot. The girl (Marketa) is really from the Czech Republic, she's an immigrant in this movie and speaks both her native language and English, but there's a conversation between her and her mother that is in their native language. In this movie, they do not subtitle that conversation. However, I don't think it was all that relative to the main plot. So if you are from another country and you understand English, then you'll like this movie. I truly wasn't expecting the way it ended, but it was good. The main characters shared a very sweet, enduring friendship that ended up with a nice surprise for the girl (Marketa) and an accepting ex-girlfriend/love. Making friends like that would be so cool. I wish! This movie was just simple and the music was great as well."

"estebangonzalez10","8","0","1","1 July 2015"," Once (8/10): A beautiful love letter for music aficionados
","""What's the Czech for ""Do you love him""?""<br/><br/>It's going to be very difficult to find another romantic musical feel as natural as John Carney's Once. In most musicals when you hear the characters singing out their lines there is something that doesn't feel authentic about it and you're reminded that it's just a movie, but in Once every moment unfolds in such a natural way that at times it feels as if you're watching an intimate documentary of two passionate musicians. The relationship between the two leads also develops in a rather refreshingly authentic way and the story avoids all the worn out clichés found in most romantic films. The dialogue, the song writing, the performances, and the chemistry between the two leads makes Once a beautiful love letter for aspiring musicians everywhere. Made with an extremely low budget and interpreted by two non-professional actors (Glen Hansard is actually the band leader of The Frames in which Carney was once a member of), it still manages to be emotionally engaging. The performances are incredibly natural and intimate, but the cinematography does suffer a bit from the low budget because the camera work is pretty amateurish. The scenes that take place at night and the lightning aren't that great, but the story more than makes up for it. I'd say that it even helps make the experience all that more natural. There are even several spontaneous moments in the film that work to its advantage, such as the unscripted scene in which Hansard's character sings a song in the bus about how his heart was broken. It's a small film, but it hit all the right emotional chords in such a powerful way. <br/><br/>The film begins in a rather funny note as the unnamed main character (Glen Hansard) is playing his guitar and singing for money in the streets of Dublin when all of a sudden a junkie takes his money and he chases him down through a couple of stores. One night as he is playing, an immigrant girl (Marketa Irglova) congratulates him for his music. The two begin talking about music and pretty soon they establish a nice friendship. He is living with his widowed dad (Bill Hodnett) and helps him fixing vacuum cleaners in his repair shop, and she sells flowers in the streets while trying to care for her mother (Danuse Ktrestova) and young daughter. He goes on to explain that his ex-girlfriend cheated on him and she's living in London now. The unnamed girl also tells him her story and explains that she is married but that her husband is living in the Czech Republic. The two married when she got pregnant but he had to return home. Despite being very fond of each other the two decide to remain friends. They collaborate together to make a music demo so that he can take with him to London to see if he can sign a music contract, and the film focuses on their time together during these days as they each share their stories and sing revealing songs to each other.<br/><br/>It's refreshing to see a romantic film like this that feels so authentic and natural. It is more about two people who are very fond of each other and develop feelings for one another in a very honest way. Similar in style to Carney's Begin Again, the film focuses on a different kind of love and we see it in an early scene where the guy asks the girl to spend the night at his place and she immediately is offended and leaves. It's a simple story, but it tells it in a heartfelt way that is hard to ignore. At the same time the music also becomes part of the story and it builds it even more. Irglova and Hansard are delightful together and you really believe what they are feeling through their songs. They carry this lovely film in such a way that it makes most other romantic films seem completely fake. Add Once to the list of must see films for music aficionados because it is truly a wonderful experience and a well written love letter from Carney. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","ONCE is a great little film about two characters who may or may not be falling in love on the streets of Dublin, and a film that deservedly won an Oscar for its music. Most of the feelings and emotions are explored through the music here, giving this film a novel and fresh feel.<br/><br/>I don't really watch romantic films and I actively despise the romantic comedy genre, but I can confirm that this is a low-key and touching little movie that successfully avoids the pitfalls of its genre. I particularly liked the raw, naturalistic feel of the production, and the fact that the two main actors aren't actually actors (they're musicians instead) makes it even more remarkable.<br/><br/>Really, though, ONCE is a film that's all about the music and director John Carney is happy to stand back and let the tunes take centre stage. Everything, from the storyline to the style, takes second place to the music, and while few of the songs are as good as the one that won the Oscar, the way that the subject matter is handled and celebrated with undeniable enthusiasm means that this is a film that you can really get behind and enjoy."

It looks dark and fuzzy and amateurish, but it has a soul, thanks largely to the warmth of the two central characters, played by the Irish Glen Hansard and the Czech Markéta Irglová, both chosen for their musical skills and not for any acting ability.<br/><br/>The story is very slight but life-affirming: Hansard's Guy (he is not named) getting round to recording an album one weekend - instead of delaying the project, as so many musicians do, to 'once' something or other has been done - with the support of the much younger Girl (who is also not named), in the process finding a powerful bond. Hansard and Irglová wrote and performed all the new songs.<br/><br/>I did not catch the film until seven years after its release by which time it had become something of a phenomenon, winning an Academy Award for Best Song and forming the basis of an award-winning musical.

This is just one example of the many, many, awkward and completely unmotivated scenes in this film.<br/><br/>And after seeing each other for a few months, the couple doesn't even stay together and they go off back to their sad desperate lives (This isn't necessarily a complaint since that's pretty much how most relationships end up as anyways). <br/><br/>Everyone who told me about this movie insisted that it was a ""beautiful love story,"" and that ""the music is so good,""... well I admit the one song is fairly catchy, but they sing the same damn song throughout the entire movie!

","...writer/director John Carney's sophomore full-length outing is a nice piece of entertainment that economically treads the line between outright movie musical and extended form music video. It's very low budget, shot on HDV, starring a guy and a gal who are in no way marquee names, but its economy and simplicity work to the film's advantage. It's a simple tale of boy-meets-girl, with an equally simple premise that both are talented musicians and both are pining for lost loves. Their complementary talents lead to collaboration and potential entanglement. Refreshingly, the leads really *are* talented musicians, earning a 2008 Oscar for Best Song (and a small raft of other awards as well), and if not the Irish Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb, acting-wise, they hold their own. The obvious musical bond lends authority to their relative lack of acting chops; the net effect is a very naturalistic, almost documentary feel. The music, written by the leads (Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová), is predominantly plaintive, angst-y folk-pop, so if you don't care for such tunes, you'll be less likely to enjoy the film, but the songs fit, each advancing the plot and/or emotional underpinnings, which is why ""Once"" feels very much like the aforementioned long-form music video or even a full-out musical. The main thing is that it all works, the lo-fi production values (which are still quite nice), the often hand-held camera, the unpolished acting, the naturalistic settings, an intelligent script that doesn't try to call attention to itself, it's all wonderfully, decidedly non-Hollywood, a sweet, refreshingly innocent little film. Ymmv, of course, but I found it well worth the time spent with it.<br/><br/>5.1.12 edit: I'm pleased to discover that this rough gem has been, indeed, turned into a theatrical musical, and apparently fine-tuned to such a degree that it's been found Tony-worthy.

They meet each other, they start talking; or rather, they start playing and singing in this strange, original musical. In the end, they go their separate ways (or do they?) without having even kissed, let alone having had sex, and yet having been aware of the feelings for one another that have grown in them.

","This is one of the oldest film concepts and it will live forever. Poor guy meets poor girl and they start as friends, but something develops. Tracy/Hepburn did that, if someone has forgotten.<br/><br/>But this is made in a charming way and Glen Hansard makes much more of his character than you expect from a movie like this.<br/><br/>The lines are often sung and there are also long cuts. This is on the limit of being a musical, but the people are real. But the plot is too traditional and it's like the script doesn't have the guts to tell something important. It doesn't even try and therefore this film will be forgotten. Which is somewhat a pity."
"Wolfi-10","6","0","1","10 March 2008"," The duration of the friendship as well as the movie's sound come up a little short.
","""Once is not enough"", one might say when the budding friendship and musical partnership depicted in this movie is cut off cold turkey after one week. Of course, the movie aims at being realistic, and people do stupid things in life all the time. And, if one is sufficiently concerned about these characters, one might entertain the expectation that the protagonist will return from London in a jiffy when he realizes not only the high cost of living in this city, but also the fact that he left his musical adjunct behind who assisted him to possibly become a real success on the folk music scene. This music is nice to listen to, as modern popular music goes, although not quite in the same class as when Ann Sothern helped Robert Young to come up with ""Lady Be Good"".<br/><br/>Technically, a steadier camera would have been appreciated. Most American viewers will probably have to make use of the English subtitles. However, the producers should have chosen conventional subtitles rather than those for the hearing-impaired (which inform the listeners of happenings such as ""music continues""); hearing-impaired people won't get much enjoyment out of the movie anyway since most of it comes from the music. While the producers were at it, they might as well have subtitled the occasional Czech conversations. Most astounding, however, is the fact that on a movie that has been heralded as possibly ""the best music film of our generation"", the sound has not only been robbed of much of its dynamic, but is monophonic to boot (at least on the DVD). To be sure, it has been encoded as ""Dolby Surround"", but all channels reproduce exactly the same sound at all times. The success that the movie nevertheless enjoyed, even among the professional film critics, offers the interesting cognizance that all the present-day zeal about sound reproduction with ever more channels is perhaps a tiny bit exaggerated?"

","Most stories have a plot woven around some issue of conflict. This little film wanders the streets of Dublin like the busker who has no more name name than the ""guy"" and the ""girl"" who crosses his path to encourage his musical pursuits. If you like the genre of music these young people create, you'll be pleased with this film Indeed, many have purchased the sound track after seeing it. Being from an older generation who doesn't really relate to this kind of music, I watched it with considerably less enthusiasm than those who do enjoy what these musicians are making. The story is quite undramatic with no twists of tension only a bittersweet nostalgic backflash suggesting the source of emotional turmoil the ""guy"" is feeling. The ""girl"" senses this and adds her own creative energy and eventually comes to feel more deeply for the ""guy"" than she's willing to accept. Her own emotional turmoil comes out in the unfolding of the sequence and the whole things ends on a bittersweet nostalgic note. As a film, I appreciated the glimpse into a world of talented people who are creating their music,as it does show us some of the more sentimental aspects of those in that genre with becoming maudlin. The absence of violence was greatly appreciated and this film is certainly worth recommending, especially to those who listen to this kind of music-- because that's what this film is all about."
