","I was in my mid-thirties when the Beatles came to America, and appeared at Shea Stadium and (famously) on the Ed Sullivan. I saw their success, with the screaming girls, as just another teen-age phenomenon. I must have read in some column that this film was interesting for its direction and photography. That was true. What I did not expect was that I would be caught up by the Beatles themselves, both as personalities and as musicians. Those who comment adversely on their lack of acting ability are way off base, because neither they nor the director were looking for dramatic skill; only for a degree of naturalness, which was achieved. Those who criticize the technical aspects are not well-acquainted with new developments in film technique especially in France; for instance, the jump shot. Those who criticize lack of plot must be interested only in straight narrative. I suggest that all the previously mentioned critics see the documentary materials on the making of the film, particularly those contained in the DVD set. They will see, for better or worse, that the creators and performers achieved what they wanted, allowing room for the unexpected. For forty years now I have been an admirer, own all their recordings, etc.; and taught this movie in my history of film class regularly. Don't believe the nay-sayers; see for yourself."

","What can you say about the film that started it all? Where popular culture as we know it took shape in a ""let there be light"" Genesis kind of way? Where pop rock became worth listening and not just dancing to? Where John, Paul, George, and Ringo became firmly established as individual personalities as well as the premier entertainment troupe of the 20th century?<br/><br/>Only this: ""A Hard Day's Night"" is good, yes, and significant, but it's fun, too. Still, and above everything else, it's a lot of fun.<br/><br/>""A Hard Day's Night"" is probably more responsible for the Beatles' enduring image in our culture than any single song they made. It came out in 1964, within a few short months of the Fab Four's sensational appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show that truly launched them globally, though they had been making great pop music for more than a year which was all the rage across Europe. ""Hard Day's Night"" captures the band when they were still relatively provincial and innocent, not yet in the ""marijuana for breakfast"" phase they were well into the following year when they made the zanier ""Help!"" LSD, Yoko, and the Maharishi were not even on the radar, nor was the psychedelic era the Beatles would usher in less than three years later. Finally ""Hard Day's Night"" clicked not only with the kids but the adults, who previously viewed the band as a motley band of overplayed haircuts. It gave all the generations of the time something they could agree on. These guys were good.<br/><br/>The story of ""Hard Day's Night"" is thin by design. We see the Beatles in slightly fictionalized form, with a manager named Norm and a roadie named Shake, traveling by train across England and ducking into a studio to make a TV appearance. Paul has his grandfather along, a codgy old troublemaker who nevertheless is ""very clean."" The irony of the movie is that the old guy, played by British TV star Wilfrid Brambell, is the one that continually ruffles the feathers of society while the Boys themselves play things fairly straight and legal.<br/><br/>Grandpa has the best take on the meager storyline: ""I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery, and so far I've been in a train and a room and car and a room and a room and a room!"" Brambell works very well in the film, a needful focal point in a film that requires some bearings in order to work. Of the Beatles themselves, Ringo makes the strongest single impression by showcasing his vulnerable side while John probably has the best moments with his wacky, caustic humor. George shines, too, in a scene with a trend-happy fashion maven, and married one of the girls on the train in real life, so he did pretty well here, too.<br/><br/>Is it the best Beatles film? I think ""Yellow Submarine"" is better for what it's worth, but ""Hard Day's Night"" is the best film actually featuring the Beatles for who they were and what they were about.<br/><br/>Great music, too. The sequence on the train with ""I Should Have Known Better"" still works as a video, with all the baggage-car bric-a-brac thrown in for ambiance. Then there's ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" which shows the Beatles in full-tilt boogie mode after momentarily escaping their studio confines. ""And I Love Her"" has some of the film's greatest camera work, very moody and intense in its focus on how well the Beatles worked in a TV studio setting.<br/><br/>As a film, ""Hard Day's Night"" lacks a bit of heart. Not that it's cold or cruel, just a trifle too detached to get enveloped by, the way one does with great cinema. I don't really miss the fact that ""Help!"" wasn't a true sequel; ""Hard Day's Night"" works for its 90-plus minutes but doesn't leave you wanting more. The relationships between the band members, and with Grandpa, Norm, and Shake, are left unexplored, and you don't really miss that as much as you maybe should.<br/><br/>But as a collection of small, witty moments interspersed with great music, ""Hard Day's Night"" is a pleasure through-and-through. Like the scene where John cuts the tailor's measure (""I now declare this bridge open"") or has that absurd corridor chat with Anna Quayle (""She looks more like him than I do."") Or when Ringo tells the crotchety train passenger who complains he ""fought the war for your sort"" that ""I bet you're sorry you won!"""

","""The first 60's film to ever waken my musical interest in pop music and electric guitars...not to mention, I wasn't even born then!"" The film is full of great music and British humor by the Fab Four. It stars The Beatles themselves - John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr in their first acting debut. The music they perform in this 'black and white' film are 7 'Lennon & McCartney' classics - from the title song, ""A Hard Day's Night"", to ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""She Loves You"". In the comedy skits of the film, The Beatles' drummer Ringo Starr, definitely leaves the other lads in a so-call 'run against time'. It's a fun and exciting film...a pop film on what 'Beatlemania' was all about back then in 1964. This classic is a must see for all upcoming Beatle fans from all around the world, as well as people and kids of all ages.

"Pedro_H","8","74","92","8 April 2004"," Solid gold record of the Liverpool miracles at the point of making pop history.
","The Beatles travel down from Liverpool to record a TV show.<br/><br/>If I was to meet Richard Lester I would shake his hand and thank him for recording the Beatles during the middle part of their career when they could entertain but hadn't yet shot off in to outer space. Without this we would have a piece missing from their history - and lets be frank - our history. They changed the world and all they had to change it with were electric guitars and their personalities!<br/><br/>The script is clever in that it showcases the personalities of the group without asking them to do much acting. Wilfred Brambell tags along to give comedy relief and the whole thing fits in plenty of songs that are good - but not as good as what soon followed. They are still tied to the Northern dance halls.<br/><br/>I have always thought that if they had a died in a car crash at this point they would be a mystery to the modern audience - hugely popular at the time - but not particularly stand-out from the other bands around. Like the way we regard Charlie Chaplin or Mary Pickford - both incredibly famous in their prime - but little regarded today. <br/><br/>Whether you like to admit it or not there are three geniuses at work and Ringo Starr. So I guess that it is fitting that Ringo comes across the best of the group: Down-to-earth, chatty, witty and willing to talk to anyone. Even the kids down by the river. John Lennon had a comic wit that could have given him another career had his music not been up to scratch. Talk about being master of the witty comeback. <br/><br/>Anyone watching this film will see London as it really was at the time. Not the swinging sixties that everyone pretends it was. Grubby shops, unpainted windows that look about to fall out of their frames, empty streets bar a few beat up cars. <br/><br/>I guess you could say this is the perfect record of Beatlemania: The driving beat songs (cranked out even quicker on stage), the backstage sieges, the ping-pong put downs that is the hallmark of English humour, the screaming that overpowered the performance. Enjoyable at the time (as light entertainment) it becomes an important historical document now and every generation should see it. Your pop culture education depends on it."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","24","28","11 October 2007"," Fun and inventive- a magical musical which stands outside its time
","""A Hard Day's Night"" doesn't seem dated now, but it does seem familiar. We're used to all its madcap editing and photography now thanks to television and music videos, and we can only sit back and imagine (or try to remember) what it looked like through eyes that had never seen anything like it before. Watching it today, ""A Hard Day's Night"" still seems fresh and original, because it's still different (we're used to music videos, but not feature-length music videos), but to the 1960's audience it would have seemed entirely different from anything they had previously seen (especially if they were expecting a traditional rock musical, considering that the only good one of those made prior to this which I've seen is ""Go Johnny Go"").<br/><br/>Lester infuses the film with nonstop quick cutting and energetic pacing, giving the film an almost documentary-like feel (and somehow managing to integrate the biggest pop band in the world into the French 'nouvelle vague' style of film-making). When Orson Welles was interviewed in Playboy magazine in 1967 he said that the film directors that appealed to him the most were 'the old masters- by which I mean John Ford, John Ford, and John Ford. With Ford at his best you feel that the movie had lived and breathed in the real world, even though it may have been written by mother Machree'. When questioned about younger directors he enjoyed the most he named Stanley Kubrick and Richard Lester. <br/><br/>It seems absurd after Kubrick's long and distinguished career and Lester's career which while featuring some famously good films, also includes ""Butch and Sundance: The Early Days"" (a cheap prequel with none of the original cast), and the notoriously horrible ""Superman III"" to compare the two directors, but looking at Welles' reasoning behind loving John Ford films, it all makes sense. ""A Hard Day's Night"" really does feel real, we are basically transported into a day in The Beatles' life and given a VIP pass to accompany them wherever they go. It's a fascinating adventure which the screenplay handles very well. <br/><br/>The Beatles were not actors, but they really come off as themselves because all they have to be is the cocky, wisecracking, and rather charming men they were in real life. The screenwriter is smart enough not to provide them with any real acting, which really helps the film. That's not to say there isn't any good acting in the film, quite to the contrary actually, since Wilfrid Bramble is hilarious as McCartney's grandfather and was presumably cast thanks to his very funny co-starring role on Britcom ""Steptoe and Son"", which was one of the shows I frequently watched as a kid (and was remade for American audiences as ""Sanford and Son""). <br/><br/>The film is effortlessly charming, relying on the Beatles' natural charisma to carry the film but also including enough wit to warrant comparisons to later great British comedies and also to the later Beatles films (including Lester's later, slightly funnier and more experimental ""Help!""). The Beatles were not yet the musical innovators they would later become, but there's something I personally prefer about their simple, short, and perfect Merseybeat songs, especially those on this soundtrack, which contains some of the most joyous and memorable pop songs ever written. <br/><br/>9/10"

","If anyone wants to witness the phenomenon that was ""Beatlemania"" in the 1960s, all they have to do is view ""A Hard Day's Night"". Although it's a fictional account of two days in the life of the rock group on tour, it captures the essence of what their life on the road was actually like. It also served to enhance their ""personalities"" as individuals, as well as show their spirit of fun-loving lads as a group. And as a bonus... the music throughout is superb! Sprinkled with Beatles' hits, Richard Lester's film almost serves as a blueprint for the music video form that took over the airwaves in the 1980s. Filmed with humor, great tunes and fast-paced editing, ""A Hard Day's Night"" usually never fails in delivering smiles and pleasure. If you're a music fan, and a rock and roll buff, the film is a must!"

","Classic cinema verite has the Fab Four going hither and thither, accompanied by Paul's ""very clean"" grandfather John (Wilfrid Brambell). Naturally, it wouldn't be a Beatles movie without their music. And the music always fits the scene (unlike so many musicals). My favorite scene was on the train where John, Paul, George and Ringo meet a middle-aged man, and...well, let's just say that it did a really funny job showing the generation gap. In short, you can always count on the Beatles to do something great, as every one of their songs showed. They may have had a ""hard"" time making this movie, but they would have to agree that it was worth it; people could easily spend ""days"" and ""nights"" watching it."

","A ""typical"" day in the life of the Beatles. They have to deal with Paul's grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell), a neurotic TV director (Victor Spinetti), their long-suffering managers and tons of screaming fans.<br/><br/>No real plot, just a lot of very lively sequences overflowing with one-liners and non sequiturs. The tone of the scenes go all over the place--one is full of verbal puns, the next visual gags, then absurdity reigns, THEN surrealism! It's a credit to director Richard Lester that he manages to keep all these various shifts in tone flowing smoothly. It's great to see that the Beatles are obviously enjoying themselves every minute. Some of the jokes are obscure (the ""clean"" jokes were based on remarks made about the Beatles back in 1962) and the accents are sometimes difficult. But it's great to see the Beatles so young and full of life and when they sing the film becomes magical. Also they have a good cast backing them up--Brambell and Spinetti are just great (and very funny). If you don't like the Beatles or their music, you might want to skip this film. But if you do, it's a must-see."

When the young females were resting I had to contend with the Fab Four's Liverpudlian speech patterns which were as yet unfamiliar to me. Still very few soundtracks produced as many hits as did A Hard Day's Night.<br/><br/>As much as The Beatles themselves revolutionized popular music, A Hard Day's Night also was a revolutionary film of its own. What you're seeing here is nothing less than the first music video, albeit a rather lengthy 90+ minute one.<br/><br/>Director Richard Lester wisely eschewed the idea of a plot and basically did a docucomedy with songs about 12 hours in the life of John, Paul, George, and Ringo. They gave Paul a grandfather, played by Wilfred Brambell who when he wasn't getting into mischief on his own was influencing Ringo to spread his wings so to speak. <br/><br/>Will Ringo get back to the studio in time for the big Broacast? Actually 32 years before that in Paramount's The Big Broadcast the same was asked of straying Bing Crosby.

","What a fun movie. I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release as a kid in 1964. (They gave us black and white Beatles Fan Club buttons.) Looking back through a 10 year old's eye's I couldn't wait to see The Beatles in a movie. I had seen them on TV and in magazines but an entire movie about them was going to be a watershed event in the career of the group. Indoctrinated by all the corny teen movies that mostly were made prior to Hard Day's Night you knew that if they were going to be portrayed as conventional teen idols it was going to be a bust but if it was a glimpse into what it was like being a Beatle and the London mod scene of '64 and The Beatles in their irreverent but likable persona with cool clothes and Beatle boots and lots of Beatle's music and The Beatles playing their guitars it was going to be a hit. Well it didn't disappoint. I didn't even expect there to be a story. I just wanted to see the Beatles on the big screen and hear their music. (The theater even had women playing nurses in nursing outfits and stretchers for people who fainted. Cool and campy. I have to give that theater credit for all they did. The first 50 people in got Beatles wigs.) As I grew older this film did not when I would see it on TV. Sure it was dated but it was still fun. Supporting, or in this case actual actors, Norman Rossington as Norm and Victor Spinetti as the TV Director along with Wiford Brambell as Paul's ""clean"" grandfather and John Junkin as Jake gave the movie a legitimate cast to cohesively hold it together and it worked well but heck, The Beatles were good on their own first time out. George Harrison's future wife, fashion model Pattie Boyd is one of the girls in the train car with the band (Her only line is ""prisonors"") and even future rock and pop star Phil Collins is in a scene as a teen fan. Director Richard Lester should have been at least nominated for an Academy Award as Best Director. Alun Owen did get a nomination for Best Screenplay in the only film he ever did. George Martin also received an Academy Award nomination for Scoring of Music Adaptation. Any of The Beatles songs in this film should have been nominated for Best Original Song but they weren't. Gilbert Taylor was the cinematographer for this film. He had just come off doing the cinematography for the film Dr. Strangelove. John Jympson who had just come off editing the film Zulu was the editor. This film does a wonderful job of capturing the era of mid 1960's London and Beatlemania on film in black and white. Their next film Help, also directed by Lester tried to be too James Bondish and although good was largely silly and didn't come close to HDN. This film has been with me so long and I've seen it so many times I can't help but give it a 10."

"JoeKarlosi","10","13","18","17 February 2006"," A Hard Day's Night (1964) ****
","The Beatles' first classic movie is a nostalgic time capsule that manages to embody a very special age of innocence from the early 1960's, when four young men from Liverpool England practically took over the world with their marvelous music and charismatic charm and wit. Director Richard Lester is to be commended for successfully capturing all of the excitement and joyful hysteria of these times for historical posterity. For anyone new to The Beatles who's looking to discover what they were all about, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is the perfect place to start. It showcases the four at the height of their early powers, before the psychedelic experimental period began and the latter breakup took its toll.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Alun Owen spent some time with the Fab Four in late 1963, when a phenomenon christened ""Beatlemania"" was descending all across Great Britain. He began to get a good idea of their individual personalities and what he wanted to write for a proposed film which would start production sometime in March, 1964. Even more appropriately, the Beatles' world-astounding popularity soared still further in the interim, after they set foot on American soil in February of '64 and became household names. The market was ripe for this film, which it was decided would show the rigors of a typical day in the life of the band at the peak of their stardom. <br/><br/>The resulting motion picture was funny, clever, delightful and of course, musical. John Lennon and Paul McCartney penned several songs for inclusion in the film, all of them winners and two of which easily became #1 hits (""Can't Buy Me Love"" as well as the title tune, which was actually made-to-order overnight after producer Walter Shenson asked for a song called ""A Hard Day's Night"" which could run along with the credits). The film is very British, and the decision to photograph in black and white nicely compliments the aura of England. The Beatles are shown traveling from gig to gig, performing music, doing interviews, trying to outsmart legions of adoring fans, and generally trying to have a good time amidst all the insanity. While the Beatles themselves were not professional actors, they hardly had to be as they were essentially just being themselves, albeit exaggerated caricatures: John the sarcastic and witty one, Paul the professional lady's man, George the quiet cynic, and Ringo the lovable but mistreated clown. Elder British comedian Wilfrid Brambell was also cast as Paul's meddling ""very clean old grandfather"", and is often humorous to watch, getting involved in all sorts of mischief, though perhaps the necessity of his character being added to the formula would be open to debate.<br/><br/>A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is a special account of a very wonderful, if fleeting, moment from our entertainment history. We are very lucky to have this record of those special days to take us back and enjoy throughout the many different times yet to come.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

I also saw a few melancholy faces, too, and I understood those as well, sort of. I'd seen the film many times before -- I rank it in my top 20 -- and it remains, always, fast, funny, and smart (shot in a kind of luminous black and white by Gil Taylor -- ""...Strangelove"", ""Star Wars""). Director Richard Lester and writer Alun Owen caught a moment in time like lightning in a bottle and turned it into a jumpy, jangly thing that is as hot as it is cool and everlasting as The Beatles' music. I hesitate to write about their music or the stand-out moments in the picture (the lads were naturals, weirdly so} -- there are too many of those moments and part of the joy of the film is discovering them from that first, familiar guitar stroke onwards -- but I want to touch on that melancholy I saw in those faces. It's more than nostalgia. This is a depiction of a time that people born years after the killing of John Lennon watch and want to be a part of. You watch and want to be part of something just because it feels right.

","One of the biggest reasons film holds the effect over us the way it does is because it appeals to our emotions in ways some of the other arts cannot. This is because film incorperates sound, theatre, painting, dance and writing. That dry polemic aside, A Hard Day's Night is a fine example of what film can do. This film is one of the purest expression of joy in cinema history. What made the Beatles so fantastic as performers and ultimately as cultural icons, is they personified all of our hopes and dreams. We all wish we could be as expressive and has happy as they appeared to be. I know that much of what we see is fabricated, but one cannot fake the explosion of life we see on the screen and hear on their records. There was the celebration of life and creativity in those four young men and they shared so much of it with us. This film is a great document as to what made them so great. Richard Lester, the director, got out of the way and let them be the Beatles. The camera work and editing in this film arguably made the '60's cultural revolution. It is a perfect marriage of music to image. Without this film there never would have been an Easy Rider or even an MTV (on second thought, maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing). Of course John, Paul, George, and Ringo couldn't completly match their images in their private lives (who could?) and of course they matured and evolved as we all have. But this film inspired many to live, to love and to create. It is such a force of positive life affirming love that it has to be savored and enjoyed. I don't apologize for dripping over it the way I do. It is a great film, on the level with Kane, Singin' in the Rain, The Seven Saumurai and others. It should be so much higher on the IMDB scale."

","...but they were great entertainers, and this film is great entertainment. This is the best of all of the rock and roll films that feature the actual performers. This picture demonstrates The Beatles at the peak of their popularity in the Summer of 1964- wandering about London- with the ultimate soundtrack in the background. A fascinating homage to Beatlemania when viewed now- over half a century later. The inventive boys from Liverpool are displayed at their sarcastic and witty best in this natural setting. A Hard Day's Night is a great example of the early Beatles musical ability, and work product, being that the title tune was written in about 20min between finishing an American tour, a European tour, a plethora of television specials, recording an LP in Paris in German for the Deutschland market, writing and recording the Hard Day's Night LP as well as making this film all within the same year, and before May of that year. After which, they all went on a month long vacation, recorded another album and began work on the next film. These guys were driven workaholics at this time, and their collective creative synergy has never been seen again.<br/><br/>There wasn't anywhere The Beatles could go without being mobbed, thus they spent years boxed up in hotel rooms together to the point where they knew each other so well they often finished each others sentences during interviews. As a group of young men going through that type of stress day in and day out, they had to develop coping skills in order to keep it together, it seems they chose humor as their main tool. This movie shows us a little bit of that. <br/><br/>Genius casting is evident in Hard Days Night with the inclusion of Irishman Wilfred Brambell as Paul McCartney's incorrigible Grandfather. Brambell was only 52 at the time but looked 82. At the time Brambell was very well known to British audiences due to the popularity of his television character named Albert Steptoe in a show called Steptoe and Son. Brambell's 1960s character Steptoe was the basis for the Fred Sanford character played by Redd Foxx on the 1970s American TV show ""Sanford and Son"".

","A Hard Day's Night is quite simply a masterpiece--it so thoroughly re-wrote the rulebook on filmmaking that it is impossible to appreciate today how many rules it broke.  Richard Lester's direction is so innovative that 35 years later MTV probably still hasn't finished ripping him off.  Alun Owens script is a wonder--so seemingly natural that it is easy to forget this isn't a documentary (at least enough people noticed there was a script to nominate it for an Oscar).  And as for the acting--trained actors couldn't have portrayed the Fab Four better.  Each of their personalities is captured perfectly, especially John's (when George asks why he was leaving the room, John replies, ""He told us to stay here, didn't he?""<br/><br/>Then there's the music--glorious early Beatles!!  Some of the best music ever made.  This is on my short, short list of best films ever made."

","The Beatles take England by storm as they travel from Liverpool to London so they can do a live performance on a television show. What makes this movie so special and enjoyable is the way it vividly captures the Fab Four when they were still pretty fresh, dynamic, and even fairly innocent; by having the Beatles wisely just be themselves this film manages to astutely nail the charming effervescent quality that made them stand out as a group. <br/><br/>John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr all display a winningly natural rapport and a tight camaraderie that's a joy to behold. Moreover, they all deliver a slew of sharp snappy one-liners with cheeky aplomb. Wilfrid Brambell nearly steals the whole show as Paul's mischievous grandfather. In addition, there are amusing supporting contributions from Norman Rossington as long-suffering manager Norm, John Junkin as hapless lackey Shake, Victor Spinetti as a pompous TV director, and Kenneth Haigh as a pretentious advertising executive. Alun Owen's sly script pokes wickedly hilarious fun at everything from the media -- the press conference sequence is a riot! -- to television to the Beatles themselves. Directed with tremendous gusto by Richard Lester, exploding with infectiously anarchic energy, and further galvanized by a bunch of wonderful songs, there's a vibrancy and spontaneity evident throughout that's downright impossible to either dislike or resist. A total treat."

","This film is charming. A black and white production that relies upon the music and personalities of The Beatles. It has a 'loose' plot, The Beatles' lives over a 48-hour period, looking after Paul's grandfather, which serves as an excuse for hi-jinks and bursting into song. Directed by Richard Lester, it manages to convey the social feel of its time, what it is like to be alone, ageing, class divisions, and an England that does not exist any more. It is witty,nostalgic and makes you aware of how fresh The Beatles were before they (and the 60's) got complicated.<br/><br/>Here are some of lines from the film, whether they were scripted or spontaneous I know not, but it doesn't detract from the humour:<br/><br/>Who's that little old man? Ringo: He belongs to Paul.<br/><br/>I shall call the guard. Paul: Ah, but what? They don't take kindly to insults.<br/><br/>Have you seen Paul's grandfather? John: Of course! he's concealed about me person.<br/><br/>They've gone potty out there. The place is surging with girls. John: Please sir, can I have one to surge with sir?<br/><br/>What would you call that hairstyle that you're wearing? George: Arthur.<br/><br/>George (about Ringo): He's very fussy about his drums you know. They loom large in his legend.<br/><br/>Well quite frankly I wasn't expecting a musical arranger to question my ability picture-wise. John: I could listen to him for hours.<br/><br/>If you ever wanted to have lived during the 60's a film like this epitomises why. There's a really lively night club scene where you get to watch, almost like a 'fly on the wall', The Beatles being themselves.<br/><br/>Watch it, buy the Hard Day's Night Album and drift away into a pleasant and sentimental 60's daydream."

","When you are dealing with a myth you have to look for what was new at the time when that myth appeared. And the Beatles are such a myth. This film reveals the fabric the myth is made of. Pure cinematographic and even photographic silk. The four boys have to be running because at the time everything young and new was on the run since it was chased by the establishment in order to be pilloried and exposed. But it also had to show how these four young men had to be able to capture the attention of other people and bring them into the running, first of all young people, particularly girls, and second the best representatives of the establishment, coppers. The film also had to be in black and white to be out of time, eternal because looking old, even odd or oddly even. Then and but their music did not have to convince their audience. It was new, fresh, lively, light, slightly rocky and rather smoothly rolly, with some drums but not too much, and a lot of harmony and melody, but the main attraction was the use of simple catch phrases to express love, freedom, desire, alienation and yet liberation in a mellow and sweet wrapping, like the cute title of the film taken from one of the songs. Finally the film had to satisfy the audience on the lifestyle of the Beatles and on their surrealistic reality. That is done with a plot based on their real life as musicians, etc, and at the same time with constant reference to impossible, at times absurd, breaches in this realism into some impossible meaningless or humoristic pranks. In one word the film is so real that it reaches beyond reality and even the virtuality of a life imagined as being out of logic.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

","It must have been immensely frustrating for Elvis Presley to have to sit and watch this movie. As if he didn't feel threatened enough by the Beatles stealing his thunder and taking the American market by storm or by their genius-level songwriting skills (Elvis didn't write his songs), he had to watch them in action in a movie with an Oscar-nominated script, material he could only ever dream of getting his hands on. Oddly enough, the jokey style of this script would have suited Elvis to a tee, he had a similar giddy personality in real life and ""Monthy Python's Flying Circus"" would become one of his favourite shows. Elvis must also have been frustrated to think that the Beatles were working with people who not only understood exactly who they were but people who respected their talent also, while the people The King had to work with were the exact opposite. Elvis was stuck singing lousy songs in crummy movies for hack directors for the rest of the 60s.<br/><br/>If you ever wondered what all the fuss about Beatlemania was, check out this movie. It perfectly captures the joy of the whole thing, from the underdog charm of the four Beatles themselves to the sheer excitement they created around the world just by being themselves and using their God-given talents.<br/><br/>The film is a flawless fusion of the clever wordplay of Alun Owen's script and the visual humour of director Richard Lester. The whole thing crackles with energy and invention from start to finish.<br/><br/>The first scenes in the film eerily seem to predict the break-up of the Beatles in later years. When the film starts, we see John, George and Ringo but there is no sign of Paul McCartney (John, George and Ringo would later unite against Paul, leading to their split). When we first see Paul, he is wearing a fake beard as a disguise (Paul would have a real beard when the other three turned on him in the late 60s). Weird. <br/><br/>And then there are the Beatles songs themselves. What a pleasure to listen to such gems as ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" ""She Loves You,"" and the title tune ""A Hard Day's Night"" (based on one of Ringo's sayings). Even the lesser-known songs are good.<br/><br/>The Oscar-nominated script plays to the Beatles strengths by incorporating their own real-life sarcastic comments to journalists in the dialogue while masking their deficiencies (i.e. acting).<br/><br/>Wilfred Brambell plays Paul McCartney's Irish grandfather (Paul's mother Mary really was Irish and came from County Monaghan, she is the ""Mother Mary"" in the song ""Let It Be"" that Paul wrote). It was a bold move for one of the heroes to have an Irish relative in a British movie as Irish people were discriminated against in Britain at the time (Rooms to let were advertised across Britain at the time with signs which read: ""No Blacks, No Actors, No Dogs, No Irish"" - Irish actor Wilfred Brambell was two of those). It only increases the anarchic nature of the whole project even further.<br/><br/>The next Beatles movie ""Help,"" was not as good as this one even though it was in colour. Screenwriter Alun Owen wasn't involved in that one, although director Richard Lester was.<br/><br/>Looking at John Lennon in his early 20s here, it's hard to believe the fate that awaited him on December 8th 1980 when he was shot dead in New York City by the lunatic Mark Chapman. What an appalling waste of a man's life and talent. The good news is that this movie has captured him forever in his prime and it can be enjoyed over and over by future generations. We shall never see their like again."
"jjm_1965","10","3","3","20 June 2005"," I never get tired of this movie.
","The 1st time saw ""A Hard Day's Night"" was about 1970 on ""the 4:30 Movie"" on channel 7 in New York. I was 5 years old and remember hearing the Beatles music on the radio constantly at that time, so it was cool when I saw them miming to some of those same songs in the film. ""The Monkees"" TV show was shown regularly at that time (on Saturdays @ 12:00 on CBS), so I was already familiar with seeing a bunch of guys running around and then performing songs. At the time I did not see the similarity between the film and the TV show. I thought all rock bands really experienced everything like in the film, so I made up my mind at 5 years old that I would be a musician when I grew up. That did come true (though I have not made it past semi-pro yet), except I never had a bunch of girls chasing me down the street.<br/><br/>Anyway, as a piece of film-making, I think it is brilliant. It is as enjoyable as any Marx Bros. film, the script is great, it does not try to change the world or make a great statement, and the fact that it is in black and white gives it an artistic edge that would have been lost in a color film. Watch it even if you are not a Beatles fan."

There was a mormon girl who went with us to see it, and she complained about the Beatles and their drugs and long hair (this was 1987, by the way). She only had negatives to say about them before seeing the film.<br/><br/>After the movie, it was 1964 all over again.

","""A Hard Day's Night"" is a great film for Beatle fans, but even non-Beatle maniacs can appreciate the great British humor, stylish cinematography, and on screen hijinks. This movie is shot to somewhat look like a documentary, or an actual day in the life of the Beatles. The outcome is wonderfully innocent on the outside, and devilishly rebellious on the inside, much like the Beatles themselves. The movie follows the Beatles, their two comical managers, and Paul's cranky grandfather as they travel from trains, studios, clubs, all around London, and back to the studio again. The humor is at times very intellectual, at other times, purely visual. Another treat for Beatle fans is that much of the humor is simply the Beatles being themselves.  Though the film is not a documentary, it actual does a good job of portraying the Beatles' real personalities and gives the audience a feel of their hectic, confined, touring days. There's also a great concert scene which, if you use your imagination, is almost like being there yourself. I gave this movie an 8. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially those who love the Beatles or have an appreciation of British, Monty Python-style humor."

","The most striking thing to me about AHDN is the youthful spontaneity of the Beatles and their fans. The Beatles seem to be at such ease portraying themselves in the film. They WERE themselves in the film. The director, Richard Lester, easily blends performances of their songs in a plot that serves to string them together, that plot also having a quirky, sometimes rickety, yet purposeful life of its own. The dialog can have an appealing, off-handed humor.<br/><br/>This film has wonderful, surprising moments. In one scene, Ringo, who has abandoned a TV studio rehearsal to walk around London, meets a boy of twelve or thirteen by a river. They chat a bit, and then the boy leaves him and runs down an embankment to join his mates as they skip stones on the water. You get the impression that, with all their fame, the Beatles might have enjoyed that simple luxury as well."

"consortpinguin","10","5","6","22 September 2002"," British Comedy at its Best!
","""A Hard Day's Night"" is one of the greatest comedies of all time.  At the time of its release, the Beatles were the hottest, newest sensation in the world.  Even at the tender age of 13, I thought this fad would fade... but I was wrong.  They just kept on getting better and better. <br/><br/>I have seen this film four times... at four different times of my life, and I appreciate it more each time. <br/><br/>Naturally I laughed and enjoyed the music when I saw it as a young teen. Then when I was about 17 they actually had it TV and I appreciated it more, being a more seasoned Beatles fan.  And as an adult, and a parent, I love this story.<br/><br/>You probably know the story -- a couple of days in the life of the Fab Four on tour, mobbed by fans, living in hotels, travelling on a train.  The musical numbers just fit right into the story, just like a Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers classic.  I think this movie is great because it was made in the finest tradition of British comedy -- namely, we can all have a laugh at ourselves.  I love the scene where George is interviewed by some advertising mogul about what young people like, and gives a rather nasty opinion about a TV show that's supposed to be the hottest teen program. <br/><br/>
Having Paul's grandfather was a stroke of genius.  What a great character actor he was, always getting into trouble, and trying to get the boys in trouble too.  And of course, the scene where Ringo is wandering around aimlessly, slightly hung over!  Actually, I read that he says he was pretty hung over at the time.<br/><br/>Hard Day's Night was the best of all the Beatles films.  I think ""Help"" is OK, but lacks the spontanaety of ""Hard Day's Night.""  ""Magical Mystery Tour"" had a great premise, great music, two interesting videos, but fizzled because the Beatles tried directing it themselves, with no experience.  ""Let it Be"" was interesting to watch, almost as a documentary, and ""Yellow Submarine"" was actually very good, but you had to suspend all rules of conventional thinking.  Many viewers had ""a little help from their friends"" although I personally don't believe in that stuff.  <br/><br/>It just shows that the Beatles really were the very best rock band in history -- there was a magic that only John, Paul, George,and Ringo together could make.  Made on a low budget and tight schedule, I have to say the directing, script (ad libs?), singing, and acting were superb.  Compare this to pathetic attempts by other bands -- ""Spice World"" -- Spare me!<br/><br/>""A Hard Day's Night"" will still be one of the all-time classic films a century from now, like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""The Band Wagon,"" or ""Swing Time."" Definitely a TEN!!!"

One can't help but feel that they are all having a great time doing this, because they really are!!! Enough has been said about this movie that I need not go into the fact that The Beatles were compared to the Marx brothers for their wit and comic delivery. There are few movies that I have watched several times because I liked them so much, and none that I have watched more than this one. In the summer of '65 right before the movie 'Help' came to theaters, they ran HDN on TV, almost as a promotion for the show. My sisters and their girlfriends, who were all at least 7 years older than me and on their way to college, sat in our living room and watched the movie together. They were like mesmerized by the Beatles, and being only about 9 years old at the time, it was hard for me to understand what was really happening. But I sat there with them and had a really good time watching their antics, and listening to the girls comments about each Beatle being 'Gorgeous"", whose favorite was whose, and beginning to understand that this was truly something special, something that I had never experienced before. Watch this movie, forget that they are The Beatles, turn off the songs, and you will see that it still holds up. That's how good it really is!"
"phillip_c_owens","10","10","15","2 December 2005"," A little masterpiece
","I was in high school in Australia when this movie was released in 1964. I was not a fan then, although I had heard of the Beatles and seen them on TV a few times. I did not become interested in music of any kind until after I first listened to ""Seargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" in 1967. Within three years I had seen all the Beatles films and heard every album and single and within 5 years I was playing electric guitar and electric bass and singing in a rock-and-roll band. Their records certainly had a profound influence on me.<br/><br/>Two hours ago, I saw ""A Hard Day's Night"" on Korean television forty-one years after this film was originally released in theatres. What a wonderful, joyous, charming, wacky piece of work. It was much much better than I remembered.<br/><br/>A day in the life of the Beatles was almost certainly nothing like the portrayal in this ""documentary-style"" film shot in black and white. Even in 1964 they were well into alcohol, amphetamines and girls, so naturally all that was cleaned out or up. After all, this movie was obviously produced as a marketing medium for their music and their personalities, and what a brilliant job of directing Dick Lester did to showcase both.<br/><br/>It is a cleverly crafted screenplay and an amazingly effective film considering none of the band could act. As their musical recording producer George Martin has said, ""I knew that their charm alone would sell them"", when he was talking about why he recorded them at EMI in the first place. This film clearly illustrates what he meant.<br/><br/>And of course the music in ""A Hard Days Night"" is stunning, not to mention the reaction of the young female audience. The professionalism and skills of the band are on clear exhibit, including Ringo's much deprecated but original and innovative drumming. The Beatles in full flight.<br/><br/>I love this movie and will be showing it to the kids a little after the eldest one reaches the age of ten.<br/><br/>A ground-breaking pop classic!"

"krumski","Null","15","26","1 December 2000"," Now let's get a few things straight. . .
","I am just about the biggest Beatles fan imaginable and so, axiomatically, I enjoy this movie very much. However, I think it's time to put to rest the notion of this being some kind of great film apart from its value as a keyhole onto to the Fabs' heyday. Let's face it, as pure moviemaking, this thing is a bit of a joke. The story, as such, is nonexistent, the pacing is flabby, and the ""Paul's grandfather"" subplot (which no one ever seems to mention in appraisals of the movie anymore, despite its taking up of a good deal of film time) is embarrassingly cheesy. On top of all that, the Beatles themselves are simply so hard to *understand* much of the time (Liverpool scouse being a very mumbled and slurred-together dialect) that quite a bit of the so-called sparkling wit just goes over (or under) your head the first three or four times you see it. Someone really should have sat the lads down with some Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello movies to teach them at least the rudiments of enunciation and comic timing.<br/><br/>As a story, it's very interesting how the film portrays the Beatles as prisoners of their own fame, with an unmistakable wisp of pathos and frustration which is allowed to undergird all the wildness and comedy. This especially comes through in the sequence where Ringo leaves the band to go ""parading"" and enjoy some freedom (an unconscious foreshadowing of future events to boot, as Ringo was the first Beatle to ever ""leave the band"" - four years later during the White Album sessions). Yet, the irony is never put forth that the very people who are keeping the Beatles prisoner - their fans - are the ones for whom this movie is made and is being aimed at. A decade later, such a disparity would have forced a punk band such as the Sex Pistols to fire off a massive ""F*** You!"" to its audience (and, in fact, one rock star did do just this - in film, no less: Roger Waters during the amazing and squirm-inducing ""In the Flesh"" segment of Pink Floyd The Wall, where a concert of mindlessly adoring fans is compared none too subtly with a Nazi rally).<br/><br/>I'm not saying, of course, that the Beatles should have come out spitting and gobbing at their fans and tearing apart their image in A Hard Day's Night. This would have been impossible to do in mainstream cinema in 1964, anyway. What I'm saying is that by introducing such a glaring irony and then failing to deal with it in any way, the film asserts itself solidly as a product of its times and nothing more - no great and enduring piece of art, certainly. In some ways, the next year's followup, Help!, was the better film because it did not try to be anything more than a madcap Beatle travelogue (and succeeded admirably, with its pristine color, beautiful locales, and clever comic moments - although its setups do get a bit monotonous after awhile).<br/><br/>Of course, A Hard Day's Night *will* endure - simply because THE BEATLES endure, and this gives us the best sustained look at their performing prowess and all-around joie de vivre. The musical sequences in the film are simply glorious, particularly the orgiastic concert at the end, but even more muted moments such as when the Beatles sneak off to a nightclub to dance and intermingle with other youths to the soundtrack of their own songs; the scene provides a wonderful ""you are there"" quality to the partying and club-hopping side of Swinging London circa 1964. But a film's overall quality, I say, must be judged by its ability to be a complete and satisfying whole, not just as a vehicle to show off the talents and charm of its central figure or figures (otherwise, by that measure, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective would have to be preserved and championed as one of America's greatest contributions to world cinema).<br/><br/>So what am I saying, finally? A Hard Day's Night - if you are a Beatle fan it is essential; see it, enjoy it, revel in their youth and vitality as often and as passionately as you want. Just don't allow your enthusiasm for the group to confuse this with a great film.<br/><br/>(btw: If you wish to experience the group's charm and musical euphoria of this time full on, without the intrusions of a tacked on plot or supplementary characters, check out the wonderful documentary ""The Beatles' First U.S. Visit"". Done by the Maysles brothers - the duo behind the Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" later in the decade - the film captures all the excitement [and footage] of the Beatles' triumphant arrival in America, including all their Ed Sullivan appearances, various backstage reflections and shenanigans, and an extended, supercharged sequence of their concert at Washington Coliseum. For my money, this film is even MORE essential than A Hard Day's Night; it is, quite simply, the best extended visual document of the Beatles that we have.)"

A day and a half in the life of the Fab Four (Paul McCartney , Ringo Starr , George Harrison and John Lennon offering a few welcome moments of his acerbic , dry wit) leading up to a studio , in flight from the fanatic fans , managers (Norman Rossington) , and televised concert gig . It starts with the known rock and roll band travelling from their home town of Liverpool to London to perform in a television broadcast . While Paul's Grandpa (Wilfred Brambell) serving as a linking device to connect scenes of the Beatles. Ringo however is arrested and still isn't in the studio half an hour before air time. Soaring in their first, full-length, hilarious, action-packed film! 6 exciting new songs! Their first full length hilarious, action-packed film. The greatest rock & roll comedy adventure .<br/><br/>The Fab Four's first movie is a joyous musical comedy through an ordinary ¨Day in the Life¨ of the Beatles, being their distinguished debut feature with an agreeable line in witty lunacy . Filmed in a pseudo-documentary style with great fair-play and noted as the first movie containing video-clips . Here the Beatles make like Max Sennett with a touch of Marx Brothers , including a paper-thin screenplay about difficulties with their manager and Paul's grandpa on the loose and delivering antics , craziness and mayhem . The boys seem to be constantly on the run and showing a lot of example of wry sense of humor , while escaping from their crazed fans and from their manager, who is constantly trying to rein them in. All 4 flopheads show a deft touch with throwaway joke here and there . The surrealist frames , slastick images and hilarious scenes are legion . The charming best scenes are a chaotic press conference , and a wild as well as wacky fling as the Beatles escape from it all for a few minutes in a field with likeable scenes filmed in relaxed music video style . The popular and wonderful group performs a dozen or so songs. And adding Wilfrid Brambell as Paul's unconventional grandfather who is available for additional comical relief, giving a very sympathetic acting along with Ringo Starr , as the band must rescue them from various misfortunes and misadventures .<br/><br/>
The motion picture was originally directed by Richard Lester providing attractive images in its own right , being filmed in his peculiar style coupled with typical surrealist comic touches , being well accompanied by a brilliant cinematography in black and white by Gilbert Taylor . Richard Lester's gimmicky camera-trickery , fast and slow-motion , jump-cuts and it has dated badly . At the beginning Lester directed various Beatles vehicles as ¨How I won the war¨, ¨Help¨ and subsequently made known comedies : ¨The knack¨ ¨A funny thing happened on the way to the room¨, ¨The Ritz¨, ¨The mouse on the moon¨, a satire : ¨The bed sitting room¨ , Adventures : ¨Royal Flash¨ , ¨Robin and Mariam¨, Western : ¨Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid : the early days¨, and drama : ¨Petulia¨ , ¨Cuba¨ . He got a big success with ¨The Three Musketeers¨ (1973), which he shot simultaneously with ¨The Four musketeers¨ (1974) for producer Ilya Salkind , resurrected his career . When the Salkinds (Ilya and his father Alexander Salkind) were in the midst of filming ¨Superman¨ (1978) simultaneously with its sequel, Lester was hired as a supervising producer, then took over the filming of the sequel, ¨Superman II¨ (1980), when original director Richard Donner was fired . The sequel was a financial and critical success , and he was hired to direct the far-less successful ¨Superman III¨ (1983). At the end of the 1980s, Lester returned to the storyline that had revitalized his career back in the early 1970s, filming a second sequel to ""The Three Musketeers"" titled : ¨The return of the musketeers¨ . However, after his close friend, actor Roy Kinnear died during the shooting , Lester seemed to lose heart with the movie-making business , he has not directed another film."

","A Hard Day's Night (1964)<br/><br/>I've loved the Beatles for as long as I can remember, and I love this movie because of that. I also really groove to the black and white photography, and Richard Lester's jittery, cutting edge camera style (influenced I suppose by the realistic films of Tony Richardson). The mix of mad cap energy and straight ahead songs is fun, and it goes places Elvis movies never did just for creativity and fun. The Beatles are way more edgy but they come off as not a bit jaded or spoiled, none of the bad-boy rocker stuff that gets old fast. In fact, A Hard Day's Night reminds you just how fresh and light the Beatles were in those first couple of years.<br/><br/>There, that is said. Now for the truth about the movie as a narrative film, which I think it has some vague idea it wants to be (music aside). It bumbles around and plays with old (even then) tricks of picking on the old fashioned Britons in a comic way. I sometimes found myself trying to let one scene lead to the next, and really that's not the idea. The happy zany inter- scenes between songs are just inventive, fun, craziness. That probably enough, but if you've seen the movie a couple times already like I have, or if you don't automatically like the Beatles enough just to watch them for who they are, you will probably find your mind drifting. Not that it's not exciting. It's just aimless excitement.<br/><br/>There, now that is said, too. So back to the start. What a fun, uplifting, non-conformist, sharp movie. Nice to see a genuine sense of humor are work, and a bunch of not-so-clean lads letting 'er rip."

","Right from the off, 'A Hard Day's Night' is a classic subversion of early 1960s society - even its pseudo-documentary style cleverly pokes fun at the rise of cinema verité. A fictionalised look at a typical day in the life of the Beatles, poised on the verge of super-stardom, it's a fast-paced, exuberant, carefree tale of four apparent innocent, everyday working-class lads from Liverpool abroad in the big scary capital, complete with one of the finest double acts ever in the form of managers Shake and Norm, and Paul's 'mixer' grandfather, in tow. The film rarely passes without a moment that makes you smile - being chased by screaming girls through the streets, arguing with a fellow train passenger, taking the mick out of the press - 'What do you call that hairstyle?' 'Arthur.' - and dancing around in fields like loons to the strains of 'Can't Buy Me Love'. John's triumphant declaration 'We're out!' embodies the spirit of the movie - and indeed, the entire decade - in two simple words. It's a tribute to celebrating your uniqueness and living life your way, and I utterly defy you not to adore this film. If you've had a bad day, put this on and 84 minutes later you'll be smiling from ear to ear."

","A study of a day in the life of a mega-popular UK rock band in 1964, ""A Hard Day's Night"" does nothing to disguise its performers: they may be playing characters, but they're the Beatles.<br/><br/>This is essentially just a movie that follows them around as they lead a day of their ""ordinary"" lives - packed with raving female fans, musical jam sessions, and comic mishaps.<br/><br/>This isn't as ""great"" as some people (mainly Beatles fanatics) would lead you to believe -- if it weren't for the Beatles' presence, nobody would even be watching it. I'm not saying it's a poor film -- I'm saying without their presence, it wouldn't be as engaging or interesting because it would just be watching actors playing musicians.

In January, 1964, I saw a clip on the Jack Paar show. It was unbelievable! The Beatles were going wild! Girls were screaming and throwing jelly beans! It was The Beatles' sound. It was the long hair! I started letting my hair grow that night. Beatle records flowed into America. The Beatles revived the rock & roll of the late 1950s, the fire. John Lennon sang Chuck Berry. Paul McCartney sang Little Richard. They took it to a new level. They had their own songs, incredible songs! They filled albums! Cousin Larry and I saw A Hard Day's Night in August, 1964. The theater was packed with teenage girls. They screamed for 90 minutes! We could not hear one word of the dialogue. It did not matter. This was Beatlemania, and there would never be anything like it again! ""You Can't Do That"" was cut from the film. It was my favorite. John Lennon's jealousy and possessiveness were too potent for the young audience. His primal scream at the start of the solo says it all."

","Well admittedly I'm a Beatle fan but I think this is an important enough film that should at least be in the ""top 200"" on IMDB.  Especially since Gladiator is, what, #60?  Richard Lester is a great director, the Liverpudlian script by Alun Owen is very suitable for the boys and seems like ad-libs.  Also the black & white film format is perfect although supposedly it was done for monetary and not artistic reasons.  If there's any flaw perhaps it drags a bit at the ""concert"" scene at the end (see if you can spot a child Phil Collins in the audience).<br/><br/>This was the first teenage exploitation film to be far more than just a vehicle for some hit songs; although there are plenty of hits to go around. By today's ""N'Sync"" and ""Brittany Spears"" standards The Beatles in this movie are practically avant-garde with a little help from Lester & Owen. <br/><br/>
This is the best Beatle film; in ""Help"" they are basically just stoned on pot the whole time with a terrible plot & characters, and ""Yellow Submarine"" they hardly had any input other than some leftover songs.  And the less said about the ""Get Back/Let It Be"" project and ""Magical Mystery Tour"" the better."

","As an Englishman or at least part English/ Irish man this film evokes memories not only of the Beatles but also of the sights and sounds from that era. In some ways it almost brings to mind the smells as well. Buildings/ streets that no longer exist. I love Norman Rossingtons attempts to open a milk carton from a machine because I can remember how difficult they were and also getting milk over my jacket when trying the same thing myself. Hard Days Night works even though it is contrived because it allows non actors (The Beatles) to play to their individual strengths. Ringo stands out but don't forget John who although he recognised their inability to act managed to add his own persona quite naturally with many comments being ad-lib. John contributed the lions share of the tunes but as a group it reflects their talents and the simplicity of a now lost era. This remains an uncomplicated film that fall very naturally under my heading of ""Simply enjoy""."

","It is very hard not to like this movie if you're a Beatle fan. Filled with the youthful exuberance of the Fab Four, it zips through a long working day of Beatlemania as the lads dodge screaming hordes of female fans while traveling to make a live TV appearance. It has all of the innocent fun that made the pre-Yoko Beatles the most popular group in music history. John, for instance, is a sardonic boyish wag with none of the acrimonious, world-weariness that characterized his appearances with the later Beatles. And Ringo is an innocent abroad who runs afoul of the law, setting up the movie's erstwhile story line of freeing him from the clutches of the police in time for the broadcast. <br/><br/>Great, silly, charming and timeless fun."

He was helped immeasurably by a strong script from Liverpudlian Alun Owen which captured the essence of the public face of The Beatles, and a strong supporting cast. The Beatles themselves, of course, were at the heart of the film's success: despite the fact that they weren't always able to hide their inexperience as actors, their sheer force of personality carried the day.

","Well, not like ""Dr. Strangelove"" was that same year. But, for a 15 year old in 1964 Midwest America, the confident cheekiness of the band towards their elders (and betters) was an eye-opener.<br/><br/>Prime example is Ringo's response to the well heeled businessman who reminded him that ""I fought the war for your sort."" Ringo's reply still echoes: ""I'll bet you're sorry you won!"" There's plenty more of that throughout the film in nearly every vignette. Even Paul's ""grandfather"" is something of a rebel causing his own brand of trouble for staff and officialdom alike. <br/><br/>Like so much of what the Beatles did, said and produced, HDN was and remains a template for what came after. A fine film that still appears less dated than it looks. As for the they-can't-act knock, the band admitted as much early and often.

","""A Hard Day's Night"" was filmed in early 1964 when Beatlemania was still in its relatively early stages. In the film the Beatles play themselves as they go through a typical 'day in the life', as it were.<br/><br/>Though the boys had no previous acting experience they managed to do an admirable job of playing themselves here. That is, their on-screen personae seem to capture the appeal that made them successful entertainers off the screen. Apart from the Beatles the acting is pretty decent but nothing to get too excited about.<br/><br/>While entertaining, the script is fairly inconsequential but that's not necessarily a drawback. The film's main strength is it's soundtrack, which prominently features about a dozen Beatles tunes, including the title track and ""Can't Buy Me Love"".

There isn't much of a plot - just a series of vignettes that appear spontaneous and unscripted. Lester, making only his second feature film, uses a hand-held camera much of the time, conveying a sense of urgency. It still feels fresh four decades later and is a precursor to the music videos that became popular two decades later. John, Paul, George, and Ringo show themselves to be natural actors.

","This clever, fast-paced movie, made in 1964, came soon after the eruption of Beatlemania and brings to the screen the humour, the hijinks and sheer energy of the group. The music is singable and danceable and the ballads are great for listening. There is no let-up in the action which has no particular story but follows one frenetic day in the life of the early Beatles. There is great comedic talent in Wilfred Brimble, Paul McCartney's grandfather, an eccentric character who has great fun as he goes along for the ride. There are great close-up shots of Paul, John, George and Ringo. We somehow feel that the photographer has a soft side for Ringo, who can go from mournful frown to winning smile. We see the four trying to escape the mad crowds of fawning admirers as they go from train to car and from one stop to another. The action is spontaneous and seems to move seamlessly because of the great camera work.<br/><br/>One of my attractions to this movie is that these are the Beatles I first remember but it also reminded me that they would go on to accomplish much more. This was before many of their classic albums, like Rubber Soul, Sergeant Pepper, Abbey Road and the White Album. With each of these advances, there was more and more great music. John Lennon implied how the early period was just fluff and the real creativity came later on. My own view is that their music evolved over time. The early music is one great chapter with several others to follow in the relatively short span that the group was together."

","No one can truly call themselves a Beatles fan without watching this movie. While there really isn't a plot, it's very funny. The jokes are random but still flow nicely so you don't feel lost. The train ride, for example, is full of randomness (ie: John sniffing the Coke bottle, the boys messing with the man who sits in their compartment) as are the interviews they're giving. You can tell that they all have wonderful senses of humor (many of the shots had to be re-shot because they wouldn't stop joking around and changing the lines like when John said ""I declare this bridge open"" he kept change bridge to something else). The accents can be hard to understand,especially George's, but all you really have to do is pay close attention. Since I'm way too young to have been able to go to one of The Beatles' concerts (which, honestly, is a good thing considering you couldn't hear over the screaming girls), this and watching old episodes of The Ed Sullivan Show are the closest I'll ever get. A Hard Days Night is a classic comedy that every Beatles fan should see."

","By 1964 The Beatles were a huge phenomenon. Already the focus of international obsession, it seemed logical that a feature film would be the way to go. It was not uncommon for musical acts, and pop groups to enter into the world of the big screen to enhance their careers. Instead of musical glamour and romanticised story lines, director Dick Lester and producer Walter Shenson, together with Alun Owen who wrote the screenplay, set out to construct an expose of the culture of the world in which The Beatles lived. The object was to show reality, to document what the lives of the Fab Four were like, albeit lightheartedly. The sense of realism established in Lester's film achieves an important target: The Beatles are playing themselves, and unlike their second feature film, Help! also directed by Richard Lester in 1965, has a plausible and likely plot line. As well as being fictional, A Hard Day's Night could be a straight documentary, revealing intimate character traits of each Beatle. Lennon appears clownish, caustic and cynically sarcastic; McCartney, good natured and playful; Harrison as quietly witty and Ringo appears vulnerable and cute, and all four possess and display with terrific ability the quick, Liverpudlian wit and humour which they became so well known for. Increasing this sense of a realistic setting is Lester's revolutionary behind-the-scenes approach. The result is a humorous and interesting film which revolutionised the landscape of modern cinema. An absolute must whether you are a Beatles fan or not."

","Although our MTV-brainwashed world is too busy foisting off all the latest mindless drivel in pop music, and classic rock somehow only seems to involve the Stones, the Who, or Led Zeppelin, the fact is- The Beatles were the greatest rock band ever. No other rock band in the history of music changed the world in such dramatic fashion. Sure, Elvis brought rock to the forefront as an entertainment, but people often forget that rock almost died in the 1960-1962 era of payola scandals and Dick Clark teen idols. True American rock had to be re-invented and The Beatles were the geniuses behind it. Their influence in the recording industry in all fields as well as ability to write amazing rock and pop songs is unparalleled in a career that, on the world's stage, lasted just 7 years (1963-1970). <br/><br/>The movie ""A Hard Day's Night"" is a fictional ""day in the life"" pseudo-documentary of a band called ""The Beatles."" The four lads play streotypes of themselves, but among all of them, they felt it was a fairly accurate portrayal of their lives at that stage. Filmed just as Beatlemania exploded on the world stage, the freshness and innocence of the early days, before the screaming and insane attention drove the Band to quit touring and to eventually split up. However, to the astute, a hint of the real darker days to come is also well portrayed in the almost constant claustrophobic settings within the movie.<br/><br/>The plot centers on the band having to get to a TV studio for a required performance (this is before videos and lip-syncing... bands actually would do live performances for radio, TV, and then have shows in the evening every night somewhere). Surrounded by a storm of media attention, crazed fans, crazier directors and managers, the 4 lads try to find a bit of freedom from it all. Within all that, Paul's mischievous grandfather, tagging along to get out of the house, does his best to rile everyone up and create havoc. Eventually, Ringo gets caught for ""malicious wandering"" and has to be freed from the jail in time for the show. Unlike any ""rock band"" movie before or since, the members of the band act, follow a very thorough and humorous plot, and there aren't, for the most part, bizarre excuses to break into a song out of the blue. The songs are introduced as part of the storyline (rehearsing, run-throughs, passing time on a train), rather than suddenly bursting into song like in the Elvis movies. The camera work and editing are first-rate, considering this was considered a low-budget movie in its time. Alun Owens (screenplay) and Richard Lester (director) also so a wonderful job catching the manic storm The Beatles were already trapped in. Almost every scene is shot in a tight room... on a train, in rooms in a studio, a small cafe, etc... This hinted claustrophobia, especially in black and white, really points at the world the Beatles were going to spend the next 3 years in. Paul's grandfather (played by Wilfred Brambell wonderfully) makes a speech, comic in its delivery, but deeply revealing in its context... he is complaining that he was supposed to be out getting fresh air, but by being with the Beatles, he's been nowhere but ""in a train and a room, a hotel and a room, and a room and a room."" This movie is a classic and captures a point in time just as socially significant as Kennedy, the moon landing, etc. While time has made it seem that The Beatles and their contemporaries such as the Stones and The Who were on equal footing, those of the time know that the Beatles were in a league of their own, above and beyond all the others. The Beatles led and the others, even in feigned defiance of the popularity of The Beatles, merely took what the Beatles did and copied it, mocked it, or exaggerated it for their own success.<br/><br/>A Hard Day's Night stands alone as a movie of a rock band starring a rock band and has no equal to this day."

This charming, funny, and frenetic film will take you back to 1964 and will let you relive the first, glorious, and innocent days of Beatlemania.<br/><br/>It's important to remember that many critics in the entertainment business believed that the Beatles' popularity would be over by the end of 1964. The film was given a miserly budget and a very tight shooting schedule, and was seen by some as just another ""teen"" movie of the 1960s. The plot: two days on tour with the group, replete with screaming fans, electrifying music, and all the shenanigans of youth. Paul's grandfather (played with great style by Wilfrid Brambell) provides an amusing subplot, as the old guy is always getting into trouble.<br/><br/>Great script by Alun Owen, along with wonderful, creative direction by Richard Lester, and the timeless music and charm of the Beatles themselves, make this film a true classic movie experience.

","You know em, you love em, cant get enough of em (depending on the voracity of the particular fan, current or nostalgic), the Beatles are two things at once: a nifty rhythm and blues band that can play (at least in this 'Fab-Four' early era) all sorts of cool three-minute songs dedicated to loving this or that girl, lamenting some loss, and solid blues and rock standards. And they're also a pop phenomenon that unlike boy bands or other pop acts of today aren't made from conglomerated formations. The brilliance of Hard Day's Night is that director Richard Lester takes on the Beatles phenomenon for what it is, makes it an exuberant feast of rock and fun and screaming girls, and at the same time makes of the funniest British comedies of the last fifty years. He mixes documentary style with some of the New Wave techniques from France and elsewhere with a zany rhythm that is distinctly his own. Lester's next Beatles film, Help!, might have more laughs per capita, but it's this film that marks him as something of a minor genius.<br/><br/>There isn't much need for plot, and it's a good thing too- plot, unless if it's the kind from Help!, gets in the way of the Beatles natural riffs and jabs and of course the music. It follows one day in the life of the Beatles as they escape from hordes of screaming pre-teen/teen girls, gear up and practice for their upcoming show, and bits of wackiness in-between. Most of this involves Paul's grandfather (played in such a fine toss-up between deadpan and insane/senile by Wilford Brammell), who wanders off or tempts Ringo with the ideals of ""parading"" instead of drumming and reading, or just minor technical issues with the Beatles' managers and organizers of the event. There's no nonsensical plot to thrust our stars into like with Elvis; it's if anything probably closer to the madness of that time and place for them than anything else (i.e. the press room, where, according to the Beatles Anthology documentary, THOSE kinds of questions really were asked).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, as Lester delivers some usually clear-cut scenes edited without much fuss or muss he also digs into creating Hard Day's Night as a fantasy mixed with this strange reality of Beatle-mania. Seeing the Can't Buy Me Love scene, in its own rough-hewed way, is as joyous as anything in Signin' in the Rain. And then it shifts to being funny while also going for an underlying sense of loneliness with these guys, like Ringo's walk along the riverside contemplating what to do with himself. And then there's just general hilarity that more than likely inspired Monty Python, like when George is thrust into a questionnaire about fashion, or just getting a crazy look at John in the bathtub. And let's not forget the music... OK, lets. Seriously, even if it's not your favorite period of Beatles music (and, for me, they would hit their peak and run with it two years later with Rubber Soul and Revolver), it's still a gas to see them play and enjoy themselves all the while doing it. They don't over-do their theatricality like bands of today, and they never look like ""oh, it's just another gig."" On stage, as with the film itself, energy rollicks it all the way through. You want your classic Beatles, here it is, packaged like a a crispy and nutty chocolate bar of rock and 60s hipness. A+"

Lester manages to establish four distinct characters (Ringo as goofy, John as a wise guy almost the Bugs Bunny of the movie, Paul as sweet and George as hard and blank) while using the thinnest of plots to explore the circus that was this group's life.<br/><br/>The Beatles were gods in 1964 (not just another pop group as someone, obviously too young to know stated in another review, sorry to play the age card) and Lester, with their enthusiastic help, cut through the crap and managed to show four young human beings riding waves insanity and to reflect that insanity in a joyful and creative mÃ©lange of film."

","I was looking for movies at the library when I came across this movie. I've liked The Beatles since I saw 'I am Sam', about 2 years ago. It was nice to see them young, and a little weird to see all those screaming girls! A little odd..But this movie is amazing, a 'typical' day for a 'mocker' seemed stressful. But overall, I really loved this...Totally drool-worthy. i cant understand why the director shot it in black and white. He was American wasn't he? And our movies were in color then weren't they??? Anyway, the plot was good, and GrandDad was really funny. And Ringo was (still is, isn't his band called The Boys or something?) and amazing drummer...and I liked the way he danced. The guys said a lot of funny things..I love quoting them! 'Orgy!!'"

","The Beatles finest moment on film, hella yes? Yes. I never get tired of watching this movie. Although I feel sometimes that the acting could have seemed a bit more natural (i'm looking at you Paul) overall they actually did a fab job of pretending to be actors and then pretending to be themselves...wow it is kind of complicated isn't it? They're themselves pretending to be actors and then try to pretend to be themselves and in doing so try not to look like they're acting. Anyway, the music of course is what makes this movie such a great experience, the great writing is of course important too, but it wouldn't be the same without ""if I fell"" and ""I should have known better"". From beginning to end The Beatles are charming and hilarious and that's what I did over my summer vacation."

","The combination of music, visuals and screen writing make this a nearly perfect film. Especially if you're a Beatles fan. But even if you're not, this film captures a moment in time, a moment in history, musical history that's worth watching every frame. The screen writing for each of the Beatles, John, Paul, George, and Ringo is so enjoyable and entertaining and indelible. One forgets that these are not actors, but four guys from Liverpool with an innate ability to communicate via music and acting. (When Lennon passes a bevy of showgirls backstage and turns to his manager and says, ""Please, sir, can I have one to serve me, sir?"" always makes me laugh.<br/><br/>Brilliant!) <br/><br/>And the music. What can one say about the Beatles' music that hasn't been said? A HARD DAY'S NIGHT captures them early in their career; fresh, brash, and brilliant.

","A look at the life of the top 1960's pop group, ""The Beatles"", on tour in 1964. Including how Ringo feels unnoticed compared to the others, Paul having to contend with his trouble making grandfather who is always stirring up trouble and contending with their manager Norm who frowns at their behaviour yet can't do without them at the same time.<br/><br/>During the 1960's, there was numerous pop films hitting our cinemas, but very few have stood the test of time like ""A Hard Day's Night"". The film includes plenty of the band's best music including two number one hit singles of the year, the title song and ""Can't Buy Me Love"". In most other pop movies of that era, many of them had songs which were written especially for the film, but all too often these were poor and didn't live up to the artists' hits. The boys also took to the film extremely well with their own unique brand of caddish wit. The script by Alan Owen is stronger than one would expect for this sort of thing and a better than average director in Richard Lester was chosen to direct the picture. Good supporting cast includes Wilfred (""Steptoe And Son"") Brambell as Paul's grandfather. In the mid-1990's, ""The Spice Girls"", were being hyped as the female equivalent of the fab four but they lasted less than half the time that the boys did before they finally disbanded in 1970. The girls released their own film in 1997, ""Spiceworld: The Movie"", which attempted to copy ""A Hard Day's Night"", but it failed miserably and it failed to exploit their music to the same degree that the former did. In common with the girls themselves, I am extremely doubtful that ""Spiceworld"" will achieve the classic status that ""A Hard Day's Night"" has in the past forty years since it was first released and also I doubt if the ""Spice Girls"" will be remembered to the same degree that the fab four are in forty years time."

George Harrison has his part , putting down the soon to be ""so called"" hip new cool shirts. Lennon always great with the quick wit,and he really lets it shines in this flick. Ringo is a natural.

They were the first great Rock-n-Roll band, Band. No one star, a real team effort. The Beatle were a real class act, no filler.<br/><br/>Remember this was it. Before Hard Days Night there were a few flicks with Little Richard, Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee playing their hits. Their music was an extra, but side attraction. Hard Days Night was different. A real movie with their music, as the star, the main attraction not as a second thought or just added in.<br/><br/>See this movie and come close to reliving one great part of the 60's.

That's it.<br/><br/>This is THE real and only Beatles movie, for me. ""Help!"" (made one year later) makes a step further. We have the Beatles in Technicolor but the film is not as spontaneous as the previous, furthermore the story is silly. ""Magical Mystery Tour"" is a long musical clip made for TV in '67 -it can't be considered as a movie-; ""Yellow Submarine"" is a cartoon -apart from the soundtrack the Beatles weren't involved in that project-.

Of course, you know that if it`s the Beatles, there`s going to be music (despite the fact that they`re only miming along to the soundtrack). My only problem was they re-used a few songs in the end sequence. Of course, they could only use songs from the soundtrack and it would be wrong to expect John and Paul to write that many songs for the one album. Overall,this film is a brillant masterpiece that I can`t wait to see again.

I imagine the DVD with 5.1 surround sound makes this even that much better!<br/><br/>The story is really nothing but showing the Beatles traveling to do a concert and quirky behind-the-scenes goings-on.

The movie also features a side plot about Ringo running away. Of course what makes this music stand is the music, including ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""Hard Day's Night"", ""I'm just happy to dance with you"" and my personal favorite ""I should have known better.""

","Along with Michael Wadleigh's `Woodstock: Three Days Of Peace & Love' and Dennis Hopper's `Easy Rider', Richard Lester's `A Hard Day's Night' seem to personify the `right place at the right time' merging of film and music in the Sixties. `A Hard Day's Night' is probably the most important of these films, coming as it does with Beatlemania still swelling to uncharted heights and Lester capturing it in a verite style that lends an immediacy to what at the time could still be construed as merely a happy accident. Lester's innovation is assisted by Alun Owen's snappy screenplay (apart from some flights of fancy, it's remarkably realistic), the gracious charm of the Beatles themselves and John Jympson's tight, sophisticated editing. This film is the blueprint for the music video genre and is a spectacular piece of work that refuses to ever get tiresome."

The other 'Beatle' movies like ""Help""(1965),and ""Yellow Submarine""(1968) and the documentary ""Let It Be""(1970) were pretty good,but out of all of them it can't touch the electricity of ""A Hard Day's Night"".

Everything in 'A Hard Day's Night' is so well balanced - there's nothing too much, nothing too less and the songs play in perfect order at the very best spot.<br/><br/>Everything that Elvis Presley failed to do in his movies worked well with the Beatles. There are no endless amount of romances with women who look like our mothers but just hysterical girls and cool looking young lads who play music from probably their nicest sounding album A Hard Days Night, plus a couple of their older tunes.<br/><br/>It is really cool to see a rock'n roll or pop movie where everything works so well. You will even remember those supporting actors which in other rock films become just victims of mega-rock stars hubris, but in 'A Hard Days Night' even an Irish grandfather gets a couple of memorable one-liners that does not question the Beatles' stardom.

Yes, it's cool to see the young Beatles and get a glimpse of their personalities - however manufactured for the film they may be. It's neat to see '60's London, the fashions and dance styles of the time. The music is impeccable.<br/><br/>The rest of it is just kind of blah.

","Directed by Richard Lester and written by Alun Owen, ""A Hard Day's Night"" is a musical comedy starring the Beatles at the initial explosion of 'Beatlemania.' The movie focuses on several days in the lives of the members while in England, including recording music and a concert at the end with the requisite screaming pubescent girls.<br/><br/>While the Beatles were before my time, they were indeed great. There was something about the chemistry of the members that produced catchy hit after hit during their decade together from 1960-1970. When ""A Hard Day's Night"" (the movie) was released in the summer of '64, simultaneously with the album of the same name, they had only three albums of material released in two years, 1963-1964. The producers wanted to get a movie out before their popularity waned, like practically every other pop rock artist or group. But their fame was not to decline, as their appeal spread to young and older alike. They would release four more movies before breaking up, if you include the animated ""Yellow Submarine."" <br/><br/>""A Hard Day's Night"" is considered a cult movie, and I can see why. It captures the group while they're not much more than kids, still in shock about their skyrocketing success. The best parts, of course, are the music numbers, which play like what would later become known as music videos. Seriously, any time one of their hooky ditties starts playing your attention perks up and your feet & hands start moving in delight. It's the in between scenes that are problematic. You might enjoy these sequences more than me if you're enamored by the members. I'm not; I just like their music. I suppose it doesn't help that these episodes are plagued by mumbling dialogue with the corresponding English accent, not to mention British humor from the time period that I mostly don't 'get.' <br/><br/>The film runs 87 minutes and was shot entirely in England.<br/><br/>GRADE: B-"

","I've never really been a fan of the Beatles. This is not to say that I don't enjoy their music, but I'd simply never been exposed to much of it. However, in the past year, I'd started to listen to many of their songs, and I instantly understood why they were so popular. Back in 1964, the band's growing popularity had spawned numerous best-selling albums, and the next step was a natural one - a Beatles movie. And so 'A Hard Day's Night' was born.<br/><br/>This modest-budgeted 1964 black-and-white film allegedly documents a ""typical"" day in the life of the Beatles. Whilst I'm aware that much of it was greatly exaggerated and dramatised for its portrayal on screen, I'm fairly certain that one thing has remained fairly accurate - the vast hoards of incessantly screaming teenage female fans who flock around the four performers, either during performances or in public. At the height of Beatlemania, I wouldn't be surprised if such scenes actually occurred on a regular basis.<br/><br/>The four young actors of the band, who I, quite obviously, don't need to name, are not the most talented of actors, but they perform adequately. The screenplay simply calls for them to act as themselves, and this they do quite well. Norman Rossington is good as Norm - the Beatles' manager - and Wilfrid Brambell is hilarious as Paul McCartney's ""other grandfather,"" who has joined the band's travels for a ""change of scenery."" 'A Hard Day's Life' is an interesting little film, full of moments of joy and laughter and drama - and let us not forget the excellent soundtrack of (you guessed it) Beatles songs! It is not, in any real way, a groundbreaking film, though I've heard that the performance scenes greatly influenced how music videos were filmed at the time.<br/><br/>However, if, like me, you were unfortunate enough to have missed out on the 1960s, and you've been wondering why the Beatles were as big as they were, this is your definitive answer!"

","'A Hard Day's Night' is an excellent Beatlemania documentary, showing an important piece of history in music. The film is not a traditional documentary, but it is a non-traditional documentary in the sense that it portrays the life of the Beatles at the height of Beatlemania. One of the most excellent aspects of the film is the excellent and artistic cinematography; director Richard Lester knew how to capture engaging moments to prevent this film from becoming dull and unengaging. The scene with the Beatles in the playing field (shot in one day from helicopter) is one of the most memorable scenes.<br/><br/>The humour in the film is done well, and it captures the individual personalities of the Beatles and the problems that they had with the media interfering in their lives - which is an important and unavoidable part. The best acting in this film was done by Ringo. The film captures his loneliness and loss of feeling of unacceptance. The scene where he walks down by the river after taking photographs is touching and acted out very well; it is easy to feel sympathy.<br/><br/>The music on 'A Hard Day's Night' album is also among the best that the Beatles performed, and there are several excellent film clips throughout the film that make this a historical music documentary.<br/><br/>It's thoroughly an enjoyable film packed with humour, rich cinematography, and excellent music. The only downfall of the film is that it moves rather slowly in some places; the cinematography and the music help bring it back into focus, but the script is not as engaging and it would fail as a story on its own. It is a must-see for Beatles fans and music enthusiasts. This film should be shown in music history classes. It is an excellent insight into the successful career of the Beatles."

The boys are very good at delivering some unusually funny scripted nonsense. Here they're almost restructured as the Marx brothers and the transformation is a pleasure.<br/><br/>This movie is the kind of reminder Hollywood needs every once in a while that CGI, explosions, forced thrills, luscious eye-popping color cinematography and conventional thinking are all markedly less interesting than simple dry wit and honest effort. It's the film equivalent of the White Stripes; stripping a format down to it's essentials and sounding like a revelation. <br/><br/>Only the standard straight boy bugaboo (terror of an effete man - Here, a TV producer) is stale. It's here the movie begins to lose some steam. And Lennon, apparently lacking charm, is a too desperate for laughs and tries too hard.<br/><br/>But even after all these years the movie feels fresh and unforced. You do not have to like the Beatles (I'm indifferent) to really enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>It's a trifle, but it's fricking terrific."

","A Hard Day's Night is a largely plotless romp with the Beatles telling jokes and running around. It's also a hugely influential work by Richard Lester that brought New Wave ideas into a more entertaining framework and created much of the grammar for future music videos. The film represents one of the few times a rock band movie had a genuinely talented director in charge, and it's a must-see for anyone who likes the Beatles or is interested in film history.<br/><br/>Filmed in a pseudo-documentary style, not much happens. Paul's uncle gets in trouble, Ringo gets out of sorts, and girls scream. The Beatles' Liverpool accents and breezy personas were unusual in films of the time, and while you can't necessarily say any of them can act except Ringo, they are utterly charming.<br/><br/>A youth-against-the-man theme runs throughout the movie, starting with an encounter with an obnoxious train passenger (who is probably in the right) and reaching its apex in the movie's best scene, where George gently mocks a corporate trend manipulator.<br/><br/>The songs are, of course, wonderful. Some musical numbers are little more than the Beatles sitting and playing, but the opening of Hard Day's Night is an extended chase and Can't Buy Me Love is a lot of joyful hijinks that is a classic of its kind.<br/><br/>The weakest part of the movie is the last section, in which the Beatles perform in a studio before an audience of screaming girls. The hysteria is somewhat entertaining, but for the most part this is just the Beatles performing songs that were already played earlier in the movie.<br/><br/>If you like this movie, check out other Richard Lester films like The Knack and How to Get It."

I'm one of the biggest Beatle fans in the whole universe, and this movie HAD to appear in my list. Because it's not a perfect movie, but it's still great. Funny story, good soundtrack, very good cinematography, and the Beatles are just...... Well, they're not good actors, but they're still the best part in the whole damn film. I have to say that I think this movie is very underrated. I have seen it in 'Movies Before you Die' books many times, but I think it has to be mentioned in more books about movies or stuff like that. Because it also is a very iconic film. It was very succesful and it shook the world when it came out. And it's still loved by many people (like me). I'm not gonna say anything about Help! (1965), because it isn't a very good movie. The same happens with Magical Mystery Tour (1967). But Yellow Submarine (1968) is, in my opinion, as great as A Hard Day's Night. They're different, but when it comes to Beatles movies, they're the greatest ones. I'm not mentioning Let It Be (1970) because it's a documentary. Anyway, AHDN is a great film, and I think it should be more considered. What else can I say? A must-see film."

"Desertman84","10","1","1","15 September 2012"," Dated But Still A Great Musical Movie
","A Hard Day's Night is a British black-and-white comedy film directed by Richard Lester that features the The Beatles — John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr — at the height of Beatlemania. It was written by Alun Owen. The film was made in the style of a mockumentary, describing a couple of days in the lives of the group.<br/><br/>Using a variety of techniques cribbed from Hollywood slapstick comedies, the French ""new wave"" movement, and his own experiences as a TV- commercial director, Lester fashioned an exhilarating study of a ""typical"" 36 hours in the lives of the Fab Four. Onto a plot about getting to the Big Show on time are hung a series of instant-reaction gags, character vignettes, and musical setpieces. Much of the humor arises from Paul McCartney's efforts to keep his grandfather, a ""clean old man,"" from getting into mischief. Also good for several laughs is the hookey-playing Ringo Starr, whose mistimed declaration of independence lands him in jail. We are also treated to a war of nerves between the unflappable John Lennon and an uptight TV director, who worries that, should the Beatles not show up at broadcast time, he'll be demoted to ""News In Welsh."" George Harrison stars in a sequence in which he is mistaken for an auditionee by the producer of a superficially trendy, teen-oriented TV weekly. Then there's Norman Rossington and John Junkin as The Beatles' managers, who carry on a battle royale simply because one man is taller than the other. The supporting cast includes comedienne Anna Quayle, cartoonist Bob Godfrey, TV host Robin Ray, dancer Lionel Blair, Harrison's future wife Patti Boyd, and director Lester himself. The songs include ""I Should Have Known Better,"" ""And I Love Her,"" ""Tell Me Why,"" ""If I Fell,"" ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" and the title song,""A Hard Day's Night"".<br/><br/>This humorous mockumentary of the Beatles had a huge impact, forever changing the definition and limits of the musical movie genre for it captures the Beatles when they still looked like they were having fun, back before drugs and psychedelia and Yoko Ono took effect.The result still seems fresh and different decades later."
"JamesHitchcock","8","1","1","27 August 2008"," The Beatles in their Springtime
","""A Hard Day's Night"" (a title based on a remark once made by Ringo) was made to cash in on Beatlemania while it was still in its early days. The film's plot, such as it is, concerns the group catching a train to London where they are due to take part in a live TV broadcast. They are accompanied on their trip by Paul's elderly grandfather, and are constantly pursued by screaming girls (something, of course, which frequently happened to the Beatles in real life). There is some consternation when Ringo goes missing, and ends up getting arrested, after Paul's grandfather suggests that he should get out and enjoy himself more, but all ends happily and he makes it back to the studio in time. <br/><br/>The role of the old man is played by Wilfrid Brambell, an actor today best remembered for his role in the television sitcom ""Steptoe and Son"", in which he played Albert Steptoe, an elderly rag-and-bone man. In that series Albert was constantly referred to by his son Harold as a ""dirty old man""; hence the many references in the film to Brambell being a ""very clean old man"". In reality Brambell was only in his early fifties at the time, considerably younger than the characters he played both in the film and the TV series. <br/><br/>The film was, of course, a great commercial success; given the enormous popularity of the Beatles at the time it could hardly have been otherwise, especially as it features many of their best-loved hits from this period. It was also critically well received at the time, and has continued to receive praise from the critics, largely because of its influence on later films. Leslie Halliwell credited the film with ""leading directly to all the kaleidoscopic swinging London spy thrillers and comedies of the later sixties"". Roger Ebert stated that its director, Richard Lester, had created a ""new grammar"" of film because of its apparently spontaneous, mock-documentary style. Lester would go on to become a major Hollywood director; he also directed the Beatles' second film, ""Help!"".<br/><br/>The trouble with ground-breaking films is that, with the passage of time, they can come to seem of limited interest to all except cultural historians and obsessive film buffs. What does ""A Hard Day's Night"" have to interest the general viewer more than four decades after it was made? <br/><br/>The look of the film seems very dated today. Halliwell's comment has always struck me as being wide of the mark, as ""kaleidoscopic"" is not the first adjective that comes to mind to describe a black-and-white movie. I cannot see any obvious influence that ""A Hard Day's Night"" might have had on the likes of, say ""Blow-Up"" or ""The Ipcress File"". The film's improvisatory look probably had less to do with any deliberate attempt to create a ""new grammar"" than with the need to make the film as quickly and cheaply as possible to cash in on the lucrative Beatles fan market. <br/><br/>None of the Beatles nurtured serious acting ambitions, although Ringo was later to give a good performance in ""That'll Be the Day"". After making his only non-Beatles film, ""How I Won the War"" (also directed by Lester), John Lennon was to brand acting a ""silly"" profession. Here, however, the Fab Four are all essentially playing themselves in roles which call for naturalness rather than sophisticated acting techniques, and all four come across as both likable and amusing. The script is, for the most part, not great, and the comedy is fairly inconsequential, although there are some occasionally sharply witty parts that stand out. I particularly liked the scene where George is being interviewed by that dreadful phoney TV producer, and puts him firmly in his place. This exchange may have been motivated by a concern that the youth culture of the sixties was being deliberately manipulated for financial reasons. (It is also said by some to contain the earliest recorded use of the word ""grotty""). I also liked the strangely poetic scene where Ringo is wandering by the canal. <br/><br/>What the film does have for the modern viewer is some wonderful music. In 1964 ""Sergeant Pepper"" and the band's other more innovative work still lay in the future, as did long hair, psychedelia, drug experiments and transcendental meditation. The Beatles were not yet a four-man cultural revolution; they were just four ordinary Liverpool lads with an extraordinary musical talent, producing some of the most wonderful, melodic, heart-lifting love songs ever written. We do, of course, get to hear a number of these; not just the title song but also ""She Loves You"", ""I Wanna be Your Man"", ""All My Loving"", and several others. (I know any serious Beatles fan will have all these in his or her music collection, but it's still worth hearing them in another context). As a comedy the film deserves perhaps 5/10; as a record of what Ebert aptly called the Beatles' ""lovely springtime"" that rises to 8/10."

The Beatles clearly didn't give a toss about the result and they didn't try to conceal themselves behind a meaningless plot, they sat on top of it.<br/><br/>If anyone wanted to know when the Sixties started to swing, I'd say it was at the point early in this film where they are in a press reception and a journalist asks John 'How did you find America?' - his response 'Turn left at Greenland!'. That's it. England swung.<br/><br/>Here we have alienation, precious television directors, Steptoe Senoir as Paul's 'other' grandfather and, above all, a sense that nothing - absolutely nothing - matters other than the music.<br/><br/>I am not a Beatles nut, and clearly it is only moderate cinema, but it is fun and it is subversive, and that's enough for me right now."
"MatBrewster","8","1","1","18 February 2005"," Great Tunes, Good Comedy
","Critiquing this film as a piece of cinema, and not as a collection of Beatles tunes is a difficult task. Richard Lester creates some truly beautiful black and white images. Though sometimes the camera can't seem to find its focus. And the images obviously taken on a helicopter as they boys play in the grass outside the television studio shake wildly and distract from the fun being had. The boys, though essentially playing themselves still play it a little stiff as if they are not sure how, exactly, to be themselves. The jokes, for the most part, are still funny, and what little plot there is, still works to give a glimpse into what it was like to be a band on the verge of universal stardom.<br/><br/>To take the movie without the songs is well beyond the point, though. The movie is essentially a market ploy to get the songs heard via a different media. One might not be so forgiving if the songs were not any good, but the music shines throughout. The title song that starts the movie off starts with a struuuum that is instantly recognizable and jumps out and smack you in the face. That is followed by what is arguably the Beatles best tunes. When you add in such songs as: I Should Have Known Better, Tell Me Why, I'm Happy Just to Dance with You, the simple, sweet ""If I Fell"" and the sing along favorite ""Can't Buy Me Love"" to the soundtrack then you have a musical that is just shy of remarkable.<br/><br/>The movie was released just before the Beatles came to America and appeared on Ed Sullivan which brought on the madness known as Beatlemania. By this time they were extremely popular as can be seen in the crowds reaction while the boys sings on the television show. It is still shocking to see images of teenage girls screaming, crying and shaking in a manner previously only known to the Pentecostal religion. The soundtrack periodically allow the girls screaming to take over the music allowing us to glimpse what it must have been like to be there. No wonder the boys gave up playing live shortly thereafter.<br/><br/>A Hard Days Night is an excellent glimpse of the Beatles on the cusp of World Stardom. This was before the summer of love, drugs, and the sitar where the Beatles were just trying to be the best band in the world and writing songs that made them so. It is a joy to see them cutting up and being their goofy, hilarious selves. I dare you not to sing and dance along as you watch it."

In the '70's he created the frequently amusing Three Musketeers comedies with Michael York and Oliver Reed.  Then he just sort of faded, bottoming out in the 1980's with the truly dreadful Superman III.  What happened?<br/><br/>Lester's style was originally manic screwball humour, and he's near the top of his form here (I think ""Help"" is marginally better.)  He's capitalizing on the popularity of the Beatles, but not only do they turn out to be fine comic actors (compare this film to contemporary Brit-comedies like ""Smashing Time"" if you want to see how much it really shone at the time) but Lester is able work in some clever digs about the entertainment industry and teen-marketing."

","""A Hard Day's Night"" was the Beatles' first, and probably best, feature film of their career.  Unlike the confused and confusing ""Help!"" or the incredibly simplistic and message-oriented ""Yellow Submarine"" -- in which the Beatles only appeared briefly -- this film has sharp editing, good supporting characterization, and the good sense not to rely too much on the Beatles themselves for more than some good quips and great music. <br/><br/>
Richard Lester's compelling and innovative cinematography and editing underscores the fact that these four young Liverpool lads are going to change the world, well before they actually had begun to do so.  Rather than making a throwaway flick for the fans, Lester crafted a minor masterpiece for rock and roll movies that has never been equalled or even attempted. (The best musician-based movie is still The Buddy Holly Story, but that was a biography and really a different genre.)  The Beatles exploit their public personas to the max here -- loverboy Paul, sardonic John, quiet and naive George, and cuddly Ringo.  Wilfrid Brambell steals the show to the extent possible as Paul's grandfather, ""a real mixer"" as Paul says, who seems to delight in starting fights and causing trouble.  <br/><br/>The movie does get slow at points, and except when the Beatles are performing, the movie is surprisingly lacking of a score.  The DVD transfer I watched is terrific and the remix of the songs is especially good.

They were entertainers, not necessarily good actors. Ringo does show some promise as he did not seem as self conscience as John, Paul or George. This was Beatlemania, put together in a documentary format by Richard Lester. The movie being in black and white doesn't hurt either, as it gives the film a timeless feel. In an age before there were rock and roll videos, it is great to have this recorded piece of history on a group that became a phenomenon."
"FilmFlaneur","Null","1","1","4 October 2002"," The Best Beatles Film
","The first - and best - of the Beatles' feature films, A Hard Day's Night purports to cover 36 hours or so in the life of the Fab Four in the run up to a live TV performance. The director, Richard Lester, made such archetypical 1960s' films as The Knack (1965), How I Won The War (1967) and Petulia (1968), as well as another less successful Beatles' film, Help! (1965). His style, at once comic and gently surreal, is at its best in the present production, which gets much of its strength from an informal mockumentary style. It is shot in an apt black and white, and the Group are ably supported by a rich array of British character actors.<br/><br/>The decision to assemble a swollen supporting cast was a sensible one. As actors themselves the Beatles, while at this stage in their careers unassuming and fresh in their own right, are no less, and no more, than can be expected from any amateur dramatic performers. Musical impressions aside, Ringo is perhaps the most charismatic one out of the four, George the most wooden. The other two just hang round cheerfully. Lester acted on these understandable deficiencies by regularly breaking the dialogue scenes into short, pithy, elements in which the Four, when speaking, do so virtually in catchphrases. Spoken in isolation then assembled into an off-the-wall continuity by a skilled editor, many of the weaknesses could thus be minimised, at the same time improving the film's pace. And by surrounding the guys with a pleasurably distracting range of minor turns (Wilfred Brambell, Norman Rossington, John Junkin, Victor Spinetti, Deryck Guyler, Anna Quayle, Robert Ray, Richard Vernon, Kenneth Haigh, et al), the dramatic weight could be further distributed away from a weak centre.<br/><br/>The result is a film which is very light on its feet, in which the Beatles' slightly smug solecisms never drag or appear self-indulgent. Chief amongst the professional actors around the Four are Brambell (as Paul's erstwhile granddad), their permanently stressed manager Norm (Rossington) and the sweater-wearing and vaguely feminine TV director, (Spinetti). Interestingly, while the band are pursued and besieged by women, and repeatedly express their desire to make female acquaintances, the film explores primarily a *male* musical universe. During the press reception they flirt with women journalists; later Paul and another Beatle are seen chatting to some dancing girls. John is cornered by a woman (Anna Quayle), for some notable sexual banter on the theatre's backstage stairs. Outside of these accidental meetings, women, or more specifically girls, are kept at arm's length - either literally behind a physical barrier (as during the performance on the train) or left ineffectually screaming in their seats in the televised concert scenes. In a film beginning with famous images of mass female pursuit of their objects of desire, none of the Four are either caught or confronted by these fans, whose adolescent desire is appreciated, if never explicitly acknowledged. The Beatles are a self-referential, sealed unit, thereby contributing to the feeling of claustrophobia they experience, and creating the dramatic impetus which drives much of the later plot: the need to 'escape' and find some degree of relaxation and freedom. This is most made concrete with the 'Ringo on the loose' scenes, as the drummer dons a cap and raincoat, grabs a camera (he's the only one of the group associated with non-musical interests) and heads off to the canal. Allegedly stoned while he was acting these scenes, Starr's wonderings might have strayed in from a different film. They have a meditative and lyrical quality about them, providing a welcome contrast to the madcap pace shown elsewhere. Drugged or not, Ringo's escape also injects a dramatic crisis into the film - will he or will he not be back in time for the live broadcast? - which the film needs, to avoid a feeling of flatness in its last third. The only other 'escape' in the film is less adventurous, but funnier, as Harrison wonders into a fashion guru's (Haigh's) office and gives blunt Liverpuddlian comments on a range of trendy clothing (""I wouldn't been seen dead in that""). This scene, for all of Harrison's shortcomings as an actor, is also one of the best dramatically: a moment when, temporarily freed from his Beatles' locus, Lester can ridicule the absurdities of youth fashion and prick the whole 1960s style industry.<br/><br/>Outside of the Fab Four, and the source of the longest running gag (""He's very clean isn't he?"") is Paul's grandfather, played by Brambell. His scowling face, deviousness and cynicism born of experience is a necessary counterweight to the charming, yet flighty, naivety of the Four. Having little or no familial contact with his relative, it is he who persuades Ringo to step outside the theatre to do his thing - an act for which he later apologises, but that we feel has been for the ultimate good. It is Granddad, too, who remains the most resolutely anti-Beatles in tone and appreciation, and his final presence and enjoyment at the concert is less than convincing. It is interesting to consider the likely effect had Lester cast Brambell as the Police desk sergeant for the arrest scenes, rather than the genial Deryck Guyler. In A Hard Day's Night the police are comic stooges, generally inefficient. They never offer any real threat to the disruption offered by the Beatles' mild anarchy. There is little of the social confrontation that would develop as the decade wore on and the Fab Four's politics became more obvious. Brambell's underlying caustic nature would have made all the difference. The concert is the thing. Lester's film shies away from social concerns, and the boys remain above controversy. The plot even includes elements of whimsical fantasy, as when Lennon abruptly vanishes from his bath, or when the Four's instruments suddenly materialise to play in the guard's van. These timeless elements, as well as Lester's light directorial touch, are what have helped it to remain undated and fresh; the film still enjoys a large following and belongs on the shelf on anyone who enjoys 1960s culture."

","This movie really is truly ""A laugh a line with Lennon"". Hysterical Beatle humor. It's a light hearted film. The music is great. Each Beatle is unique with pieces of their own character adding to the movie. John as the trouble maker, George as the scowling cynic, Paul as the peacemaker, Ringo as the downtrodden soul and Paul's grandfather as the sneaky villain. Their managers have a full babysitting job watching these five as they try to play a gig but being Beatles it's not easy to have a normal day. They go to a press party and can't even get a nibble of food while constantly hounded - but their answers are worth it for us. Highly recommend it."

","This is a pretty good job of restoring an old classic, however, unfortunately at the end of the movie, when The Beatles do the last songs on stage, the screaming of the fans is almost completely dubbed over. The screaming at the end is what made the movie's climax. It clearly showed what the sixties were like when attending concerts of your favorite rock stars, in particular, The Beatles. I think that reworking that part of the movie's soundtrack was a big mistake, there are some classics you cannot make better and this is a good example. If one wants to hear The Beatles in clear crisp stereo, then one can put on a compact disc. I waited a long time for this release and I was very disappointed in the end. I hope that they will issue this title again and restore the original soundtrack and get rid of that wishy-washy church sound, so that all generations will be able to experience this movie like it was and not how some individuals want it to be."

Of course, the plot is just an alibi for them to perform their famous songs like ""Can´t buy me love"" or ""She loves you"". I have watched the original version with a digitally remastered soundtrack. It was one big pleasure to watch, especially because of its surprisingly funny dialogue -  although the translation of the subtitles was strange sometimes. I suppose that it surely had a big influence on video- clip directors.

The film, in black and white, is marvelous in its simplicity and the way in which the music is so artfully wended into the plot, which of course is silly and superficial, almost non-existent. Who cares, this is Beatles music at its freshest and rawest, with the Beatles themselves behaving rather than acting. Its almost as if they can't believe they are in a film, and maybe they can't, but it doesn't matter because the music is so strong and powerful that you forget to criticize. The pacing is excellent, and it does not let up for a moment, but you never sense it's frantic or frustrated - the film never wants to do more than it does. There is one really touching moment, Ringo's adventure ... and I defy anyone to watch this without some reflection on what fame and success is all about. Watching Ringo with some yobo kid throwing stones into the River Mersey is an image I will always remember. Its a lovely little film and will transport you, for a while, into the inane, slightly ridiculous charm of the early sixties in Great Britain"

I saw them live on Ed Sullivan in February 1964 while at a girlfriends house and remember that fondly. I was 20 at the time.

","The Beatles have made a huge impact in music history. This was basically a film capitalizing on their success. Sadly aside from the classic songs played throughout....This is one annoying movie. First thing is. The Beatles can't act at all. They phone in every line of dialogue and don't care whatsoever. Oh and the entire point of the movie is them not caring about their career and goofing off. The Beatles end up coming off as unlikable, egotistical, and annoying while being jerks to the people around them.... that's the movie.<br/><br/>Its okay to have little plot for a music movie. And to be honest I never really cared that much for their music. But when the songs play in the movieThe ""story"" doesn't progress It's like the movie is on pause. But the thing is without the music this wouldn't have been successful in the slightest. The movie then goes into a pattern of them goofing off then performing a song.<br/><br/>.......They just preform then goof off, preform, then goof off... And...That's pretty much it!!<br/><br/>The goofing off scenes happen with vandalism and harassment they even have the cops chase them at the end of the movie.

I ORDER YOU NOW.<br/><br/>Are they all gone? OK, let us proceed.<br/><br/>I'm a Beatles fan, but I don't mindlessly applaud everything they've done. The Beatles I admire were the guys who wrote their own music, blended styles and philosophies of Eastern cultures, arranged symphonic movements, challenged our musical conceptions... and HAD PERSONALITIES. These qualities wouldn't surface until the 2nd half of their career after they had achieved sufficient confidence to dump the record company ""charm school"" that had made them.<br/><br/>The first half of their career, up to and including this movie, they were just prettyboy pawns of the record industry. And that's exactly what we get. We get some record producer's lame idea of a Beatles movie, NOT a Beatles movie. They act like, talk like and look like what a record producer would portray. Nothing human, nothing passionate, not even funny. Just reading lines and lip synching their catchiest tunes (somewhat poorly, I might add... Paul gets a few lines wrong, but the cameras just keep on rolling).<br/><br/>Maybe some folks will laugh at the fast-motion antics of the fab four running around a football field and acting like clowns, wrestling and hitting each other. But I'd just as soon skip over that and get to the heart of it all. Surprise. there's no heart. This is just an endless parade of predictable gags and goofiness that becomes downright embarrassing after the first 20 mins.<br/><br/>I repeat: THIS IS NOT THE BEATLES. It's a carefully packaged dress rehearsal of what fans wanted the Beatles to be back in the early 60s. Fans loved it back then, I'm sure. But in retrospect, it's no more interesting than watching a 1964 commercial for Comet Liquid Soap.<br/><br/>Skip this one, folks. Proceed directly to YELLOW SUBMARINE.

","Although I do like a lot of their songs, I wouldn't consider myself a huge fan of The Beatles. I tend to like other contemporary artists better and in some cases I prefer the careers that McCartney and Lennon had after the group split. Therefore I wasn't particularly fussed about watching this drama-documentary-comedy-musical that follows the fab four around at the height of their fame. It's short in black and white with an on-street vibe by Musketeers director Richard Lester, but what comes across to me is just how unpleasant the group members are. They make constant wisecracks and jokes, but a lot of them seem to be sarcastic and mean-spirited, which I didn't find appealing at all. The songs are great and break up the rest of the tedium, and casting proper actors like Wilfrid Brambell in support was a great idea, but the rest is merely inconsequential - unless you're a fan who can't get enough of them."
"MartinHafer","6","3","6","15 June 2011"," Well, it's certainly no ""Give My Regards to Broad Street""...thank God!
","In the 1980s, Paul McCartney made a film that was obviously inspired by ""A Hard Day's Night"". However similar in structure, ""Give My Regards to Broad Street"" was clearly NOT the same quality movie. So, if you saw this much later film and assumed ""A Hard Day's Night"" is also a boring, bloated and enormously long-winded music video, think twice! Despite having practically no plot and TONS of Beatles songs strung together instead of a story, there is something likable about ""A Hard Day's Night"" and it gives you the next best thing to a backstage pass to meet them--albeit heavily scripted and plasticized.<br/><br/>The plot, for what it is, is a visit to the hectic life of the Beatles--making it not much of a stretch for the boys. And they essentially play the public roles each played--Paul was the sweet and nice one, John the clever smart-aleck, George the quiet one and Ringo the goofy one. Whether this is exactly as they really were is pretty doubtful, but they did play the parts the public expected and loved. The film includes them being chased by fans (A LOT), riding trains, making eyes at girls, cracking jokes and singing. Along for the ride is the somewhat irrelevant 'grandfather' of Paul--who was actually actor Wilfrid Brambell from ""Steptoe and Son"" (a precursor to ""Sanford and Son"" in America). He mostly just sits there and looks serious or chases young women. In the MANY times when the film breaks into seemingly spontaneous music videos, he mostly sits there and looks bewildered. I am sure back in 1964, anyone in the theater older than, say, 35, looked pretty much the same way!! As I said, the plot is VERY thin and mostly it's just a chance to pretend to see the Beatles as they are in real life (sure) and hear a lot of their songs...LOTS. In fact, it seems like the songs often take the place of plot. Now this would suck if it was, say, the Bay City Rollers,The Ohio Express or The Starland Vocal Band. But, considering almost every song is among the group's best, it's hard to hate the lack of plot--unless you are a crazy young whippersnapper who hates the Fab Four! As for me, I found the film very forgettable but fun...with nice tunes. I did NOT see it as brilliant cinema and cannot understand all the votes of 10--which, to me, seem more like votes on how much they like the Beatles instead of the overall merits of a film. That's because it just didn't seem like a movie--more like an extended advertisement for the group in order to satisfy their insanely devoted fans and convert others to the cult! And, in that sense, it is a successful film---but oddness in style and the group not taking themselves too seriously don't, to me, make it a great film. Many of their jokes fall flat, the songs seem about as spontaneous as a moon landing and the lack of structure make it a niche film. A must-see? Well, if you love the Beatles, yes. Otherwise, just a strange and occasionally humorous 'anti-film' that tries hard NOT to be a movie.<br/><br/>By the way, not matter how kooky the Beatles may or may not have been, who wears a hat and underwear in the bathtub, shaves a mirror or draws on TV monitors?! Also, watch Ringo when he plays the drums. Often his motions aren't even close to him really playing the drums and the sticks often don't come close to touching the drums!"
"bob the moo","Null","2","4","4 May 2003"," Amusing but dated as a film but a must-see for Beatles fans
","This film follows the Beatles on a tour of the south of England.  As usual they have all the problems associated with rushed schedules and high-pressure gigs  not to mention the screaming fans.  However this time they have an extra consideration in Paul's grandfather who has come along to see the sights.  He may be clean, but sadly he is a real stirrer and causes frictions in the band.<br/><br/>I saw this in the mid nineties in a bar full of students and I found it very enjoyable.  To write a review of it I re-watched it last night and must say that it didn't have quite the same impact on me  maybe memory gave me a rose tinted impression of it.  That's not to say I don't enjoy it but it seems to have dated very badly and major aspects of it seem very `out'.  At it's heart the film is a way of getting the Beatles' music onscreen and feed the fans and, as a vehicle for them, it works very well.  It has no plot but has plenty of memorable scenes and uses the grandfather well as a central point.  The musical numbers are all great (of course) and all stand out.<br/><br/>The humour is good but there are too few really big laughs to make it hilarious.  However it is still amusing with some good lines, imaginative bits and running jokes (`he's very clean').  The direction adds to the dated feel as Lester's jerky camera and student camera angles really make you know that it is from the 60's.  However to be fair the film IS from the 60's and for many this will not bother them as this is part of it's appeal.<br/><br/>The Fab Four are great  all putting forward funny characters.  Lennon comes off the best as the sarcastic one, Paul is a little less interesting and George makes even less of an impression.  Ringo is very good  allowing himself to be made fun of but dealing with it well.  The support cast add much of the comedy and have a few famous faces.  Brambell (Steptoe) is the best of all the cast  his character is the funniest and is also the lynchpin for the majority of the film.  Other faces you may see include Derek Nimmo and Deryck Guyler.<br/><br/>Overall this is a real must-see for anyone who likes the Beatles' music. The fact that it is funny will just add to it's appeal.  As a film it is dated and not as funny as one would hope but then this is not just a film is it?  Well worth a watch but sadly not as funny as I remembered it to be."

Instead of adding to the Beatles mythology, it brings the boys down to earth in quirky and eccentric ways, presenting some great songs in the process. Early Beatles was all about silliness, and this is a fine example, although it may leave you wondering what all the fuss was about.

A friend with a a fair sized allowance and a hefty collection of 45's and a record player was a good friend to have.
So, with that said, this movie was simply a lovely way to let people see these 4 lads who changed the face of rock and roll forever. There has never been anything like them, and these first few years they were in business had a cultural effect like no other.

","Just passed its 50th anniversary now, ""A Hard Day's Night"" remains a fresh and exuberant film capturing the energy and spirit of the young Beatles as they get through a typical day of travelling, press-conferences and musical appearances. Interspersed are several of the group's numbers, some are from past singles and albums while most are from the newly- minted soundtrack album and containing such new classics as the title track and smash single ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""And I Love Her"" and ""If I Fell"".<br/><br/>The movie is slightly fleshed out by the ten minute concert at the end but before that the boys are given ample acting opportunity at which they acquit themselves surprisingly well given it's their collective debut. Yes, there's a touch of stereotyping in their respective personae, the rebellious Lennon, romantic Paul, deadpan George and sullen Ringo, but it's also possible to detect some likely improvisation by them, which only adds to the overall spontaneity. Writer Alun Owen has a good ear for the Liverpool vernacular and inserts some neat jokes although I could have done with less of Wilfred Brambell's meddlesome role as Paul's grandfather. The running joke about him being very clean wouldn't have been lost on British viewers who knew Brambell better as the ""dirty old man"" Steptoe Senior character from TV's ""Steptoe and Son"".<br/><br/>Director Richard Lester does his task with invention and vigour, his camera rarely standing still and employing several tricks to play up the gags and boost the story. Even unintentional goofs, like George falling over in the initial scene which has the group escaping their Beatlemaniac fans and later backing into his amplifier on a later song only add to the fun. Quite what John Lennon's wife of the time made of his woman-chasing screen-demeanour is anyone's guess however.<br/><br/>What's good for me as a fan though is to see the Beatles as near as possible in their natural environment, obviously enjoying their success and each other's company at the same time. The group harmony wouldn't last but it did long enough for them to ultimately ditch both the outlets of cinema and live performances in pursuit of musical excellence, the right choice of course as things panned out."

","Thanks to the brilliant BBC 4 premiere of the 2014 remaster I have regained my former enthusiasm for this film in spades and am now suffering from an attack of Beatle mania. I can't wait to see the film again, only this time at a movie theatre, which will be a first for me, as in 1964 my father took my brother and I to see it at the Woolton Picture House in Liverpool; little did we realise that John Lennon lived around the corner and so there was a huge queue of people waiting to see the movie. We got all the way up to the front so that we could see into the foyer when we heard the usher proclaim: ""FULL UP! NO SEATS LEFT INSIDE!"". So that was it. I had to wait until it came on TV many years later to appreciate the greatness of this film. It is revolutionary,innovative, charming, hilarious and an absolute blast! And the songs aren't bad either,to put it mildly. To think it does all this on a U (US G) certificate. As a Liverpool person I have no trouble with the accent and in addition to documenting Beatlemanis it is also peppered with slang we all used at the time. It wasn't just the Beatles who said ""Gear"" and ""Come 'ead"".It was all of us in Liverpool. The music sounds better than ever due to the remastering. It felt more like a modern film produced about the era than a 50 year old classic. This is all credit to Dick Lester masterful direction. He truly captured ""lightnong in a bottle."""

","Greetings again from the darkness. It's the 50th anniversary and what a treat to see the re-mastered, restored film in a crowded theatre - many wearing their Beatles shirts. The quasi-documentary, cinema verite' approach from director Richard Lester may not fit the traditional idea of a great movie, but at a minimum, it's a fantastic pop culture artifact showing a world on the verge of change.<br/><br/>This is The Beatles first film and this is the most innocent and fresh-faced we ever see them ... it's just a few months after their first appearance on ""the Ed Sullivan Show"". John is the most guarded, but his quick wit and distrust of the establishment are obvious. Paul is at his cutest and least arrogant, but still managing to pose on cue. George comes across most open and full of joy - before he became the most publicly withdrawn. Ringo is self-deprecating and in full hang-dog mode.<br/><br/>For a stark contrast, watch the four lads a year later in HELP!, also directed by Mr. Lester. The luster of fame has clearly tarnished and they are quite aware of the power they wield. Still, during this shoot, we are almost ""on set"" as the boys are first experiencing Beatlemania! In addition to the Fab Four, British actor Wilfrid Brambill plays Paul's Grandfather. The recurring gag of him being ""very clean"" is a play on Brambill's long-running role as Albert Steptoe in ""Steptoe & Son"" where he is referred to as ""a dirty old man"". Victor Spinetti plays the very anxious TV director wearing the infamous sweater. Mr. Spinetti also appeared in HELP! (1965) and The Magical Mystery Tour (1967). Richard Vernon played the grumpy old man sharing the train car with the boys. Mr. Vernon also appeared in Goldfinger that same year. Another James Bond link occurs when Ringo is invited to the Le Cercle Club ... the same club James Bond first appears in Dr. No (1962). Lastly, Pattie Boyd is one of the giggly schoolgirls on the train and appears in 3 different scenes. 18 months later, she was married to George Harrison ... and a few years later, she proved her attraction to lead guitarists by marrying Eric Clapton.<br/><br/>I was caught off guard by the frenetic pace of the film ... it has been 3 decades since I last watched it. But mostly, I was stunned at the clean look of this restored version and was awed by the terrific sound, especially of the song restorations completed by Giles Martin, the son of Beatles record producer George Martin ... who was nominated for an Academy Award for his film score.<br/><br/>The film inspired the 1960's TV show ""The Monkees"", and of course, the soundtrack was a massive seller. ""If I Fell"" is one of my favorite Beatles songs and it's a nice segment in the film, but the real climax is the performance of ""She Loves You"", replete with terrific crowd shots. The impact and lasting impression of the film is every bit as recognizable as that stunning opening chord to the title track that opens the film."

","Looked at in the cold light of day, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT has dated badly. Many of the gags fall flat on their face, while the visual style seems artificially jumpy, as director Richard Lester makes a labored attempt to emphasize the Beatles' liberated life. In terms of film history, however, the film occupies a seminal position; not only does it provide a record of the Beatles in performance, but it makes a conscious attempt to explain the Beatlemania phenomenon. The Fab Four not only introduced different musical styles into the Britpop world, but they were representatives of a new, swinging way of life that contrasted starkly with what had gone before. They were happy-go-lucky, free, not frightened to express themselves, and hedonistic - as seen, for instance, in the ""Can't Buy Me Love"" sequence where they gambol about on a school playing-field, shot from above by director Lester. In historical terms, the film offers a valuable portrait of mid-Sixties London, especially the contrast between 'old' and 'new' values. In one sequence the Beatles get into an argument with a city gent (Richard Vernon), who tries to stop them playing their transistor radio in the belief that, as a regular traveler on the train, he is somehow superior to them. Needless to say John Lennon immediately exposes the stupidity of such claims. The film is full of experimental visual styles, from the speeded-up chase sequence as the Fab Four are pursued by the London constabulary, to the rapid intercutting between the Beatles in performance and their adoring fans in the audience screaming themselves hoarse, And then there are the songs, which remain as fresh and original half a century on as they did when they were premiered. A HARD DAY'S NIGHT demands to be watched by anyone interested in social and popular music history, as well as Beatles fans young and old."

","Originally A Hard Days Night was intended as nothing more than a way for United Artists to gain the rights for the Beatles next album. They didn't think that the film alone would be any good. But instead of becoming nothing but a marketing whore (like more recent music artist films such as the Spice Girls Movie) this film is a classic with clever scripting, a great shooting style and all the charisma of the Beatles making this in to a timeless feel good comedy that's up there with the best music comedies. <br/><br/>It's story is simple enough, following the Beatles as they go on tour in London and all the shenanigans they get in to. Throughout it has clever writing similar to that of a Marx brothers comedy, with a mixture of witty dialogue and hilarious visual comedy. On top of this writer Alun Owen captures the Beatles personalities perfectly, making their dynamic that much more believable in the film and further fills us with a real sense of friendship between them all.<br/><br/>There are some jokes which have become dated, such as a reference to Pauls uncle being in Steptoe and Son likely to be overlooked by more recent audiences. But most of the comedy in the film does have a timeless feel with most of it based on clever wordplay and silly visual comedy such as the various Benny Hill style chase scenes.<br/><br/>Of course, just like the producers wanted, the soundtrack is incredible, coming from a high of Beatlemania, filled with classics like A Hard Days Night and She Loves You in the film. On top of this the music sequences are also very impressive and have gone on to influence many other music videos in the future with a mixture of on stage performances and using the music to accompany the beginning chase scene. <br/><br/>This is probably one of the most influential music films and definitely one of the best. It shows the Beatles at the top of their game through great comedy mixed with some incredible music reminding us why the Beatles were so big."

","""A Hard Day's Night"" was written by Alun Owen, and directed by Richard Lester. This documentary-style film was released in 1964, at the height of Beatlemania. At one point in the movie, the Beatles hold a press conference. Reporter: ""How did you find America?"" John: ""Turn left at Greenland."" Reporter: ""Are you a mod or a rocker?"" Ringo: ""I'm a mocker."" Reporter: ""What would you call that hairstyle you're wearing?"" George: ""Arthur."" Reporter: ""Do you often see your father?"" Paul: ""No, actually, we're just good friends."" The Beatles were naturals at acting, as well as answering questions at real press conferences. Musically speaking, Ringo may have been overshadowed by John, Paul and George. In this movie, once Ringo steps out from behind his drum kit, he steals the show from the other Beatles! No film evokes memories of my childhood as much as this movie does. I vividly recall sitting in a movie theater, and listening to girls my age screaming every time one of the Beatles was on-screen. The video quality of the Blu-ray version of ""A Hard Day's Night"" was crystal clear, even seen by a misty-eyed, middle-aged man reliving his childhood."

","Just call me late to the party on so many topics. I was never a Beatles fan back in the day, I thought they'd be a passing fad and all the screaming girls at their concert appearances convinced me that too many people had simply lost their minds. So it's fifty years later and whenever an early Beatles tune comes on the radio it gets my feet pumping in time to the beat. My appreciation of the Fab Four has obviously grown over time, and their staying power in popular music seems likely to continue forever.<br/><br/>I had some interesting observations while watching this flick the other night. For starters, their hair really wasn't all that long! Mop-top, yes, to be sure, but otherwise they looked to be exceptionally well groomed. Virtually every closeup of the boys looked like it could have been a cover on the next issue of Teen Beat or 16. The frantic double and triple timed speed-ups in the filming with the odd camera angles was an early precursor to shows like 'The Monkees' and set a new standard for portraying zany antics in movies.<br/><br/>In as much as there really is no story to speak of, what most viewers should enjoy is a hearty helping of the group's early popular songs. If you're a fan you'll recognize them all and find yourself singing along. You get the impression the Beatles didn't take themselves too seriously at this stage in their careers, and it was a hoot to see a particular scene where an old man in a closet has a fan mag with a picture of Elvis on the cover."

","I was part of the Beatles generation, a freshman in high school when they came to America. You couldn't help but get mixed up with them whether you liked them or not. They were everywhere. Everything about them was special to teenage girls: their accents, the British colloquialisms, their clothes - it was indeed a British invasion.<br/><br/>The Beatles would go on to have many peaks of popularity because they and their music evolved. A Hard Day's Night was done at their first ""peak"" (but let's face it, they didn't have much non-peak time). Frankly, it's a work of genius, as far as I'm concerned. The Beatles here are the '60s version of the Marx Brothers and completely natural, funny, crazy, strange, and uniquely talented. The movie is a day in the life of the Fab Four, with lots and lots of their music intertwined. The writer, Alun Owen, followed the Beatles on their French tour and put the script together based on his observations. He tagged John as a smart aleck, Paul as cute but practical, George as quiet, and Ringo as kind of slow. He also worked to get their speech and daily routines into the script. When they went to film it, the Beatles did a lot of improvisation, some of which was incorporated after the film.<br/><br/>It's a black and white movie, using jump shots, which were quite new, and it really set the stage for other musical movies to come.<br/><br/>Seeing A Hard Day's Night today, it was an innocent time in general and for the Beatles, who were still pretty provincial. They were exuberant in their fame; that would change later. Unlike some other groups, where people played in a band and went their separate ways, the Beatles were always together, it seemed, at least in the beginning.<br/><br/>One piece of trivia: On the night they appeared on Ed Sullivan, John Lennon appeared in the dressing room of Mitzi McCall and Charlie Brill, who also performed though they couldn't hear a word the other was saying because of the screaming fans. The Coke machine was in the Brill-McCall dressing room. John came in, got a Coke, and sat down and talked to Charlie Brill. As he talked, he drew something on a napkin and signed it. Then he left. ""What a pompous jerk,"" Brill said -- and tossed the napkin in the wastebasket.<br/><br/>Charlie Brill now knows that was a big mistake. They were no flash in the pan. They were the Beatles and they just got better and better. This movie captures them and London at a moment in time with the screaming fans, the music, and the excitement about the Beatles that I'll always remember."

There's not much of a plot (come to think of it, virtually none!) but it's a day in the life of the Fab Four, during the birth of Beatlemania, as they are going to be performing at some BBC TV extravaganza. Expertly filmed in B&W, director Richard Lester manages to capture a documentary feel to this without the heavy handed narration. At the heart of this are the boys performing some of the best of their early music, some simple yet brilliant pop. About the final .15-20 minutes they are on stage in front of a screaming audience of mostly teenage girls. Lester has some great shots during this-including from behind the group, looking out into this mass of pubescent frenzy. If you have no interest in the Beatles you'll probably be bored...but if you don't know much about them and are curious as to what the fuss was about, check it out."

This movie and Help! were film works which made the Beatles a solid hit world wide. <br/><br/>This movie presents them at their height. The sad thing about the amount of talent this group had is that it ended so soon. Their success made them huge for about 6 years after this film. Then all that success made the group fall apart in 1971, never to get back together again. <br/><br/>One can only imagine what music might have resulted if that success had not shortened things.

","Up until A Hard Days Night, musical pop star movies were a combination of schmaltz and rotating guests that were forced upon the director and audiences alike. Frankly, they are painful to watch, if only because they were so dated prior to release. While AHDN certainly has the usual movie schmaltz, it has three distinct elements that propelled it to our DVD history shelves. We were given silly editing of the song clips leading up to the TV show taping assuring eternal Beatle love for not taking themselves too seriously. We have the fab four delivering the quick witted, somewhat silly delivery of the schmaltz! We have live performance captured in that unique style that slammed Richard Lester as the grandfather of MTV. Each part has its' fingerprints on modern musics' video delivery There's no denying that the supporting cast are simply stooges, the dialog is forced and the delivery is about as natural as plastic, but we have our idealistic youth, real or not, captured in a time vault accompanied by a soundtrack that we all know by heart."

","The more you watch this wonderful film the more the significance of Paul's grandfather reveals itself. The 52 year old Wilfred Brambell - who was actually younger than Paul's father at this time - acts as a cipher for the louche behaviour afforded the Beatles through their fame. He is a womaniser, always up to mischief and an opportunist. His 'dirty old man' persona with his unshaven appearance is used to contrast their clean cut ebullience. The long running joke that he is 'very clean' is ironic, as he seems to play the role of fall guy to disguise their amphetamine driven, highly sexed life - a hint of which is given when John sniffs a coke bottle. The Beatles' excesses are no secret now, but it was in 1964. Their marketing was of four wholesome, clean blokes who you would invite home to meet the family, unlike Paul's grandfather!"

","""A Hard Day's Night"" is a pseudo-documentary of a day (or two) in the life of the Beatles.<br/><br/>John, Paul, George and Ringo play four Liverpudlian musicians named . . . well, John, Paul, George and Ringo. But even though they go by their own names and have ""The Beatles"" on their drum (the band's name is not referenced elsewhere in the movie) the story is a clever comedy fiction.<br/><br/>Some things are obviously based directly on the Beatles' lives. The screaming teenage fans (what do those girls of 1964 think when they look back at themselves in later middle age?), the constant hustle from one concert venue to the next, etc. Luckily, the Beatles, collectively, had a cheeky sense of humor about it all, and a strangely natural way of presenting their fictionalized selves before the camera.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Alun Owen (whatever it feels like, the movie was scripted) stereotyped the boys' real characters and gave them distinctive voices (despite their all talking in Scouce accents)retelling the Beatles' story as a surrealist comedy about four ordinary blokes who lucked out and are enjoying fame, despite the hardships (such as being unable to get anything to eat). From the script,(then)avant-garde director Richard Lester, working at a feverish pace to reach the studio deadline, produced a minor masterpiece that defies category. Is it a docu-drama? A ninety-minute music video? A musical comedy? To heighten the comedic side, Lester surrounds the boys with fictional players. The band's quarrelsome managing crew are portrayed by the familiar faces -- in Britain -- of Norman Rossington and John Junkin (the tall one).<br/><br/>The plot, such as it is, concerns the band (again, ""The Beatles"" is never used in the dialogue) arriving to perform a televised concert burdened with Paul's mischievous, trouble-making grandfather (played with delicious maliciousness by William Brambell). Brambell's character is the catalyst for the band's difficulties, for instance when he provokes Ringo to go for a jaunt around town shortly before air time. Filming the movie in black and white heightens its sense of realism, while no doubt also lowering the stakes in the gamble of whether a real band could pay off in a movie.<br/><br/>When it was first produced, ""A Hard Day's Night"" was probably seen by some of the audience, as well as the film makers, as a long promo to sell records. At the time, they also probably wondered whether the Beatles had any staying power. These days, the Beatles' first movie is a delightful romp best viewed outside the context of their contentious legacy. It's great fun."

","If you go into the movie expecting more than a few great musical numbers and some good uncomplicated fun, you will be disappointed. The plot is simple—it is all about the Beatles preparing for an upcoming show. This simplicity, however, allows the audience to truly experience John, Paul, George, and Ringo in all their unrestrained quirkiness. We get to see what the Beatles lives are like in between shows, exaggerated of course. The lack of a full plot actually adds to the comedy, something that not many films do successfully.<br/><br/>Even though the dialogue is scripted and the situations they find themselves in are ridiculous, I feel that there are times in the movie where we are actually getting an inside look at the life of the Beatles. Alun Owen, the screenplay writer, spent some time traveling with the band, and concluded their lives are like ""a train and a room and a car and a room and a room and a room,"" never slowing down and never resting. I think this movie portrays that aspect of the Beatles life quite well; they never seem to be in the same place for more than an instant.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was a fun time with this wacky band. The acting was done pretty well by the Fab Four, and Paul's weasel of a grandpa was especially fun to watch. The soundtrack was great—it's the Beatles of course. If you go in without any expectations of a fully formed storyline, you should be pleasantly pleased."

It's a laugh, it really is! I laughed! I thought it was hilarious. I think it's great that the Beatles made movies like this, so that you can capture the special Beatlemanis moments forever! I just wish there was talent like that these days, but we'll never see anything like the Beatles again.<br/><br/>It also taught me a lot more about the Beatles.

You could say that this is basically like one big marketing video for The Beatles. It shows the four Beatles, Ringo Starr, George Harrison, Paul McCartney and John Lennon as themselves, having lots of fun with partying and girls and doing lots of other very immature stuff. And yes, occasionally they of course also perform some of their songs. It probably sounds like something negative but no, I actually like this movie very much. It's simply so much fun to watch throughout!<br/><br/>It's a real comedy, that shows The Beatles from their funny sides and the movie does actually feature some fun dialog and good silly comical situations. It stars The Beatles as themselves but please don't think they are not acting and they really lived like that. It's no documentary by any means and it allows The Beatles to show themselves from their funny and artistic side.<br/><br/>It's a movie that dates back from the early Beatle years and got made at the verge of their big breakthrough. In that regard this already is a special and musically significant movie to watch. All of The Beatles were still in their early 20's and the movie showed them as rebellious young boys, all doing their own thing and already having their unique sound and style. Even almost 50 years later the songs are still catchy and you don't necessarily have to be a familiar or a big fan to enjoy listening to their songs in this movie. But it's a movie from the early days of The Beatles, so don't expect to hear all of your favorite Beatle songs in this movie. It features some well known songs but most of them just aren't that well known, which is not saying that it are horrible songs though.<br/><br/>It by no means is a great done movie though. I mean, stuff is happening really very random in this movie and it obviously was a cheap one to make as well. The movie really thrives on its charismatic 4 leading men and their chemistry together.<br/><br/>Not that any of The Beatles were great or natural born actors though. Their acting performances really aren't great but what saves them is that they basically are simply playing themselves, which did not require an awful lot of acting skills obviously.<br/><br/>Great fun promotion for The Beatles, from their early days.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Released in 1964, at the height of Beatlemania, this was the silver screen debut of the Beatles. This film was released 22 years before I was born, which means I was born sixteen years after the band broke up, and six years after the assassination of John Lennon, but I cannot remember a time in my life when I was completely unfamiliar with the music of the groundbreaking group. The first time I ever saw ""A Hard Day's Night"" might have been in the late 90's, and I watched it again for the first time in many years in 2007. I still thought this 1964 comedy was good when I finally saw it again after all those years, so I saw no reason why I wouldn't still be impressed nearly four years later. Without a doubt, it didn't wear thin with my latest viewing.<br/><br/>The Beatles (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr), from Liverpool, England, have a live TV performance scheduled to take place in London. The band members manage to escape from a crowd of crazed fans and board a train to take them from Liverpool to London. Paul brings his grandfather along for the trip, and the train ride does not turn out to be a very peaceful experience for the band members. Upon arrival in London, they inevitably come across more crazed fans to escape from. Their lives continue to be burdened by their stardom during their stay in the capital of the United Kingdom as they face problems, especially with Paul's grandfather. Even though he is constantly called a ""clean old man"" by the people who see him, it's hard to keep him out of trouble. The misadventures might eventually even threaten the band's upcoming performance, which is supposed to happen very soon! <br/><br/>The opening sequence of this mockumentary features the hit Beatles song with the same title as the film, and shows the band members trying to get to the train while they are pursued by crazed fans. This is a great, energetic opening sequence with a fitting song to go with it. After this, the film shows the band on the train, and at this point, it's VERY funny, with lots of humorous dialogue, the people the band members meet on board, the presence of Paul's grandfather affecting the experience, etc. After the train ride, the laughs continue, but it eventually becomes clear that the film is not as great or consistently funny as it looks at first, and there are times when the camera work is shaky. Still, there are laughs throughout the film, with the dialogue and situations, even if they're not usually very big laughs. The band members all put on good comical performances as themselves, and the other cast performances are generally favourable as well, including Wilfrid Brambell as Paul's fictional grandfather. The Beatles songs featured in the film are a big part of it as well, and they also help.<br/><br/>My latest viewing of this film was my first one since watching ""Spice World"" three years ago. That film was released over thirty years after this one, but certainly is a similar idea. Both movies feature a band playing themselves, experiencing fictional trouble as the time for a big upcoming live show which they are scheduled play in London draws nearer. However, I thought that the 90's film was very bad, and never before or since have I seen a movie which was that much like watching something in fast forward mode when I actually wasn't! I am not a Spice Girls fan, but even if I were, I highly doubt that would have made TOO much of a difference when I finally decided to watch their movie years after their heyday! Unlike that mess, ""A Hard Day's Night"" is funny, well-written, well-cast, and focused, not just slopped together like the later film that's often been compared to it. If you're a Beatles fan and want a laugh, but haven't seen this 1964 music comedy, there's probably a lot you could find to like here."

As for music do I really need to say about how the music is awesome. It's The Beatles of course the music is great! The dialogue is also very well written. Then we have the characters. Of course we have The Beatles playing The Beatles, and they are as I said hilarious. Then there other characters that I also think are hilarious also. The grandfather is just as much of a gutbuster as The Beatles. Overall if you are The Beatles fan watch this movie as soon as possible. If you aren't still enjoy this movie. It may not make you go crazy for The Beatles, but you'll enjoy yourself the whole time.<br/><br/>4 stars out of 4"

","When you see Paul, Ringo, John, and George in ""Hard Days Night"", you really see yourself thirty-five years ago - brash, egotistical, flighty, and rebellious.  In seeing their rise to stardom amidst the adulation and fanfare, you see also your own rise to being whomever you are now.  This is a joyous return to pure showmanship that didn't need a corporate sponsor and to a dream-like state where wishes do come true.  Sadly, there are truths which reverberate with the familiar tunes they play so well.  When they are not performing, you see the images of lonely young men running away from commitment, from the mundane and stilted lives around them, and running to their elusive girls and their elusive freedom.  On the train, they can't help poking fun at a middle age man who insists on doing everything his way. On an open field, they frolic as children in a playground that the owner regards as closed.  In a police station, they see conformity and they are chased not merely by cops but by their very authority. Yet when they are performing, you see the bright laughter in their faces and the enjoyment of what they do best.  There are no second takes from outsiders because they follow only their own intimate direction.    ""Hard Days Night"" is not merely a running monologue about young men trying to stay sane even as their admirers surround them with their insanity.  It is a true-to-life look at possibilities, some real and some not real.  When Paul's fictitious grandfather asked Ringo to put down his book and to start 'marching', the film is telegraphing that same message to us - to put down the conventional and look at the unconventional.  The only thing that could have made this film better is if they had sung ""Imagine"", the most admired tune of the last half century.  ""Hard Days Night"" takes us back thirty five years and it too ask us to imagine what life could have been like."

","I've seen this movie, if you can believe, at least 30 times.  Yes, you can call me a fan.  However, not everything they touched turned to gold.  (eg. Magical Mystery Tour) No matter, at the time it was released, this film was just expected to make a nice revenue for it's distributor (United Artists).  They felt that The Beatles were just a ""flash in the pan"" and wouldn't last longer than a couple of years.  They obviously were wrong.  The film turned out to be a blockbuster and the reviews were quite positive (quite unique and rare)for a rock & roll movie).  I recall seeing this movie at the theatre when it was first released.  I could not hear anything.  The screaming lasted from the beginning to the end.  I've never, before or since, had an experience like that at a movie theatre. The movie is full of excitement and humour (British humour was still quite new to us).  As actors The Beatles hold their own. The music is what drives this movie.  Some of their best songs are featured here (A Hard Day's Night, She Loves You, All My Loving, and the list goes on).  This film grows on you over the years.  It is still fresh no matter how many times you see it. A few years ago there was a rumor that the producer (the late Walter Shenson) was going to turn this black & white film into color. I was shocked to hear this.  Part of the greatness of this movie is the black & white filming.  It gives it a ""documentary feeling"" throughout the movie.  The rumor turned out to be false (thank goodness).  I was 9 years old when I saw this film and just recently my 9 year old nephew saw the film with me.  He loved the music and generally liked the movie.  He now knows who The Beatles are.  In the past year or so he just listened to their music.  It just shows you how The Beatles' popularity keeps growing to each generation.  Their music and/or popularity will never do away.  This film is going to be re-released to the theatres sometime later this year (to a select few, I'm told). If it opens in a theatre in this city, I will certainly be there once again. Perhaps I can ""relive"" my youth for just one more time. Rick S."

I was pleased to see a couple of months ago that AHDN was being screened on telly and sat down to watch it. Within a few minutes I was squirming with embarrassment but persisted anyway. After about another half an hour my wife couldn't believe how dreadful it was and left the room. I lasted a few minutes before I switched it off. It was like watching an old friend, whom you have recommended to all your other friends, making a complete fool of himself in public. An utterly cringe-making experience.

","The Beatles have much to be praised for, genuinely breaking new musical ground in their careers. However, one thing that's often overlooked is how rubbish they could be, too. Aside from a momentary blip with the Help! Soundtrack they didn't produce a decent album until 1966's Revolver. While they had some halfway decent singles the first three years of their professional life delivered bland generic pap that sounded like a close cousin of Gerry and the Pacemakers. Their twee head-shaking antics are also cringingly embarrassing to watch now, and in all honesty only three songs in this film are actually any good.<br/><br/>Ah yes, The Beatles films. Self-indulgent tripe the lot of 'em, from the plotless turgidity of Yellow Submarine to the Tragical Mystery Bore. Only George chucking his teddy out the pram in Let It Be produces any cinematic interest, so that while the superb Monkees film Head goes underrated, this pile of tat still gets criminally overpraised. To be fair, the direction is absolutely excellent, and the black and white photography looks superb. Yet while some of the one-liners are quite witty (Alun Owen's script certainly providing more mirth than the band's real-life Scouse banter) they are drained of anything approaching a laugh by the absolutely chronic acting. Shy George is predictably lame, though gregarious Ringo surprises by delivering a performance that can only be described as downright abysmal. John does little better, leaving it to Paul to be the one to hold any form of amateur thesping self-respect. The forced cheeky chappie dialogue and ""loveable scally"" characterisations soon begin to grate, and whoever told The Beatles they could act should be shot. The string of repetitive set pieces is fine for blinkered fans of the group, though casual listeners may become more easily distracted.<br/><br/>Most irritating bit is John's line about Ringo: ""'Ey, 'e's reading the Queen. That's an in-joke, you know."" Oh really? Well if it's an in-joke then why include it? What it really cries out for is incidental music to paper over the embarrassing gaps between mistimed lines. Other than two instrumentals the entire action passes by in a ropily acted vacuum. Only player to preserve dignity is Wilfrid Bramwell, effortlessly eclipsing the others in this sorry affair. Other things to think about: People who resented The Beatles' later years when they got heavily into drugs like to imagine this period as an example of a wholesome band. Yet John does a coke joke with a bottle and Ringo admitted to being stoned when he filmed the canal scene. Also weird to hear George's original docker's accent in all its glory. A fictionalised 36 hours in the lives of The Beatles so fabricated their manager is a red-blooded hetero male. If this was a true reflection of the lives of the group then I'd feel sorry for them... for they must have had very boring lives indeed."

","Even though I wasn't even born when The Beatles split up, let alone that I witnessed their biggest successes (I was born in 1978), that doesn't mean that I don't know them or their music of course. My mother as well as my father had a lot of records from what might well be the best-known pop/rock band ever and that's how I learned to appreciate their music at a very young age. I also knew that The Beatles had played in a couple of movies, but until now I never had seen one of them. Not really knowing what to expect, I hoped for the best and was willing to be surprised by it.<br/><br/>This movie tries to show us what the 'average' day in the life of the Beatles looks like. Traveling through the country from one TV-studio to the next hotel room, they meet a lot of people, but also take their time to have a lot of fun together, much to the despair of their manager and crew who don't always know where they are at the times that they need them. And to complicate things a little bit more, they also have to take the grandfather of one of the guys with them and all he likes is to play little mind games with every person that he meets...<br/><br/>Even though I didn't know anything about this movie in advance, I hoped that it would be some kind of documentary, showing how they had to deal with all the success and the crazy fans. In a way this movie does show that, but it wasn't exactly the way I hoped it would be. Realism clearly wasn't the first concern and too often you feel that some of the jokes have been staged. They just try to make you believe that this is a documentary, but the natural feeling of the documentary style is sometimes very far away and that's too bad. Does that mean that this entire movie isn't any good? No, certainly not. The music really makes it all worthwhile and it's nice to see some actual concert footage in between the staged performances.<br/><br/>This film will be loved most by the fans of the first hour who want to see their idols once again, but in my opinion this isn't the kind of movie for the people who want to learn more about The Beatles. But even when you don't know much about them and you just love the music, than I wouldn't hesitate to give it a try. I know I didn't and I liked it a lot. I'm sure that many others in my situation will love it too, just don't expect to see reality. I give this movie a rating in between 7/10 and 7.5/10. I loved the music, but wished for a little bit more of realism."

","It was many years ago that I first saw the Beatles' 1964 debut black and white film, A Hard Day's Night, on PBS. It had to have been during the 1980s, possibly during a pledge drive. Given that I was not a Beatles fan growing up, I didn't think much of the film, however, perhaps this was my bias, the wan rift of memory, plus the fact that I have become a much more acute critic of all things, including cinema, clouding my memory. Then, a couple of years ago I watched the band's second film Help! It, too, was not a good film. In fact, it was quite a bad film. However, most critics state that the second film was not as good as the first, and this includes Roger Ebert and virtually every other online critic for, according to Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 100% rating in terms of favorability.<br/><br/>Yet, the truth is, if Help! is, as I describe it, a 'bad' film, its 87 minute long predecessor is a flat out terrible film. That anyone would find this appallingly poorly executed, unfunny, hodgepodge of ill acted swill remotely entertaining is a testament to the depths human enjoyment can plunge. Yes, the songs from the bands' early era are good, but there isn't a single joke told in this film that garners even a mild teehee. That some critics suggest this film is equal to the great classic comedies of the Marx Brothers shows how addled some minds truly are. While it's true that, as Ebert suggests, this film had a profound influence on the music video industry that arose in the 1980s, it's had a negligible impact on film, itself. Michelangelo Antonioni, Akira Kurosawa, and Ingmar Bergman, among others, were already far more visually sophisticated and daring than anything director Richard Lester tossed into this film, along with cinematographer Gilbert Taylor. In fact, despite Ebert's claims that the film is 'strikingly original,' the very opposite is true- it is derivative to the core (think Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, the Marx Brothers, the Ritz Brothers, the Three Stooges, Abbott and Costello, the Bowery Boys- need I continue?); so, unless one wants to claim that being almost wholly and shamelessly derivative is perversely a 'strikingly original' thing to be, Ebert's statement is doomed to go down as one of the greatest examples of his tendency to cinematically brain fart. The screenplay, by Alun Owen, is simply abominable. The film consists solely of songs with a few poor comic tidbits in between. These tidbits consist of the boys running away from female fans, engaging in pseudo-blue banter with Paul McCartney's supposed 'other' grandfather, a man who seemingly undermines and embarrasses the boys at every opportunity, and arguing over petty matters with their band manager. The film ends with the boys titillating a television studio full of screaming young females.<br/><br/>Several things are apparent in this film: 1) it was designed merely as a moneymaking venture for, despite the brain dead criticism this film is utterly void of any real art, 2) the Beatles simply cannot act and their films, it seems, started their later slide into musical pretension, and 3) the Monkees'- television's Prefab 4 response to Beatlemania were almost infinitely better actors. In fact, their acting range was probably farther beyond the Beatles' than the Beatles' actual musical canon was above theirs, for the Monkees actually were good at improv; the Beatles weren't. And, the film is actually at its best during seeming improves. The clearly scripted moments, which seem less like even a first draft but a first premise, and which have the boys interacting with real actors is excruciatingly painful to watch and hear, as jokes that are decades old, even then, are told with a manic glee that somehow, if a teen heartthrob tells them they will magically regain their humor. One wonders why both of the band's first two films are so poorly made and the answer is rather obvious: producers rushed them through production for fear that the Beatles' popularity would fade and that the Rolling Stones, or some yet discovered group would make them passÃ© before the films were released.<br/><br/>The real test of the film's cinematic worth, however, comes from a simple test: if the film had been on a fictive band, made up of actors, singing Beatles songs, would the critics have trumpeted it so? Of course not. Furthermore, they would have used the films of many of the predecessor comedy teams I mentioned as proof of just how derivative this film is. However, this film's cardinal sin is not its pretension, but, aside from its poor technical quality, simply how dull and unfunny it is."

","I am the same age as Ringo Starr and was born only a little over a week before John Lennon, so I watch A Hard Day's Night with more than ordinary nostalgia, the kind that might make me say with Wordsworth, ""Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, / But to be young was very heaven!"" except that I'd be lying. Still, if there was bliss to be had in that post-Kennedy-assassination, Goldwater- haunted, Cold War summer of '64, it was to be found in watching John, Paul, George, and Ringo larking about at the movies. It was a breath of optimism, a statement that youth could conquer the world. It didn't quite turn out that way, but it didn't for Wordsworth either: He was talking about the French Revolution, which proved not to be so heavenly. This is, of course, one of the great film musicals, packed with engaging songs. They may be more lightweight than the Beatles' later oeuvre, lifting the heart rather than stirring the imagination, but they're impossible to resist. It also slyly, cheekily makes its point about the generation the Beatles are trying to leave behind: the ineptly bullying managers (Norman Rossington and John Junkin), the fussy TV director (Victor Spinetti), the marketing executive (Kenneth Haigh) sure that he has a handle on What the Kids Want, the Blimpish man on the train (Richard Vernon) who tells Ringo, ""I fought the war for your sort."" Ringo's reply: ""I bet you're sorry you won."" Celebrity is closing in on them, epitomized by the wonderfully elliptical dialogue in John's encounter with a woman (Anna Quayle) who is sure that she recognizes him but then puts on her glasses and proclaims, ""You don't look like him at all."" John mutters, ""She looks more like him than I do."" Alun Owen's screenplay, written after hanging out with the Beatles, absorbing and borrowing their own jokes, was one of the two Oscar nominations the film received, along with George Martin's scoring. None of the songs, of course, were nominated. Neither were Richard Lester's direction, Gilbert Taylor's cinematography, or John Jympson's editing, all of which kept the film buoyant and fleet.

","I'm not here to tell you that, hey, the Beatles are one of the most successful pop/rock groups of all time and that they actually sucked; I realize that the album that the film promotes is nearly flawless, its pretty much a template for every pop/rock album promoted since, but the film just didn't click with me personally.<br/><br/>The main problem is that it constantly employs a standard comedy approach, where the Beatles are young northerners, outsiders representing the youth audience, and in each sequence they outsmart or out-cool the establishment, basically anyone that appears wealthier than them, or in a position of power - its much the same routine as Ivan Reitmans later ""Ghostbusters"" picture, if anyone notices.<br/><br/>My other issue with the film is that the group don't really appear as themselves, but as slangy, Northern teenagers; they typify a youth culture that they've actually outgrown. The film is for the bands audience, rather than people interested in the band themselves.<br/><br/>I like the idea of comedy, rather than an earnest series of interview segments, and this movie was a massive commercial hit (they were the biggest act in the world at the time), but I found the experience oddly thin and disappointing.

","The idea of putting pop stars and their band in movies goes back to Rudy Valle and his Connecticut Yankees in early sound. With a fan base and popularity already established a large audience capture would be inevitable even if the story line was tepid. As long as you injected a half a dozen songs or more into the plot it was a recipe for success. Vallee didn't take off but Bing and Elvis did and while Crosby had better scripts the lame Elvis vehicles killed at the box office.<br/><br/>The Beatles phenomena was only a couple of years old when they released Hard Day's Night in 1964 and it predictably did excellent box office. What wasn't predictable was with the ease the Fab Four, albeit playing themselves, were at Marxian comedy. Under the stylishly hip (part mod, part nouvelle vague) direction of American ex-Pat Richard Lester, Night has an infectious energy that is bouyed by the comfortable impish charm of the quartet. Lester wisely avoids joining the boys at the hip allowing each his own space away from the other much of the film and they all comport themselves (especially Ringo) surprisingly well; though truth be told Wilfrid Bramble as Paul's rebellious grandfather steals every scene he is in. <br/><br/>There's an album's worth of great tunes (still selling millions 45 years later) that make the film an even better listen but the band's brand of dead pan and anarchic humor (Marx Brothers light) is more than enough to sustain this very amusing little film on its own."

""A Hard Days Night"" is definately a must see, for die hard fans and the newly converted.<br/><br/>

","A Hard Day's Night is simply the BEST rock and roll movie ever made. Thanks to fantastic direction, a FAB-ulous script, great music, and THE BEATLES! This day in the life film is as fresh today as it was when it was released in 1964. The soundtrack of Beatles music is fantastic and was voted #1 sountrack of all times by Entertainment Magazine.

","A Hard Day's Night is a fun movie that takes you through a few days in the life of the Beatles, at a dizzying pace. The music and the attitude of the movie make you feel like you are in the movie, running around with the Beatles and you can't help but scream the song lyrics along with John, Paul, George, and Ringo. The Beatles (especially Ringo), give wonderful performances. Wilfrid Brambell (the Grandfather) is hysterical and the other characters - Shake, Norm, and who could forget Victor Spinetti who plays the TV Director - add humour and wit along the way. It is one of my all-time favourite movies for its crazy, haphazard, comedic, rock video style."

","I missed the sixties, but my mom was a devoted hippie, and she educated us early. I saw this around second grade, along with Help! (the other Beatles movie) and I liked Help! much better. (This isn't great for young kids, I remember I didn't get it at all. I kept saying, ""Why don't they just sing the songs now?"") But then I saw the two again recently, and it seems like A Hard Day's Night is the better film. While some of the scripted moments don't exactly work, the Beatles weren't actors, after all, the dialogue is pretty good example of Beatle humor. The best scene, I think, is where they all run frantically around a field for a few minutes. This movie is a trip for those who experienced the sixties, and still very funny if you missed them!"

","A Hard Day's Night is a simple movie that encapsulates the true spirit of the 60s. Believe it or not, the Beatles did rule supreme - they effectively dominated the number one spot in the UK and abroad in their 8-year public career so much so that only a few singles released (such as Eleanor Rigby and Something) hit anything lower (like the number two and three slots).<br/><br/>
The Beatles altered perceptions of music forever, they were the creators of innumerable styles or at least they were the band that made those other styles popular (Helter Skelter was the 'first' heavy metal song people noticed, Tomorrow Never Knows is said to have pioneered techno music using electronic looping and such). People who say that Beatle songs are dribblingly poor owe their current favourite to this band for it would have a musical connection - that song would be a part of this group's influence.<br/><br/>
Opinions are criminally divided between those that simply detest the film and those that believe that the movie rules supreme. I tend to believe that A Hard Day's Night is a delightful, simple film intended to showcase the 'real' musical lives of the Beatles (which it didn't, upsetting Lennon in particular) and display the absolute popularity they held, the tension of their work and the bubbling personalities that made them stars.<br/><br/>The movie is energetic and vibrant - as vibrant visually as black and white can be. The simple story is intended not for serious consideration or to be sneered at - rather as a semi-mockumentary that showcases several small misadventures and seven Lennon/McCartney songs including the classics A Hard Day's Night, Can't By Me Love and If I Fell. These songs are by no means the technical masterpieces that would make the Beatles the most revered, timeless band - indeed, until Rubber Soul and Revolver, they did not begin pushing the envelope in any major way. Yet they are still enjoyable and it can be seen that McCartney and Lennon are just beginning to experiment with their musicality.<br/><br/>Released to ride on the wave of Beatlemania that would see Paul's house broken into for the photographs, Ringo's hair cut (for a souvenir) with scissors by a fan at a black-tie function and the two-concerts-a-day touring schedule, A Hard Day's Night shows us in its simple, undemanding yet exceedingly enjoyable way what life was like for a Beatle (for the most part) and the absolute fun that John, Paul, George and Ringo had on their trip to the toppermost of the poppermost. Watch it and if you don't like it, at least respect that these four chaps on screen changed the world forever through their music, their message and their sheer popularity."

","I hesitated to add a review for ""A Hard Day's Night"", since there are already plenty here. What drove me to add my two cents is the ""hate/love"" nature I gathered from the other reviews. Some folks seem to think this is the best film ever made (which it isn't). while others think HDN is a load of 'dingo kidneys' (which it also isn't).<br/><br/>It's a bit hard to separate this film from the overall impact of the 'fab four' at their height of popularity.  Maybe you had to be there/then to fully appreciate the magnitude of The Beatles influence. I was, and can testify that in mid 1964, The Beatles virtually owned the world. I think it was important to be at a 'certain age' to really 'get it'; I was and I did. Be that as it may, ""A Hard Day's Night"" is a time-capsule that has held up quite well over the years. If I had a nickel for every kid that saw this film and ran out the next day to buy a guitar...<br/><br/>Front and center is the music. Lennon and McCartney were getting their songwriting 'sea legs' during this period. The title cut, ""A Hard Day's Night"", along with ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""And I Love Her"" prefigure was to become a world-class songwriting juggernaut.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most striking aspect of HDN is that these boys really were charming personalities, and their typically irreverent Liverpudlian deadpan humor is very contagious and engaging.  For those who had only seen their 3 show Ed Sullivan stint (Feb. 1964, kicking off the so-called 'British Invasion'), this film proved that the 'fabs' were no flash in the pan.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some stilted moments, but these are far outweighed by delightful pre-Monty Python-esque humor and some genuinely good music performances. Many of the music videos of today owe a lot to the infuence of this film.<br/><br/>A comment about a couple of reviews who pan Ringo Starr's drumming: Ringo didn't play 'flash' drums in the later style of Ginger Baker (Cream) or Clive Bunker (great early Jethro Tull drummer). But 'Rings' laid down a VERY solid groove, whether live or in the studio. Having worked with and listened to many drummers, Ringo can play in my band any day."

","There are many reasons why i don't like this film. Firstly, the Beatles trying to be actors is incredibly annoying (well lets face it, they're not much as musicians). If you want to see 4 guys with massive egos running around trying to be clever, this film is for you. Ringo's music ability reflects in his acting. This isn't just a Beatles rant though. The film lacks any kind of narrative, and the mise-en-scene is utterly boring.

"erniemunger","2","6","36","8 December 2005"," All work, no fun
","First things first: A Hard Day's Night is astonishingly overrated as is, in my humble opinion, the band's music - not their actual impact on pop culture and stardom, mind you. This starchy marketing gadget is trying very hard to be a comedy, yet it is not remotely funny, unless Hallmark greeting cards make you roll in the aisles. Richard Lester's cutesy story would be half redeemed if it had some kind of historic, i.e. documentary value but since it chose to be an intelligence-defiant fictionalised account, it tells mainly of the inexistent acting skills of all involved and the inanity that comes with unrestrained business opportunism. After all, history shows that similarly shameful efforts done in subsequent decades, to name but ABBA: The Movie (1974) and the oft-discussed Can't Stop the Music (1980), have all failed in their ambition. But while these still had some unwitting qualities (the former for showing 1970s Australia and giving a fair account of the hype that surrounded the Swedes, the latter, a scatty exposition of the Village People get-together, for leaving turkey fans with arguably the best worst movie of all times), the Beatles plot is plain boring and, to some extent, an arrogant monument in self-indulgence. Come to think of it, A Hard Day's Night is maybe closer to another career spin-off, namely Madonna: Truth or Dare (1991), in that it is a crass experiment in public masturbation. It is therefore no wonder that Lester went on to direct such capital works as Superman II and III, and was still licking McCartney's boots when the 1990s and Visa-sponsored tours came around. Many have argued that the image is a great black-and-white grain, but I would retorque that such assertions are tantamount to celluloid fetishism. Face it: it's the sort of statement that invariably comes up when all bridges have been burned. In Bed with the Beatles, in any case, is all work, no fun."

","I'll admit straight off that I am a fan of The Beatles, I love their music, particularly the later stuff, but some of the earlier stuff is pretty good too. This film was made when they were at the height of their fame in 1964. Beatlemania was sweeping the world and it seemed they could do no wrong. Personally, I was way too young to be aware of all this, but I think there's been enough written about it and there's enough footage kicking around from then to get the idea.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the band and a period of 36 hours leading up to a live TV appearance. They are joined by Paul's grandfather, a 'mixer' as Paul calls him. Basically, he likes to wind everyone up so they end up having arguments. Of course he causes much mayhem, particularly for the band's manager, Norm, for the purposes of the film, and his assistant Shake. Throw into the mix a highly neurotic TV director and a collection of Beatles' hits from the time and you've got the makings of a film.<br/><br/>Now, the acting is not of the highest quality from the band members, although Ringo does show a little promise. Of the other performers, Wilfrid Brambell did a great job as the evil old grandfather (very clean though). Norman Rossington was very harassed as Norm and John Junkin did a good job as the clueless Shake. For me, the best performance came from Victor Spinetti as the highly strung TV director, he was great. Of course, John was played by John Lennon, Paul by Paul McCartney, George by George Harrison and Ringo by Ringo Starr.<br/><br/>As a film, I didn't find this very good, it's quite a mess with much chaos around everything the band do. I don't know, maybe it really was like that for them back then. The plot is pretty weak, but it does the job of showcasing the band and, more importantly, their songs, which were, for me, the highlight of the piece. I guess if you're a fan of The Beatles then you'll enjoy this immensely, and so, for you lot, recommended. If you're not a fan then I'd probably give it a miss, it's not a great piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>My Score: 6.4/10"

","Directed by Richard Lester (Robin and Marian, Superman II), in their first feature film together, and what could be considered as the invention, or early version, of the music video, The Beatles made themselves even more known to the world as one of the greatest and most influential pop bands of the 60s and 70s. Basically this film is a fictional day in the life of the band members, John Lennon (as John), Paul McCartney (as Paul), George Harrison (as George) and Ringo Starr (as Ringo). They are accompanied by Paul's rich Grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell) in places, such as their live performances and the opening scenes in the train, but the singers themselves are the ones the audience won't be able to take their eyes off. With some great comedy, and their greatest songs, including the title song, ""I Should Have Known Better"", ""I Wanna Be Your Man"", ""If I Fell"", ""Can't Buy Me Loe"", ""And I Love Her"", ""Tell Me Why"" and ""She Loves You"", this is an essential musical comedy and near biographical film.

Regardless of where they stand, nobody can deny them being a perfect contender for being the best of the best. Their music is simply flawless and magical.<br/><br/>The Beatles may have released their first album in 1962 but by 1964, they were on top of the world. John Lennon even had the gull to call his group ""bigger than Jesus."" The legendary opening scene features the titular song being played while the band members are running away from hundreds of crazy fans. This is one of the top ten opening scenes ever. Unfortunately, not every scene measures up to the legendary opening.<br/><br/>'A Hard Day's Night' is just a series of meaningless shenanigans over the course of two days that do not feel special at all. When they first get on the train away from those screaming fans, they meet up with Paul's grandfather. I was very surprised at how boring it was. Then when they break out into their first song, it is lively and enjoyable. Honestly, what Beatles' song ISN'T lively and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Nothing that happens in the movie is particularly interesting or fun. I'm sure it was funny at the time, but that was over fifty years ago. The Beatles were on top of the world. So this is a time capsule of the best band at the top of the world. Does that mean the movie itself is good? Not at all. Literally the only good parts are when they sing. Enchantment grows and amazement resonates.

","Almost unwatchable. The definition of dated, in tone, style, art direction, cinematography, editing, and more. Inconsistent, lurching from long static scenes to strange little dramatic bits, to musical numbers oddly apropos of nothing. You'd think a band, on a tour, with no other structure to get in the way, could manage to make the musical numbers more integral with the film.<br/><br/>It seems to have been stopwatch edited; every Beatle has equal screen time, so even if there's no other reason there are regular cuts to random ones mugging to the camera about what is happening elsewhere.<br/><br/>Even forgiving the pretty atrocious acting, it's just bad."

","Its some considerable time since I had seen this and still had fond memories, particularly of Richard Lester's iconic b/w look. Well, the b/w look is still there and looking even better in wondrous Blu-ray but you have to wonder about some of the performances, the material and the script. I know at the time not much was expected of the film and the general rush was so as to get it out before the lads lost their popularity. Not much chance of that in hindsight but the songs are really somewhat lacking and in truth it really is only the title track that has any zing. Time may have been unkind to the dialogue but it strikes me that apart from the odd aside (ad-libbed?) this is rather embarrassing. Also, I realise that Wilfred Bramble was big at the time as 'the dirty old man' in Steptoe but boy did they push that 'clean' joke that was never funny, even at the time. Norman Rossington is completely wrong in the movie and is given the role of some bossy schoolmaster type and as he over acts it, again this becomes embarrassing. Generally the Beatles acquit themselves well enough but it seems unfair that Paul gets lumbered with the awful Brambell when the other three at least get one decent moment each. In this respect that of Ringo seems outstanding, particularly with regard to his chat with the young lad by the river. Overall the film remains important as a showcase for the four lads but perhaps even more importantly for the dynamic and influential way that this is shot helping to change the face not only of pop music videos but British cinema as well."

","I watched this on the HULU channel via my ROKU stick. Great fun to see the Beatles in their very early days.<br/><br/>I was a teenager in 1963 to 1965, the years when the Beatles made their big splash here in the States. I remember their splash very well although I never became a big fan. Their music is pleasant with nice harmonies but nothing I ever got excited over. <br/><br/>This was likely filmed in 1963, or maybe very early 1964, when Lennon was maybe 22, McCartney was maybe 21, Harrison was maybe 20, and Starr was maybe 23. When you see them in this movie they look quite young indeed and they act like kids. It is very refreshing to see them before they were as big as they ultimately became.<br/><br/>They are all from Liverpool and, except for Lennon, from Merseyside. I recall back then hearing ""Ferry Cross the Mersey"" by Gerry and the Pacemakers and I had no idea what it was about. Now I know it is about the River Mersey, the lifeblood of Liverpool. <br/><br/>In a similar manner Lennon's ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", my personal favorite Beatles recording, was inspired by Lennon's memories of playing in the garden of Strawberry Field, a Salvation Army children's home near where he grew up in Liverpool. <br/><br/>Point being as a kid growing up in the States I heard the lyrics but had no idea what their connections were, later in life and with great use of Google searches I know a lot more!<br/><br/>This little movie is a contrived, humorous story about their journey by train from Liverpool to London for a recording session and a performance. There are lots of hijinks but magically everyone arrives just in the nick of time.

","Directed by Richard Lester and written by Alun Owen, 'A Hard Day's Night' is a comedy musical film starring John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr playing themselves. The plot although is fictional, however the life of the 'fab four' depicted in this film couldn't have been too far away from the reality at the time which was the height of 'Beatlemania'.<br/><br/>The concept of popular musicians starring in films is certainly not uncommon. But on most occasions, those outings turn out to be a shoddy attempt to make money by exploiting the popularity of the stars. This could have been a similar case considering the low budget assigned for the production of the film. But Alun Owen's great screenplay and specially Richard Lester's tour-de-force direction elevates the film from just being a showcase for The Beatles' music to levels of greatness.<br/><br/>As far as I am concerned the basic theme of Owen's screenplay is the exuberance of youth and the yearning for freedom/liberty. Instead of making the 'fab four' play righteous heroes, the script makes them play themselves in order to make a social commentary in a subtle way. Like in real life, the Beatles in the film also exist in Britain at a very significant time when the old somewhat Victorian-esque ways of authority and customs were starting to be gradually obliterated by the youth of the 'swinging sixties'. This rift between the old and the new gets portrayed extensively in the film like the encounter between older posh gentleman and the beatles in the train compartment or the moment when an older man asks the gang to get off his private property after their wild craziness. The members of the band in the film are youngsters who want to do what they want to do without having to be answerable to anybody. Their manager almost gets driven mad by the lack of discipline of the group which is another metaphor for defying the restrictions and refusing to get dictated by the elders. The wild girls going crazy for the Beatles and trying to get close to them by escaping the police and the security is their way to become non-conformists by embracing the boys who represented their idea of self liberation. An interesting aspect of the film is the character of Paul's grandfather. Although based on his age, he belongs to the older generation, but he actually is a young naughty troublemaker in an old man's body. He represents the kind of character that the 'fab four' would be like in their old days if they don't change.<br/><br/>For me, what makes this film a classic is Richard Lester's direction. He really adds the energy to the film. Some of the scenes have become very famous due to the directing techniques that were used to capture them. Lester's direction in the film is certainly heavily influenced by the style of the French New Wave. We see a whole array of intricate directorial tools like repeated jump cuts, Cinéma vérité style of cinematography in the street scenes to give a documentary feel, we see extended overhead shots, sequences with speeded up motion, etc. There are also some shots in the film where the characters wink at the camera a bit which is also a slight homage to the French New Wave. All these intricacies get put together and used brilliantly by Richard Lester to tell the story in a manner which goes with the themes and the nature of the characters. I think Lester's direction makes the film transcend genres. It has elements of a documentary, a musical, and a slapstick comedy all together. This must have to some extent influenced 'This is Spinal Tap'.<br/><br/>Although John, Paul, George and Ringo are clearly not the best of actors but they certainly add the wild charm and likability that is needed. What can never be denied is that they are funny together. Paul making fun of Ringo's dancing or John having funny arguments with their manager or George's weird encounter with the fashion moguls are examples of scenes where the easy-going but effective comedy comes to the forefront. I have nothing to say about their music. It is absolutely fantastic, both the slower tracks as well as the faster ones, but one will expect that.<br/><br/>Apart from the social commentary in the script and the uninhibited direction, I really want to drive home the fact that this film is bloody funny. I can watch it over and over again due to its vibrant energy and its easily likable comedy. This really is a Rock n' Roll Musical of the highest order and it does cinematic justice to the legacy of the Beatles instead of just exploiting their fame."

","A Hard Day's Night packs a lot of fun into a movie. Some critics say this film is part documentary, to which I saw just because the famous group plays themselves doesn't make A Hard Day's Night a documentary. It is a quirky comedy and a musical that tries to capture the essence of The Beatles, one of the most influential bands in history.<br/><br/>It is enjoyable how many comedic bits this movie is made of. Although it is definitely not the same type of humor throughout the film, some of it seems to pay homage to the Marx brothers. The comedy is all situational or dialogue-based, but none of it seems to be slapstick humor which comes into play only a few times in Marx brothers films. Though you don't find the urge to laugh at it, the first conversation of the film is amusing; Paul McCartney insists the man they sit with on a train is his grandfather, explaining ""I'm entitled to two, aren't I"" when the other Beatles insist they have seen his grandfather before. It is also amusing when the Beatles never seem to react much to things their managers get into a fuss over.<br/><br/>Although it touches on it only in a few parts, this movie also has great commentary on social class. A few minutes into the film, an older gentleman of the upper class shares the train carriage with the Beatles and he is immediately snobby to fit the conditions to his needs, which means the Beatles can't have the window open or listen to their radio. Then, inexplicably, The Beatles are running beside the train asking for their ball back, a great analogy of the situation.<br/><br/>Obviously the music in the film must be given thought to as well. The music is simply there when it is used and does not really contribute much to the story. However, the energy of the Beatles is captured with the opening credit sequence in which A Hard Day's Night is playing as well as in a scene with Can't Buy me Love when the four Beatles run around a field with a helipad to escape their ""imprisonment due to fame"" if only for a brief moment. Some of the music is just there, and some of it conveys energy.<br/><br/>The story is definitely not the highlight of the film. It is reflective of the Beatles' life as a band - the reason some may consider it a documentary - but it truly is not a documentary in any sense. It is a fictional story constructed around the idea that the band has an important performance to give. Don't set expectations high for a great story here because it is very straightforward.<br/><br/>A Hard Day's Night still has a good sense of energy and a lot of comedy, making this ""Beatles movie"" a delight to watch.<br/><br/>3.0/4.0"

","Within two short years, the Beatles had completely changed Britain's musical and cultural landscape. They had consigned solo ballad singers (usually American and called Bobby) to the scrap heap and men started wearing their hair longer, dressing more smartly and becoming fashion conscious. And now with their film ""Hard Day's Night"" at the Odeon, they were throwing out a challenge to a film industry that had previously made teen musical films with ineptitude and with disdain for the audience. Everyone expected the Fab Four's first film to be a cheap cash in on their perceived short term popularity, but in the hands of director Dick Lester, ""Hard Day's Night"" came swinging into town with a zing and a freshness and a brash with-it-ness. The story is slight, it's a day in the life of John, Paul, George and Ringo and Paul's grandfather played by Wilfrid Brambell who tags along with them. They weren't actors - so cleverly Dick Lester has captured as best he can the actual personality of each person and each Beatle gets his own little scene (except Paul whose scene with Isla Blair was cut from the final print) and Ringo displays a natural comic talent. Support came from Victor Spinetti, Norman Rossington, John Junkin and Deryck Guyler, and the songs included 'I Should Have Known Better', 'Can't Buy Me Love', 'If I Fell' etc. Believe it or not the BBFC were not too happy about a veiled drug reference when John sniffs a Coke bottle and asked for a dialogue cut when someone says 'get knotted', but this was reinstated in the 1980s for video release. The support at the Odeon in Glasgow was ""Bird Man"", a 15-minute interest feature about parachutists which meant that the film could be played five times a day at 12:45, 2:50, 5:00, 7:05, and 9:15, and queues were right along to and down West Nile Street.<br/><br/>Adapted from 'What We Watched In The 1960s (In The Cinema) Jim Doyle is the author of 'What We Watched In The 1960s (In The Cinema)', 'What We Watched In The 1970s (In The Cinema)"" and 'What We Watched In The 1980s (In The Cinema And On Video)'"

","If this is not the first film to deal with the life of music royalty, it certainly was the first influential one. What the Beatles were to music, their first film was to music biopics. It is cheeky and comic, rebellious in the most British way possible, and the cornerstone for the generations of music films to come. If you are a particularly nitpicky person who is both obsessed with originality and loves music films, don't watch this movie; you'll love it just fine, but all other music films will be ruined for you. Even though I'm not one of those people, I still can see myself pointing out, ""Yep, that's from a Hard Day's Night. And that. And that. Only they did it way better than this film,"" whenever I'm watching a music movie with a group of friends.<br/><br/>This film details an exaggerated but still believable day in the life of the Beatles with pizazz and sharpness. They play music, deal with managers, try new things, explore, and so on. There is a scene in which they have to answer questions from reporters.<br/><br/>One asks, ""Do you consider yourself a mod or a rocker?"" To which Ringo responds, ""Uh, no, I'm a mocker."" Gold (and apparently a real line he said). More importantly, it defines the tone of this film. It is not brash and anger-filled, like would be done if the film were modern or American and certainly if it were both. Rather, it is sharp and confident. It uses a cinematographic style that is typically used for documentaries without trying to push on you that it is a documentary.<br/><br/>All and all, it fits the persona and style of The Beatles quite well. For how much people love to complain about the facts that famous people can do pretty much anything without getting caught, this film and this group reminds that such is not necessarily a bad thing. The Beatles were not vile vagrants, nor were they trying to burn everything down. They were simply open-minded artists who acted as they believed all people had the right to act. Great artists lift society.<br/><br/>They also lift movies. Little to no effort was put into distributing this film, with it simply being used as an excuse to sell the soundtrack album. But the joke was on film when the movie turned out to be surprisingly good, a classic of the eras. I love it when that happens.<br/><br/>Above all, this film is entertaining. There are some parts that fall flat, at least for me, most notably being the scenes involving Paul's grandpa, hence the 9. I do not like this film as much as some; to me, it is more a scenic river ride than a swirling, striking rushing waterfalls of adventure. But still, what a river ride it is. I felt sucked into the atmosphere, into the world they created. I did not want to leave, certainly not after ninety minutes. I feel more connected to the Beatles and their mythos now. If nothing else, I can tell them apart even with their similar haircuts now."

","A Hard Day's Night (1964): Dir: Richard Lester / Cast: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, George Harrison, Wilfrid Brambell: A tremendous tribute to the Beatles regarding the height of their career where the seemingly normal becomes out right bizarre. They are John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison and together they deal with screaming female fans, nagging management, and Paul's grandfather who has his own agenda when receiving all four signatures on a photograph. Directed by Richard Lester with many hilarious moments and great musical numbers. It celebrates the reality that The Beatles became the biggest band in history. At one point it was claimed that they were bigger than Jesus himself although such claims must be taken from an amusing standpoint. The year that this film was released The Beatles made their now classic appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. This film is shot in appropriate black and white and more or less follows each member of the band particularly Ringo who goes off on the town with Paul's grandfather where they are arrested. Wilfrid Brambell is quite funny as McCartney's grandfather whose ideas are best left forgotten in terms of his influence. Hilarious documentary style comedy that simply plays out the humorous nature often associated with one of the most famous and celebrated bands in music history. Score: 10 / 10"

","For those of you (like me) who weren't alive in 1964, let me tell you this: back then, in Britain and America (and elsewhere), The Beatles were absolutely HUGE. Fans would swoon at their presence. So, naturally, it was decided a movie should be made of them. What came to be was: A Hard Day's Night.<br/><br/>This movie isn't entirely plot less -- It's general plot is The Beatles, playing The Beatles, make their way to a concert, showing what they do behind the scenes, as Paul's wacky grandfather, played by Wilfrid Brambell, tags along and gets in some crazy antics. It almost seems to be a sketch comedy. But since it definitely has its humorous scenes, I can't blame anyone for anything. All in all, I recommend this one. It's worth watching, but if you want you can skip it. It's nothing spectacular."

","I was a male teenager in the 1960's. To me and my friends, the Beatles and the British invasion was so important. We were normal kids with all kinds of other things going on, but whenever a new album came out we were there. There was so little footage of the guys because other than the news when they came to a new city, it was non-existent. Videotape was minimal. There was some film of their concerts but the screaming drowned out most of the music. When ""A Hard Day's Night"" came along it was gift. We had the ""Ed Sullivan Show"" and that was it, so to see all those songs being performed and hearing them talk and act. Fantastic. I couldn't afford to go to the one concert at the old Metropolitan Stadium (home of the Twins in Bloomington, MN) because we were a very poor family, but my friends told me they were unable to hear anyway. Still, it would have been a great experience. The wonderful thing about this film is that it is funny and intelligent and works so well. It is about the Beatles as it should be, and yet there is a surreal element that is so precious. So much has been written about Richard Lester and what he did, but he deserves it. A film that changed the world when it came to taking pop music to another level."

Watching the Beatles performing their songs was a treat and then there some music video like clips on certain songs that caught my eye. <br/><br/>If you're not already into the Beatles I would give this a recommend, it can change your mind on them."

","As it turns out, this wasn't the Beatle's movie that I saw as a kid (and I still don't know which one it is – all I know is that they went for a swim somewhere and landed up in a swimming pool in a resort) but it was still quite amusing. In fact this is the first full length Beatle's movie, and is also in black and white, which shows you how old it is. Actually, I quite liked it, especially the scene right at the beginning where John Lennon is given a bottle of coca-cola and he starts snorting it (gee, they even have subtle drug references back it in sixties – but then again this is the Beatles).<br/><br/>The film is basically a day in the life of The Beatle's, and is about how they travel from Liverpool to London to perform a concert. Mind you, it opens with them being pursed by a mob of adoring fans, and has them trying every trick to outwit them. They even throw a few more of these in when they arrive a various studios. Also, Paul's grandfather (the other one – he is entitled to have two you know) is coming along for a ride, and while he is supposed to be 'clean' he is anything but – including disappearing for the night to go and play bingo at an exclusive French casino.<br/><br/>There are even a couple of jokes about the drummer, Ringo, who by the way is challenged about how he spends all day sitting inside reading a book, so goes off for a wander which causes the others all kinds of grief. The other thing that I noticed (or somebody else did, I just picked it up) is that there is a theme about since they are now the Beatles they actually don't have time to themselves anymore. Even at night they are dumped with a huge number of fan letters that they are told that they have to answer everyone.<br/><br/>However, the main thing about this movie is the music. It is basically their earlier pop songs, so if you are looking for the psychedelic rock of their later years then unfortunately this isn't the film for you (maybe you should try Yellow Submarine, or Magical Mystery Tour). It is still quite a fun movie that got an applause from the audience at the end (but then again it was showing at Melbourne's cult movie cinema – the Astor)."

","In the space of 10 years the Beatles completely changed the face of music. A Hard Day's Night, the Beatles' film debut, was released a little over a year after their first album Please Please Me. Not even two years later they'd release the double-punch of Rubber Soul and Revolver, and just a year after that they'd rewrite the rock-and-pop rulebook with the seminal Sgt Pepper. Their energy must've been ferocious. <br/><br/>A Hard Day's Night captures this energy. We're introduced to them as they run, beaming, from their frenzied fans. They jump on a train. They catch their breath, but the frame doesn't; the British countryside roars past the window. They get off the train and run some more. They talk for a bit. They dance for a bit. They sing for a bit. Then they run again. The black-and- white photography and quick edits makes the thing feel like a slice of European New Wave, but injected with wry British humour and punctuated with a handful of the finest pop songs of the 60s.<br/><br/>The clang and subsequent clamour of the opening minutes is a dizzying amalgam of music and images.

Everyone knows that the Baby Boom population explosion ended in 1964, the same year the Beatles boys' band spearheaded the so-called ""British Invasion."" This was no coincidence, as you'll see if you watch A HARD DAY'S NIGHT. Every female pictured in this flick of child-bearing age--and there are thousands of them--is caught up in a frenzy of teary, screaming, energy-sapping mass hysteria. Their male peers are nowhere to be seen. At this time, self-styled demographers were freaking out about a ""population explosion,"" and the most explosive figure in the movies was the shadowy British intelligence operative James Bond. When you see A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, it becomes obvious that the ""British Invasion"" was a real-life Bond-like CIA\MI6 plot to curb the further arrival of ""excess"" American babies. In Colonial America Paul Revere may have warned us ""The British are coming, the British are coming!"" but this was something the flower of American youth no longer could do regularly once the Beatles came.

","'Are you a mod or a rocker?' is the question. The reply - 'I'm a mocker'. That's A Hard Day's Night for you. A ninety-minute sneak peek at the lives of The Beatles, it showcases, quite literally the trappings of fame. The Lads from Liverpool are ensconced into one enclosed space after the other echoed in this line by the four to the scriptwriter Alun Owen – 'a room and a car and a room and a car and a room and a car'. Any moment in the interim is construed, by fans as the opportune moment for a tryst with the four, and by the four themselves as a chance to breakaway, indulge in a bit of fun.<br/><br/>The film has a nice flow to it; the fun is scattered. Slapstick is thrown in too but much of the humour is a gentle mockery of the fame of the Beatles. A cavalier Lennon is stopped by a fan who says he looks just like John Lennon. When the Beatle doesn't aver she changes her mind! Paul McCartney comes across as the more concerned of the quartet while Ringo is the wandering soul. I couldn't get a fix on Harrison but this is the sell: one feels as if the four are very familiar. Richard Lester (director) has shown them in a very agreeable light; they come across as immensely likable and unassuming chaps, handling fame and mania with ease.<br/><br/>For a part-documentary-part-burlesque, the film is incredibly well shot. It's one of those cinematographic exploits that ram home the elegance and striking quality of Black and White. Be it the close-ups or the Beatles' antics or the sheer madness of the wild goose chases, Gilbert Taylor does a fine job and it pays off – you're never really bored inspite of there being no discernible story or narrative convention. The visuals arrest you then and there, keeping one engaged.<br/><br/>And then there are the songs. Taking off with A Hard Day's Night some of the picks of the track for me were I Should Have Known Better, Can't Buy Me Love, And I Love Her. Every one of them a chart-topper and hugely influential. None more so than the finishing piece, the frenzied She Loves You. A snapshot in all, of that time when the Beatles ruled and this was only the beginning."

The big guns didn't think they were worth colour! The movie was well written and well directed, even though Lester had only made advertisements till this movie. But they tried to show a fictional day in the life of the Beatles. The comedy works really well, working off the natural humor within the group, it's all natural from the Beatles themselves with actors playing all the other parts. I understand Paul, who thought with his theatrical background (Dad?) he could act but he was a handful for the director. The impromptu, train carriage scene and eventually recordings in a TV studio/theatre in front of a ""live"" audience. This was filmed when the usual musical was either a ""Elvis"" or Cliff Richard"" type setting.
