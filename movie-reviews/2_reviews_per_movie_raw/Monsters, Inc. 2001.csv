"vchimpanzee","Null","60","62","31 October 2004"," Adorable, funny, perfect voice casting for the lead roles
","I thought Billy Crystal and John Goodman were great. I like them anyway, but I can't imagine anyone else in their roles. John Goodman comes across as a warm, fuzzy teddy bear type in so many of his roles, and this time he was actually drawn that way. Crystal and Goodman were great together, even when their characters showed signs of not getting along. And Boo sounded so natural, so childlike. There's no way an adult could have done her lines the way they were executed.<br/><br/>And the writing was so intelligent, this movie was not just for kids. There were a lot of clever jokes that kids might not get. Still, the warm and fuzzy qualities of so many of the monsters make this a perfect choice for kids as well as adults, and I really don't get why ABC couldn't give this a TV-G rating. It may have been a little violent or scary at times, but never all that intense. Kids see worse on Saturday morning."
"ahill-1","10","130","149","12 December 2001"," Now here's a story children and adults can relate too. Monsters in the closet.
","While monsters in the closet may seem to be a scary reality for some children, `Monsters, Inc.' makes it light hearted by showing them it's all in a night's work.  The characters are as charming as the cast that speaks for them.<br/><br/>It's a learning experience children get to see how an industry works. Monsters, Inc. is an in-genius corporation that has scientifically learned how to channel children's screams into energy that is used for electrical power.  It has monster employees, an assembly line of doors (which give monsters access to children's bedrooms), a top-flight training program and some of the top Monsters in the scaring business.<br/><br/>There's a colorful Metropolis, filled with houses, buildings, businesses, cars and everything that makes a city run smoothly along with a population of colorful creatures.  One of the colorful groups of creatures is the yellow swat team.  Their job is to protect the Metropolis of Monsters, Inc. from human contamination.<br/><br/>But what happens when a human child mysteriously gets through the bedroom door and terrorizes the city with screams and boo's.  It's wondrous and funny.  In the mist of all this is industrial crime, brought on by greed. But, the story ends on a very happy note.<br/><br/>John Goodman is the voice of `Sulley' a colorful large blue-green ape like monster who's the star Monsters, Inc. employee.  He's some type of monster, cut, cuddly, and he has a conscience that leads him to feelings of regret about scarring children.  He becomes attached to Boo (voice of Mary Gibbs) a cute, little big-eyed girl who is mysteriously brought to Monsters, Inc. and in his quest to return her home becomes very attached to her.<br/><br/>Sulley's best friend is Mike (voice of Billy Crystal) who's a funny looking green ball with stick legs and one huge eye.  His comedy is seen through out the movie.  Mike is Sulley's driving force, acting as his agent.  Mike's job is to make sure Sulley remains the top Monsters, Inc. employee. But when it comes to laughter Mike proves he's on top.<br/><br/>Mike's girl friend Celia (voice of Jennifer Tilley) is the stylish employee who has Mike's best interest at heart.  Her job is to keep him out of trouble.<br/><br/>I give Monsters, Inc. a ten.  It is an animated movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family.  It makes for great family fun."
"MovieAddict2016","10","115","132","12 March 2003"," Does For Monsters What ""Toy Story"" Did For Toys!
","Monsters, Inc.<br/><br/>We were all, at one time, scared of monsters under the bed. Shadows of clothes in the closet. Weird sounds outside in the trees. I remember thinking there were all kinds of monsters in my room - not as much under my bed as in the closet. And once again, Pixar, who brought us ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2, plays on both adults' memories and children's dreams, making it equally enjoyable for both children and adults.<br/><br/>John Goodman voices James P. Sullivan, known as ""Sulley"" to friends. He is a big, blue, hairy monster with horns on his head and hands the size of a watermelon. Billy Crystal is Mike Wazowski, his wisecracking, one-eyed best friend. Both of these monsters live in Monstropolis, a world where monsters roam freely. Their city is powered by a rare source of power - children's screams. That is where Monsters, Incorporated comes in. At Monsters, Inc., monsters like Sulley and Mike open portals into children's rooms - through closet doors - and scare the children, capturing their scream in a little yellow bottle. Sulley is the top-scarer, bringing in the most scares. But Randall (the always enjoyable - even when animated - Steve Buscemi), a wormy, multiple-armed lizard-monster with the ability to change appearances to its surroundings, is jealous of Sulley, and will attempt anything to get more scares...even if it means taking a child from the real world and bringing it into Monstropolis. But after the child escapes, Sulley and Mike reluctantly look after it, all the while trying to get it back to the real world before Mr. Waternoose (the late James Coburn) and others find out about the incident...<br/><br/>""Monsters, Inc."" does for monsters what ""Toy Story"" did for toys. Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my ""Toy Story"" review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience's INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc.,"" but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for ""Toy Story 3"") and gives them the bare minimum.<br/><br/>But that is straying off the subject. ""Monsters, Inc."" is one of the most enjoyable animated films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I didn't enjoy it as much the first time, but I then bought it, and have since watched it many times. It is an instant classic. I will be watching it years from now, when I am old and frail and in a rocking chair. It ranks right up there with ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2, and all the OLDER Disney films from the 50's-70's. It has all the elements of a sweet, charming, emotional and pleasurably good-natured animated film. And, more coudos to Pixar: Thank you for not packing it full of the language and inappropriate content that Disney shoves into the dark recesses of their films nowadays.<br/><br/>Not only has Pixar brought back the ""Family Film"" genre to what it should be, but it also redefines it. Pixar's animated films are some of the most thoughtful, imaginative and enjoyable animated films ever - not to mention 100 % family safe. Thank you, Pixar, for getting back on track.<br/><br/>5/5 stars"
"jdesando","Null","81","97","25 October 2001"," `Monsters, Inc.' is the best animated feature this year and one of the greatest of all time.
","You may admire the hair detail on Sully the Yeti's arm, but you will be amazed at the warmth of characterization in `Monsters, Inc.,' surpassing even the great `Shrek' earlier this year. Goodman and Crystal are a comedic team reminiscent of the zaniest Martin and Lewis days. Crystal's Borscht-belt routines brought smiles even to this jaded and admittedly tough-on-comedy critic.  I thought Eddie Murphy's donkey in `Shrek' was smart and funny; Crystal's one-eyed monster is even better with its wry and annoying wit.<br/><br/>Cleaning the environment of child contamination is a hilarious conceit that turns around the usual fears children have of monsters in closets.  It is also a chilling parallel to the challenge of removing anthrax from today's letters. Generally, the allegorical underpinnings of animation are natural for the medium, powerful like the images of the novel `Animal Farm' for political and sociological levels of meaning.  For example, the endless-door motif in this film is an ingenious metaphor for the scary and glorious possibilities the present and future hold for kids.<br/><br/>Even before you see this feature, Pixar offers the short feature `For the Birds' -- a brilliant takeoff on Hitchcock's memorable film besides being a great commentary on diversity. The expressions around the animated eyes, as the little birds deal with the big bird interloper, are more expressive than those of most contemporary film actors, with the exception of Brando, Pacino, Depp, and Streep.<br/><br/>The short trailer for `Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones' may precede the showing as it did ours for an added delight.<br/><br/>`Monsters, Inc.' is the best animated feature this year and one of the greatest of all time."

","The best way to describe this movie in one word is; fun! ""Monsters, Inc."" is a movie you can easily fall in love with. It has some great fun character, some awesome moments and some well placed comical moments. ""Monsters, Inc."" is entertainment at its bests.<br/><br/>The voice cast is amazing. John Goodman and Billy Crystal form a great leading duo. Steve Buscemi is a great villain and James Coburn has a great voice that fits his character perfectly. John Ratzenberger as always is very entertaining this time in a role as banished Yeti.<br/><br/>The story itself is pretty simple but thats what makes it easy to follow and so much fun to watch. The movie not only knows how to entertaining but also knows how and when to emote. The combination of fun and emotional things is perfectly balanced and placed within the movie.<br/><br/>There is some great dialog but the true power of ""Monsters, Inc."" are the wonderful characters. Not is there only a wild variety of strange and weird characters but also some characters that are good for some serious laughs and Boo is simply adorable and a pretty fair representation of a kid in real life.

"george.schmidt","Null","66","83","5 November 2001"," An instant classic
","MONSTERS, INC. (2001) **** (Voices of: Billy Crystal, John Goodman, James Coburn, Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi, Mary Gibbs, Bonnie Hunt, Bob Peterson, John Ratzenberger, Frank Oz, Steve Susskind, Jeff Pidgeon, Sam ""Penguin"" Black, Daniel R. Gerson. (Dir: Peter Docter/Co-directors: David Silverman, Lee Unkrich)<br/><br/>There's something undeniably magical about a Disney movie that brings out your inner child and the streak continues to manifest itself in the latest with its fine track record with upstarts Pixar (the ""Toy Story "" films) in delighting children of all ages in one of the year's funniest (and most fun) films.<br/><br/>The childhood phenomena of imagining monsters lurking in one's bedroom closet or under the bed is in actuality a reality that exists solely for the world of the monsters to use all the energy extracted from a child's screams as their natural resource to power their communities and subsist in their parallel universe. Specifically Scream Heat (""We Scare Because We Care""), the corporate entity that harnesses the youngsters' reactions to its hard-working crew of creatures including our heroes James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (marvelously voiced by Goodman) and his best buddy Mike Wazowski (ditto Crystal). Sulley is a bear-like, blue and purple hairy and horned monster and Mike is a cyclopean lime green M&M clone. The two couldn't be more different yet both share their passion for their vocation and the only thing getting in their way is their rival colleague Randall Boggs (Buscemi, at his oiliest menacing), a reptilian nasty who wants to beat Sulley for the all-time factory record of most points racked up in a single day on the job  at any cost. Watching the proceedings is Sulley's father-figure boss Henry J. Waternoose (Coburn) – a cross between a crab and Edward G. Robinson – whose main priority is avoiding any ""rolling blackouts"" (in one of the film's subtle jabs at the current climate in our nation). Mike is in love with cutie pie receptionist Celia (Tilly) who also sports one eye and is afoot taller than him, with a hairdo sporting a Medusa twist (snakes sit atop her head) who wants something from him besides excuses to their frequently put-upon dates together. One day after work Sulley accidentally lets into their world a tiny 4 year old girl – a big no-no – legend has it that one touch is toxic and fatal! – which causes mass havoc wreaked upon the populace as the authorities attempt to corral the tyke while decontaminating the infected workshop's workers (a running gag has the SWAT like DEA agents popping in at a moment's notice whenever a sign of human contact – i.e. a small cotton white sock attached to an unsuspecting monster – makes its ugly presence known!) Mike is in a panicky sweat that they will lose their jobs and tells Sulley he can't hide Boo (the nickname the big guy dubs the adorable tot) and they must return her to her bedroom. Easier said than done when Randall gets wind of the partners abetting the unsuspecting crime and he too has his plans to use Boo for his own selfish endeavorsat any cost! The film is a laugh a minute romp and an incredible mix of state-of-the-art computer generated dynamics that truly enhance the candy-colored world of Mike & Sulley with its picture perfect depictions of moveable hair (see how Sulley's locks sway to and fro so naturally! A first for CGI imagery!) and expressiveness given to the one-eyed Mike who works his brow into a real sweat. Never before has voice talent been so perfectly matched and acted to a t than in the comic team of Crystal and Goodman with their characteristics smartly enhanced into their characters with Crystal's liberal use of his ""SNL"" Willy the Masochist (""Oh I hate when that happens!"") and Goodman's burly, awshucks demeanor fits his soft-hearted meanie like a golden glove. Sulley is the true star of the show with his emotional overload not unlike a kid learning to make a new life transition as he discovers there's more to his existence than meets the eye (same for Mike; pun intended). When he realizes that Boo (by the way, nice job by the producers to use real-life 4 year old Gibbs, in easily the cutest turn by a child performer ever without making an audience gag) is not threatened by his hulking presence. The laughs are largely thanks to Crystal's myopic M&M who is always one-step behind his behemoth buddy and slow on the uptake as the plot proceeds with his sly one-liners, sudden bursts of unrestrained anger and confusion, and slapstick antics leads the film into uncharted territories of hysterical laughter and a great breakneck roller-coaster ride with Mike & Sulley attempting to find Boo's bedroom door with Randall in hot pursuit gives the film a giddy headrush of adrenaline. The film is witty, bright, upbeat and has its shares of incisiveness (I loved the use of HarryHausen's as a local chic eatery that all the monsters are dying to get into; in case of those who don't know Harryhausen, Ray Harryhausen, is the premier stop-motion animator pioneer who gave life to scores of sci-fi creatures including the fabled ""Sinbad"" flicks of the 1960s and 1970s among others) that will undoubtedly have its constituents clamoring for a sequel pronto. Arguably one of the best films and funniest of the year; I loved it and so will you (and your kids if you have any; if not all the more to see it again) An instant classic."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","51","63","10 July 2006"," Nothing To Criticize Here - Very Solid Animated Film
","This is a very entertaining animated film. I've seen it twice and enjoyed even more the second time. Billy Crystal said he enjoyed making this film as much as any film he's ever done, so that's a good testimony that you'll get some laughs and enjoy this movie as an adult, too. <br/><br/>Kids will love it, I am sure. The ""monsters"" in here are funny-looking and almost lovable, nothing that would scare your kids (or you). Crystal has a bunch of funny lines but overall I found this to be as much if not more of a human interest story than a comedy. <br/><br/>There is a lot of sentimentality to it, even overdone a bit at the end, but that's okay. There is absolutely nothing offensive in here, either. The colors look spectacular, too."
"TxMike","Null","51","63","19 September 2002"," Superb animation, a most inventive story, fun for the whole family.
","""Monsters Inc"" came out on DVD this week, and now I have my own copy!! It is not very useful to try to evaluate this one against others since such an evaluation is so subjective. But I put it in the same superb category that such animated films as ""Toy Story"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""Shrek"", and ""Disney's Tarzan"" are in. <br/><br/>First, the quality of the animation and the picture quality. Unbelievably good. I can categorically say it is the best picture quality I have seen on DVD, and the movement and facial expressions of the animated characters makes it almost feel like they are real. <br/><br/>Second, the story. How inventive! The only thing separating the monster world from the real world are the doors. The company, Monsters Inc, must have millions of them in inventory, computerized for quick call-up to send in a monster to get screams and charge up their energy cells.<br/><br/>The main characters are voiced by John Goodman (big, blue, hairy ""kitty"" with purple spots) and Billy Crystal (short, green, one-eyed monster) and their acting add so much. Plus the great music provided by Randy Newman. Overall an hour and a half of pure edge of your seat entertainment. And that doesn't even include the 3+ hours of extras on the second disk. <br/><br/>You can select either standard or widescreen format, and I watched mine widescreen on a 16:9 HDTV with 5-channel surround system with powered subwoofer. Almost like being in a theater!!"
"astutekitty","10","60","75","16 January 2005"," One of the most endearing animation films created
","Pixar is the best! Of them all, Monsters, Inc. takes the cake. The realism of the characters' movements & feelings is perfect. The ending is a tear jerker on a happy note. At first I was concerned with the plot of monsters scaring children with a ""business as usual"" attitude, but right away you discover that the monsters are as terrified of the kids as the kids are of monsters.... wonderful juxtaposition throughout the film... a totally enjoyable, feel-good story. Buy it for the kids and let them watch it over and over. (adults may want to sit-in on more than one occasion themselves). Personal Note: For me, a mystery about this film was ""Roz""; the voice reminded me so strongly of the grandmother in ""Dinosaurs"", and I thought the character drawing was similar as well; upon researching the two, I found they are definitely different actors."
"Spleen","10","63","80","2 January 2002"," The best computer animated film of them all, and the most adult
","Until now I couldn't bring myself to believe that computer animation was the equal of either stop motion animation or hand-drawn animation.  All computer animated films looked a little (usually more than a little) too sterile, many were animated poorly (""Antz"", ""Shrek"", ""Final Fantasy""), and even the single unqualified success (""Toy Story 2"") provided little evidence that a computer animated film COULD reach the heights other kinds of animation could.  ""Toy Story 2"" had flawless character animation, but nothing as inspired as the best in ""Tarzan"" (released the same year, although I could have chosen almost any other Disney cartoon to make my point); effective art direction, but nothing to match ""Fantasia"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".  And I thought that ""Toy Story 2"" was as good as the art was ever going to get.<br/><br/>I was wrong.  This is far better.  And what's more, there's no sense whatever that the script (an unusually rich and uninhibited script) is bumping up against the limits of what the medium will allow.  It's now been proven that computer animation CAN be just as good as any other kind. Whether it will be allowed to be in future is another question, but for now, I'm hopeful.  What we have here is computer animation's first ENTIRELY unalloyed artistic delight, with every character gracefully and characteristically animated, every virtual set just right and pleasing to look at, and an eye-tickling mastery of colour, light and shade that I thought would forever elude CGI artists.<br/><br/>It's not fair to judge anything good as ""Monsters, Inc."" as though it were a children's movie, but I can't resist comparing it with ""Shrek"" - which emphatically IS a children's movie.  ""Monsters, inc."" is admittedly ABOUT children, in a sort of a way.  The inhabitants of Monstropolis rely on children's screams for their energy, and the central story is kicked off when one of the monsters accidentally brings a small child (which he calls ""Boo"") into the city.  But we never see things from her point of view.  We see things from the point of view of the monsters, who are all adults - and who, like most adults, see children as frightening, almost incomprehensible members of another species.  And they ARE.  To be sure, Wazowski comes to feel strong affection for Boo, but she never becomes more than a humanoid pet (which is not to demean the relationship).  This is a story about adults looking at childhood from the outside.<br/><br/>""Shrek"", of course, is a children's movie through and through.  Its attention span is short, it has an unthinking mean streak, and children will have a whale of a time watching the central characters (the bigger they are, the more fun it is) act childishly and make poo-poo jokes.  ""Monsters, Inc."" has too much genuine wit, characters too rich, a world with too much depth, and a story at once too coherent and too complicated, to be PRIMARILY a film for children.  This is not to say children won't like it.  Maybe they will. (Who can say?)  Here's the bonus: if they DO like it, it will (unlike ""Shrek"") actually have a beneficial effect.  It will make them less frightened of the dark."
"bryanrivera15","10","10","12","15 December 2005"," Monster's Inc. Review
","There's A Monster in My Closet!<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend Monster's Inc. to people of various ages. Not only would I recommend this movie for its endless comedic scenes, but also because of its refreshing story line. The combination of these two elements makes this film relatable to everyone for we seem to seek for movies that allow us to express amusement or for a new plot. Furthermore, the unique characters added to the overall appearance of the film.<br/><br/>I watched the film Monster's Inc. at the comfort of my own home on Saturday, November 13th, 2005 at approximately five o'clock in the afternoon as I listed my twenty dialectics and worked on my Film Reflection Journal.<br/><br/>I recommend Monster's Inc. to anyone for it contained many comedic parts. I believe that people of all ages would relate to this film because it achieved to have both humor for children and adults. It has the simple amusing scenes that children would laugh at for example when Sully gets stuck in the trash can and books fall on his head and there were also the new generation, hilarious scenes that adults would get such as the scene with the Abominable snowman. Its story line was another factor that would make everyone admires the movie. It was unique in the sense that everything that happened in the film was nothing like any other movies that I have seen. The beginning started out with Mike and Sully doing their regular routine of getting up, greeting everyone monster they pass by, and going to work where they would scare children for the sake of Monstropolis. Then a child from the human world comes into their lives, which will eventually affect the city of Monstropolis including theirs.<br/><br/>The characters in the film were made for the purpose of having the audience see a whole different side of them rather than focusing on their appearances. People could relate to the characters for they showcased personalities that we would display. They showed traits like jealousy, greediness, love, caring, confidence, anger, and more. Being able to relate to these characters allows us to become more attached to the movie for we see ourselves in the figures that are in the screen. We tend to remember some parts of our lives when something similar occurs in the movie. The last parts of the film showed Sully and Mike getting chased by Randall, who was attempting to capture Boo. I remembered my aunts chasing my cousins and me as we rode around with tricycles in the Philippines. This brought back memories from when this happened to me.<br/><br/>In my opinion, I think that the movie would relate more to children than adults for some reasons. First, the characters were full of life and animated, which would suit the likings of children. It included a lonely but friendly Abominable snowman who wanted to be accepted. Secondly, the character of Boo speaks for every child who watched the film. There were probably some children who felt the same way that Boo did and possibly even have dealt with a similar problem. I know that I related with Boo because she brought me back to my past time when I had dilemmas with monsters at night. If I could relate to Boo, I know that other children will as well. The way that the monsters went to work and used the doors of children to enter their realm and scare them was a brilliant idea. This concept really tied the whole movie together. It was a critical part of the film for this is where Sully and Mike met Boo. The way that they competed on who can gather the most screams from children affected the movie in a positive way for it added more comedic parts in it.<br/><br/>If you are looking for an animated yet memorable movie to watch that contains drama and comedy, Monster's Inc. is the film to choose."
"ManyGentleCuttlefish","10","12","16","6 July 2006"," My personal favorite Pixar movie
","Pixar. With only seven movies you've built yourself a reputation as the greatest current animation studio of them all. Dreamworks has made some good ones and 20th Century Fox's movies have made me chuckle a bit, and Disney has gone downhill in recent years. But you can consistently produce quality work with almost no stain on your track record (except A Bug's Life, the one Pixar movie I did not enjoy). But I've lost track of my thoughts.I'm here to talk about Monster's Inc., my personal favorite Pixar movie.<br/><br/>I'm a doodler myself, and wan't to be an animator someday. And I love drawing monsters. Weird looking, many armed, strange-eyed creatures. That may have been the 1st reason Monster's Inc. appealed to me. So many of these creatures looked like something I would draw, and I spent much of my movie time looking at the creatures in the background.<br/><br/>I also was captivated by the world that was created in Inc. A big problem for me in Pixar's newest movie Cars was lack of real explanation for their universe, like how they built their buildings. In Monster's Inc. the monster world is explained so much more in depth, and we really believe this world could exist. There's a beauty in watching the thousands of closet doors zoom around and I always get goosebumps from watching the ""scare montage"", because I now know the mechanics of the world these creatures live in. <br/><br/>The characters in the world are also incredibly well realized. Mike and Sully both are easily relatable to, and even small characters have feelings and motivations we can understand. ""Boo"" actually behaves like a young child would, and that helped me believe she had real emotions. But the creature Randall is what stole the show for me. With his many arms, chameleon-like ability and sheer voice presence, it was hard for me to keep my eyes off of him. But what really made me love this movie so was the characters. When it comes time for the ""sad part"" of this movie, I was sad. I was actually seeing an animated cartoon that managed to make me feel for these animated creatures without being emotionally manipulative. And I'm not afraid to admit that I cry 4 out of 5 times at the ending.<br/><br/>So, in the end, I can't recommend this film enough. I think this stands above all other Pixar productions and is definitely one of the best animated films I've had the pleasure of seeing."

","This is a resubmitted comment, the original was removed by a complaint from some anonymous aggrieved party. Let's hope the edits are sufficient this time.<br/><br/>You already know that this is the usual Pixar fare, which is to say that it is excellent, better than any non-Pixar animated film. Sure, you also know that and you probably know the usual reason given: that Pixar spends more time on basic storytelling values than anyone else.<br/><br/>Here are two elements of this that may deepen your appreciation. The first is that Pixar recognized early that 3D animation software allowed two types of advance in the third dimension. The first is obvious, that everything has depth and reflection and shadow more or less like reality.<br/><br/>The second is that once these objects and scenes are defined in the computer, it is no extra work to move the camera anywhere. it can loop and swoop in ways that we never could have before. Pixar decided to exploit this in their storytelling here and later in ""Nemo.""<br/><br/>Nemo was set in an environment where there was no horizon so the camera could flow and the watery feel of the place could make the unfamiliar fluidity of the camera seem more natural. Here, is where they tested some of those perspectives in the three dimensional door warehouse and the extra dimensions of going in and out. Those scenes make this for me.<br/><br/>The second interesting thing is some competitive background. In those days, there was a shooting war between Bill Gates, financier of Dreamworks Animation (and leader of Microsoft) and Steve Jobs of Pixar (and leader of Apple). This was in the heyday of Gates' dirty tricks and he was intent on burying Jobs forever. Pixar depended on the success of ""A Bug's Life"" their followon to ""Toy Story,"" so Dreamworks rushed ""Antz"" -- a cheapy -- to open a week or so before to steal the market.<br/><br/>""Bugs"" prevailed, sufficiently at least, and Pixar ramped up for their usual three year development of ""Monsters."" Dreamworks, getting wind of this, went all out with ""Shrek,"" their ""monster"" movie that could be released six months earlier. It only took a year because the animation is less perfect. But they were overt in their attack this time: ""Shrek"" made literal fun of Disney, the Pixar partner. The head guy at Disney was the model for the blowhard King who reigned over a fairytale kingdom populated with -- can you guess? -- all the old Disney characters.<br/><br/>Pixar/Jobs would never do something so spiteful. But perhaps they did subtly appreciate the use of windows and gates to the future that always seemed to go wrong. And now you can too.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

Before I have watched movies from Pixar like '' The Incredibles'',''Shrek'' or even ''Finding Nemo'', ''Monsters Inc.'' was one of the first movies made by Pixar that I watched and enjoyed a lot! The monsters like Mike and Sulley are charismatic and funny,and the story is very pleasant as well: <br/><br/>In the monster's land, the monsters generate their city's power by scaring human children.One of the biggest companies of energy is the famous 'Monsters, Inc', where Mike and James Sullivan work. James is very famous in his work, since he is one of the 'scariest'and the one who produces the bigger amount of energy to the company. One night, however, Sully uncovers a devious plot to rid Monster city of it's power problems but accidentally lets a human little girl to enter the monster world. The funny thing is that the monsters really believes that children can contaminate them, so, everybody is afraid of children, specially the little girl who entered the monster's world. Mike and James call the little girl 'Boo'and after seeing she looks harmless, they try to send her back to her world. But many things, Randall included, are trying to not let their plan come true..."

","Monsters Mike Wazowski and Sulley are the best scare team in Monsters Inc. The company catches the screams of children to power the city of Monstropolis.  However Sulley's main rival, Randall Boggs is up to no good and is working the rooms after the factory is shut.  Sulley stays late one night to find a door has been left open and that a highly dangerous little girl gets trapped on the wrong side of the door.  With the contamination unit closing in on them, Mike and Sulley must get the girl back into her room and uncover Randall's plot.<br/><br/>From the Toy Story producing Pixar comes yet another child/adult cartoon. The story here will satisfy adults and children but it feels like an excuse for things to happen rather than a story in itself.  Where Toy Story had layers of story this is quite straightforward.  That's not to say it's not good, but it is more aimed towards the children than the adults.<br/><br/>Similarly the majority of the comedy is aimed at children.  The only consistent laughs for adults come from the original `one-eyed monster' (where was that joke!?) Mike - he delivers plenty of funny lines and his musical over the outtakes is the funniest thing in the whole film.  The problem is that it doesn't have Toy Story's spread of backup characters to deliver one-liners, here we have the three main characters and a couple of baddies, other than that there are no really good support roles - even Celia is wasted as Mike's love interest.<br/><br/>There are still more laughs than many real comedies!  But it's unfortunate that it's only left to Mike to carry the adult humour.  The animation here has really advanced from Toy Story - just check out Sulley's hairy coat to see the detail.  At times you forget it's a cartoon - the characters and backgrounds just look so very real.  The final chase through the many doors of the factory is really exciting visually and is pleasing to all.<br/><br/>A great voice cast includes Crystal, Goodman, Coburn, Buscemi, and Tilly all do well, but Crystal is the only one that has much to do and he comes away with all the praise.<br/><br/>Overall it is aimed more at kids than adults and it's not near the heights of Toy Story.  However there is still lots to enjoy for all ages."

","Monsters generate their city's power by scaring children, but they are terribly afraid themselves of being contaminated by children, so when one enters Monstropolis, top scarer Sulley finds his world disrupted.<br/><br/>Monster's Inc explores childhood fear, the fear of looking under your bed or looking at your open closet thinking a monster would pop out. Pixar of course wouldn't make it fearful, but brought lightheartedness to it and made a highly imaginative tale of a fictional world where monsters scare children to power their city. This film is illustrated with creative monsters and styled with classy/jazzy music. The feeling while watching this is amazing and the emotions you feel for the monsters is just magical. Pixar has once again OUTDONE their-selves with every project they have thought of. Monster's Inc is definitely one of the top Pixar movies and also one of the most creative. If you can outlook the childish themes and look deeper into the movie's heart and soul, you will definitely be immersed in Pixar's movie-making magic. Most people would complain about the animation because animated movies have this thing when where one sees one, it's automatically horrible and childish. If one is made by Pixar, I highly recommend you sit down and see what they can do to animations; you will be amazed. 10/10."

","This movie is one of the most brilliant, creative and intelligent animated movies of all time, along with all the other Pixar Animation Studios' Movies. The characters are hilarious (Billy Crystal as Mike Wazowski and John Goodman as Sulley was brilliant) and heartfelt, and the movie exposes raw sensitivity with the separation of Sulley and Boo. The animation is incredible, the humor is witty and the storyline is flawless. This movie should be seen by any Pixar fan, Billy Crystal or Goodman fan, or anyone who just plain likes funny movies, lighthearted ones. Pixar, you've done it again, made a brilliant epic masterpiece! Congrats! Watch out for another appearance by John Ratzenberger (Hamm, P.T.Flea etc.). Hint: Himalayas! Overall, loved it!

","This film is great. It made me laugh out loud and made me feel sad when I was supposed to too. The monsters all live in a city called Monstropolis and they need the screams of children to power everything. Sully (the big blue furry monster) is the top scarer and he and his one-eyed green friend Mike work together at ""Monsters, Incorporated"" gathering screams. The monsters are terrified of the children however, thinking that if they get touched by a child they will die. One of the children (she ends up being known as Boo) gets into the monster world and everyone goes into a panic. Sully and Mike must return her to her home before she gets caught. Boo is a cute little character and that's a lot coming from me (I am not a huge fan of small children - it may be because she isn't real). There is also an evil creepy monster called Randal who is planning on kidnapping children to harvest as much scream as possible. The animation was great, I am always amazed at the patience that must go into animating hair, Sully is very hairy. As with all Pixar films there are ""bloopers"" during the credits which were really funny. With some of the rubbish that Disney seems to be coming out with (Little Mermaid 2, Jungle Book 2 anyone?), Disney/Pixar has to be the wave of the future."

","I was recently gifted a ""100 movie advent calendar"" for Christmas. When you are ready to watch a movie you scratch one of the boxes off and it tells you what to watch. The first draw was Monsters, Inc. I haven't seen this classic for over 10 years, but my wife was pulling quotes out verbatim. The opening 10 minutes are executed to perfection. The characters are introduced nicely, the plot and obstacle to overcome laid out, the world built, and the comedic timing perfect. The compilation of Mike training Sully with scare exercises had me rolling. The movie does lose steam after this first 10 minutes but it certainly never sputters out. Monsters, Inc. is a classic for a reason, and is a must see."
"jamesrupert2014","9","2","2","8 January 2019"," Monstrously clever and funny early Pixar CGI feature
","Sully and Mike (voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal) are employees at Monsters Inc., a scream-fueled plant that provides power to Monsteropolis. Screams are generated by 'scarers' (and Sully is the best), who enter children's bedrooms via the closet and are harvested by their partners (in Sully's case, his best friend Mike). Extreme care must be taken, as children are highly toxic to monsters, so when one is accidently transported to the factory, pandemonium ensues. The film is the fourth of Pixar's full length animated features and like most of the studio's work, is excellent. The story is fun with a clever 'twist' to the ending, the animators manage to inject a tremendous amount of character and personality into the CGI characters, and the choice of voice talent is perfect (I especially liked Steve Buscemi as the chameleonic villain Randall). CGI technology has advanced considerably since the film was released but the imagery still holds up and the vast 'closet door' storage facility is great. Typical of the studio, there are a lot of amusing details in the background that are worth watching for. Good, timeless fun for all ages."

","This film had really cool, imaginative animation.  Plus the plot was entertaining.  I liked the idea of children's screams powering Monstropolis, cute and funny.  The little girl, Boo, had such a funny, little laugh.  I liked how all the monster characters had their own personalities.  From the striking colors to the way the hair moved on Sully to the snow blizzard, the CGI was great.   I also liked the expected chase scene because it was  a little different in this movie. Here, Sully, Mike, and Boo travel through doors and come out in different places and out of different doors as they are being chased by the evil Randall as they search for Boo's door.  I just really liked the uniqueness of these scenes.  Also, the final scene was touching, and we get to see how Sully's character transform from a scarer to someone who just wants to make kids laugh. <br/><br/>

I couldn't get into A Bug's Life or the Toy Story movies (though they were just as well-made) but when I saw Monsters Inc I was amazed. The colours are beautiful and the monsters actually have individual personalities that you can form an opinion about. My personal favourite is Sully - the way the bond grows between him and Boo is wonderful to watch, and he's such a tender, caring character. It's the only animated movie that has ever truly moved me - the ending brought a tear to my eye. I cannot find any fault with this movie and I fell in love with it the first time I saw it.

"zetes","9","7","13","18 February 2002"," Pixar's glowing reputation takes yet another step forward
","First came Toy Story. It was cute, but lacked bite. The technology was new, and Pixar was still experimenting. Next came A Bug's Life. It was remarkable. Then came Toy Story 2. Even better! Now here is their fourth feature: Monsters Inc. I'm not sure that it's better than Toy Story 2, but at the very least it's equal. It doesn't compare with that film in terms of hilarity. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, is one of the funniest films of the past several years, if not the funniest. However, Monters Inc. has a couple of advantages over TS2 (and, I promise you, it is at least as funny as any other film from 2001). First, the animation is even better than TS2. What? What did you say? Shrek? Ugh, don't even mention that waste of hard-drive space. Monsters Inc. is simply gorgeous in its color schemes. And the movement of the characters is so smooth it looks almost as if it were just the best stop-motion animation ever created. In the film, there is a Japanese restaurant that the monsters go to that's named after the great stop-motion master Roy Harryhausen. I'm sure he'd be stunned at the accomplishment. Second, it has a couple of the most exciting sequences in animation history, especially the climactic sequence in the door room. That's a scene that'll go down in the books. And, third, it's perhaps the first Disney film since Dumbo to be touching, but not cloying. Although some people have told me that the one song in TS2 made them cry, I personally was cringing through that number. There's a scene in Monsters Inc. that honestly made me cry. Generally, that's not much. I'm easily moved. However, I don't fail to notice if a film is emotionally manipulative. That's not the case here. The only other Disney moment that really touched me that deeply is the ""Baby Mine"" song from Dumbo. I think that the only people who don't cry during that song are convicts on death row. I really loved the characters in Monsters Inc. The relationship that develops between Sully and Boo is truly touching. It's developed in a very natural way. And it certainly helps that Boo is easily the cutest kid in the universe, even if she's not real. There were a lot of ""aww""s in the theater, but they were coming from college students, not maddening parents trying to get their kids to pay attention. Oh! And did I mention that the film's villain is one of Disney's best? He's a chameleon-like monster named Raymond, voiced by Steve Buscemi. Sure, his motives aren't all that interesting, but I love the way he moves. It's amazing. And his face is so expressive, but not too expressive like the characters in, say, ahem, Shrek.<br/><br/>As much as I would love to, I can't say that Monsters Inc. is a perfect film. There are a couple of flaws. The first fifteen minutes or so, basically until Boo wanders out into the monsters' world, are pretty boring. By this point, though, I was so amazed at the beauty of the artwork that I hardly cared. Also, most of the monsters aren't very interesting looking, that is, besides the colors. Raymond and the big boss of Monsters Inc., who is a spider-like creature, are the most interesting. Also, Billy Crystal's girlfriend in the film, a Medusa-like creature, with snakes for hair that copy her emotions, is very cool. Most of the other monsters are so cute that it's a wonder that they can scare children at all! (That's how they get fuel, by the way; children's screams power the monsters' world). Sully, for instance, who is the main character, more or less (the commercials concentrate on Billy Crystal's character more, for some reason; the logic must be that Billy Crystal is a bigger box office draw than big, fat John Goodman, a pretty insulting thought). Anyhow, Boo comes into the monsters' world because she thinks he is a giant kitty! We can't blame them too much for this, though. You know Disney would never produce a film that didn't have an ability to push their line of plush toys. Some of the monsters, though, are kind of boring. This is especially true with Mike, the little green cyclops ball played by Crystal. Sully could become a classic hero, and Raymond a classic villain, but it's doubtful Mike will stick in your head for as long. Crystal is, however, very funny in the film (and that might be the only time I'll ever say that!). He'll never be as boring as Shrek, nor as painful to listen to as Eddie Murphy as the donkey in Shrek. The story of Monsters Inc. is full of cliches, which is unfortunate. As I've been trying to point out, most everything else about the film is so inventive that it's not too noticeable, but it will never be unnoticeable. You'll see the revelation that the monsters have at the end two hours before the movie starts. Your youngest child might not figure it out, but anyone over eight will know as soon as it's humanly possible. There's also the kind of betrayal that's popping up so often now in animation, well, in all movies, really, that you can almost take it for granted anymore. And, heck, I would've predicted it myself if I weren't being so enormously entertained! If it weren't for these cliches, Monsters Inc. might have ended up earning the title as one of the best movies I had ever seen. Still, I'll never forget it! Now, what can Pixar possibly do to surpass this? 9/10."
"Movie-12","7","11","25","18 November 2001"," Colorful images and great imagination, but one heck of an annoying character. *** (out of four)
","MONSTERS, INC. / (2001) *** (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>When I was a kid, I imagined a world of monsters just like the one in ""Monsters, Inc."" I dreamed of a magical kingdom full of strange, menacing creatures. Creatures that waited anxiously for bedrooms to darken at night so they could jump out of closets and scare unsuspecting children. Alone in my darkened bedroom, surrounded by complete and utter silence, I heard lots of strange noises. When I noticed something unusual, like a sudden squeak or a shadow on the wall, it wasn't uncommon for me to pull the covers over my head. Heck, don't tell anybody, but I still do that today.  <br/><br/>
Children will remember the characters of this film long after they see it. Expect to hear comments about monsters in the closet weeks after they see it. But their remarks will not come out of terror, but out of pure joy. The Academy Award-winning creators of ""Toy Story"" give us a new, pleasing insight on monsters. It turns what was once a motif for terror into an imaginative realm of entertaining delight.<br/><br/>This computer animated production represents the most advanced technology of Disney and Pixar, the highly acclaimed team behind such family gems as ""A Bug's Life,"" and ""Toy Story 2."" From its convincing depiction of monster fur, to the realistic shadowing, lighting, and movement, the filmmakers pay close attention to the even the slightest details. <br/><br/>The story revolves around a massive corporation where all kinds of monsters reside. It's called Monsters, Inc., the biggest scream processing factory in the monster world. Set in Monstropolis, the main power source of the city is the collected screams of human children. We meet a hairy blue creature named Sully (voiced by John Goodman), and his friend, roommate, and assistant, Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal). These guys are the best scream producers ever, much to the dismay of Randall Boggs (voiced by Steve Buscemi), a creepy, lizard monster who will stop at nothing to claim their coveted standing. <br/><br/>One day, Sully accidentally allows a human child to enter the monster world. To complicate matters, human children are said to be highly toxic to monsters and should be avoided at all costs. Sully quickly finds his career in jeopardy and his life in total chaos. When Mike enters the situation, the two uncover a scandal at Monsters, Inc. that will place their very lives in jeopardy. <br/><br/>""Monsters, Inc."" works rather well until it introduces this annoying little girl as a plot device. I know I am being excessively critical here, and I know that my personal hatred for whiny, giggly, squirmy infants seized me over. Some audiences will find this character absolutely adorable, maybe even as the film's most distinguished. Though for me, this character almost destroyed the entire movie.  <br/><br/>I understand the need for a child to enter Monstropolis, but why couldn't the film have had fun with the idea. Perhaps it could have used a child old enough to understand his circumstances, but young enough to delight in the wonder of his newly discovered world. Instead, the movie gives us a nonsensical plot in which the infant gets herself into one problematic situation after another. <br/><br/>This has worked before. In ""Baby's Day Out"" we laughed at the accidental irony of the situations. Here, the character gets herself into these situations. She becomes a nuisance even as she initially appears on screen. There is nothing innovative or creative with a young girl running in and out of rooms, yet ""Monsters, Inc."" insists it's funny. The film becomes a one-joke comedy. If you're old enough to cross the street by yourself, you're probably too sophisticated for this humor. <br/><br/>Despite this parasite of a character, ""Monsters, Inc."" still manages to come out of the one-joke routine and display a third act of climbing excitement, surprising twists, and entertaining action that will amuse children of all ages. If not for the pesky little girl, this movie might have been one of the most colorfully creative films of the year. All though it is not, ""Monsters, Inc."" does contain enough imagination and colorful images to warrant a trip to the multiplex. <br/><br/>But don't say I didn't warn you about the kids. During the screening I attended, jam-packed with children running all around and making noise, I had a little boy sitting behind me that kept kicking my seat. Now that's something I never want to see coming out of my closet."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","5","9","16 June 2009"," Definitely one of the best films of 2001!
","This was a wonderful movie, with colourful characters, a fun storyline, and a funny and sometimes touching script.(I liked Shrek as well, but I slightly preferred this) I don't think it is quite as good as Toy Story, but I found it an enormously entertaining film, it was much better than I expected. The animation was truly excellent, with colourful and engaging backgrounds, and no stiff movements as far as I could see. I wasn't hugely keen on the song playing over the end credits, but compared to the overall goodness of the film, that is such a minor criticism, and it is fair to say that people have different tastes in music. The script was very, very funny, particularly with the character Roz. The voice talents were fantastic, John Goodman and Billy Crystal were brilliant as Sulley and Mike, Steve Buschemi clearly has a lot of seedy fun as Randall, Jennifer Tilly is wonderfully innocent as Mike's girlfriend, and the late James Coburn is wholly convincing as Waternoose. And I loved the character of Boo, she was so cute, and I loved the ending, people complained it was overly-sentimental but I thought it was so sweet. The story, as is always the case with Pixar films is highly original and charming, and doesn't drag at all. Overall, a wonderful film, truly entertaining and a must-see, and if you are starting to lose faith in Disney and their countless sequels, this is perfect for you. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox."
"JasonGOrtiz","10","3","5","26 March 2008"," The best Pixar effort so far.
","I know. That's a pretty bold statement. Don't get me wrong, ""The Incredibles"" is certainly worthy of mentioning in this post as is ""Toy Story"" & ""Finding Nemo"". Hell, there hasn't been a weak Pixar film yet. ""Cars"" is definitely my least favorite, but was still miles ahead of anything Dreamworks has done.<br/><br/>But for me ""Monsters Inc."" is just the complete package. Obviously the animation is stellar. That pretty much goes without saying for this company. But the animation isn't even the greatest strength of this film. Like ""Toy Story"" before it, the characters in this movie possessed depth and personality, as much as any live action film. Whoever didn't fall in love with Boo upon first introduction, is either heartless or a robot. And furthermore the relationship that develops between Sully and Boo is absolutely touching, while the dynamic of Mike and Sully's relationship is complex and anything but uninteresting.<br/><br/>And then there's the real accomplishment of ""Monsters Inc."" which is the originality and creativity inherent in every aspect. This film has such a rich imagination that can be found in everything from the Characters to the films sense of humor. And the plot is one of the most original pieces of screen writing I've ever seen. The first thing I thought after seeing this movie for the first time (And I went to catch the Star Wars: Episode II trailer, not expecting too much from the actual movie!) was ""How in the hell did they dream that up?!?"" I always admire when a movie provides a story that you know was given the utmost thought and attention, and this is no exception.<br/><br/>Upon further viewings I began seeing it as timeless fairy tale. Like a household bedtime story that's been around for centuries. I was certain it would have at least an 8.0 rating on this site and was a little confused to see otherwise, especially with other Pixar works in the top 250. But alas I know that this is all just my own opinion and not everyone agrees. Is there anyone else that feels so strongly about this movie? Am I crazy? Dellusional? Maybe all of the above.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day this truly is a great piece of film. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and walk, no run... you know what take your time, but get somewhere that has this movie and watch it. Alright, you know what? Forget about the whole ""take your time"" thing. Go now!"

","Monsters Inc. is just what I expected, Amazing. Every time I see a Pixar movie, from the spectacular Finding Nemo, or the hilarious Toy Story, I know I will be enjoyed. Pixar has such a way with making movies interesting to all ages. Because everyone of all ages, can relate to these characters, or the plot. From all the special features and commentaries I watch on these movies, the directors and writers really do spend so much time in making sure all audiences can watch their movies.<br/><br/>Now that I have talked about Pixar, I will talk about Monsters Inc. The movie is just wonderful. From the first scene, where the monster is just totally destroying this kid's room, to the last scene, where Sulley finally sees Boo again, I laugh, I worry, I feel. If anyone says there is nothing funny in this movie, they must either have no sense of humor, or a really bad sense of humor, or just want to be cynical. The movie is HILARIOUS, with lines such as ""did you loose weight, or a limb"" The voices are wonderful, John Goodman just has this wonderful voice for animated films, it is so deep and hard, but tender and soft. Billy Crystal is just wonderfully funny. Even all the little characters, like the abominable snow man, are just hilarious. And the story is also touching, you really feel for Boo, and her relationship with Sulley, and even with Mike.<br/><br/>I think the thing that makes Pixar so different from all other animation companies such as Dreamworks, Pixar doesn't very many vocal songs. They have an orchestra do most of their music. It gives the movies much more of a genuine tone. Even though i love the sound track to Shrek and Shrek 2, I feel i watch the movie for the music, not the plot. Pixar has such amazing music, you don't realize that it almost another character to the films.<br/><br/>Overall, Monsters Inc. is a wonderfully entertaining film and should be watched by any age group."

","10 reasons why ""Monsters, Inc."" was robbed by ""Shrek"" at the Oscars:<br/><br/>1.

The humour is less scatological and more character-based.<br/><br/>3. The animation is so effective that it's hard to believe it's animation (two highlights are Sullivan's sleigh ride down a snowy mountain at night and the door chase climax - door chase? Just see the movie)...<br/><br/>4. ...but the movie never gives you a chance to just wind up being amazed at how it looks and forget about how it feels.<br/><br/>5. It doesn't try and impress you with its pop-culture references and how clever it is generally (there is a restaurant called Harryhausen's, but that doesn't really count).<br/><br/>6. The voice performances; one of the tests of a cartoon is if the voice cast isn't distracting, and save the Abominable Snowman (voice of John ""Cliff Clavin"" Ratzenberger) that isn't the case. Kudos all round, but particularly Crystal, Goodman, Coburn, and Bonnie Hunt as the aforementioned martinet (see #1).<br/><br/>7. Only one ""proper"" song, and even then it's by the great Randy Newman.<br/><br/>8. The relationship between Sullivan and Boo (the little girl who gets into Monstropolis) is genuinely touching.<br/><br/>9. The end credits not only feature always welcome ""outtakes"" but also follow up a plot strand from the movie itself.<br/><br/>10.

","MONSTERS INC - 2001<br/><br/>Directed by ​Pete Docter, Lee Unkrich & David Silverman<br/><br/>Starring Billy Crystal, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi<br/><br/>Plot Overview: ​Monsters Incorporated is the largest scare factory in the monster world, and James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) is one of its top scarers. Sullivan is a huge, intimidating monster with blue fur, large purple spots and horns. His scare assistant, best friend and roommate is Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a green, opinionated, feisty little one-eyed monster. Visiting from the human world is Boo (Mary Gibbs), a tiny girl who goes where no human has ever gone before.<br/><br/>This movie is a definitive representation of Pixar Standard, back in their golden age. I am confident it will become an animated classic, and rightfully so. It is rare for a movie to come out that is so original, creative and imaginative. The voice acting is amazing, especially from Crystal and Goodman. The animation is great. My main flaw with the movie is how awful the plot is.<br/><br/>It's a paper thin plot that features way too many 'twists and turns' to make it interesting. I don't know a SINGLE person who says they were interested by the plot of this movie. I don't. My adoration for this film stems from the colourful characters, not an overly complicated plot about power shortages. <br/><br/>Two things that are kinda plot related that I do like, however, are are the climax and the final scene of the movie. The climax for this movie is an insanely fun ride and it is just so creative in how it is handled. Then the final scene of this movie. I mean damn it is a punch to the stomach. I'm not spoiling anything but I mean, damn Pixar. Why. Don't do this to me.<br/><br/>As far as performances go, this movie is very strong. Billy Crystal gives one of my favourite Pixar performances as Mike Wazowski and is the standout of this film. He is consistently funny and Crystal showed some impressive range in emotion delivered. John Goodman is also excellent as Sully and provided as strong, authoritative presence to the role. Steve Buscemi is great as Randall and makes him one of my favourite Pixar villains, easily. James Coburn was alright as Waterloose but I really did not find his character interesting in the slightest. The design on him was amazing though. Boo is a cute character and serves her purpose so I can't really praise nor fault her. <br/><br/>For the time of this film's release, the animation is exceptional. Seriously, it looks fantastic for the time. I absolutely love the character design for all the characters. Each and everyone is unique and hints at the characters personality without requiring them to speak much at all. One minor flaw with the animation is that Boo looks like a plastic doll. She doesn't look human at all. I understand there were limitations at the time but it is sill a flaw. It is a well shot and edited movie. <br/><br/>Comedy wise, this is probably one of Pixar's funniest. The humour is genuinely good and that primarily comes down to Crystal's impressive performance and vocal talent. As far as emotional payoff goes, this movie also succeeds. The last scene is all I need to refer to because that scene is Pixar punching me in the stomach continuously. It is very well done.<br/><br/>This movie is a prime example of what Pixar is capable of. It is funny with good emotional payoff, it has great animation, great vocal performances and a fantastic premise. It truly is an exceptional movie. I'll rate Monsters Inc 9 Googlybears out of 10!"

","I am always happy too see a Pixar movie. They have not yet disappointed and there films are always perfect. They missed a few things in Cars. But smashed away by worries away with Ratatouille. They haven't made one bad film. Just by the knowledge of Monsters Inc being made by Pixar should be enough for anyone to see this. Again another superb animated movie.<br/><br/>The animation was great. Wonderful color and details. After a little while the characters stop being 3D images and start being lovable and actually have the ability to move you to tears.<br/><br/>Even though there are monsters in this it is still suitable for kids. There are some scenes that could scare young kids. But they shouldn't scare kids too much.<br/><br/>The story was great. It was very creative. Monsters Inc is the kids scream power plant in the monster world. In the monster world human children are toxic. When the plants top scaring team Sully and Mike accidentally let one kid called Boo into their world. All hell breaks loose. Returning the kid to her bedroom is not as easy as it sounds.<br/><br/>I couldn't have asked for a better ending. There's action,laughter and tears.<br/><br/>This movie just keeps getting better and better. From a colorful and creative opening to a funny end credits scene, Monsters Inc is one to put on your must watch list. I recommend it.<br/><br/>10/10"
"dhein09","10","2","3","10 May 2008"," A Truly Fanstastic Film, To Be Enjoyed By All
","When I first heard about this film somewhere in 2001, I thought that, after the failure from Toy Story 2, Pixar wouldn't redeem themselves. But in early 2002, when I saw this in theaters, I was shocked! The movie was fantastic! I laughed at everything to be laughed at, and the beautiful animation and wonderful voice cast just made it better.<br/><br/>The Plot: (may contain spoilers) The movie starts out with an introductory to all the main characters and scenes. Mike Wasoski(Billy Crystal) and James P. Sullivan(John Goodman) are getting the day started when the new TV commercial for Monsters Inc. premiers. Mike is so anxious to see himself on TV, but when he's on the screen, the Monster's Inc. logo covers most of his body. Mike doesn't realize this however and starts shouting with joy.<br/><br/>After the morning is started, Mike and Sully head off to work. Mike wants to drive his new car, but Sully says that there's a scream shortage(screams are used to power the city) and that they must walk. Along the way, they encounter some friends and neighbors.<br/><br/>When they arrive, Mike walks up to the counter to see Celia(Jennifer Tilly), who he refers to as ""Googly Bear"". It's her birthday and Mike has reservations from a restaurant known for its almost impossibility to get a reservation. After that, he and Sully walk to the locker room to get ready.<br/><br/>Mike leaves the locker room early to get his flies from Roz, the secretary who wants it her way and her way only. Mike tries to make it romantic, but fails to put her in a good mood. He still pretends to like her as he walks away, but then snaps out of it soon.<br/><br/>Mike and the other scare assistants get the work station ready. They take they're scare card out and slide it in. A door comes by and locks into the station. The door leads to a child's room. It is the scarer's duty to scare the child to produce screams.<br/><br/>After setup, the scarers come out. The attendant prepares the monitor and scare records. The assistants prepare the scarer while the attendant prepares the countdown. Then the monsters run into the room and scare the child. Some aren't so lucky, but it turns out to be a good day.<br/><br/>But then a scarer, George Sanderson, comes out with a sock on his back. This is considered toxic(the code is 23-19) and the CDA(Child Detection Agency) charges in. A child or anything owned or touched by the child is considered dangerous to monsters. George is decontaminated and has all his fur shaved off.<br/><br/>The scare floor is shut down for 30 minutes. The day then goes on as usual. Henry J. Waternoose(James Coburn) asks Sully to come by and give some trainee scares a demonstration. Sully agrees, and eventually the quitting bell rings.<br/><br/>Mike and Sully walk into Roz again. Mike says he has a fun-filled evening planned, but after Roz reminds him about paperwork e was supposed to file, he immediately panics. Sully says he'll get the paperwork just as Celia arrives to get Mike. Mike tells Sully what to do and leaves with his date.<br/><br/>Sully goes back to the scare floor to get the report. he notices a door was left behind, which is considered carelessness, because all doors must be return by the end of the day. Sully explores the door to see if anyone is left behind. Then he notices a child is play with his tail. He screams in terror and runs off.<br/><br/>I'd like to say more, but because of the character limit, I should leave it to you to find out what happens next.<br/><br/>The Voices: This movies features a variety of great voice talent. It stars talent like John Goodman(TV's Rosanne), Billy Crystal(Deconstructing Harry), Steve Buscemi(King Of New York), and even a cameo by Frank Oz(Star Wars). All of them worked hard and it paid off.<br/><br/>The Verdict: This is a wonderful movie and it's a great way to help younger kids understand that monsters aren't always scary. Plus the great humor, brilliant animation, and wonderful voice cast don't even begin to say how great this movie is.<br/><br/>10/10"
"tmazanec1","10","2","3","23 September 2006"," Worth Buying
","I purchased this movie over online as a DVD pair, the only movie I have ever done this with. I liked Randall Boggs best and found myself sympathizing with him more than I ever have a villain before. The plot twist may have been foreseeable to some reviewers, but I was taken completely by surprise when I first saw it, and even seeing it again do not have any inkling about what it will be until it is revealed. The relationship between Sully and Mike is right on target, and the storyline is excellent. I did not see this for the humor, but for the plot and setting, and at these the movie is superlative. The only problem is that we do not have a PG-6 rating level, since it really doesn't deserve a PG-13 yet might be too scary for very small children."

"Ryan_Barbakins","9","1","1","15 February 2020"," A Hilarious, yet Heartfelt Experience
","Monsters Inc is an amazing concept fueled by a common disbelief by children that a monster lives in their closet. This film gives us an explanation as to why Monsters do this in a genius concept. Mike Wazowski is an incredibly well written character with his comedy, temper, and overall comedic appearance. There are so many jokes in this film that could arguably be considered ""ironic humor.""
Monsters Inc is also a very heartfelt and emotional film. The ending, while being sad, feels like the right thing to happen. However the very last scene gives us hope for a happy, satisfying ending to the story. I really don't think a sequel can be made of this film, because the story felt so random, as if it was just a few crazy days at work. Which is exactly what this film, at its core is, which explains its genius of a concept."

"tieman64","Null","2","4","17 September 2010"," Something evil this way comes
","""James, this company has been in my family for three generations. I would do anything to keep it from going under!"" - Henry J. Waternoose (""Monster's Inc"")<br/><br/>One of Pixar's best films, ""Monster's Inc"" plays like a buddy comedy in which a hairy blue monster (John Goodman) and a one eyed testicle (Billy Crystal) struggle to protect a human child from corporate bad guys.<br/><br/>The film is super cute and supremely precious, but never dips into the kind of annoying mawkishness that plagues Pixar's later films (""Up"" and ""Wall-E""). This is primarily thanks to the vocal talents of John Goodman and Billy Crystal, two seasoned comedians who not only lend the film real warmth, but are able to capture the kind of edgy, rapid-fire banter that Hawks and Wilder were known for. Unique in the Pixar canon, this is thus a dialogue driven film, relying on sharp exchanges, a screwball plot and lots of buddy interactions.<br/><br/>Like most Pixar films, this is also a hypocritical message movie. Here we have a ""big corporation"" (Monsters Inc - they're literally comprised of ""corporate monsters"") who not only specialise in ""exploiting"" humans, but refuse to adopt better, more efficient and ""environmentally friendly"" practises. Thankfully such preaching is handled with subtlety (unlike ""Wall-E""), though the film does end with an annoying cliché: the kind hearted and fatherly company boss is revealed to be a devious bad guy, the film reducing ideology, systems and power structures to the morality of an evil figurehead. The belief that replacing a monster's head will cause its body to magically transform - indeed, the belief that the head is itself somehow separate from the body - is a fantasy common in cinema.<br/><br/>Visually, the film looks great. This was Pixar's big attempt to successfully render fur, wind and hair, a hurdle they had to get out of the way before conquering water, fire, metal and surface reflections with their later films. It's staggering to see how far computer animation has come in such a short space of time. This film's textures, resolutions and animations look positively archaic when compared to Pixar's later efforts. <br/><br/>Incidentally, ""Monsters Inc"" is part of a longstanding battle between Pixar and DreamWorks Pictures (founded by Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen in the mid 90s). With the surprise success of Pixar's ""Toy Story"", DreamWorks set about discovering Pixar's next project. When their spies learnt of ""A Bugs Life"", DreamWorks therefore rushed out the similarly themed ""Antz"" in an attempt to steal some profits.<br/><br/>Next from Dreamworks came ""The Prince of Egypt"" and ""The Road to El Dorado"", two animated films designed to rip off Disney's ""Hercules"" and ""Mulan"". Dreamworks' ""Shrek"", a monster flick designed to cash in on Pixar's ""Monster's Inc"", came next, followed by ""Sinbad"", a knock off of Disney's ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"".<br/><br/>The battle continued with ""Shark Tale"", Dreamworks' copy of ""Finding Nemo"", ""Megamind"" which copies ""The Incredibles"", and ""Flushed Away"", which mimics ""Ratatouille"". No surprise too that the hero of DreamWorks' ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is called HiccUP, and that the film was the studio's response to Pixar's ""Up"". And so on and on it goes, corporate warfare and artistry dancing their intimate ballet.<br/><br/>The point is, ""Shrek"", which was released the same year as ""Monster's Inc"", used a tale of monsters to poke fun at Disney, Pixar and Disney fairy tales, whilst ""Monster's Inc"" celebrates the portals, multidimensional windows and doorways of business magnate Steve Jobs' ""Apple Computers"" (Jobs was chief executive of Pixar). What's interesting, though, is that ""DreamWorks"" is now turning the brand awareness generated by its crappy early animations into giant ""cash cow sequels"" (""Shrek 2 and 3"", ""Kung Fu Panda 2"", ""Madagascar 2 and 3"", ""How to Train your Dragon 2"" etc), whilst Pixar, now fully absorbed by the Disney Machine, has sold out and become a monster of its own, milking their early projects with the planned releases of ""Cars 2"", ""Monsters Inc 2"" etc etc.<br/><br/>8.5/10 – The takeover has already started. Pixar is turning into the very monster it rallies against in this film. Today it exemplifies what Robert Pfaller calls ""interpassivity"", performing our indictments for us whilst allowing us to consume with impunity.<br/><br/>Worth three viewings."
"departed07","10","2","4","18 March 2005"," The Laughs keep on coming
","Though I slept on the couch throughout my life, I never really experienced sleeping in my own bed until I got older; and yet, I never figured out if monsters ever lived in my closet or better yet, wondered why there would be a monster in my closet? Monsters, Inc. is about a company in Monstorpolis City (hence the title) that has monsters to scare kids as a way of their energy of keeping the city alive. It's very amusing that they show the monsters in a room where they would have different doors leading to a room in different parts of the human world. The world's top scarer is James P. Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) who is known to friends, family and fans as Sulley. His assistant is the little one-eyed green ball Mike Wasizoki (Billy Crystal) in which they are partners no matter what (like Shrek and Donkey). Sulley's competitor is Randall Wallace (no relation to the director and is voiced by Steve Buscemi) who will do anything to win and be number one.<br/><br/>The rule that Monsters, Inc. has is not to get into contact or let a child touch them. In one scene during the big scream fest, a big blue monster screams out of a closet crying saying that the child wasn't scared and that it touched him. The other monster replies, ""She was only six!"" When Randall tries to cheat in the competition while every monster is away, Sulley sees a door with flowers on it and opens the door. He hears someone messing with his tail and sees a little girl playing with it. Sully does not scare her, but he's reaction lead into a chase where this time it's the other way around; the little girl is chasing the monster. The city finds out that there's a little girl on the run and afraid that they'll get a disease from the child. Though the film is a buddy picture, the main characters are the little girl (Boo) and Sulley as he watches over her making sure that she doesn't get hurt. Most people would consider ""Shrek"" a better cartoon because of its cruelness and ethnicity, but I also like ""Monsters, Inc."" because it's cute in a way of curiosity and realizing that monsters have lives too."

"Jack the Ripper1888","Null","2","4","11 June 2003"," One of the very best films of the year.
","Released almost back-to-back with ICE AGE, both films had basically carbon copied plots of each other. I doubt they did it on purpose, but they are almost the exact same thing. The two short films included on the VHS and DVD, MIKE'S NEW CAR and FOR THE BIRDS were not very good, but MONSTERS, INC. was truly a masterpiece.<br/><br/>While I wouldn't go as far as to call it one of the top 250 movies, it was still very good. There was a lot of adult humor in the film, which made it easier for me to watch the movie, but this is still aimed more for kids. I usually enjoy Pixar movies because they usually try to include a little bit of everything in their movies (and thankfully they leave out the stupid, annoying songs included in so many kids' movies). TOY STORY was their first movie, and then they dished out A BUG'S LIFE, TOY STORY 2, and most recently FINDING NEMO. Their main big plot of almost all of these films though, is getting old. It is amazing that kids haven't noticed that all of their favorite Pixar films have the *exact* same plot in all of them. Dreamworks's SHREK was a change of pace only because it was a parody, but almost all of Pixar's flicks are about some friends trying to get somewhere to rescue somebody or something almost exactly like that. Either way, MONSTERS, INC. was still a very good movie as it did complete the one major feat that a lot of films are not able to do nowadays: Entertain people.<br/><br/>MONSTERS, INC. gets 5/5."
"Howlin Wolf","7","2","4","9 February 2002"," Light, enjoyable fare that proves animation is still on top...
","... when it comes to producing well-rounded, realised and consistently entertaining movies.  Is it just me or have there been no REALLY awful animated films from the stables of the top studios like Pixar and Dreamworks, etc?  The movie industry as a whole should perhaps sit up and take notice of the craft that goes into these movies.  Both 'suits' and audiences are sure to benefit if that ever happens.  Long may the tradition of quality animated movies be, I say!<br/><br/>   I actually bought a ticket for this last night after finding to my dismay that another premiere, ""From Hell"", was already sold out by the time I arrived.  These are certainly two distinctly different films in theme!  I was slightly grouchy, because, coupled with that minor disappointment, I'd had an argument with a friend on the way over to the theatre, and was now proceeding solo.  I wouldn't say that ""Monsters Inc"" made me glad I missed ""From Hell"", but I still got a solidly entertaining film for my money.  I just hope I don't miss ""Ocean's 11"" next week...<br/><br/>   For every plus-point to the movie I can also think of a criticism, but on the whole the good points JUST outweigh the bad.  The setup may be a little too complicated for younger audiences and the supporting cast of voices is wasted.  There was definitely not enough Steve Buscemi, whose bad guy just seemed like an afterthought to all the Keystone Cops esque capers of trying to get ""Boo"" out of Monstropolis.  The script is pitched at a much younger level than ""Toy Story"" was, and so as a result adults may be bowled over by the animation, but slightly starved in the belly-laughs department.  That said, there are still a couple of moments guaranteed to have older patrons guffawing heartily, just not enough for my liking.  Even without laughter, the story is still diverting and inventive enough to fix your attention satisfactorily.  The movie really comes into its own when the kid is introduced, as thereafter the action rarely pauses for breath.<br/><br/>   Good as the voice talents of Goodman and Crystal are, it is undoubtedly youngster Mary Gibbs who inadvertently steals the show.  Her cute gurgles and shrieks are enough to put a smile on most people's faces and warm their hearts.  The job the team did on collecting all her voice samples for the finished movie is nothing short of amazing; indeed, just like the animation achievements were as well.  Goodman excels in his voice acting, making ""Sulley"" a truly memorable character.<br/><br/>   The animation is wonderful, and at times will make you unable to do anything else but gawp.  Techniques in this arena seem to be moving at lightspeed, and in just a few years will make the graphics seen in ""Toy Story"" seem unremarkable.  Just for this factor alone, ""Monsters Inc."" deserves to be seen, but the likeable (if not always best used) cast and the imaginative plot add an extra dimension that make it worth your time. Nowhere near a ""Toy Story"" beater for sheer polish and appeal to all ages, but a commendable effort nonetheless.  Well done!   <br/><br/>

","You may admire the hair detail on Sully the Yeti's arm, but you will be amazed at the warmth of characterization in 'Monsters, Inc.,' surpassing even the great 'Shrek' earlier this year. Goodman and Crystal are a comedic team reminiscent of the zaniest Martin and Lewis days. Crystal's Borscht-belt routines brought smiles even to this jaded and admittedly tough-on-comedy critic. I thought Eddie Murphy's donkey in 'Shrek' was smart and funny; Crystal's one-eyed monster is even better with its wry and annoying wit.<br/><br/>Cleaning the environment of child contamination is a hilarious conceit that turns around the usual fears children have of monsters in closets. It is also a chilling parallel to the challenge of removing anthrax from today's letters. Generally, the allegorical underpinnings of animation are natural for the medium, powerful like the images of the novel 'Animal Farm' for political and sociological levels of meaning. For example, the endless-door motif in this film is an ingenious metaphor for the scary and glorious possibilities the present and future hold for kids.<br/><br/>Even before you see this feature, Pixar offers the short feature 'For the Birds' -- a brilliant takeoff on Hitchcock's memorable film besides being a great commentary on diversity. The expressions around the animated eyes, as the little birds deal with the big bird interloper, are more expressive than those of most contemporary film actors, with the exception of Brando, Pacino, Depp, and Streep.<br/><br/>The short trailer for 'Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones' may precede the showing as it did ours for an added delight.<br/><br/>'Monsters, Inc.' is the best animated feature this year and one of the greatest of all time."

","The animated feature from Pixar reveals that it is true (as every child knows) that there are monsters in the bedroom closet, especially after the lights have been put out. What we did not realize is that the monsters are on assignment. A closet door, which by day leads to a closet, at night leads directly to Monstropolis, the world of monsters, which is powered by Scream Heat. The only reason monsters jump out of closets and scare kids is to collect their screams, which are to Monstropolis as power plants are to the rest of us."

They are iconic in the roles, and the characters they portray are surprisingly great.<br/><br/>I loved the interaction between all of them, and the relationship between the monsters and Boo is extremely touching. There are a couple of scenes of genuine emotion, and the ending gets me every time I watch it. Whilst I can't say that it delivers a finalé as impactful as the ending of Toy Story 3, it was still very impactful.<br/><br/>The story of Monsters Inc isn't paced very well, but I really enjoyed the overall narrative and the journey that the characters went on. I find Randall to be one of the most underrated of Pixar's villains, and he brought a true menace to the scenes he was a part of. The musical score was also excellent, and the animation keeps improving with each of Pixar's films.<br/><br/>As you can tell, I really liked Monsters Inc, but it didn't do anything which made me say that the film was incredible. It was definitely great, but not one of Pixar's finest efforts.<br/><br/>SCORE: 83%"

","Monsters Inc, like Toy Story is also a genius concept. The film works off the premise that children's bedroom closet doors operate as portals that allow monsters through them to scare them and obtain the energy released in the scream to fuel the monster world. I have no idea how this concept was thought up but it sets the movie up for a home run.<br/><br/>These characters have fully realised and developed personalities. We see that their decisions have actual consequences and they feel more than one way about the events. We see internal conflict and for a movie animated ""lovable"" monsters, that is really impressive.<br/><br/>The chase scene at the end is staged and paced perfectly. Great story telling and really entertaining watching. It made me fall in love with these characters and really get on board with what they were trying to do. It culminates to a denouement that is satisfying, well thought out and fully rounded.<br/><br/>Monsters Inc is Pixar doing what it does best."

It has some great fun character, some awesome moments and some well placed comical moments. ""Monsters, Inc."" is entertainment at its bests.<br/><br/>The voice cast is amazing. John Goodman and Billy Crystal form a great leading duo. Steve Buscemi is a great villain and James Coburn has a great voice that fits his character perfectly. John Ratzenberger as always is very entertaining this time in a role as banished Yeti.<br/><br/>The story itself is pretty simple but thats what makes it easy to follow and so much fun to watch. The movie not only knows how to entertaining but also knows how and when to emote. The combination of fun and emotional things is perfectly balanced and placed within the movie.<br/><br/>There is some great dialog but the true power of ""Monsters, Inc."" are the wonderful characters. Not is there only a wild variety of strange and weird characters but also some characters that are good for some serious laughs and Boo is simply adorable and a pretty fair representation of a kid in real life. Well done Pixar!<br/><br/>Pure entertainment for the entire family!"

","It has a creative plot of monsters scaring children so that they can power their city and how they work in an office environment. The characters, animation, and said plot are great. My favorite characters are Mike, Sulley, Celia, and Boo. The humor is hilarious, the title sequence looks neat, Billy and John are great together, Boo is cute, the plot twist where Waternoose was the one behind Randall's schemes was really surprising, and the music by Randy Newman was excellent!<br/><br/>There are some emotional scenes, like when Sulley scares Boo, and when they have to part ways. I know Randall is a funny villain and all, but he is a jerk in my opinion. Anyway, the song ""If I Didn't Have You"" was amazing, and there's more to laughs than scariness, which makes this a really fun movie.

","Another Pixar classic, this one focuses on the world of monsters and how similar their world is to ours in that it's blue-collar. The main characters are Mike(Billy Crystal) and Sully(John Goodman). Sully is a top scarer at his job and loves what he does. You see their world is powered by the screams of kids and it's his job to help maintain the power they receive by scaring kids.<br/><br/>However there's a catch: The monsters think kids are toxic and that touching them can be fatal. Isn't that hilarious? It doesn't help that a little girl makes her way into their world and they have to keep her existence a secret. While struggling to get her home they begin to realize that she's not toxic and that there may be a conspiracy involving their rival Randall(Steve Buschemi) and boss Mr. Waternoose.<br/><br/>So yeah, the premise's interesting and leads to a lot of creative jokes. A good one is at the beginning where they're walking to work and one of the monsters they walk past is a slug who goes through a filter on the street and another who accidentally burns his newspaper by sneezing fire.<br/><br/>The characters are enjoyable to watch. Mike as a comic relief's funny and Sully works well as the straight man. It's funny to see them bounce off each other while also seeing them talk about serious matters like the situation about the little girl nicknamed ""Boo"". Randall's an interesting villain. The way he moves is cool and his design is interesting.<br/><br/>Monsters Inc. is a great movie to watch. It has something for everyone both kids and adults. I don't have much else to say other check it out for yourself. It's another Pixar classic."

","Without giving the name of the author, Canadian social commentator Mark Steyn cited a piece of writing during a 2012 interview with an American cable-TV company which was about how children perceive the world around them through the fiction they're exposed to early on in life. Principally, he cites an analysis made by a fellow-Canadian on how creatures, or 'monsters', on television, or in cutesy books, were damaging to kids - it imparted the idea that monsters were just cute, cuddly friends that needed taming or befriending. Steyn seemed to prefer 'classic' children's literature in this respect, because there you garner a '...far greater sense of the realities of life from the Brothers Grimm than you will from the Cookie Monster.'<br/><br/>I wonder what either of them thought of ""Monsters Inc."", where the one infant character in the film is completely unafraid of precisely the sorts of post-Sesame Street monsters the article cited, yet is a character in a piece imparting the idea that cute and cuddly is good. To some extent, Disney's 2002 animation plays like a kind of animated therapy for young children, who will of course love the colour; vibrancy and sense of adventure infused throughout ""Monster's Inc."", but will also have one of their fears exorcised - that of the dark bedroom at night-time and the idea a creature might lurk beyond a visible realm.<br/><br/>At the core of the film is a quite brilliant idea: in an alternate world running parallel to our own, there exist actual creatures, hideous in physicality, desperately in need of the terrified screams of young children so as to run their civilisation. In order to do so, they appear in bedroom closets around the world late at night (the only gateway from our own universe to theirs); do what they have to do to induce sheer panic and return home again having captured the noise in a canister. One of the film's best jokes, in fact, doubles up as a devilish social commentary on how much harder it is these days to truly frighten children, given what they are often exposed to on TV and in video games.<br/><br/>The scream-drive is propelled by two monsters called Sully and Randall, whose physical characteristics are cleverly echoed by their voice-talents: Sully, like John Goodman, is big and huggable and has a dopey voice, whilst Steve Buscemi's lizard-like creation is more slender and bug-eyed. Sully is the consummate professional who goes through the same process every morning: exercising and scare routines with his flat-mate and floor-work partner Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). He blindly trusts the corporation, epitomised quite cleverly in the arachnid-like CEO Henry J. Waternoose (James Coburn), who sports a waist-coat but is tragically missing a monocle. Children are Sully's worst enemy, believing them to be potentially toxic. Regardless, he puts his life on the line every day for his society - the moral justification for all this lies in the company's motto: 'We scare, because we care'.<br/><br/>As each of the monsters in the company lumbered with this responsibility walk to their posts in slow motion, the film invokes Michael Bay's 1998 film ""Armageddon"", which infers a sense of doom or catastrophe if these brave souls were to fail in their duty: these people are the guardians of civilisation. Civilisation does not quite crumble, but disaster strikes when a young American child manages to make its way out of our world and into the monsters' own - enough to have Sully and Mike worried their days are numbered as previous misnomers have led to other monsters banished to our world, cleverly accounting for Bigfoot and the Yeti. In a panic, the twosome concoct a plan to return it to where it belongs, but that becomes problematic when Sully becomes attached to it.<br/><br/>""Monsters Inc."" cracks along at a fantastic pace and works so wonderfully well because of a number of things. Principally, the stakes are incredibly high, so there is always this rapid, even nervous, energy pulsating through the film once the 20 minute mark elapses, and the film does such a wonderful job in bringing the two personalities in the form of its heroes to life in such a short space of time that we are hooked on their adventure the whole way. Furthermore, the characterisation is superb - these are rounded characters with lives; dreams; goals and even girlfriends - they possess different attitudes; physical appearances and characteristics. The world it creates, that of one parallel to our own, is extraordinary from a design perspective - the way they echo one another in the form of a daily commute; workplace rivalry; a relaxing meal after work and generally the things you see out and about is marvellous.<br/><br/>What directors Pete Docter; David Silverman and Lee Unkrich later pull off is the incredibly tricky transition the film needs to make from being a double-act comedy about getting rid of something which doesn't want to leave, to being a film about foiling a corporate conspiracy. One cannot laud the team enough. Laudable too is the character study - this is Sully's film; a character who blindly trusts the machine at the beginning of the film but undergoes his own journey to find out that kids are not toxic; corruption might come from anywhere and even tackles the moral dilemma of how to power his world. Irrespective of age, and with whomever you see it, ""Monster's Inc."" is a genuinely infectious and wholesome piece of animated entertainment."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","4 January 2019"," What's behind the door?
","It's such an odd premise for a movie, but yet it works so well. What if the monsters hiding in your closet are real and what if they have a society of their own, behind that door. What would that society look like and what part the scaring of little children would play in it.<br/><br/>You can definitely build a movie around that and Pixar does so beautifully. In the process we get introduced to James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan and Michael ""Mike"" Wazowski, the top scaring duo Monsters, Inc. has ever seen. Things go well, until a little girl child, adorably and promptly named Boo, slips through the door. Hijinks do indeed ensue.<br/><br/>The movie has a strong idea and some topnotch characters going for it. I thoroughly enjoyed the relationship between Sully and Boo. The rest of the cast are voiced by some really talented people and all of the main cast have really great designs as well. I especially enjoyed Henry J. Waternoose III, the CEO. The side and background characters looked a bit more generic and blobbish in contrast, which is a shame, but then again they're not the focus.<br/><br/>The only real flaw the film has is the story. It's not bad by any means, but it is not as strong as the other elements. Status quo is king, something upsets the status quo, hijinks, solution. No real surprises, no great stakes. I would have liked to explore the world a bit more or move beyond the obvious bad guy good guy setups.<br/><br/>Still, a great animation film for all ages. Definitely worth a watch."

","In a world full of monsters of all kinds, where all the power came from children's screams, a select few had the job of going into the human world to scare the little ones. Everything seems as normal as it can be for that place, until one day, a human child enters the monster world and is hidden by the two protagonists who don't actually know how to get rid of her fast enough before the authorities catches them all.<br/><br/>It's a one of a kind story which presents the adventures of two monsters who worked at the power factory and unwillingly get a human child at their feet. Being seen as toxic for the monster world, the child must be sent back to her world as soon as possible before the two get into trouble. Thus a cavalcade of funny and suspenseful action sequences emerge in their desperate attempt to make things right. As you might expect, not everything goes according to plan as they're about to find out a big scheme which might put their lives into peril.<br/><br/>As said before, it's full of action, thrill, emotion and comedy, managing to keep the bar raised throughout the movie. It looks great, it has a very good plot, it's very entertaining, so you'll definitely have a very good time watching it.

","In this loving, yet fun kid's movie, the main characters change their world through friendship, justice, and sacrifice. One of the main characters is Sullivan. Sullivan is a big, tall, furry, blue and green monster that has a loving heart for a different creator than himself. His best friend, Mike, is a short, round, all green, one-eyed fellow who only cares about himself and not the world around him. Mike drives a sports car and inspires to climb the corporate ladder. Sullivan, also referred to as Sully, walks to work, and genuinely cares about the environment and the creators being harmed by the creation of their energy supply. Mike and Sully work for Monsters, Incorporated, who power the world of Monstropolis with the screams of human children. When a child named Boo enters the monster world, a panic is created. Human children are poisonous to monsters, or so they think. A series of events happen that lead the monsters to capturing the child and realizing her laughs supply more energy than her screams. At the end of the movie, Sully and Mike take over the Monsters, Inc. and use the newly found energy source (laughs) as their only energy source. The children are no longer scared of monsters in their closet but get a laugh when monsters enter into the human world. 
A friendship like Woody and Buzz from Toy Story, Mater and Lightning McQueen from Cars, or even Remy and Linguini from Ratatouille, all show that true friends can overcome obstacles in life. It also shows that one outgoing friend and one conservative friend can join forces and change the world they live in for the better. 
Even above friendship, justice, and sacrifice, I think the overall picture is saying we need a better energy source that doesn't harm the environment. It's a long shot, but it makes sense to relate their story to ours. They go against the grain to fight for better energy sources that give them more energy in the long run."

","In the aftermath of my lukewarm review of The Incredibles, someone asked me what I would consider the great PIXAR film. I didn't want to give an immediate response without revisiting all the titles I had loved the first time round, before my critical faculties had developed to their current level. But until such a point in time, Monsters, Inc. is a very good candidate, being a truly great children's film with all the hallmarks of what makes PIXAR great.<br/><br/>All the best PIXAR films have a simple but engaging premise, from which an entire world can be constructed. With Toy Story 1 & 2, it was that your toys are alive and will miss you when you're not there. What could just be a gimmick was expanded out into a fascinating, complex and heart-warming story about childhood, jealousy, rejection and the fear of being abandoned. PIXAR have always been very good storytellers, laying the proper foundations of a world in which memorable characters can flourish.<br/><br/>With Monsters, Inc., the premise is equally straightforward: there are monsters in your wardrobe (closet if you will), but they are more afraid of you than you are of them, and they rely on you to function. From this idea is built up the entire system of the factory for harnessing children's screams, the means by which monsters can travel to our world, the hierarchies within the workplace, and the central comic conceit of a child who escapes into the monster world and isn't afraid of Sully or Mike.<br/><br/>Even in this set-up, Monsters, Inc. presents itself as a really great twist on monster stories, giving insight into the nature and purpose of monsters in our childhood and culture. It's a film about children learning to grow up and face their fears: either the monsters simply cease to be scary (as happens early on, when a door is shredded), or the children end up actively laughing at them, which the monsters eventually embrace. The discovery later in the film that laughter is more powerful than scares reinforces this message about standing up to your fears and overcoming them. It also ties in with one of PIXAR's overarching themes, namely coming to terms with the people we love growing up.<br/><br/>There is also a neat little role reversal in the film regarding the choice of monsters. The employees at Monsters, Inc. are assigned to a specific child to extract the most possible scares out of a given subject. Rather than the children creating the monsters, as manifestations of their fears and uncertainties, the monsters are tailored for them in the hope that their fears might manifest themselves. This approach within the fictional universe is complimentary with PIXAR's notions of creativity: their films have broad appeal but they are built around emotions and feelings that children will respond to, rather than asking them to respond to something they know nothing about.<br/><br/>On an entirely different level, Monsters, Inc. is also a film about good business practices. The prosperity of the company is directly in proportion to the quality of life enjoyed by its employees. At the start of the film, everyone is working flat out to avert an energy crisis and the management keep complaining when anyone falls short. They even resort to underhand tactics to achieve their goal, rather than thinking the problem through with their employees at the heart. In contrast, Sully's management decisions, from the new energy source to the brighter colours in the workplace, make dealing with the daily grind a lot more fun.<br/><br/>There are a lot of wonderful touches to the visual world of Monsters, Inc. which reinforce the business angle to it. Mike and Sully's world has a lot of blue-collar qualities, from the helmets to the metal lunchboxes, but unlike The Incredibles, it doesn't feel like these adult characteristics are being forced upon a younger audience. The paperwork conversations are structured much better and take up less time than the insurance conversations in Brad Bird's film: not only are they shorter but they are not an integral part of the story. We get a sense of how Monsters, Inc. works as a company without Pete Docter having to labour over details at the expense of his characters.<br/><br/>While Docter needn't labour in his storytelling, there are a number of nice references to monster movies buried in Monsters, Inc., reinforcing our impression of PIXAR as a thorough team who are passionate and well-researched. The restaurant at which Mike and Celia eat is called Harryhausen's, after Ray Harryhausen, the great stop-motion animator and special effects pioneer. Celia's hair is reminiscent of the Gorgons in the Greek Myths, in which Harryhausen dabbled at the peak of his career. There are also several little nods to other PIXAR works in Sully's last scene with Boo: she hands him a Jesse doll from Toy Story 2, the ball from the PIXAR logo and a clown fish (Finding Nemo was in production at this time).<br/><br/>Even if you don't pick up on all the film's deeper themes or references to other works, Monsters, Inc. is still a great piece of storytelling and a really funny family comedy. While Mike and Sully haven't become quite as indelible as Woody and Buzz, they still make a great double act with believable characterisations and great physicality. John Goodman's lugubrious delivery is beautifully balanced out by Billy Crystal's fast-paced dialogue, and unlike many Dreamworks productions it feels like the famous faces are playing characters rather than just letting loose with their own distinctive shtick.<br/><br/>Alongside the main pairing, there are a number of really good performances in the supporting cast. Jennifer Tilly is very good as Celia, her gravelly voice capturing the harsher side of the character while being suitably smitten with her """"googly bear"""". Steve Buscemi is well-cast as the villainous Randall, with the role playing to the same slippery, scheming quality that he brought to Fargo or Reservoir Dogs. James Coburn, in his final performance, balances the mentor-like role he has to Sully with all the ruthlessness and frustration surrounding his position. Best of all, however, is Mary Gibbs, who is simply adorable as Boo. Gibbs was only two-and-a-half she was cast, and was so restless that the recording staff had to follow her around with a microphone.<br/><br/>Most of the humour in Monsters, Inc. is visual, but it's superbly timed and really quite inventive. The scenes involving the CDA are wonderfully over-the-top, parodying any number of scenes in thrillers where a SWAT team must invade a building and remove a threat. Many of the best gags are throwaways, like the jelly-like monster slipping through the grating in the street, or Randall's multiple colour-changes when Boo is bashing him over the head. There's also some good dry humour between Roz and Mike regarding his paperwork, and when Crystal is required to improvise, it's a lot funnier than his stuff in The Princess Bride.<br/><br/>While Monsters, Inc. isn't primarily an action film, it does have several good set-pieces which will keep children entertained. The door chase sequence is to some extent a one-upping of the luggage chase at the end of Toy Story 2, but it's still executed in a very neat way with good editing. Similarly the scenes with the Abominable Snowman (voiced by Toy Story alumnus John Ratzenberger) results in a decent slice of action with a solid punchline. Neither of these scenes are particularly ground-breaking, but they do punctuate the slower, sadder moments.<br/><br/>Monsters, Inc. is also noteworthy for the visual leaps it made, for CG animation in general and for PIXAR'S aesthetic in particular. The film utilised a new animation programme called Fitz to accurately produce the appearance and movements of Sully's hair, including the correct amounts of shadowing on different parts of his fur. Without these innovations, Docter's subsequent film Up would not have looked half as inviting. Ironically, the title sequence feels like a product of 1960s Disney, being reminiscent of 101 Dalmatians in both its pacing and design.<br/><br/>Monsters, Inc. is a great and funny family comedy which still holds up really well after both 12 years and its recent prequel. While its technical innovations can be marvelled at in hindsight, its real achievements lie in its beautifully crafted story, great characters, memorable performances and the nuanced ideas that these raise together. While it's not quite up to the high standard of Toy Story 2 or Finding Nemo, it remains one of PIXAR's finest achievements."
"TheMovieDiorama","9","0","0","24 February 2018"," Monsters Inc showcases the imagination and originality of Pixar's early days.
","We all have films we grew up with, earning a sense of nostalgia that may skew the true reflection of the film. Monsters Inc is one of those. It's a little rough around the edges, but the finished product will always be one that I will truly appreciate. Monstropolis is powered by energy garnered from children's screams. Sully and Mike go to work just like any normal day, except they accidentally let a child into the world of monsters. Normal day has now just taken a turn for the more eventful. Comedy ensues with various antagonists being revealed and a surprising touching ending that packs a punch to the heart. One of the greatest additions to the animation genre, this flick shows that pure imagination is able to extend its captivation beyond a good narrative and aesthetically pleasing visuals. It's all in the details! Explaining how the door system works, why the city needs screams, showing the partnership between the scarer and their companion. It fills in all the gaps to complete a greater picture, adding that finesse. The world doesn't feel populated for the sake of it, it naturally breathes life through the art of animation. It's what Pixar is famous for. I loved how they deconstructed the ""monsters in the closet"" theme, which most definitely appeals to all audiences. John Goodman and Billy Crystal were the perfect voice actors, I cannot envisage anyone else replacing them. Sully and Mike are John and Billy. It's a done deal. Irreplaceable. The dialogue between them was intuitive and felt seamless. Quick banter with boundless quotes...""put that thing back where it came from!"". Randall was a memorable villain that was underplayed, not overly sinister which I appreciated. Certain scenes were rushed, like Mike coming back from the Himalayas, but it's not a major detriment. Monster's Inc just screams imagination. Its ingenuity and originality will appeal to everyone and is a stepping stone for cementing Pixar as one of the best animation studios."

","In a world full of monsters of all kinds, where all the power came from children's screams, a select few had the job of going into the human world to scare the little ones. Everything seems as normal as it can be for that place, until one day, a human child enters the monster world and is hidden by the two protagonists who don't actually know how to get rid of her fast enough before the authorities catches them all.<br/><br/>It's a one of a kind story which presents the adventures of two monsters who worked at the power factory and unwillingly get a human child at their feet. Being seen as toxic for the monster world, the child must be sent back to her world as soon as possible before the two get into trouble. Thus a cavalcade of funny and suspenseful action sequences emerge in their desperate attempt to make things right. As you might expect, not everything goes according to plan as they're about to find out a big scheme which might put their lives into peril.<br/><br/>As said before, it's full of action, thrill, emotion and comedy, managing to keep the bar raised throughout the movie. It looks great, it has a very good plot, it's very entertaining, so you'll definitely have a very good time watching it. It is also pretty unpredictable, thus being able to provide a satisfying finale.

","""Welcome to Monsters Incorporated where we scare because we care."" Disney/Pixar have always been known as the kings of 3D animated features ever since Toy Story was released. But now after DreamWorks dropped a bomb on the head of 3D animation with Shrek, Pixar needed to release a creation upon the world to place themselves back atop the thrown that they helped to created, so now we have Monsters Inc., Pixar's newest brainchild. Our story is a very complex one. We are throw into the world of monsters where everything is fuelled by children's screams. We follow the lifestyle of Sully, the highest ranked scarrer and his partner. best friend Mike. This is where the story breaks off into two sections. On one side of the story there is Randall, a scheming lizard who wants to be the top scarrer. Then we have a little girl who accidentally gets released into the monster world. All hell breaks lose because monsters just so happen to be as scared of humans as we are of them but Sully befriends the child and even comes to love her. When making animated features story is key, you can have the best animation out there but without a good story you have nothing to work with. Here, as with Shrek, is a very creative and original story on a misunderstood stereotype. The film easily has the best animation from Pixar to date and the Voice work from Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Jennifer Tilly, James Coburn and Steve Buscemi as fabulous but what truly makes this film a winner is that the monsters are given human traits and live there lives like any other normal human being would. They are also given heart, which sets us up for a lesson, never judge someone by what they look like because deep down inside there is always something special to be found. Now you either would have to be dead of blind to not think that Shrek was hilarious in ever aspect of the word, the humour was enough to keep the kids entertained but also keep the adults just as interested. Well I will admit that Monsters Inc. is downright funny, often time hilarious, but most of the humour seem to be directed to a young age margin, making a lot of the jokes seem childish and fall flat at times. Not to mention these jokes and gags are shot at the viewer at such a fast rate that a lot of them are just misfires and take away from the comic value of the really good jokes, making this a little harder to stomach for the older audience. Still because the film has a heart of gold and some genuine hilarity it is sure to go down in time as a true classic."

Apparently the folk at Pixar do too. But a clever computer-graphical interpretation of Mother Nature's sweet little imagination wouldn't make for much of an entertaining time. Fortunately this film also has wit, slapstick, pathos and adventure in just the right proportions. I laughed, I cried, I was amused by the homage to Ray Harryhausen and the nods to Star Wars, James Bond, Mission Impossible, Toy Story, The Wrong Trousers, Reservoir Dogs (yes really!) not to mention the many more that I probably missed by blinking or not paying attention (Fargo, apparently, for example).

","**Mild Spoilers** I thought this movie was great, plenty of laughs and amazing graphics... But was it really a kids movie? Personally, I think Randall was quite frightening, at least would be in the eyes of a child. And a machine which latches onto a child's face and sucks screams out of them? Sounds a bit too scary for kids to me. I talked to a few kids about this movie and what they thought. From what I gather, smaller children seem unaffected by it while the older ones (6 or 7 year olds) were frightened, by Randall especially.<br/><br/>
But to those of us who aren't children, this movie is very amusing. I can't seem to stop imitating Boo and saying, 'Miiiiike Wazowski!' Its funny and it has heart. I thought it lost its charm a little towards the end when Mike and Sully are exiled and are in the cave with the Abominable Snowman. Once they returned to Monsters Inc., however, it got better.<br/><br/>

The fact it starts off with a digital cartoon short will take you back to the heady days when Warner Bros. cartoons were the stock standard introduction to any movie.<br/><br/>  Then you're thrown head long into the world of Monsters Inc., the company that provides electricity to the city of Monstropolis by collecting the energy generated by terrified children's screams.  The opening scene is pure genius, with a trainee scream collector as terrified of his victim as the child is of him.  But not all is what you think, with a nice twist thrown in right at the beginning.<br/><br/>  The best scream catcher at the factory is Sulley (John Goodman), who we meet as he prepares for his day's work under the watchful eye (pun intended) of his trainer and mentor Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal).  At the plant he's everybody's hero, while chameleon like monster, Randall Boggs is obsessed with knocking him off his perch.<br/><br/>  Things go awry when a small child enters the world of monsters.  The monsters are as terrified of children as children are of them, thinking that children carry terrible viruses that will destroy their hidden world.  But Sulley connects with the intruder, whom he names Boo, and decides it's up to him and Mike to save her.  That means getting her back through the closet door that will return her to the world of humans.  But it's easier said than done, with Randall and Monsters Inc. CEO, Henry J Waternoose, doing their best to banish Sulley and Mike while using Boo for their evil means.<br/><br/>  Telling you too much more would spoil the story, but I can tell you, that since Disney are involved, it has a happy ending.  <br/><br/>  And that was the problem for me, not that I don't appreciate happy endings.  I found Monsters Inc. to be too schmaltzy for my taste.  The continual use of violins in the soundtrack became a little overbearing and were used as signposts to let you know that now was a good time to get emotional.<br/><br/>  Perhaps the writers should have taken note of their own story line - that children don't scare as easily any more.  A few more scares and less sugar would have made a world of difference.  It also lacked the wit of Shrek - perhaps the best animated feature this year?<br/><br/>  Now, please don't get me wrong and take it that Monsters Inc. is a bad movie; it's just that it could have been a lot better.  If you want to know what it could have been like, check out Real Monsters on Nickelodeon, a cartoon that has real wit for the adults and plenty of slapstick for the littlies.<br/><br/>  But when it comes to the perfect kids movie for over the school holidays, you couldn't go far wrong with Monsters Inc.  Children will love the delightful, almost cuddly monsters that aren't really scary at all.  The animation is of the highest standard, with everyone of Sulley's hairs lovingly rendered and attention to the smallest details making the movie life like.  <br/><br/>  But perhaps the best thing about Monsters Inc. is that it will help your children realise that all those scary things that go bump in the night are just doing their job."

James P. (""Sully"") Sullivan (John Goodman) is the top-scarer at Monsters, Inc., a powerplant type factory that uses children's screams as a source of power. His partner is the eyeball Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). Sully does the scaring and, well, Mike takes the credit. Mike is romantically linked to Celia (Jennifer Tilly). When the two are out on an evening of romance, Sully offers to do Mike's paperwork. When he goes to the ""scaring floor"" to pick of the papers, he finds a door. He checks to door to see if anyone is scaring in there. When he turns around, the cute, adorable Boo (Mary Gibbs) is standing right there. This isn't good because children are toxic. ""A single touch could kill you,"" we are informed by Waternoose (James Colburn), the head of Monsters, Inc.<br/><br/>Sully and Mike have to hide the little Boo (Boo's not her real name, Sully nicknames her that) so they don't get in trouble. They need to find her door and return her safely home. This won't be easy because the evil Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) is after her. He's trying to beat Sully's record and become the top-scarer. Randall is lizard like thing that can blend in with the surroundings. He is bad news.<br/><br/>I don't think that Disney/Pixar could make a bad movie. Even if the story was horrid, the visuals would be terrific and make up for it. But MONSTERS, INC. doesn't need to worry about that. It is practically perfect. Crystal and Goodman are the perfect comedic team. Crystal offers a ba-da-bing style and Goodman is the awe-shucks monster that Boo calls ""Kitty."" Boo is captured by Mary Gibbs, a real child. Not some adult voice of a Rugrat. A real little girl. That gives her more authenticity and believability.<br/><br/>
There is nothing I can complain about. Nothing at all. Except, I just wish it was longer because it was so good. I am ready for MONSTERS, INC. 2, MONSTERS, INC. 3 and even MONSTERS, INC. 4. Only if Goodman and Crystal return that is."

","Disney and Pixar are at it again.  Inspired by their own sales figures of Toy Story action figures and lunchboxes, the two companies have collaborated once more for Monsters Inc., a film that would be flat-out charming if it wasn't so disappointing and lacking in the qualities that made Toy Story a good film AND marketing device.<br/><br/>	The best thing about Toy Story was that the story didn't just focus on Woody and Buzz.  There were all those supporting characters, and every one, from Rex and Hamm to the aliens in the vending machine, had just as much personality and were just as funny as the main characters.  In Monsters Inc., with the exception of all-too-short scenes involving the Abominable Snowman and Mike's girlfriend Cecilia, there are no supporting monster characters at all; we're stuck with Mike and Sully the whole time.  No offense intended to Billy Crystal or John Goodman, as both are perfect matches for their characters, and put in a valiant effort, but neither of the leading monsters has any good lines (even Mike's ""Sure, blame the little guy with his ONE EYE!"" line from the trailer has been cut).  There really doesn't seem to be much humor at all, not even any toilet humor for the immature kiddies.<br/><br/>	The other major problem with this film is that it reeks of unoriginality. The concept is brilliant, and the explanation of Monsters Inc.'s premise and why monsters scare is innovative and suggests what could have been; unfortunately, like many recent Disney films, the film is totally formulaic and predictable, all the way up to the obligatory ""heroes in peril chase scene"" that is thrilling, but will also no doubt inspire Disneyland's next attraction.  There wasn't even a trademark Pixar ""bloopers reel"" during the credits (although I will admit the film's opening credits were very classy, and reminiscent of the Pink Panther).<br/><br/>	So what are Monsters Inc.'s saving graces? Well, it has the Pixar name, and a bad Pixar film is still better than the average bad family film (and really, since Pixar currently has no competition in the computer animated feature film market except Shrek, they can set their own standards for quality).  If nothing else, it's amazing to see the hypnotic realism of each individual strand of Sully's fur blowing in the wind.  There are also some slick inside references to Ray Harryhausen, California's recent power crisis and Toy Story, and a great bonus short included before the film that I actually enjoyed more than the feature film (just like in Bug's Life... am I noticing a trend here?).

I always watch animated films with my girlfriend since we both love them and all that happened was: Me snickering in the first 10 minutes of the movie and my girlfriend laughing each time that cute 3-year old girl would do something cute and adorable this isn't comedy, it was just an entertaining movie to pass the time.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Toy Story Knew Better (6.3/10)<br/><br/>[+] An original concept. Good animation and voice acting.<br/><br/>[-] Good characters, but a tad forgettable. Not funny. Boring plot.<br/><br/>Also Check: Toy Story (1995) – Finding Nemo (2003) – Shrek (2001) – The Incredibles (2004)<br/><br/>P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say ""I like\don't like this movie"" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO..."
"Silverzero","6","3","8","7 February 2003"," Enjoyable well created compu-toon. Some flaws, but still highly entertaining
","The latest compu-toon from the Big Mouse is a highly entertaining one, which is a step further in computer animation. Released about the same time as Dreamwork's `Shrek' and 20th Century Fox's `Ice Age', this proves that Disney is still as strong as it was 60+ years ago.<br/><br/>The story is set in Monstropolis as big-time scarer Sulley and his one eyed friend Mike work for Mr. WaterNoose at Monsters Incorporated. They use children's screams to produce electricity for the city. But when a human child accidentally gets into Monstropolis, Mike and Sulley must try to get it back into the real world, all while avoiding rival monster Randell.<br/><br/>As you can see, it's very imaginative and has a fresh concept. For the most part, the vocal talent is very good. John Goodman is easily recognisable and suitable as the big monster, Sulley. Billy Crystal is really good as well and his cynical, sarcastic sense of humour helps liven up the film and give it a sharper edge. Jennifer Tilly is also good as love interest Celia and has great chemistry with the rest of the characters. The only one who didn't work for me was Steve Buscemi as the film's villain. He seemed inappropriate for the part and didn't have enough characteristics to be evil enough, mind you he does get a good come-upance.<br/><br/>One of the film's main flaws was its style of humour. Much of it is based on the monsters over-reacting to very mild situations. This is OK in small doses, but it's been cropping up in many Disney films as of late. But the character humour helps make up for this. Some scenes in the film are a bit sugary and bring down the film's momentum. Most of those scenes between Sulley and Boo will be a letdown for adults. <br/><br/>But the stunning visuals and good script should make up for these flaws. It lacks the dry wit and consistent entertainment of non Disney films such as the PG rated `Antz' and `Shrek', and the overall shape of the similarly themed `Ice Age', but it's imaginative, creative and a very welcome addition from Disney. <br/><br/>By about an eyelash, it's the least of the three compu-toons released almost simultaneously but it's an excellent movie for children and adults alike. 7.6 out of 10."
"MartinHafer","9","3","9","10 June 2007"," Of all the Pixar movies, this is among the very best
","Aside from TOY STORY II (which I loved), this might just be the best film Pixar has released. It's a really close race between it and THE INCREDIBLES for second best. And considering how wonderful their movies are, this isn't a bad place to finish. Unfortunately for the good folks at Disney, MONSTERS, INC. could not have come out at a worse time. Just days after its release, the even better and more timeless SHREK was released--thereby stealing MONSTERS, INC's thunder and resulting in its just being lost in the shuffle. It's a real shame, though, as this is a wonderful film from start to finish. The voices of the characters were great, computer animation tops and the story line, though silly, worked. But for me, the biggest surprise was that as a jaded adult and very critical person, I loved the cutesy addition to Baby Boo to the film. She was, without a doubt, the cutest thing I have ever seen but also was not gratuitously cute or nauseatingly cute. She was just a perfect addition to an otherwise great film. If you haven't seen this film, get off you behind and see it--it's great stuff and kids as well as adults will love this film."

No. These guys mean business when they step out from behind a child's closet door.<br/><br/>For the most part, I enjoyed Monsters Inc. and found it to be quite imaginative as it told its cute, little tale of forbidden friendship and defying authority.<br/><br/>Set in the make-believe world of Monstropolis, where everyone's a literal monster (but usually a nice monster), we find that this urban centre's electrical power is generated from harnessing the screams of human children who are, nightly, scared out of their wits by the hideous, growling creatures who emerge, like demons, from out of their darkened, bedroom closets.<br/><br/>As we soon discover - A monster is, of course, forbidden to ever come into direct contact with a child, as the touch of these beings is both more toxic & deadly than any plague or disease imaginable.<br/><br/>Directed by Pete Docter (writer of Toy Story, Wall-E, Up), Monsters Inc. is a delightfully colourful, CG animated tale which tells us, plain & simple, that laughter is, indeed, 10x more powerful than a scream.<br/><br/>2 thumbs-up to Pixar Studios for delivering this good-natured, little gem that's sure to entertain audiences of all ages."

"lee_eisenberg","10","2","5","28 September 2005"," I loved this movie...and I don't even like Disney.
","One of the ways that I rank a really good movie is one that gives us a new perspective on our own world. ""Monsters, Inc."" is one such movie. Set in Monstropolis, the movie shows that monsters are in fact not much different from humans. The two main monsters are one-eyed, diminutive Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and furry behemoth James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (John Goodman). They work at Monsters, Incorporated, where everyone's job is to go into children's bedrooms, roar at them, and record the screams - which they use to power the city. When a little girl accidentally gets into Monstropolis, they not only have to do everything possible to hide her from the authorities, but they discover a bizarre conspiracy.<br/><br/>One of this movie's most interesting aspects was it's timing. Released less than two months after September 11, 2001, it was sort of reminding us that human nature is in fact good - even if they had to use monsters to show it. Also, the scene where a monster walks back into the factory with a sock apparently reminded some people of the anthrax attacks. Oh well. Life goes on. With some absolutely hilarious lines, ""Monsters, Inc."" is one of the best examples of a movie. I'm even someone who doesn't like Disney and I'm saying this."
"AnnieC","6","2","5","4 November 2001"," Good. . . but Not Great!
","Pixar can do no wrong, in my opinion.  In MONSTERS, INC., they did no wrong; they just didn't do enough that was right!  I liked the movie, but I didn't love it.  There was just something missing and I'm not sure what it was. Maybe it was the fact that there were no really well-developed supporting characters.  It was ALL Mike and ALL Sully.  And that wasn't enough! Randall was a good villain; he just wasn't villanous enough! Maybe the monsters weren't scarey enough. . . or cuddly enough.  They seemed to be mostly potatoes, slugs or sausages with an unusual number of eyes. And the boss monster was a rip-off from one of the mutant toys in TOY STORY. Maybe there weren't enough in-jokes to keep adults entertained.  Oh, sure, I liked the STALK/DON'T STALK crossing light.  And I saw the TOY STORY doll but I'm not sure whether it was Woody or the cowgirl.  And I caught the Oscar Meyer jingle line.  But I wanted more. Maybe I was waiting for a song and dance number.  Randy Newman wrote the music.  Why can't we have more than a sing-along over the credits? And where were the Pixar out-takes at the end? I'm not sure the kids in the audience liked the movie so much either.  The kid sitting next to me knew who all the monsters were; she shouted their names out to her dad who was sitting down the row.  But I don't recall her laughing.  Or anything. What was there was clever and even tugged at a heartstring.  It's what wasn't there that's bothersome."
"dbn3","6","2","5","13 January 2002"," Beautiful, but Soulless (6/10)
","(I saw this in the theater, YMMV)<br/><br/>Let's start with what makes this movie stand out from the crowd -- Pixar's rendering of the big blue furry monster, Sulley.  I am in complete awe of what Pixar has accomplished with rendering Sulley.  My mouth fell open and my head spun during a scene where Sulley is lying on the ground in a snowstorm.  Lying in the snow with all of his fur waving in the wind and the snowflakes flying by and getting caught in his fur.  Spectacular. Amazing. Probably took months of the entire processing power of every computer on the west coast to render that scene.<br/><br/>Other than that, there ain't much else to recommend this movie.  I didn't care one whit about any of the characters in this movie.  None of them, not even Boo, the little girl.  She was soooo precious and soooo fearless that she was completely unbelievable.  In addition, there is seemingly a new rule mandating the use of a rollercoaster-like scene in every computer animated movie.  If you like that kind of stuff, you won't be disappointed.  The rollercoaster-like scene in Monsters, Inc. seems to go on forever, and starts to feel like just another gimmick to show off how smart those programmers are.<br/><br/>Monsters, Inc. is a wonderful demonstration for the technical wizardry at Pixar, but it just never quite makes it as a movie."

","This movie didn't do anything right; the comedy was bad, the characters were completely undeveloped, and the story was just plain uninteresting and unintelligent.

"WordtwisterMN","2","6","27","27 November 2002"," Nothing funny, with no surprises.
","This movie is often compared to Shrek.  I found no comparisons but for the main character and the animated look. This movie offers a story line spread so thinly that it tore within the first 30 minutes.  I didn't laugh once in the first hour before I decided to get up and write how boring this movie is.  The little girl is cute, but offers no surprises, and has very little attitude for supposedly a scary presence.  The monsters remind me of the blue-collar characters from the row houses of Baltimore.  The viewer is not allowed any kind of reference to any of the monsters past or their future. The entire movie is predictable, boring and difficult to watch. You will not likely run across anyone that says they have watched this movie multiple times as they did with Shrek.  I give it a 2 of 10, and advise anyone that expects to see anything mythical, creative, or enchanting to avoid this movie.<br/><br/>There's not even one good line in Monsters Inc.

Even the villain does not feel his sense of danger. And inside, in the compact 90 minutes, there is an endless stream of jokes, especially the one-eyed dragon's words are really too much. The overall setting of the film is very closely related to children without losing the sense of science fiction. It is also a very good idea to use the screams of scared children to generate electricity. At the end, laughing instead of crying made the film's style rise again.

The design of the characters and the world is like something out of a child's imagination, while the story is well-plotted and engaging.<br/><br/>As a child, I recall being most interested in the buddy comedy elements and the chase scene through the colorful warehouse filled with bedroom doors. As an adult, I've come to better appreciate how the movie works as a parable about becoming a parent. Sully is initially interested in his own glory and the petty goal of being the best. When Boo comes into his life, everything changes-- everything he believed was important turns out to be nothing compared to the fatherly love he feels for her. It's sweet without rotting your teeth and the ending... oh God, it still makes me cry.<br/><br/>One of Pixar's best, without a doubt."

","'Monsters, Inc.' is one of Pixar's best known and most widely popular movies - an endearing and highly likeable family movie bursting with ideas and imagination. Though not one of Pixar's best and not a personal favourite of mine, I did get a lot of enjoyment out of this movie, especially the characters, which are all brilliantly unique, entertaining and genuinely funny.<br/><br/>The storyline, as enjoyable as it is, is not on the same level as the likes of 'Toy Story' and 'Up'. I always get the feeling I'm watching something special with those movies, but I think 'Monsters, Inc.', for all its creativity and likeability, lacks that special quality to put it up there with the very best animated pictures. That said, judging it on its own merits, this is a great animated family movie and one of those movies that is just impossible to dislike."
"zkonedog","8","1","2","6 March 2017"," Laughs + Heart = Fun
","Disney/Pixar movies always work best on the ""funny + heart"" formula. ""Monsters, Inc."", while not absolutely perfecting that formula, works well enough to produce another solid animation effort.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie poses that the ""monster in the closet"" you were scared of as a kid was indeed real and just trying to scare you to collect your screams, which powers their entire industry. One ""routine day at the Monster scare factory"", however, top scare-er Sulley (John Goodman) and pal Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) bring a small girl back into their own world, wreaking havoc along the way and learning a pretty valuable lesson in the process.<br/><br/>To be sure, ""Monsters, Inc."" is a great animation effort. It is witty (for both adults and children), full of action/adventure, and has a lot of heart/emotions weaved into the proceedings. Especially standing out here is the voice acting from Crystal and Goodman, whose characters have such a great report with each other.<br/><br/>The only reason I give the movie four stars instead of five is because, unlike the top tier of Disney/Pixar efforts like Toy Story, Wall-E, Finding Nemo, and Up, this one shies away from the take-home message when it could have embraced it. For example, and I'll try to be as spoiler- free as possible here, towards the end of the movie the two leads make a discovery (which is hinted at throughout the film) that will change the ""Monster world"" forever. Instead of really delving into the consequences of that revelation, however, the producers choose to ""keep things simple"" and not get too deep. I think they could have gone a little deeper and doing so would have vaulted this one into the upper echelon.<br/><br/>Overall, though, ""Monsters, Inc."" is a fun film that the entire family can enjoy. While it may not be the absolute best of its kind, it is still easily better than most."

"tlove79","9","1","2","3 May 2016"," Monsters, Inc., A quirky twist on the interactions between monsters and humans
","This family-friendly animation takes place in the world of monsters. At Monsters, Inc., the monsters enter doors, leading to the closets of children on a quest to scare as many of them as possible to fill up energy tanks that help keep their city powered. As with many companies, Monsters, Inc. keeps track of top performers, thus invoking a competitive spirit amongst the monster employees. Things change when Sullivan, also known as Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) stumbles upon a little girl named Boo (voiced by Mary Gibbs) and is forced to face and perhaps overcome his fears.<br/><br/>Sulley is the top scarer and has been for many months. His best friend Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal) stays close by helping him stay in top performer shape, though he sometimes gets sidetracked by his romantic interest, receptionist Celia (voiced by Jennifer Tilly). Sulley's fiercest competition comes from Randall (voiced by Steve Buscemi) who will do whatever he can, with some help from his sidekick Fungus (voiced by Frank Oz), to snag the top spot from Sulley, including cheating. <br/><br/>Humans, primarily children, are a feared species, so when Boo, who Randall has a lot of success frightening, enters Monsters, Inc., it changes Sulley's life forever. Initially, Sulley is afraid and does everything he can to get rid of Boo. As Sulley gets to know her, over the course of time, he becomes less fearful and even turns into Boo's protector. Eventually, Sulley learns that his fear, along with the other monsters, of children is misguided and over exaggerated due to lack of knowledge. This makes me think of the movie Inside Out and how our emotions can lead us astray if we don't keep them in check. Once Sulley gains some insight, his new awareness ultimately leads to a delightful change in how business is conducted at Monsters, Inc. <br/><br/>There were shadowy effects throughout the film which added a sense of suspense. However, the lighting on Sulley is soft, which gave warmth to his character, even though he's one of the largest monsters. The transitions from scene to scene were smooth. The music effects are suspenseful, happy and playful in the right areas. The attention to detail in all sectors made the movie thrive. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed Monsters, Inc. I would rank it as one of my favorite animated movies. The writing is funny and witty, and the props are clever. I look forward to watching it again. It was a nice spin on overcoming fears and not judging a book by its cover. Two lessons that are universal and relatable to all ages, races, and genders."

"C22Man","7","1","2","22 January 2016"," Excellent in nearly every way
","The premise behind Monsters, Inc. isn't something that we haven't seen before, but it is one that allows for a lot of creativity and one that the film takes full advantage of. Pixar was still in a relatively early stage when the film came out, yet it was the perfect way to show that their imagination knew no bounds. It centres on two monsters at a company whose job it is to scare children because the monster world is powered by the screams of children. Now that is a really inventive idea. But their world is thrown into disarray when a child called Boo gets out (with monsters believing children are toxic) and our two heroes have to get her back, all while not being found out and uncovering a wider conspiracy. This leads to a story packed full of twists and turns, plenty of comedy and action set pieces, and a surprising emotional heft.<br/><br/>The story itself allows for a vast amount of creativity with the concept of monsters having this kind of job, all the unique designs and the fact that they are terrified of children. It is also great how detailed the story is, because you simply never know where it's going or how it's going to end up and its constantly gripping as a result of that. The two leads are vital to the story and thankfully they are both great. Sulley is the company's top scarer, yet on the inside he's just a big teddy bear and there is something so endearing about him. He's a really warm screen presence and seeing his relationship with Boo grow throughout the film is strangely beautiful. Mike is much more of a wise-cracker and somewhat neurotic, which actually makes him a great contrast to Sulley. He does provide a lot of laughs and the friendship with Sulley feels very genuine. In fact both John Goodman and Billy Crystal deserve praise for giving such excellent performances.<br/><br/>It's also impressive how well Boo is handled. Usually very young children can be annoying or plain boring, but she is the right balance of curious and gentle whilst still having enough funny moments. The fact that she speaks in a muddled sort of baby talk is another positive and actually makes her more endearing. Most notable is her relationship with Sulley, as it is build up just perfectly and their final moments together are incredibly touching. That emotional core between is a real strong point of the film. The films comedic moments are very well done too. Mike relies much more on his witticisms and anxious behaviour to get laughs which works surprisingly well, while the other monsters ineptitude when it comes to scaring also provides a great number of amusing moments.<br/><br/>With that said one of the films few weaknesses are its villains. They're not bad, just a little one-dimensional and underdeveloped. Randall is a typically snide and aggressive rival, we don't learn anything about him and he doesn't really do much but try to hunt down Boo. He either needed to be funnier or more threatening to leave an impression. Waternoose also turns out to be involved in the plot despite his initial loyalty to Sulley, his conflict does make sense yet he is also a little underused. Despite that he does have a good design and James Coburn does a good job vocal. That said their actions do lead to a spectacular climax. It basically has Sulley and Mike frantically searching for Boo's door in what is effectively a gigantic room of doors. It's fun, it's exciting, it's tense, it is exactly the type of big climax you'd want the film to have. <br/><br/>The animation is excellent once again. The fact that its set in a world of monsters allows for some really interesting and colourful designs, the majority of monsters look unique and are memorable as a result of that. Just looking at Sulley, the amount of detail put in with all his hairs is so impressive. We don't see too much of the monster world, but the factory is an interesting setting and still permits plenty of creativity. The side characters are a bit hit-and- miss, although the Abominable Snowman (Pixar regular John Ratzenberger) gets some really good lines and the cranky receptionist Roz is enjoyable. Randy Newman's score has an effective light, jazzy feel to it and it is brilliant. Not only does it suit the tone of the film, but it also adds a nice energy to the more action packed scenes and provides some wonderfully emotive melodies.<br/><br/>So on the whole Monsters, Inc. is another big success for Pixar. I think that it works so because it gets the key areas right. The premise is interesting, the two leads are a great pairing, the main conflict is gripping and there is a strong emotional centre to the film that makes it even stronger. It is easy to care about these characters and want to see them succeed. I do think the villains are a bit weak and maybe the conspiracy is a little unneeded, but neither does too much damage to the overall product and that is because its central focus is so good. Added to that the animation, score and comedy all work fantastically to the best effect. It's a film that is funny, moving and engaging in all the right ways."

Inventive conclusion with imaginative directing by Pete Docter. Terrific vocal work by John Goodman and Billy Crystal as Sully and Mike. Sully is famed as the top scare monster while Mike is sort of his manager. Now they are met with a dilemma to help this young girl and discover that laughter is a much more powerful energy. Steve Buscemi voices Randall in what is the standard villain but his punishment fits the crime with amusing results. Jennifer Tilly voices a Meduca-like figure who acts as the romantic interest to Mike. The role is perhaps the weakest in the film. John Ratzenberger makes a great cameo voicing the Abominable Snowman who desires a change in the perception of him. Theme visualizes that there is more power in love than fear. Score: 8 ½ / 10"

","I love this film. I'm not usually a fan of animated films, I find them emotionless and boring, but I think that with the relationship of Sully and Boo, mixed with the humor of Mike made this the perfect family film. I still love it today, years after it came out and will never pass up an opportunity to watch it. <br/><br/>I think that one of my favorite parts of the film is the very end, when Mike gives Sully the present of Boo's door. It is lovely to see that Mike would do this, seeing as though he was not to keen on the child in the first place, and I have to admit that it brought me to tears. <br/><br/>It is one of Disney Pixar's best films, in my opinion and one of the only ones I can watch the whole way through.<br/><br/>The humor of when the monsters are describing t children, with 'lazer eyes' and 'mind powers' is truly funny and keeps the light heartiness of a child's film. And yet, the way Sully treats Boo can captivate the hearts of many people who prefer emotional films.<br/><br/>Brilliant........just brilliant!!"

","After exploring the worlds of toys and bugs in the two Toy Story films and A Bug's Life, the award-winning computer animation company Pixar delves into the realm of monsters with its fourth feature entitled,Monster Inc.This computer-animated comedy-adventure film is directed by Pete Docter, released by Walt Disney Pictures, and the fourth film produced by Pixar Animation Studios. Co-directed by Lee Unkrich and David Silverman, it stars two monsters who work for a company named Monsters, Inc.: top scarer James P. Sullivan or Sulle,voiced by John Goodman and his one-eyed assistant, Mike Wazowski,voiced by Billy Crystal.Other voice overs is provided by Mary Gibbs,Steve Buscemi,James Coburn,Jennifer Tilly and Frank Oz.Monsters generate their city's power by scaring children, but they are terribly afraid themselves of being contaminated by children, so when one enters Monstropolis, Sulley finds his world disrupted.<br/><br/>Hulking, blue-furred behemoth Sully and his one-eyed assistant Mike Wazowski are employed by Monsters, Inc., a scream processing factory. It seems that the denizens of their realm thrive on the screams of kids spooked by monsters lurking under their beds and in their closets. It's the job of Sully, Mike, and their co-workers, including sarcastic Randall Boggs, crab-like CEO Henry J. Waternoose, and lovely snake- headed receptionist Celia to keep the frights flowing. When Sully and Mike are followed back into the monster world by a very unafraid little human girl named Boo, they are exiled to her universe, where they discover that such a modern-day mythological specimen as the Abominable Snowman is a fellow refugee.<br/><br/>Even though Monsters, Inc lacks the sophistication of the Toy Story series, it is a still delight for children of all ages due to the fact that John Lasseter and the Pixar crew know how to turn shared human feelings and experiences into strange and delightful animated features.No doubt that this is one of their most solid efforts.Aside from that,it is a charming cartoon classic."
"Igenlode Wordsmith","6","1","2","3 September 2010"," Not much here for grown-ups
","Coming to this film late (I missed it the first time round) I'm afraid found myself rather underwhelmed. Shorn of the 'wow-look-at-the-fur' novelty rendering factor, what remains is a rather thin piece of slapstick with additional heavy-handed sentiment; the level of humour is distinctly juvenile, epitomised by the 'yellow snow' jokes, and the moral message hammered home with a twenty-foot mallet.<br/><br/>Compared to films like ""Wall-E"" or ""The Incredibles"", this has little to offer adult viewers -- the whole lengthy opening sequence revolves around what is basically a single role-reversal concept, that the monsters are in fact terrified of the children they scare, but this idea is worked to death long before we actually start to care about the characters, with resulting tedium. The film picks up in interest later on, but it then descends into a long chase sequence, while I did find the sentimental sequences grated with excessive repetition.<br/><br/>'Mike' is a typical Annoying Disney Sidekick of the type I've never cared for, but the little girl is charming (and her pre-verbal sequences conveyed in what amounts to silent film technique, an interesting precursor to the long wordless introductory sequence of ""Up""). Other characters, including Sulley, I found 'all right' but nothing very special.<br/><br/>I suppose I'm unduly disappointed in the film because Pixar have established the boundaries of expectation so high; but this picture is to ""The Incredibles"" as ""Flushed Away"" is to ""Chicken Run"" -- for an Oscar-winning Pixar animation, it was rather more generic and less inspired than I was hoping for."
"kill-the-boxtrolls","10","1","2","28 March 2010"," Who else would hate Monsters Inc.??
","Its one of the best animated films I've ever seen over these ten years and its far better than monster movies like Monsters vs. Aliens or anything else it was just adorable. I like animated films but this should've received a golden globe for best picture or something. Its about a monster with blue-fur named ""Sulley"" has a companion or something named ""Mike"" and they hear of a commercial called Monsters, Inc. where a factory, Monsters Incorporated is aimed for the monsters to fear children in their closets. They soon discover a small toddler named ""Mary"" or ""Boo"" and all she seemed to do is do ""baby-talk"" and the reason why she is doing that was because between the character and the real actress were both two and a half so she couldn't talk yet but she was potty-trained. And the reason why Sulley was so scared of Boo was because she was a different specious, other monsters were afraid of her, too and they think she could do anything she wants but to wreak havoc. The next day, Sulley and Mike get used to Boo and dresses her up as a tiny little toddler monster to keep a disguise. Although Mike has a somewhat girlfriend named who'd he call ""Scoompchie-Poo"" but broke up with him because he ignored her birthday party all because of the havoc-like child. Boo soon needed to go to the bathroom but seems to have a pretty secret fear of ""Randall"" the monster next to the ""top scarer"" Sulley. She soon escapes and Sulley and Mike set off for a wild, crazy misadventure to look for her. They soon found her in a serious of normal pre-schoolers and which Boo calls Sulley ""kitty"" as her favorite monster found the monsters. It's a little disappointing to see a kid be upset over a monster scaring her off so badly on the set but this is a spoiler and you know why?? Because Sulley is seriously the top scarer of Monsters, Inc. but she soon got used to Sulley and Randall and has no fear over them anymore. The movie's pretty intelligent, yet clever with two monsters finding a normal but average-intelligence little girl and help her on a clever misadventure to find the correct door."

","Monsters Inc thee fourth animated movie from Pixar I thought was an hilarious film! I loved the idea of monsters having the job to scare kids through their doors in a factory and then all of a sudden a little girl gets loose in their world! That was hilarious! My favorite character was Roz. I loved how she was pestering Mike about turning in his paperwork and then at the end being the Number 1 CDA Agent and she didn't wanna see any paperwork on the incident with Boo! That was hilarious! I also liked Randall Boggs and I think he's my favorite Pixar Villain along with Hopper and Syndrome. I loved how he could make himself invisible and I liked how he got banished to that trailer and got beaten up mistaken for a gator! That was hilarious! Filled with wonderful characters, great animation, and a great story Monsters Inc is a true classic that'll go on forever and ever! Good job again Pixar!"
"Victorious_One","9","1","2","29 October 2005"," A Cute, Enjoyable Film
","""Monsters, Inc"" is a lovely family film to watch. The story is basically about a Monster City, in which its power is generated by scaring children. But what's funny about this is that the people of this city, or I should say, the monsters of this city are more afraid of the children than the children are afraid of them. But when a young girl accidentally enters Monster City, the top scarer, Sullivan and his friend Mike start sharing a bond with this girl, or what Sullivan called her, Boo, after realizing that she is no harm to them.The story is somewhat weird, yet hilarious, and is full of laughs. ""Monsters, Inc"" is a very enjoyable film and is worth watching and owning."
"griml001","8","1","2","30 June 2005"," When a little girl is released into an unknown world, chaos ensues...
","Pixar have, it seems, done it again. Coupled with breath-taking animation and a superb storyline, Monsters, Inc. has achieved something truly incredible- a film able to entertain not only children, but those 'over the hill' too.<br/><br/>The basic plot is that there is another universe, full of the monsters that one sees in childhood hiding under your bed or in your closet. These monsters go to all different parts of the world through portals in the doors to be able to scare the children, and in return collect the children's screams, as it is, for them, a form of energy. But chaos ensues when a little girl is accidentally let into the Monster World, and a more sinister plan is revealed...<br/><br/>The voice acting, for one, is superb, with each character's personality shining through magnificently. The actors were chosen well, with John Goodman as the cheery James P. Sullivan, and Billy Crystal providing the voice of the marmite-esquire character Mike Wazowski. (Marmite because you either love his quirky jokes, or hate his boastful nature.) Also, a kudos has to be given to Steve Buscemi for playing the sinister, yet, in my opinion, weirdly lovable character of Randall Boggs- his voice fits perfectly.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is definitely not one to be missed, and deserved all of the praise it has received."
"FrankBooth_DeLarge","9","1","2","3 February 2005"," Not as good as the other Pixar movies, but still great
","Monster's Inc. is another part of the great Pixar movies. Pixar really is the leading company in CGI effects. If you look at it, Pixar introduced the first fully computer animated movie Toy Story to the world in 1995. Ever since then, Pixar has continued to make movies and other company's like Dreamworks have also gotten started. <br/><br/>(possible Spoiler) Monster's Inc. follows the world in which monsters live in. Their everyday job is to go into kid's rooms at night and scare them, because their screams are useful for energy in the monster world. The two main characters are the green one eyed Mike(voiced by Billy Chrystal) and Sully(voiced by John Goodman) who are the best workers of Monsters Inc. and are competing against an evil monster named Randall(voiced by my all time favorite actor Steve Buscemi). Despite being the fearless and ferocious monsters that they are, they are never supposed to touch a child or any of its belongings, because they think children are toxic. Everything goes wrong when a child happens to come into their world and isn't afraid of the monsters, but the monsters are afraid of her. The rest is pure fun, Pixar style.<br/><br/>Most kids should enjoy this, it is possible that kids around age three will be scared by it, but it will probably make them braver about their fear of monsters. This is a great movie, and I think anyone who wants to watch a fun movie should watch it."

However, the Monsters in this movie are just as afraid of children and believe them to be bad.<br/><br/>The movie points out how modern society motivates us with fear and how the fear of others is used to fuel our own lives.<br/><br/>The friendship between Scully and Boo reveals that when we address or get to know our fear, our fears can dissolve into something good like friendship.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed how the movie turned negativity into positivity. <br/><br/>This movie is guaranteed to make you laugh."

The monsters self are terrified for kids and if they touch one some kind of police shows up and cleans them up.

"lingmeister","8","1","2","14 January 2003"," Disney and Pixar hits a home run again
","Another great movie from the Disney/Pixar team.  It has the unique story which is great for both children and adults.  All the little touches throughout the film depicting the Monstropolis world are inventive and fun. It did not go for parody overload like Shrek did, but instead went with understated quality.  These things were not flooding the screen, but were placed here and there so that it would reward one who catches them.<br/><br/>For the story to be an offshoot of children's imagination and expand to a whole world based on that is very imaginative.  The rest of the film has it all, being clever, witty, heartfelt, edge of your seat action and suspense.<br/><br/>Another inventiveness is the the musical during the ending credits, which is the off-shoot of what Wazowski and Sully made up during their cover-up, as opposed to Shrek's kareoke after the movie, which has nothing to do with the film.<br/><br/>The other great part of Disney is that the personalities of each character takes on the being they are portraying.  Although this film cannot follow that format since almost all the characters were monsters and we could only assume how they act in real life (as opposed to a caterpillar or a fish.) But it also allows the animator to be limitless in their interpretation of the monsters physical attributes and the way they act, although in some parts, Billy Crystal has to be Billy Crystal.  On top of that, Boo character just stole our heart.<br/><br/>In all, a great movie for every member of the family to enjoy."
"Old Joe","Null","1","2","12 November 2002"," You won't believe your eye.' after watching this Pixar masterpiece!
","After you have seen Pixar's Monsters, Inc.' two things are apparent about monsters. One is that humans think monsters are scary, and two, is that humans really scare them! I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a cartoon or a movie so much. I know that Pixar has had great success with many animated movies in the past. However, I feel that Monsters Inc.' out-classes such titles as, Toy Story', Shrek' and A Bug's Life' by far. With its funny story, great characters and wonderful voiceovers, Monsters, Inc.' will be a tough act to follow in the world of movie animation. Take a look at the monsters who say We Scare Because We Care'.<br/><br/>Monsters, Inc. is the largest scare factory in the monster world. The top kid scarer is James ""Sully"" Sullivan, a huge intimidating monster with blue fur, large purple spots and horns. His scare assistant and best friend is Mike Wazowski, a lime green, opinionated, feisty, one-eyed monster. Scaring children isn't such an easy job, monsters believe children are toxic and that direct contact with them would be catastrophic. Inside the factory can be found the factory's crab-like CEO Henry J. Waternoose, the beguiling serpent-haired receptionist Celia and the sarcastic chameleon monster, Randall Boggs, who schemes to replace Sully as Monsters Inc.'s top Scarer. Visiting from the human world is Boo, a tiny girl who turns Mike and Sully's world upside-down.<br/><br/>There is so much to like about Monsters, Inc.'. The team from Pixar really give great attention to detail when they bring out an animated feature. I really like the computer animated graphics, as many of these characters to me seem to be real. The many facial expressions these monsters have are just wonderful. They were so funny, that they made me laugh many times. The sounds used in Monsters Inc' were of the finest quality and help to define the monsters and the world they live in. I also like the story that Pixar made for this film. Having doors between the monsters world and ours is clever. Also having the story follow the fortunes of Mike and Sully is good, as it is never dull or boring when it come to those two characters. Add in the what Boo does to the story, I feel it makes for the perfect script. I enjoy how this story ends, as it made me feel very satisfied for watching.<br/><br/>The characters that were invented for this film are some of the best I have ever seen. My favourite is the simple, but idiotic eyeball, Mike Wazowski'. Almost every time I saw his eye appear onscreen, he would make me laugh. Mike's best friend, is James Sully' Sullivan, and scaring kids is what he is really good at. Mike and Sully are a great team. There characters show the audience that real friends stick together through thick and thin. The other good characters include Mike's love interest Celia. The nicknames the pair call each other are hilarious. I cannot forget to mention one of the main stars of the show, Boo (Mary Gibbs). She is the little child who manages to make her way inside Monsters, Inc.'. I love her funny cry of Mike-Wazowski'. Yet with the good comes the bad. The meanest monster in Monstropolis' is a snaky chameleon character, called Randal Boggs. He is trying to become the number one scream collector at Monsters, Inc'. Another character not be trusted or liked at Monsters Inc' is Henry J. Waternoose, the CEO of the plant. He is a cross between a crab and spider, and only wants his employees to scare children and make him successful.<br/><br/>The voiceovers used in this film were out of this world'. Having stars such as Billy Crystal as Mike, John Goodman as Sully, Jennifer Tilly as Celia, James Coburn as Henry and Steve Buscemi as Randall, were all perfect choices to voice each character. You can actually picture Crystal as Mike, the talkative sidekick and Goodman as Sully, the big cuddly blue Monster, who really does care about everyone. I love Roger Ebert's cheeky comment in reference to Jennifer Tiley's character of Celia, `What she (Celia) sees in him (Mike) is beyond me, although if there is anyone who can figure out how to have sex with a green eyeball, that would be Jennifer Tilly. I can imagine her brassy voice: 'Blink! Blink!'.' 	<br/><br/>There are some great scenes in Monsters, Inc'. I like almost every scene with Mike, as he is crazy, funny and stupid. Sully's introduction with Boo is also a highlight, as we all see what a little child can do to the number one scarer'. Then what follows is the funny scene where Mike says the silly line of `This is for the up-coming company play put that thing back where it came from or so help me'. Watch out for the play on the DVD, it is a classic extra feature. Another entertaining sequence in the film is the rollercoaster chase that Mike and Sully have to do, contending with hundreds of conveyor-driven doors to make sure that Boo is safe.<br/><br/>
I recently had the chance to compare the other animated film which has been released at the moment, Ice Age'. While I know it has had good reviews from many people, I found to be nowhere near as good as what 'Monsters, Inc.' was or is. Pixar is truly talented at bringing us movies, which are normally thought to be just for children'. However, this movie can be enjoyed by many different groups as its genre suggests, such as the whole family'. I know being a kid helps me for starters, but if you cannot like Mike and the gang' then there is something wrong. I wait in anticipation for what Pixar brings us next. If you are a true movie fan, then do yourself a favour and show that you care' by watching this animated classic.<br/><br/>

","Over the years Hollywood has started to shun the Disney Film Corporation and this was evident in 2001 as ""Monsters, Inc."" failed to bring home Oscar gold for Best Animated Feature as the over-rated and somewhat annoying ""Shrek"" stole the coveted award. ""Monsters, Inc."" (from the team that has worked on the ""Toy Story"" series and ""A Bug's Life"") is an outstanding comedy for all age groups that has important messages about acceptance, friendship and love. In a world of monsters, power is generated by the screams of young children. When a young girl is sucked into their world chaos strikes. The monsters are scared to death of contamination, but two lovable monsters (voiced by Billy Crystal and John Goodman) begin to realize she is not dangerous at all as they try to hide her from those around them. While trying to get her back to her rightful place they learn that power can be generated in ways other than scares. ""Monsters, Inc."" is a smart, innovative production that has merit in many areas of the cinematic machine. It is a good teaching tool to very young audiences on how to treat those around them. An instant classic. 5 stars out of 5."

The story and characters were more diverse and, the animation was much more complicated. Kudos to the casting agent who was able to bring in talent like Frank Oz, John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi to play the roles of some of the actors.

","What a disappointment! We've come to expect a lot from Pixar and the earlier films have not failed. Monsters is a failure. The story line, while novel, is weak and thin. The pace of the movie is a keen to a Saturday morning Bugs Bunny 3 min short. Nothing sets in and most of the film is spent in a chase scene of various sorts. Next is the lack of characters, Mike (the green ball) frankly isn't that interesting, he's almost cute, almost really funny, but then not. Sully (the furry guy) is the haphazard hero. The duo reminded me of the Lewis/Martin act. After these 2, nothing, zip, nada worth while.<br/><br/>My kids are normally glued to any Disney event, but even at 90 minutes they were bored after 30.

What sucked in the film:<br/><br/>1. The storyline. Unlike A Bug's Life and Toy Stories, Monsters, Inc. is just another typical primitive, boring, sentimental Disney film.<br/><br/>
2. Character and sets design. Nothing original here. Pixar is repeating itself. The baby girl Boo is cute though.<br/><br/>3. Dialogs are supposed to be funny but they are not.

","This movie lived up to its expectations. With great ease, I might add. It is slightly different from previous Pixar movies, the fact that it wasn't directed by John Lasseter might have something to do with it:), because I felt that there was less of that universal humor that anyone, be it a 5 year old child or an adult can find funny. But the lack of humor was replaced with a truly touching story and one of the best movie climaxes I have seen in a long time. I also thought that the very, very ending of the movie is nothing less than perfect and I left the cinema with a desire to see the movie again. John Goodman and Billy Crystal were great choices for the main characters, but they could have done more with Steve Buscemi's character, if for anything because he has a very distinctive and likable voice. A great story, nice characters and THE perfect ending make ""Monsters, Inc"" a great movie experience.         <br/><br/>Can't wait for the next one.                 9/10"

","Monsters, Inc is OK for the effects but the story is not at all engaging.<br/><br/>It seems to be a series of interlocking sketches but doesn't really have much to say as a whole. I think Pixar tried to do something different from the usual film plot conventions - a kind of big-city, Woody Allen rhythm to the story - but unfortunately it comes across as no plot at all.<br/><br/>The creators seemed to lose interest in the story they were telling themselves occasionally and start off in different directions, relying on stereotypes (or the reversal of - e.g the short fast-talking one is stupid, the large slow-talking one is quick on the uptake) for jokes.<br/><br/>The ""old bag at the front desk"" character and the dumb blonde type girl monster is sexist, insulting rubbish - and as for Boo - anyone who has children, or indeed is a child, will know that this is nothing like the reality of being a child.<br/><br/>The whole thing seemed pointless - even my seven year old lost interest and fell asleep.<br/><br/>The atmosphere may possibly have more resonance if you live in New York, but to us it meant nothing. Toy Story 2 was far more universal, and Shrek, with the main character who was perfectly happy living in a swamp on his own, and the rat-eating princess, blows it out of the water in terms of originality."

"Aidan McGuinness","8","1","2","11 February 2002"," Pixar (mostly) do it again
","There's very few movies that I'd see based solely on a name attached to it. One of these would be a film by David Fincher and another would be a film by Pixar. Pixar produced ""Toy Story"" and, funnily enough, ""Toy Story 2"". Anyone who has seen those classics will realize that that is more than enough to make you go and see ""Monsters, Inc.""<br/><br/>How does the movie live up to the legacy of Pixar? Mostly pretty damn well. Firstly it looks wonderful - animation in movies is constantly improving and here we can see how Pixar have been able to enhance details such as the fine movement of hairs on Sully's body. At the same time the movie is able to feel like an animation - it has no pretensions about trying to be real as the characters are animated with extra-large-wide eyes, disproportionate heads, etc. <br/><br/>The characters in here are not as good as in the ""Toy Story"" series. That's the film's biggest flaw. They're not as cleverly drawn or as diverse. Certainly we have no cynical Woody with whom the adults of the audience can relate to. Sully is the gentle-lovable-lug and Wazowski (Billy Crystal) is the wise-cracking-side-kick. It's an old and popular formula because it works. The villain of the piece is Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) and he's about as one-dimensional as they come which is no more than you'd expect for a movie aimed for the child's market. Boo - the child of the movie - is adorably cute without every being irritatingly so. You can't help but love her and she's the nicest piece of the cast. However in the end I found the cast somewhat unmemorable and the voice-over talent weren't used to their full capabilities (Buscemi could certainly let rip as a cold, calculating villain had be been able to). <br/><br/>However a comedy lives and dies by it's script and here ""Monsters, Inc."" is very good. Some comments here suggest that the humour is aimed for children and is thus a hit-and-miss affair with adults but that's a load of cobblers - I was in a packed theatre and every single person was laughing. The humour really kicks into key when Boo - the child who accidentally stumbles into the world of ""Monsters, Inc."" - arrives on the scene and causes havoc by merely wandering around. The concept of the movie - that their world is powered by the screams generated by the monsters that come out of the cupboard to scare children - is wonderful but the final plot resolution is painfully obvious (I know, it's a kids movie but even so...). The script is very well paced and there's plenty of diverting action. Admittedly the humour isn't as clever as ""Shrek"" - there's none of the sly referencing or winks to the older audience - but it's still pretty quick and the out-takes over the closing credits are fantastic.<br/><br/>""Shrek"" is the only recently comparable piece to ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Shrek"" slightly wins out by virtue of acknowledging it's older audience and having slightly better characterization. That aside ""Monsters, Inc."" is the best comedy I've seen released this year by a long shot and is well well *well* worth seeing. A very firm 8.3/10."
"Quinoa1984","7","1","2","2 November 2001"," Entertaining and imaginative 4th film from Pixar
","Monsters Inc., another fine animated movie from the folks at Pixar takes a turn from toys and bugs and goes for something most kids and adults can identify with (adults may have to reach back in time though for that one), being afraid of what's behind the closet at night.  It turns out, in this film, that monsters do lurk behind the closet, and they scare kids as a power resource to give electricity to Monstropolis where the monsters live. 2 of the scarers include Sully (John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), who have it good in their job until a mishap occurs- a little child crawls through to the other side and creates a different type of adventure for the two monsters.<br/><br/>Incredibly imaginative and colorful computer-animated, Moster Inc. is definitely one of the best family films of the year by giving genuine entertainment to kids and adults (an added incentive for adults to see the movie: Crystal does a little of his old stand-up near the end) just like the past pixar movies.  The biggest liability: the plot seems structured in the same way as Bug's Life and the Toy Story pics and seems typical for the genre.  Otherwise, quite the see.  Other voices include James Coburn, Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi, Bonnie Hunt and Frank Oz. A-"

"fjhuerta-2","9","1","2","16 December 2001"," Polygon characters with more emotion than human actors.
","How do the wizards at Pixar do it? How can they?<br/><br/>That's the only thing I could think about when I watched ""Monsters, Inc."" yesterday. And realized that, no, nothing I had seen there existed. It's a lot easier when watching traditional animation not to get too immersed in the scenes; after all, you are always aware ""this is not here"". But CGI is making tremendous advances every day.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it's not only the realistic animation what impresses the most. It's the heart and soul Pixar embed in each and every of its films. Witness ""Shreck"", a very good film on its own right, for example. It was a major hit when it was running on theaters, yet it's seldom talked about nowadays. Now, think ""Toy Story 2"" or ""Toy Story"". Both were movie milestones, and definitely are destined to be classics in a couple of years (dare I say both are ""instant classics""?). <br/><br/>The secret, or reason, is in the powerful dose of humanity Pixar gives each and every one of their creations. They all have so many human traits it's very hard not to end up liking (loving?) them as if they were real. In a sense they are, being perfectly well rounded characters in perfectly recognizable situations. The fears and hopes of human beings are indelibly etched in every character (fear of death, fear of loneliness, fear of failure, etc.), which makes them even dearer to our hearts.<br/><br/>From the animated short that's shown at the beginning of the movie (the ""Birds"" featurette, a very similar concept to the ""Carnival of the Animals"" section of Fantasia 2000... very funny) to  story development, ""Monsters, Inc."" works like a charm all the way, all the time. Steve Buscemi, John Goodman and Billy Crystal are always having a ball, with a tremendous sense of chemistry between them. Couple that with the prettiest, best CGI character I've ever seen (Boo), and you have a group of superb people playing their parts perfectly well, in a story that is funny, very sweet, and that will leave you filled with love and laughter.<br/><br/>
Still... I think this movie comes *this* close to being another Toy Story 2. It's not that it is a bad movie; it's just that TS2 is a landmark; not only the best CGI movie ever, but one of the best movies ever made, period. TS2 most enduring quality is that, to a certain degree, it can soften the most hardened soul with its sweet, beautiful message, while ""Monsters"" is a bit less complex in its underlying theme. The fact that it managed to retain so much humanity throughout it, though, is a testament that the wizards at Pixar still have that magic touch that eludes so many famous ""live actors"".<br/><br/>I want more."

The animation is wonderful, and the plot and storyline, just brilliant! Billy Crystal and John Goodman did excellent jobs playing the comical Laurel & Hardy-type heros, and Steve Buscemi did a great job putting his sardonic, oliy, charisma into Randall. (Who, by far, is my favorite character.) I loved this movie and not even the Harry Potter movie  could bring it down from number one.<br/><br/>From the sweetness of Boo to Mike's comical antics this movie has enough comedy, action, and drama that whould appeal to all ages.

"DanB-4","8","1","2","18 November 2001"," Fun and Entertaining, but Not a Classic
","Pixar has released its first mediocre film with Monsters Inc. Don't get me wrong, I loved it. But it lacked the sense of wonder of Toy Story, the character strength of A Bug's Life and the zest of Toy Story 2. This movie has some great scenes and fills the screen with wonderful images, but it falls short of its predecessors.<br/><br/>Maybe living up to the first three Pixar features is an impossible task.<br/><br/>Monsters Inc. has a wonderfully original premise. Monstropolis, the land where monsters live, generates its power from the screams of children. Monsters Inc. is a power plant where the most talented ""scarers"" pop through closest doors though a portal into a child's bedroom anywhere on earth. They scare, the kids scream, the monsters leave and Monstropolis has their power. A problem arises - kids just don't scare that easy any more. Only the top scarers are getting results. (As the ads say ""We scare, because we care."")<br/><br/>There are two masterworks of animation in this film. The first is Billy Crystals character, Mike, who is essentially an eyeball with legs and arms. But even with these limited features, Mike still has phenomenal body language and facial expressions. The second is Waternoose, the boss at Monsters Inc voiced by James Cockburn. Waternoose is this giant, multi-eyed thing in a business suit that creeps along on crab legs, but projects the image of ""the boss"" while still being creepy. Amazing.<br/><br/>I found Randall, the villain, just not bad enough. To be a Disney villain, you have to live up to the standards set by the likes of Ursula, Uncle Scar, the Wicked Witch and Jafar and Randall just doesn't cut it.<br/><br/>Still a strong recommendation for this film. There are some fabulous visuals, most notably the wild ride through the warehouse of doors, and it sports a very original premise and works it well. I will never think of the number 2319 the same ever again.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****."

It seemed to me that the characters where reaching for jokes a lot. The plot was not very exciting.  Actually, it was very predictable, you could sit through the first 20 minutes and predict what will happen at the end.  However, for kids seven and under this movie is great.  But, if you are over seven you can try your luck and see how you like it!"

Having excellent CG doesn't cut it, unless, of course, if you're just after the huge budgets. MI just like most American animations on this ""top 50"" is after the ""cool"" look, and no-content.

"stevenleadbetter","5","2","7","10 November 2001"," Not much new to chew on here.
","I have been heard to mention my anticipation of this title in recent weeks. Now that I have finally got my peepers on it, I have to say that it wasn't really my cup of tea. I have a three-year-old son who is difficult to please as far as his entertainment is concerned and, suffice to say, he lost interest in this within half an hour. He adores Toy Story 2 and Tarzan, and can watch them (and has) repeatedly. The fear that a large proportion of ticket-buyers have come to view the now obligatory Attack Of The Clones' trailer is well founded it seemed, with large numbers of the audience leaving before the commencement of the movie. This may account for it's auspicious first weekend record-breaking figures. Anyhow, Star Wars aside. Monsters Inc is very pretty, very cute, very Disney, very Pixar. I first heard about it after buying the Tigger Movie DVD for my son. It seemed quite brilliant at the time, what little I gleaned from the all too brief trailer. I won't ruin the plot for you, but it is basically Toy Story with different characters. Instead of toys that secretly lead a life away from their owners, we now have monsters that are thought of as figments of the child's imaginings. They survive off the screams of children and around the clock they sneak through children's closet, and scare the bejeezus out of them. (Some have more success than others) Billy Crystal and John Goodman are excellent as the main protagonists but the rest of the characters are second rate and fail to inspire any feeling about them. There is a scene reminiscent of Toy Story 2 (Sorry to harp back to this again, it is difficult not to when both films or so similar) when Woody and the gang are trying to save Jessie at the Airport, jumping from suitcase to suitcase. This time we have a countless collection of doors which are used to enter the bedroom of the children the monsters scare, thousands of them hanging from conveyors. This makes for an entertaining chase, but it's been done before, as has most of the movie really. Perhaps some insight from Nick Park or the rest of Aardman Animation would be of some benefit, as their films are quite astonishing in their originality and timing. A picture that is immense fun, but as a wisened old Disney buff, I feel it is more of the same immense fun that we have seen many times before."
"thousandisland","5","2","7","28 February 2002"," Strangely unsatisfying.
","Monsters Inc is unfunny and lacks cast support.  It has a few cute moments and one horrible scene involving a ""scream extractor"" which should have earned a PG rating.  Not sure why Billy Crystal is even in it, as there are no opportunities for humor.  Sulley is sympathetic, but there just isn't enough substance or plot detail in this film to make it captivating.  The ending is nice but this one just kinda left me with an empty, unsatisfied feeling.. Like wanting pizza but forcing yourself to go to the salad bar, maybe?  None of the charm and intricacy of Toy Story, and it seemed too long.  ""For the Birds"" is the prelude short, and way funnier than anything in ""Monsters Inc.""  I will probably rent it and catch the outtakes, but I have no particular desire to see this film again.  'A Bug's Life' had many of the same pitfalls, but it's a better movie than 'Monsters Inc.'  My score: 5 out of 10."
"mattymatt4ever","5","2","7","20 November 2001"," Best for the kiddies
","I have to admit, my main motivation for seeing this film was Billy Crystal. I'm a big fan of his, so when I saw the previews and saw that he was doing the voice of the main character (and I was able to spot Billy's voice in an instant), I said to myself ""I have to see this film.""  Then I found out John Goodman and Steve Buscemi were also doing voices, and I said ""Even better."" That's how you can tell you're getting old:  You're watching animated flicks for the voice-overs...LOL.<br/><br/>On the surface, the plot seems creative.  A world populated by monsters, where the sight of a human being scares the heck of them?  Sounds good so far.  But the idea wasn't very well-executed.  Each of the monsters would go through a door, leading to a kid's bedroom, and scare them.  Supposedly, the energy in Monstropolis--where they live--is powered by human screams. That I just found silly.  And I know they were trying to make the grown-ups laugh with such one-liners as ""Kids just don't get scared the way they used to,"" but it just didn't work.  The idea was too silly!  Again, filmmakers undermining the intelligence of young boys and girls.<br/><br/>
Throughout the film, I couldn't help but anticipate the next thing Billy Crystal's character would spurt out.  Why?  Because he's Billy!  But he never does say anything terribly funny.  Is it because it's a kid's film? Hell, that didn't stop Robin Williams from cracking us up as the genie in ""Alladin.""  Instead, Crystal does a stupid gag where he was tries to cover up the fact that a kid has invaded Monstropolis by performing and song-and-dance number, ""Put that thing back where you came from.  So help me!  So help me!""  Now, if that were not in a kid's film and let's say that gag was in a live action film where Billy was doing the same song-and-dance number critics and audiences would look at him and say, ""What kind of lame crap is he pulling?""<br/><br/>The animation is good, but I think if they're gonna spend a couple years arduously animating a film of this sort, you may as well make sure you have a good, solid idea!  Like ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2.""  I was trying to keep myself awake during part of the film.  It just bored me.  I'm only gonna give in a halfway decent review because of the animation.<br/><br/>

The depiction of the monsters world is enjoyable although it is filled with clichés that dominate most movies. The movie is an easy 8 up to the point it introduces the annoying child that runs into trouble all the time, but miraculously escapes danger every time although the whole city of monsters inc is looking for it. You have the best of the monsters inc monster failing to get rid of a child who is 1/10th of its size. Then sulley grows fond of it and protects it although its supposed to be toxic and she is moaning, crying and being annoying in every way imaginable. Is it cute when a child misbehaves cries and moans all the time? I guess for the screenwriters of monsters inc it is, proving beyond any doubt that they are useless and incapable of coming up with a sweet character for a child.

"Benjamin_Cox","9","1","3","30 March 2005"," A Pixar masterclass, one of their best - 90%
","Many, including myself, will be lamenting the fact that Disney and Pixar are no more - or at least, no longer working together. In the last ten years since ""Toy Story"", they have consistently produced high quality animation that pulls off the one trick Disney rarely could. Pixar films entertain parents and kids alike and it doesn't matter which film you take them to see because all of them stick to the magic formula of being as much fun to everyone as they can. Having re-watched ""The Incredibles"" last night, I still say that film is one of my new favourites and it was with eager anticipation that I watched ""Monsters, Inc."" today. I wasn't disappointed but then again, I wasn't expecting to be.<br/><br/>""Monsters, Inc."" takes a premise that should be as child-unfriendly as you can imagine and reworks it. Monsters, you see, emerge into our world through the door to your closet (or whatever, seeing as we don't have closets in the UK) in order to provoke screams. They need screams because they use them as energy, powering their homes and businesses in Monstropolis. However, monsters are generally afraid of children as well, believing them to be toxic and deadly to the touch. So when a cute little girl called Boo (Mary Gibbs) makes her way through into Monstropolis, all sorts of panic and chaos arises. It soon becomes apparent that Boo is being looked after by top-scarer Sully (John Goodman) and his one-eyed companion Mike (Billy Crystal), who must return Boo to her bedroom before evil monster Randall (Steve Buscemi) finds her.<br/><br/>Words generally fail to do justice to how well ""Monsters, Inc."" looks. If you thought ""The Incredibles"" was as good as it got, think again. Sully is a joy to behold, a large blue yeti-type creature with each of his 2.32 million hairs all flowing and looking unbelievably real. Boo too is brilliant, capturing the movement and garbled speech of a child to perfection. If you don't fall in love with her and her innate ability to wander off and cause trouble then I'd go to the doctor because something is clearly wrong. Goodman and Crystal are probably one of the funniest and unlikeliest double acts to emerge in recent years, squabbling with each other and bursting through their monstrous visages (no offence, guys!) with enthusiastic relish. The ideas that run throughout this film are just glorious, from the frankly genius explanation of Monstropolis to the little bits and pieces that litter the cinematic landscape. A restaurant called Harry Hausen's - fantastic! Though it isn't as much fun as Pixar's latest, you'd have to a heart of stone not to enjoy ""Monsters, Inc."" <br/><br/>For whatever reason, this film doesn't seem to get as much praise as it should because this really is a fine piece of work, one of Pixar's very best and the best thing Disney have released since ""Aladdin"" (excluding ""The Incredibles""). There are moments when the humour falls a little flat, such as the incompetent co-workers who sound denser than a bag of bricks. But the humour is fresh, the ideas are astonishingly original and the vocal talents of all involved (can some mad scientist keep little Ms Gibbs at the age of six forever and give her a microphone?) are perfectly suited to their roles, as if anything less than perfect would do for Pixar. To miss out on this film would be nothing short of disastrous. Get a copy and play to your kids, because you'll all love it. And if you don't have kids (like me) then watch it by yourself and still enjoy. It will be out little secret..."

","Monsters, Inc. is another example of very cleverly-written and multi-levelled animation that appeals to young and old alike. The basic plot is instantly ingenious enough to appeal to even the most simple-minded of viewers, and it is a delightful satire on humankind's timeless fear of monsters. My favourite in terms of satirical tools is the two pimple-covered adolescent monsters who are so 'in awe' of Sullivan and the other 'scarers', which just puts that brilliant twist to the whole idea. The voices are excellent: Crystal, Goodman and Buscemi are all perfectly cast in their roles and they combine well with the very brilliant animation and clever scripting to produce a very likeable and entertaining film. This is not just one of those animated movies that attempt to lure adults through the use of well-beloved actors (Meg Ryan as Anastasia, one example). It really is enjoyable for the whole families. However, the basic warning that some scenes may frighten younger children I believe is well-justified and it is really the only criticism you could possibly have of this movie."
"Mort-31","7","1","3","7 May 2002"," Animation becomes ordinary
","Whereas much of the success of films like `Toy Story' or `A Bug's Life' is a result of the fact that the phenomenon of entire computer animation was a fairly new genre, now gradually this plus gets lost. More and more frequently, computer animated movies about various cute creatures are made and audiences aren't surprised any more about the endless possibilities of computer techniques. Moreover, I believe that with `Shrek', the genre already reached its climax as well as its ironic turn. What could follow?<br/><br/>`Monsters, Inc.' provides less laughs than `Shrek', it doesn't have the sensational character of former computer animation features. Of course the monster world and its population are nice and imaginative, but the story started off a little too complicated. It is becoming harder and harder to fulfil the task of creating `human' situations in a world of non-humans, so the basic structures are getting more and more far-fetched. However, there were some surprising features, especially towards the end, which made this (children's) film something special, also for adults: the ice sequence for instance, and that magnificent door-machine. All in all, not more than a lovely evening at the movies."

You just have to think they had a good 50min script...and tried to make it fill a 100min feature. Sorry but for me it didn't work, and my children were bored and restless in the middle to confirm this. <br/><br/>7 out of 10 Pixar - could do better!"

","Computer animated movie about the monsters in our closet from our childhood.

This isn't as funny as ""Toy Story 1"" or ""2"" but what is?

","The story: In Monsterworld, energy is produced by collecting kids' screams, which are then converted into electricity. ""Monsters, Inc."" is the leading energy producer, and it operates by sending monsters into kids' closets and under their beds, and scaring them. Each kid has its own biggest fear, and the company specializes in delivering just the right monster to the right kid. There are, however, two problems. First, kids are getting harder to scare, watching all those movies and playing all those videogames - which causes an energy crisis. And second, human kids are considered to be toxic to monsters - the most memorable scene occurs when a monster returns from his job with a sock stuck to his fur.... So it is easy to imagine what mayhem may ensue if a kid manages to get into Monstropolis...<br/><br/>The story follows two nice monsters, Sullivan, the most successful scarer, and his side-kick Mike, as they try to get rid off, hide, play with and protect (in that order) a little girl that finds her way into their world. It also features an evil chamaeleon monster and a cast of many very inspired background monsters, including a love interest for Mike. Watch out for her hair: It is one of the better ideas in the movie.<br/><br/>However, as nice as it sounds, this movie is strictly for kids only. Adults might chuckle every now and then, but in the end I walked out thinking of all the wasted talent. Why cast comedians like Billy Crystal and John Goodman as voice talents when the best comedy is restricted to a very small number of slapstick scenes? Also, the movie is very very obvious about its story and the surprise (or not so surprise) ending. It is made with kids in mind, so every lesson is repeated about five times. And, of course, it is about friendship, the power of being nice and all the other typical Disneyfied lessons in life. You might also notice this Pixar trend of only producing movies that are very very merchandiseable. Toy Story? Think plastic toys. Monster Inc? Think big Sulley-shaped fluffy animals...<br/><br/>There is one point where this movie is hard to beat, though: The animation. The fur of Sulley is incredible, and when he is hit by a snowball, it is most impressive how real it looks.<br/><br/>All in all it is very average. Not very funny, a bit repetitive, but entirely feel-good. Personally, I preferred the short movie that preceded it. It was short, funny, cute, to the point and it had all the qualities Monsters Inc lacked. Make sure you aren't late for this movie. You might miss the best part.... Also stay for the credits. Some of the fake outtakes are funny, especially the guest appearances of other Pixar characters...<br/><br/>5/10"

","If you like the first three or four CGI computer animated films by Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar, then this is the next of the films. As a kid you obviously believed there were monsters hiding in your closets waiting to scare you, well in this, they only do it because it is their jobs. The film mainly focuses on one of the best scaring monsters and his best friend. John Goodman as James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan and Billy Crystal as Mike Wazowski are just the perfect characters for this film. Basically a door (used to get to the closet of kids) is left behind, so that Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) could cheat and become best monster. Anyway, out of the door comes a little human girl, and Sulley is nearly caught hiding her. He now has to get back to Monsters, Inc. without anyone spotting the kid. Also starring James Coburn as Henry J. Waternoose III, Jennifer Tilly as Celia, Toy Story's John Ratzenberger as The Abominable Snowman and Frank Oz as Fungus. It won the Oscar for Best Song for Randy Newman's ""If I Didn't Have You"", and it was nominated for Best Animated Feature, Best Music for Randy Newman and Best Sound Editing, and it won the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film. It was number 30 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 53 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!"

","Contains Spoilers Excuse me for possible mistakes and incompleteness (i am writing an essay right now and this is the part of it)Monsters Inc. (M.I.) is the largest scream-processing factory in Monstropolis. The company generates energy from screams of human children. The top Scarer is James P. Sullivan, AKA Sulley, a huge monster with blue fur and purple spots on his body. His assistant - also his best friend and roommate - Mike Wazowski is a green, little one-eyed monster. Since the children are considered toxic and poisonous, it is absolutely forbidden for anything from the human world to cross into the monster world - even a stray sock alerts a task force. But one night after work, Sulley accidentally lets in a human girl. Named Boo, she is a threat for the monster race. But soon Mike and Sulley find out that she is actually very loyal and harmless to the monsters. She was supposed to be used for the experiment scream-mining machine of the most evil monster in Monstropolis, Randall. Later Mike and Sulley find out that Randall is completing the mission of Mr.Waternoose, the owner of Monsters Inc. Now Sulley and Mike are in a difficult situation because Mr. Waternoose and Randall want to kill Boo to eliminate any evidence of what happened. The Children Control Agency wants to eliminate the girl because of their confidence in the danger kids bring. But Mike and Sulley become friends with Boo so they don't want to give her to anybody. On the way to save Boo the monsters find many difficulties. After being caught Mike and Sulley are sent to the human world, from where they successfully escape. But finding Boo is not the most difficult thing for them, they must find Boo's closet's door, because the whole scaring system is based on closet doors. M.I. has millions of doors, and Mike and Sully must find the right one."

The animation is flawless, the voice acting is superb, characters are alive right from their facial expressions to their unique monster appearances and the story itself opens the door for a lot of complexity. Benevolent ol' Mr. Waternoose might just be a common criminal, Randall is socially awkward beneath his evil workplace jerk exterior and Mike is more selfless than Sully gives him credit for.

Everything about this is wonderful, from the essentially Pixar concept to the warm, sentimental relationships at its core. Even the animation has held up quite well, which isn't always the case with these early CG efforts: humans still look a bit wonky, but most of the cast seems drawn straight from the pages of a Caldecott winner and that kind of bright, absurd character works beautifully. John Goodman and Billy Crystal carry most of the heavy-lifting as Mike and Sulley, blue collar creatures with an easy, free-flowing rapport, but three-year-old Mary Gibbs threatens to steal the scene every time she gets the chance with her adorable almost-words and penetrating good cheer. Exceedingly well-balanced, with the kind of imagination that keeps mouths gaping and so much heart, even the boogeyman might have to fight back a tear or two. One of my favorites of the entire Pixar catalog, it swings hard and connects on every level. Sweet, sad, silly and stupendous, a timeless classic that I was glad to share with my kids."

","Just saw this at an advance screening. I had very low expectations to be honest because I really didn't see how they could have made a second Monster's Inc movie.<br/><br/>But it wasn't bad at all. It definitely isn't as good as the first but Pixar has proved time and time again that they know how to play with our emotions and make us relate to these weird looking characters. And this was no different. First of all I was surprised to see that this was pretty much Mike's story and not equally centered on both Mike and Sully. I liked this since the first was more about Sully and Boo. I also liked how they didn't play too much on the college movie stereotype. I mean there are a lot of predictable moments but again the writing and emotions are spot on.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe would probably be the fact that since this is a prequel we know how everything sorta turns out. So when they win the Scare Games I knew something was gonna go wrong because Mike isn't a scarer in the first movie. Also the absence of a character like Boo is definitely noticeable, especially since she was such a big part of what made the first movie so great. I guess since this one is more of Mike's personal story this isn't really a big deal though.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure what to expect going in, but I was really blown away by this film. It was enjoyable from start to finish: there were so many creative moments and characters, the Monsters world was wonderfully rendered, the pacing was spot-on, the narrative was unusual for an animated movie, and to top it all off it was absolutely hilarious the whole way through. To me, it felt more like a fairly authentic slice of life rather than your typical college flick. These were not 1-dimensional caricatures by any stretch. (See: Sully being a jock and a frat boy the whole way through, as well as Randall's slow transformation from nerdy kid to utter douche.) There were also some great Bay Area moments, like the Oakland cranes and bits and pieces of the Cal campus.<br/><br/>I'm gonna have to disagree with the critics on this one: Monsters University ranks among Pixar's better movies."

","In a review that I had deleted, I described Monsters, Inc. as somewhat disappointing for its lack of unsettling imagery, with only a handful of scenes that actually made me jittery. But know that I have seen this movie again, I only now realized what this was meant to be; a family film that places peeving imagery aside and leaves us with some well executed jokes and designed characters, especially James Sullivan (whose fur rendering is so strong even to this day). Sure, some of the humor is catered more towards the younger audiences, and some aspects of the monster world aren't explored well (such as how monsters of all designs share the same shape of toilets, vehicles, et cetera, excluding those already explored in its chronological predecessor) but they will focus on that more than the subplots such as Celia's relationship with Mike. The roles are (no pun intended) monstrously performed to what they were intended, and perhaps more, which can't be found in a lot of movies specifically targeted at kids today. Now that I realize what I skipped in my previous review, I feel as despondent as Boo when Sulley returns her to her bedroom. If not for the questionable world they live in, this is a film that I am complacent to say that families must watch it."

","Monster's Inc is a large piece of my childhood, and probably yours too. It is original, fun, and best of all a timeless movie. It knows when to create sentiment, or laughter at the right time and how to do it. It is basically defines what makes Pixar such an amazing studio. The movies main heroes are Mike and Sully, and even though they are children scaring monsters, it is extremely glossed over because they funny, honest, and do the best for a being close to alien to them. Besides this movie containing driven and interesting characters, it tells an interesting story that kids and adults alike could enjoy. But something that I believe the movie tries to get across is this: intelligent beings are scared of what they don't understand, and exploit whatever it is to get a resource vital to them and hurt it if they can to get the resource faster and more efficiently. For instance, the movies race of monsters are scared of the humans because they are of a different world and exploit the needed resource (the child's screams) subtly, and when Randall (one of Pixar's top villains) wants to exploit the resource faster he is willing to hurt the humans. Still , you don't need to understand Monster's Inc on a deeper level to enjoy it or love its originality.

","In the extra-dimensional city of Monstropolis, the power grid runs on the screams of human children, caused and captured by the (otherwise perfectly friendly) monsters who creep through their closets every night. The motto at Monsters Inc. is simple and endearing –""We scare because we care"". Sulley (perfectly voiced by John Goodman) is a large monster who is able to scare children by walking into their bedroom late at night and exposing his vicious teeth and frightening scream. The perfect comic foil to Sulley, Mike (Billy Crystal, spot-on) is the guy who keeps his pal in tip top scaring shape - ordering up the closet doors that the monsters go through to frighten children, whose screams are bottled and converted to the energy that keeps the monsters' world, and Monsters, Inc., going.<br/><br/>As the story in 'Monsters Inc.' continues, a tiny tot nicknamed Boo refuses to be scared and sneaks through the portal into the world of the monsters. Ironically, the burbling, giggling, ""Kitty"" shrieking tyke scares the dickens out of monsters, as much as our amiable monsters scare little kids. It is now left up to expert ""scarer"" Sully and his one-eyed pal Mike to put Boo back where she belongs and restore order to the universe before the Child Detection Agency can get wind of their mistake.<br/><br/>Like every Pixar film, 'Monsters Inc.' is crammed with intricate and subtle details, but the tortuous storyline is laid out so flawlessly that even broods have no problem keeping up. The admirable oddness of its plot — affable creatures harvest children's screams via an inter-dimensional network of cupboards — may now be softened by familiarity, yet it remains as fresh as ever. Laughs are earned throughout this heart-warming story that never engages in the potty humor that so often undercuts these films - the interplay between Sully and Mike results in jokes which feel wholly unexpected and off-the-cuff. But it's in the visuals that 'Monsters Inc.' really comes to life, from the decor each child has on his closet door to the vast variations of monsters on the job on the ""scare floor"" – blobs, giant spiders, lizards, snakes and goblins right up to the dizzying finale, set in a seemingly infinite warehouse of doors, each of which opens on a different bedroom in a different part of the world.<br/><br/>Successfully combining intimacy with a sprawling alt-universe world, marrying a gentle character comedy to a slam-bang chase finish - this is exactly what Pixar is so celebrated for. While successfully marrying all of this to jaw-dropping technology, the monsters at Pixar scare up a laugh!"

","I have watched it when it first got released, and I have been re-watching it ever since. The imaginative capability of Pixar writing is beyond us all. This super power they have can make a grown-up in his thirties, like me, feel happily silly and laugh hysterically. The world they bring to live on screen delivers a feel admiration and excitement, and a hardcore ground for parallel-world jokes. However, I can't describe into words the type of emotions they capture. They're so real, these fictitious unrealistic characters are real, and what you feel for them is real. I don't know how many times I've watched it, it didn't help me figure out how this could be made."

","I love this movie. It's so adorable. It's so completely different than any other children's movie from around this time. It has a great storyline, and very funny scenes. But it also has heart, and moments that are very heartfelt, and touching. I think it's a great movie for any kid, or adult.<br/><br/>In this movie, we visit a world completely made up of monsters. Their power source is actually the screams of human children. So everyone who works at Monsters Inc., in the scare facility, use special doors to go into children's rooms whilst they sleep, and scare them. They then collect the screams. Which is actually super creepy, monsters sneaking into children's rooms whilst they're asleep. But then a human girl ""escapes"" into the monsters world, and Sulley and Mike, a scarer, and a scarer assistant, they have to try to hide her, and get her back into the right bedroom. <br/><br/>Recommended for: Any child who likes comedy and heart, people who like Walt Disney and Pixar movies.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 7 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Great."
"sharky_55","9","0","1","29 July 2015"," We Scare, Because We Care
","The world of Monster's Inc. is not unlike our own, but it is scattered with little detailed twists that a monster city would - deodorants that come in an assortment of gross flavours, side- walk grills that become a hazard for unsuspecting slimes, the various shaped body suits of the CDF, even adjusted idioms (""first time I laid eye on you"") ...It's all very convincing and lends credence to the very original and creative premise of Pixar's fourth. The animation holds up well and also helps with the world building; whether it's the 2.3 million individual hairs of Sulley that bounce and bristle with life, or the very complicated sequence of thousands of moving doors that must have been a nightmare to storyboard and coordinate. <br/><br/>But it's the characters that really bring Monster's Inc. to life. Monster's University, the sequel more than a decade later, wound back time and placed original characters in a rather by- the-numbers college movie, with the usual jocks and geeks that arise in that genre. In MI, they are less one dimensional and more complex; and the voice acting is equally great. John Goodman brings a jovial and good natured Sulley to the screen, so convincing that its surprisingly scary when he finally bares his teeth and roar, the audience reacting as effectively as Boo does (""I'm off duty""). Billy Crsytal voices Mike, the wise cracking joker and best friend, delivering both juvenile and adult humour, while Steve Buscemi is Randall, the slimy rival scarer that has darker intentions. James Coburn is Waternoose, the well rounded boss who thinks first and foremost for his family's company, but also expresses regret at banishing his favourite scarer. The scene stealer is Boo, played by a infant Mary Gibbs, so young that they had to follow her around the studio and record sound bites which make up her gibberish speech. She's animated with such care and precision - there's a wonderful irony in the way she pops up in Monstropolis and says boo adorably, only to have every scary monster in sight run for their lives. <br/><br/>Her and Sulley's relationship make up much of the emotional core of Monster's Inc. and it progresses with remarkable realism and pacing. Goodman exposes the very confines of Sulley's heart, looking beneath the agile and powerful frame that the animation presents. It's a very touching and sometimes funny relationship that develops gradually and begins to even intrude into the long lasting bond that he has with Mike. There's such a poignancy to the way Goodman delivers the line ""Did you see the way she looked at me?"" that conjures up a wealth of subtext about the overall premise of the film, their careers, the ethics of scaring innocent children the growing fatherly role he has adopted for Boo...it's neatly tied up in the ending when they switch to comedy instead of horror (which gives Mike a new-found responsibility and role) and also is much kinder and fun for the kids. The little bits of laughter from Boo and their effects throughout the film foreshadow this nicely. <br/><br/>Randy Newman's score is also an important element. The jazzy big band influence is apparent from the opening credits sequence, and also excels in the stand out track The Scare Floor, played in the very first reveal of the elite Scarers making their way into the room and preparing for another day of screaming. The percussion beats build steadily and prepares the audience, while the jazz section swings with a wonderful rhythm that goes well with the hard work and chaos of the scare floor. The award winning is If I Didn't Have You is saccharine and pleasant, if not a little similar to Toy Story's You've Got a Friend In Me, but Goodman and Crystal play off each other well. <br/><br/>Monster's Inc. delivers laughs and emotionally rich moments for both children and adults and is another demonstration of Pixar's ability to seamlessly combine the two in a creative and original premise."
"TonioHaze","9","0","1","22 July 2015"," Underestimated piece of contemporary philosophy
","Behind the highly overrated clean animation characters with big eyes and clumsy looks that those big babol chewing Disney CEOs keep promoting, lies silent a very stimulating concept: that logically when there's something unknown to ""face"", we get way more energy from trying to making it better, than from avoiding it following the instincts that are pushed by our own fear. The wisdom of the screenplay is right in front of the viewer, but hidden by the colored masks of the funny and clumsy monster drawings. This movie helps people being less afraid of whatever they're afraid of, and - for how ordinary it might seem - this is one of the greatest purposes one artist can decide to chase. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did, that is with inspiration."
"OllieSuave-007","7","0","1","11 July 2015"," See what really happens on the other side of the monster closet.
","The events of this film, Monsters, Inc., follows that of Monsters University, even though Monsters, Inc. was released first. Here, monsters Mike Wazowski and James P.

Sulley accidentally lets a little girl into the monster world, causing chaos for the monsters since children are actually toxic to them.<br/><br/>Like Monsters University, it is filled with humor, adventures and funny characters. The animation was great and I enjoyed watching the interaction between the monsters in their world and what actually happens on the other side of the closet door before the monster steps out into the child's bedroom. It certainly gives the audience a new perspective and meaning of the ""monster in the closet."" Even for a monster-themed film, Pixar makes it both exciting and family-friendly, keeping in with the tradition of Disney. The voice actors, particularly that of Billy Crystal and John Goodman as the lead roles, were great. They give Mike and Sullivan just the right touch of love-hate friendship, though I thought Mike went just a little overboard with his over-zealousness and frustration. And, the portrayal of the little girl was cute and innocent, but I thought was too annoying as the five year-old who runs into trouble all the time and displays just about every bad quality of a misbehaving child: moaning, crying and being mischievous in every possible way. But, the overall chemistry between her and Sully is quite touching.<br/><br/>Overall, the story was pretty intriguing with an adventurous second half. Not a bad family film.<br/><br/>Grade B-"

"ElMaruecan82","8","0","1","30 June 2015"," We scare, because we care...
","If there's anything that ""Monsters Inc."" proves is that the greatest stories, whether targeting a young or older audience (or both within the same person), all rely on a simple yet original concept. It's so simple in the film that you can almost guess it from the title.<br/><br/>What kind of products or services a company named ""Monsters, Inc."" can provide? Well, what do monsters do best? They scare... but as the tag-line says, it's only business. And like every business, you need a target. Kids, who else? But the real question is : what kind of business would require them to scare poor helpless little kids? Well this is where it gets tricky, in fact children's screams supply Monstropolis' daily needs of energy, as simple as that. Their slogan says ""We scare, because we care"", so all these monsters provide a necessary public service, and that one of their rules is to never get in contact with the children shows how actually harmless and worthy of our sympathy they are (or are they? ... suspenseful music).<br/><br/>And to add to the enjoyment of a very creative premise, the exposition is a delightful sequence too, plunging us in a world populated by monsters, each one being a gag by himself. Indeed, I could easily figure out the instructions given to the artists during the making-of : ""every single monster must be unpredictable, different, funny and somewhat memorable"" so we get a succession of animal-like creatures with the most bizarre or sophisticated physical attributes, big, small, invisible, hideous, you name them. And leading the show, we have Sulley and Mike (yeah, it's an Americanized parallel universe, what's the matter?). Sulley is big blue furry one with purple spots, cool and friendly, and Mike the little green Cyclopes, wisecracking and talkative. And don't ask me which of the gentle giant and the Napoleon syndrome guy is voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal. Please, don't.<br/><br/>To complete the imagery, the film is all about imagery anyway, some others monsters are such masterpieces of creativity they shouldn't even be called monsters. Like Celia, Mike's girlfriend, voiced by Jennifer Tilly, and whose dreadlocks-like hair are made of adorable little snakes with reactions that almost match their owner (almost). From the ugly sight of the bulged-eye chameleon-like Randal Boggs whose ability to change color borrows more from the invisible man powers, it's easy to guess who's the movie's bad guy and who dubs him of course? Simply, the most funny-looking actor with the same weird-looking eyes : Steve Buscemi. A final honorable mention for James Coburn who voices the CEO Mr Waternoose, a crab-like cigar-smoking head of company who treats his best monster Sulley like a son and Roz, a daunting secretary with a ravaged-by-smoking voice that sounds like scratching fingers on a chalkboard.<br/><br/>And all this colorful gallery works in ""Monsters Inc."" following a daily routine that coincides with Earth children's bedtime, the company provides a warehouse full of millions of doors from all over the world and each one leading to kids' bedrooms, a parallel universe we're most familiar with or used to. And this is where the little Disney magic works again : the film rings that sensitive chord reminding us the time from our childhood when we were afraid ghosts or monsters would come from the closet. Well, I was more afraid of clowns or wild animals and I was more staring at the window with fearful eyes, but psychologically speaking, that's not the point.<br/><br/>So, let's get back to ""Monsters, Inc."". Like any company, they have to face real market issues, one of them is kids growing more and more insensitive to violence, this is why they only hire the best of the best, the monster's 'right stuff' as suggested by the hilarious slow-motion sequence parodying the famous astronaut-walking scene. And apparently, Sulley is about to break the company's record, closely followed by his jealous rival, Randall. But one of Randall's evil schemes allows Sulley to discover that there's one little child he does't scare, a little girl nicknamed 'Boo' who grew an instant fondness on Sulley, inversely proportional to the fear Boggs inspired her. From fear to realization, Sulley also develops feelings toward Boo, and we know where this is leading, that drop of tear for an ocean of thrills and laughs, made-in-Disney.<br/><br/>The third Pixar movie is another little touchstone of creativity and imagery that will delight kids and adults. It's good, it's even great at times, yet it lost to ""Shrek"" that year, and rightfully so, for Shrek had a less sophisticated concept but treated with more wit and heart. And a parody of fairy material could only win over a concept that, as creative as it is, relies on one gimmick. ""Monsters, Inc"" has heart too, and some moments between Sully and Boo will make a few eyes cry. But somehow, the film was victim of its own concept, and commits many mistakes with the whole door and closet systems, thus featuring a series of plot contrivances at the crucial final act. Not to mention the little resolution that plays like a nice twist but is revealed to early in the film to leave an impact.<br/><br/>Still, a very good film."

Our main characters are Mike and Sully, two creatures that work at Monsters Inc. , whose goal is to power the city with children's screams. When a little girl crosses the threshold of both worlds, trouble will arise as friendships and the overall faith of Monstropolis (the city's name) will be on the line.

"squirrel_burst","10","0","2","1 April 2015"," Wonderful animated film for adults and children
","""Monsters Inc."" isn't only a film that will delight kids; it's got big laughs for adults too. What I love about this movie most of all is the truly original premise. This world where monsters are real and they power up their cities by bottling up the screams of frightened children is wonderfully inventive and it lends itself to some incredibly creative character designs. It's all so well animated that you might just forget that what you're seeing on the screen isn't live action footage (particularly the scenes involving snow). Another particularly strong element in my opinion is the voice casting. The voices match the monsters so well that the models must have been modified or done after the recordings were done to match the voices, mannerisms and dialogue so well. Either that or we've got some incredibly dedicated, intelligent and talented individuals with an incredible amount of forethought behind the scenes at Pixar.<br/><br/>It's sweet and funny, with just that right sprinkle of heart and at times very thrilling too. One chase scene involving doors (you know what I mean if you've seen the movie) in particular always gets me excited and I never get tired of gushing over how wonderfully original it is. It's filled with characters and moments with Mike (Billy Crystal), Sully (John Goodman) and Boo (Mary Gibbs) that your heart would have to be made of stone not to enjoy it. Every time I watch this movie I catch some new gag in the background or some new detail I've overlooked in the past, meaning it's got great re-watch value as well. You'll always find something interesting to look at (though you'll have to be familiar with the story to be able to pull your eyes away from the main action).<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that you call a ""family"" film because anyone can watch ""Monsters, Inc."" and instantly fall in love with it. When you watch it with other people, it makes you feel like your enjoyment of the movie is bringing you all closer together. It's so great and smart and funny that you'll have a terrific time watching it over and over. (On DVD, October 27, 2012)"

","This is an animated feature produced by Pixar. There will be spoilers ahead:<br/><br/>There's a great deal to like about this film. The animation is wonderful, the characters are well designed and the characters mainly have strong, well developed personalities, particularly the two leads. The voice work of John Goodman and Billy Crystal as Sully and Mike is perfectly meshed, the two working together to make their characters come alive.<br/><br/>The premise is that monsters are simply doing their job when they scare children (monsters in the closet, under the bed and so on) and the power which runs their city comes from screams. Sully is the champ and he and Mike are a team. The chief villain, more or less, is another monster and Sully's main rival, Randall, a chameleon voiced perfectly by Steve Buscemi. There's an interesting, probably unintentional, resonance back to another film and role for Buscemi in what happens to doors to children's rooms when the children are no longer sufficiently frightened by monsters. But I'm weird, so I would make the tenuous connection.<br/><br/>The monsters are actually more terrified of children than children are of them and most of the movie turns on this, with a small girl named Boo (naturally) coming through her door into the monster's city. Much of the film is concerned with Sully and Mike trying to return Boo to her room.<br/><br/>The action is fast and furious, the plot is well crafted and executed and it's a fun ride. The ending is perfect.<br/><br/>This film is available on DVD/Blu-Ray and is well worth watching. Most highly recommended."

","I fell in love with Monster,Inc. the first time I saw it as a kid. It was the movie I got most excited for to watch, fast forward eleven years and I still get excited for it. This monster world is so different from what we know yet so interesting and fun. Their source of power comes from the screams of children which seems so very strange but in the context of this film, makes perfect sense. I am never forced to accept anything the film throws at me, I choose to accept them because they make sense. <br/><br/>Another important reason for why I love Monsters, Inc. is the characters. James P. Sullivan is our protagonist. He is very good at his job, known to many as the top Scarer in Monstropolis. Throughout this film, Sullivan's perspective on everything changes while his caring and comforting character grows stronger. His best friend and roommate, Mike Wazowski, is a funny and smart character who sometimes fails to see the obvious. He is full of energy and charisma, making it impossible for me to dislike him. <br/><br/>Apart from the characters and the beautiful chemistry they share, the story is very well written and enjoyable. It had some hilarious laugh out loud moments, but also some very sad ones. The 3-D is okay, but seems non-existent at times. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet must do so, and those who have should go back and revisit it. It's the well written story, the colorful characters and the heart this film carries that makes it such a timeless classic."

The scared kids screams produce energy that shall be used in the city. The premise of any PIXAR film, till I think UP was just so beautiful and nice till something went wrong. <br/><br/>OK, so this movie has something that is cut and that is the little kid called ""BOO"" I love her so much and each time I see this, I love her more. The animation is wonderful here especially for her. And for me BOO is the cutest kid ever seen on a film.<br/><br/>The animation quality of PIXAR is outstanding, from the hairs of James P Sullivan to the setup of the doors to the whole Monsters world, it is too very detailed and amazing. I wish I could see this in theatre but alas I couldn't. The characters are superb and if Mike Wozawski is comical then, Randall, the dragon is cunning and a dastardly villain. <br/><br/>At the bottom of this movie, like in most other PIXAR movies is an underline text and that is a father-daughter relationship. Sullivan becomes the father who starts taking care of BOO. This very care and what he actually misses when BOO is not around or what he loves about BOO makes the crux to an extent. <br/><br/>Thanks to the PIXAR team for giving such a wonderful film that can be shown for generations of Kids and most kids love it I hope.

","Even though the premise of Monsters Inc. has been done before (monsters scaring kids and coming back to an office environment), this adds it's own creativity to it. It creates it's own world, it's own characters, and it's own reason to scare kids.<br/><br/>James P. Sullivan ""Sulley"" (John Goodman) and Mike Watzowski (Billy Crystal) are a monster duo that scare kids for the company that they work for, Monsters Inc. They need the screams of children because the screams power everything in their world. However, they're in tough competition with Randall (Steve Buscemi) for the most scares. The monsters one weakness though, is that they believe that kids are incredibly contagious and that one touch can kill you. When a little girl enters their world, chaos ensues and Sulley and Mike have to bring the girl back, only to discover a conspiracy within the company.<br/><br/>I'll just say what bothers me the most of the film: the evil conspiracy. While not bad, I barely could follow it. But to be fair, that's not the focus of the movie. The focus of the movie is the interaction between Sulley and Mike and the little girl, which they later name Boo. I like the irony of two monsters being scared of something as harmless as Boo. <br/><br/>The monsters, come in every conceivable shape, size and color, which must have been one of their attractions, and the movie is jolly to look at. And since the monsters are terrified of Boo, whose very name is a rebuke to their lifelong missions, there are screams and chases on both sides of the closet doors. <br/><br/>Speaking of those doors--turns out they're manufactured in Monstropolis, to such exacting specifications that no one ever figures out they didn't come with the house. The most entertaining sequence in the movie is a roller-coaster chase scene involving hundreds of doors on an endless conveyor line that loops the loop at a breakneck speed.<br/><br/>''Monsters, Inc.'' is cheerful, high-energy fun, and like the other Pixar movies, has a running supply of gags and references aimed at grownups"

Onfourtanetly, I would rather watch Frozen. If you haven't watched this you should. plus another good movie is Monsters University. The characters are James P. Sullivan, MIke Wazowski, Boo, and Celia plus Randall. Also in the movie Randall tries to kidnap Boo but the first time kidnaps Mike on accident. The second time actually kidnaps Boo. The reason for his kidnapping might be to make her scream of fear into this machine so that he can beat Sully and be the top scarer."

","A really good movie that fits for all audiences. One of my all time favorites. Monsters, Inc. is a very moving story about Sacrifice and the power of love.n my opinion, the best animation movie ever made. Graphics may look ""old"" nowadays, but this is not the point. The story is based on a VERY clever concept, and the final result is very sweet. Monsters gain their energy consuming the cries of frightened children, and have developed methods and technology to ""steal"" it. The best ""frightener"" of the monsters has to deal with a... baby girl, that by accident enters the monsters' land, and ends up to treat her with love and care, and protects her from being seen, as babies are considered... health danger! Anyone who hasn't seen it should- it's brilliant."
"Stompgal_87","9","0","1","14 June 2014"," A fun and thrilling treat from Pixar
","I saw this film at the cinema with my mum and my sister when I was 14 and we all enjoyed it back then, Surely it's not quite as good as the Toy Story franchise but it is better than its prequel Monsters University and the short film Mike's New Car.<br/><br/>Firstly I liked the straightforward concept of monsters scaring children and collecting their screams to power the city. Secondly, the animation is up to Pixar's usual standards, even for 2001, with quirky and colourful character designs for the monsters, fluid movement and imaginative backgrounds. Thirdly the script was engaging with some funny, mildly scary and moving moments; the film's pace is even and the story had some fun, thrilling moments such as the door vault scene (reminds me of the luggage vault scene in Toy Story 2) and Sulley and Mike coming across the Abominable Snowman when they get banished for sneaking Boo to work, although some scenes are not as memorable as the ones that entertained me the most. While the soundtrack sounded somewhat generic, it had some fantastical elements and I liked the opening jazz music as well as the end credits song 'If I Didn't Have You.' Further to the end credits, I liked the company play footage. Sulley and Mike are diligent partners, Boo is sweet and playful, Mr Waternoose is firm, Randall is a scheming villain and Roz is strict but is funny during the outtakes (which are also a great laugh). The voice acting was superb, especially from John Goodman as Sulley, Billy Crystal as Mike, Mary Gibbs as Boo, Bob Peterson as Roz and John Ratzenberger as The Abominable Snowman. <br/><br/>Overall, Monsters, Inc. is an amusing and thrilling offering from Pixar that is a sheer delight to watch despite the somewhat genetic soundtrack and a few forgettable moments. 9/10."

","Monsters, Inc. proves to be a movie for all ages. As a child, I was entertained by the funny ""kitty,"" his partner-in-crime, and their surprising pal. Now, I watch this film and am still entertained. However, I now realize the impressiveness and complexity seen in Monsters, Inc. The competitive world that I have since entered from the first time I watched this movie is practically displayed in the monster world. Along with the competitive spirits of Randall and Sully, is Sully's attachment to an unlikely friend, and the difficulty of letting go. Sully must say goodbye to Boo, as she reenters the human world. This scene is so relatable, that for an instant, we forget the differences between the monster world and the real world. Monsters, Inc. provokes many emotions, and ultimately allows for people of all ages to have a pleasurable experience they won't soon forget."

","Monsters generate energy by scaring kids. That's what Monsters Inc is. James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) is the top scarer, and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) is his best friend. Together they work at Monsters Inc. One night after work, Sully opens a door by himself and a child sneaks in threatening contamination.<br/><br/>The characters are fun. But this is Paxar. So I expect nothing less than the best. That means comparing to Toy Story. I like the Toy Story characters much better, and there are more of them. Monsters Inc basically has two big likable characters. Quite frankly, the kid is more annoying than cute and the odd monsters wear thin. We all have the toys in Toy Story but the monster aren't as nostalgic.<br/><br/>The animation looks good for its time. It's certainly not ground breaking as Toy Story (1995) was. It's better than Toy Story by a small degree but we haven't reached a new level yet."
"Jakemcclake","10","0","1","24 October 2013"," A Great Movie for Adults and Children
","I have watched this every time it has been on TV/cable. This cartoon movie is a comedy, a drama and an action adventure flick with touching scenes and a feel good story, all in one. On top of all this, this fantastic story opens up a parallel universe of the closet monsters and how they, who terrified us, really feel about us. Despite the fact that it is a cartoon, you would be hard pressed to find a more intelligence in a movie script. After watching it, you could want to view it again to appreciate this movie to the fullest.<br/><br/>We follow monsters employed by an energy company to create energy by coming out of children's closets and terrifying them. The screams and terror of the victim children are converted into energy and help to power the town they live in, Monstropolis a town in the parallel universe of monsters.<br/><br/>We focus on several monsters in the fairly large cast of monsters, James Sullivan (Sully voiced by John Goodman), Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and Randall Boggs (Steve Buscerni) and Henry Watanoose (James Coburn). We follow these characters and their in and out of the parallel universe of monsters/human world, and we focus on their encounter with Boo (Mary Gibbs) a cute little girl and scare victim of Randall Boogs.<br/><br/>The movie eventually turns into an action/adventure flick as we uncover certain evil doings with a touch of ""My Bodyguard"" in the main climax scene. Like the ending of ""My Bodyguard"", you get a charged happy feeling from this. There is also some touching scenes and final changes to the world of the monsters that is hinted throughout the movie, that only a good writer could have developed. I have scene this movie numerous times, and never get tired of it, despite knowing the ending so well."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","0","1","18 October 2013"," Pixar creates exciting parallel world for children and grown-ups
","A world full of monsters that just got expanded with a sequel not too long ago. And the introduction to this world was the best thing about this film. One of the finest efforts in the Pixar universe. The idea of children as energy sources is the core of the film and possibly the main reason why it succeeds so impressively. The doors as means of transit from the monster world into the human world. The simulators where the not so experienced monsters can improve their abilities. It all oozes creativity. Another strength of this film is that its supporting characters are at least as interesting as the two monsters in the lead. I don't think we need to talk about Mike and Sully much. Their actions and presence speak for themselves. One is huge, furry and truly scary, yet kind-hearted, the other is tiny, slippery (at least that's what he looks like, like a frog), always funny and obviously a bit of a womanizer. And yet, they're best friends. Beyond these two, the monster world includes creatures of all sizes, shapes and colors, so they're a feast visually, but with some the writers also succeeded to make them truly entertaining and effective. The two antagonists are really a scary presence, thanks to their looks with all those tentacles for example on Coburn's character or their ability to turn invisible (Buscemi). Two more I liked: One would be Mike's girlfriend who gave me a true LOL moment when she talks during the date about how she may be interested in a shorter haircut and we see those snakes that actually are her hair go into full panic mode for a moment. The other is the poor Monster Inc. worker who got showered and sheared when they discover a baby sock on his back. His reaction when there is one on his back again later into the film was pretty hilarious. Well done. The exterminators were pretty hilarious too, even if you didn't see any physical trademarks on them as they were all covered by their huge uniforms. There's just so many great characters and I'm certainly forgetting some. Already all those they see when they go to work. Thankfully Sully kept Mike from taking the car, otherwise we would have missed all of these.<br/><br/>When the whole part of introducing us to the monster world ends and the real story starts with the little girl entering the picture, it gets slightly worse, but only because it was so great before. Boo is still the cutest thing ever (gotta love how she keeps saying Mike's name) and the way Sully slowly grows paternal feelings for her is displayed with lots of heart. Afterwards we see the usual ingredients, the villains seemingly gaining the upper hand, characters being exposed as surprisingly good or evil, the main characters' friendships being put to the test, Sully to Boo and Sully to Mike etc. The latter actually happens in the Himalayas and features a funny cameo of the Abominable Snowman and his snow cones. The only thing from the film which did not really interest me, was the action sequence and all the main characters riding on the doors on their fight for little Boo. That felt really only for children in the audience again. I won't complain though as not only the way the two villains got it in the end (crocodile reference, simulator exposure) and the twist of turning the scream factory into a laughter factory were very well-made again and the epilogue with Mike having built the door to Boo fully together will hopefully give you an equally warm feeling in your chest as it did for me. ""Boo?"" ""Kitty!"" with the huge smile entering Sully's face was truly a perfect way to end the movie. Easily among Pixar's best and very much recommended for people all ages."

","A powerhouse of imagination, creativity, heart, humour & passion, Pixar Animation Studios' funniest film to date is such a fascinating blend of excellent direction, smart screenplay, heartfelt narration, perfectly-timed humour, colourful characters, gorgeous photography, dazzling animation, terrific voice-work & mesmerizing score that it not only ranks amongst the studio's best films but is one of the greatest works of its medium as well.<br/><br/>The story of Monsters Inc. is set in the parallel city of Monstropolis which is inhabited by monsters who travel into the human world to scare the children for their scream is what powers the whole city but they are also equally terrified of being contaminated by them for children are considered toxic. When a human child accidentally enters into their world, the titular company's top scarer & his best friend try to return her back to where she came from.<br/><br/>Directed by Pete Docter, Monsters Inc. is narrated with such fine elegance that within few minutes into the picture, we get a clear idea of why this world exists & how it works without it being spoonfed to us. Add to that, it's full of gags & hilarious moments that keeps it a rib- tickling experience from start to finish. And then, there is Pixar's very own trademark fusion of heartfelt storytelling with stunning animation that radiates an immense sense of warmth & admiration for what it's about.<br/><br/>As the film is an outlook on life from a monster's perspective, the story provides a massive canvas for the animators to create, design & render these characters in various shapes & sizes, and it is pretty evident on the screen what a remarkable job they've done. But where these talented minds at Pixar truly triumph is in assigning personalities to each one of them. Every monster here gets its own personality, their world is fully realized & despite the visual difference, it's effortlessly relatable.<br/><br/>Taking a leaflet out of almost every kid's nightmare & coming up with the idea of monsters' absolute necessity to scare children, it's amazing how Pixar keeps coming up with original concepts that feel incredibly familiar yet has an originality of its own. And the process of refining that concept into a heartwarming story that viewers of all ages can relate to & then pushing the boundaries of animation with relentless innovation is exactly what makes them the best animation studio on the planet.<br/><br/>The voice-cast is another gem for it comprises of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Mary Gibbs, Steve Buscemi & others, and they all are perfect choices for their characters. The chemistry between Goodman & Crystal is no doubt impeccable but the real charm is provided by the character of Boo; a 2-year old human girl in the monsters' world. The story is light-hearted for the most part, filled with hilarious situations n set-ups but when it goes for the dramatic effect, it nails it so well that many are sure to leave misty eyed by it.<br/><br/>The 3D animation in itself was groundbreaking at its time of release but even after all these years, it looks damn impressive. Whether it's the realistic rendering of animated fur or the skillful use of lighting or that jaw-dropping ""door vault"" sequence, Monsters Inc raises the bar that was set by previous Pixar features and is visually enticing all the way through. Also worthy of mention are its ingenious use of camera angles, tight editing that provides a breezy flow to its narrative & Randy Newman's emotionally resonant score.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Monsters Inc. is one of Pixar's most enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying works that takes its creativity in the storytelling department & innovation in its 3D animation to an all new realm. A masterpiece in every sense of the word, Pixar's fourth feature film & their first to be not directed by John Lasseter has been adored & cherished by viewers of all ages ever since it made its debut on the silver screen, and for the timeless classic this film is, it's gonna continue to do so for decades to come. Delightfully recommended."

","Trust in Pixar when it comes to kids movies with unconventional stories behind them. Who'd have thought that a movie about Monsters could be kid friendly? Pixar apparently and it does work quite well. I haven't watched the recently (conviniently released just before the sequel hit the cinema screens) re-vamped 3D version of the movie, but I'm pretty sure they did a good job on that too.<br/><br/>Whatever that looks like, I can attest that the ""normal"" 2D version does look great. But it's obviously the movie that counts and that is a good one too. Not so much relying on Minions or other sidekicks, this based on the friendship of two Monsters.

","Summary As you can see in the title of the movie, it is about monsters who try to scare kids. Sully and Mike are monsters who are best friends. They work with each other at Monsters, INC. They have to scare kids and use their screams to have energy in their town. In their monster town kids aren't allowed. At work Sulley and Randall are enemies. They want to beat each other's score. Randall cheated after the work hours to beat Sulley his score. While he was cheating he accidentally let a kid out of a door. Sulley and Mike found that kid. At first they thought the kid was dangerous but it turned out she was a very sweet kid. Sulley got attached to her and he named her boo. The boss of the factory found out that a kid has escaped and closed down the factory. Sulley opened the factory again but instead of making kids scared they made them laugh.<br/><br/>My opinion about the movie I did like the movie because it is for all ages and it is a nice and lovely story. It is a movie that make you laugh at any time and this is a very good aspect about it. At the end of the movie, the story could make me cry. Actually there is nothing bad about the movie. I recommend you to watch it. I love the movie very much. P.s.: The first movie is better than the second.(:"

","Monsters, Inc.<br/><br/>***1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>92 mins/ U<br/><br/>Cast: (voice) John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Mary Gibbs, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn, Jennifer Tilly, Rob Peterson, John Ratzenberger, Frank Oz<br/><br/>Directors: Pete Docter, David Silverman, Lee Unkrich<br/><br/>Plot: In Monstropolis, Monsters generate energy by scaring human children in their beds at night, but when one escapes her bed and enters the city, two scarers called Mike and Sulley have to hide her to prevent the rest of the monsters from knowing. Why? Monsters believe children are contaminated. <br/><br/>JJ's Verdict: Monsters, Inc. is one of the first films both children and adults can relate to. I can almost be certain that everyone in the world was once sure that there were monsters hiding in their rooms. It is funny, imaginative and full of lovable characters. The city of Monstropolis, unknown to the human world, creates all their energy from the screams of small children as designated scarers creep into their bedroom's every night. What humans don't know is that the monsters are as scared of the children as the children are of them. So when top scarer Sulley (John Goodman) and his assistant Mike (Billy Crystal) accidentally let a young girl loose and into the city, the pair have to try and return her to her 'door' while not letting anyone know how or who let her out.<br/><br/>Monsters, Inc. is a magnificent creation from Pixar. The depth of imagination and creativity is a delight and director Pete Docter should be congratulated for one of the most original children's film of all time. Each tiny detail in the animation is so precise and the world of Monstropolis is just breathtaking, as are the small insignificant characters that pop up along the way. It could only be Pixar that can actually create a film that has both hilarious verbal and physical/slapstick humour and it seems everyone involved can such a brilliant time working on the film. It seems like Billy Crystal and John Goodman were actually there in the animation and their characters have such great chemistry. Steve Buscemi is perfectly cast as Sulley's scare rival Randall, a slimy and slithering chameleon, who is always up to no good. Also in the voice cast are Pixar regular John Ratzenberger who plays the actually very nice Abominable Snowman, 'The Great Escape' star James Coburn who plays Mike and Sulley's boss Mr. Waternoose and voice of Yoda and Miss Piggy, Frank Oz who plays Randall's weak assistant Fungus. When people think of Monsters, Inc. they think of Mike and Sulley as the best team-up but the loving relationship between Mike and Boo, the little girl who enters Monstropolis , is the films finest part in terms of emotion, care and utter cuteness. John Goodman really put his all into this film.<br/><br/>Monsters, Inc., although very slow is enough to hold your attention and finishes on an excellent final chase scene which is genuinely threatening. Kids will adore it and adults will also love it with amusing pop culture references to Metropolis, Psycho, Tootsie, The Right Stuff, Toy Story, Fargo, Starship Troopers and Armageddon among others. And stay tune for an excellent credits scene."

","Man, I love Pixar. Time goes by and their movies have never disappointed me. Monsters, Inc was obviously not an exception. I really can't think of any flaw in this movie. The animation was beautiful. The voices were perfect, with a special mention to Billy Crystal, who gives voice to the funniest character in the whole story (in my opinion), Mike Wazowski. There are good guys and, of course, villains. The monsters are, in fact, no monsters at all; they are incredibly sweet and human. And of course, the script; funny, witty and surprisingly deep. At this point, I guess everybody knows that Disney films always (and I mean always) have an important message, for both kids and adults. Monsters, Inc is a tale about friendship, sticking together through the hard times and not being afraid of the unknown. 90 minutes of cinematic joy that I'd recommend everyone. Grab the popcorn and enjoy."

Well in this world monsters do exist and they go around scaring kids by coming out of the closet for energy supply. But the thing is the monsters are as much as scared of the kids as the kids are to the monsters. But the main conflict starts when a kid comes into the monsters society. When it comes to kids in movies it can be a hit or a miss but in this case she is adorable. While having the kid demeanor and although the cause of the conflict and what drives the story but didn't really get annoying. And seeing it now I kinda enjoyed it more than when I saw it as a child.

","A Colorful Feel Good Movie<br/><br/>From its creative take on the child imagination of monsters in the closet to its advanced animations, directors Pete Docter, Lee Unkrich, and David Silverman outdid other Pixar films like Toy Story, A Bugs Life or Brave. If you've watched 2012's recent movie release of Monsters University then you have to see what's still considered one of today's most hilarious motion pictures, 2001's Disney production Monsters Inc.! <br/><br/>Scream Heat corporations top scarer's and best friends Mike Wazowski ( Billly Crystal) and James p. Sullivan ( John Goodman) exist in a colorful Metropolis filled with businesses, and homes powered by the extracted energy of screaming children. The lime green, M&M cyclone Mike, and blue, bear-like monster Sully, share their passion for scaring in a virtual world that can be accessed through an assembly line of doors to the bedrooms of sleeping children. Among other monsters the pair live to scare, but must avoid contamination that is believed to be outcome of touching a toxic child. Mike struggles with juggling work and girlfriend Cecilia, a tall purple one eyed receptionist, while Sully works to impress father like figure, and boss Henry J Waternoose at the organized scaring factory. As they work against their biggest rival, a nasty and vicious reptilian Randall Boggs to achieve the all-time scaring record, Sully accidentally leaves open a door allowing what their city considers to be the biggest threats to their lives to enter; a child. The tale kicks off when panicky Mike and Sully encounter the little girl and are faced with the challenge of returning her to her door without being contaminated or seen. This is proved difficult when Randall discovers the mistake and searches for the four year old for his own evil and selfish agenda.<br/><br/>The movies hilarious aspects are displayed throughout the individual roles of each character along their pursuit to return the trespassing infant Boo. Comedic Mike is always one step behind his best friend with funny outburst and witty comments. Randall's dark character allows the film to venture into a seriousness that keeps the audience frantic and guessing. Adorable pigtailed Boo's playful and realistic infant like curiousness makes it difficult to look away. Other characters like always contaminated George, Mike-worshipping Smitty and confused Needlemen are beautiful additions that bring general humor to the film. The plots outbursts of sly one-liners and unrestrained antics lead the film into uncharted zones of hysterical laughter.<br/><br/>The detailed graphics presented in Monsters Inc. are brilliant! Each character brings a unique sense of physical humor. Mikes green M&M structure and one large eye is just as hilarious to look at as his voice, played by Bily Crystal, is to listen too. The fuzzy blue like bear and Scream Heat corporations top scarer James P. Sullivan is a great combination of scary and compassion. With so many monsters of different shapes, and sizes there is never a dull aspect in the movie. The entire city is yet another eye catching detail the graphic designers of Monsters Inc. so brilliantly crafted. <br/><br/>I personally love this movie and recommend everyone take time out of their day to watch Monsters Inc.! Its dramatic twists, colorful plot and unique characters keep you guessing about what could happen next. From start to finish, the ten star Pixar animation is a hilariously touching delight! With lots of laughs and the perfect amount of mild scares this fun film is suitable for all ages."

","For the second straight week, Monsters University takes home the box office winning again over World War Z.<br/><br/>This time the winning team Disney/Pixar made $46 million in the U.S. for an impressive total $171 millions in two weeks. The Heat, with Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy, took second place with $40 millions in its debut week. Brad Pit and his zombie flick only could make third with $29 millions, leaving zombies wanting for more.<br/><br/>It is a bit of a surprise that WWZ is doing so modest in the box office in spite of all the publicity and marketing. But in the other hand, maybe we can think of summer as the reason for this overturn to the Max Brook's book film version.<br/><br/>In my visit to the theater to watch the second installment of the Monsters Inc 2001 film, the audience was almost all kids with one or two parents. This maybe made it easier for the animated film to make more money in the U.S., as long as kids are in summer break and parents are willing to sacrifice themselves for them; or shouldn't I have called it sacrifice? Pixar Studios, in my opinion, have found the formula to create stories that could entertain both kids and parents at the same time. To name some: Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and the most recent Toy Story 3. Story lines well told, impeccable animation, comedy and a lot of the Disney Magic is what makes these films so attractive to all audiences.<br/><br/>Monsters University belongs to this category. The animation of the campus is absolutely beautiful. Screenwriters, Dan Scanlon and Daniel Gerson, recreated the before lives of Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan in a smart way. But the story line that for me was more relevant was the bullying that Wazowski was victim of.<br/><br/>This is a theme that in the U.S. public opinion is being trending for the past years, so it was not difficult to feel related to easily. So for the rest of the story, I won't make more explaining in order not to spoil the movie to those who have not seen it yet. But I have to say that any person, who has had the experience to attend any classroom of any type, will enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Also the performances of Billy Cristal (Mike) and John Goodman (Sullivan) were pleasant to the ears. It felt like it hasn't been 12 years since Monsters Inc., and more impressive is that they were portraying those characters voices in their younger spirits. Thumbs up to these good actors.<br/><br/>By far, Monsters University belongs to the elite group of sequels (and in this case prequel) that have made a presentation that it's original and yet keep the essence of its previous one. Also, it could become one of the most successful movies for the team Disney/Pixar, even though is quite a hard task to beat the incredible $1,064,404,880 box office score of Toy Story 3 worldwide gross.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, while we wait for that to happen, what we can say for sure is that zombies are not happy by the fact they have been beaten by two chicks in a cop flick, and by monsters that were meant to scare kids but that have been heating the numbers for two weeks in a row.<br/><br/>Five stars to Monsters University make me say that it is mandatory for parents to take their kids to see it. And for those who enjoy the Disney magic, in this case seasoned with the Pixar originality, please don't miss this change to be entertained with a good movie."

","Isn't it unfathomable that Monsters Inc. is now twelve years old? Even Pixar's first masterpiece Toy Story is quickly approaching twenty, which is equally unfathomable in any state of mind. Rewatching Monster's, Inc., in light of the upcoming prequel, I couldn't help but realize that Pixar hasn't changed a whole lot in their animation style. Little noticeable additions and upgrades such as lighting and texturing have been made, but changes like that are pretty much unnoticeable to the public. Pixar has been one of the few companies that has done little innovation to the overall layout and design of their animation since their breakout in 1995.<br/><br/>Pixar, however, has to remain witty, original, and subversive in their material and story lines to remain the almighty, animation patriarch they've always been. In 2013, I'm proud to save I've never been letdown by a Pixar film so much so that I gave it a negative review. Even their lesser stories are better than Disney's average ones, and even a good Dreamworks movie is not usually the equivalent of an average Pixar one. Monsters, Inc. is a story that is cinematic bread-and-butter, combining the quirks and uniqueness of monsters and articulating their appeal to children wonderfully in a film. While the subject matter may have you thinking otherwise, this is a sweetly appropriate film for children over five, and unlike maybe some modern animated releases such as Hotel Transylvania this one doesn't segregate the viewer solely because they've seen more modern monster films than everyone in the audience.<br/><br/>The plot concerns Mike (voiced by the lovable Billy Crystal), a stout, green, Cyclops-esque monster and his pal Sulley (John Goodman), a lovable, furry, blue monster and their duties at Monsters, Inc. The company is dedicated to frightening children of all ages after hours, and to do so, they use a series of doors, assigned to each monster. The doors look like they lead nowhere, but actually house a child's room behind them. When a monster walks back through the door, it is extracted from the ground and taken through an elaborate conveyor belt behind the scenes.<br/><br/>Mike and Sulley always find themselves harassed by Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi), who leaves a door on the floor, allowing a child to enter the premises so he can get them kicked out of Monsters, Inc. The child is two years old, unafraid of monsters, and thinks of Sulley as a lovable teddy-bear rather than a ferocious monster. The film follows Mike and Sulley as they try and hide the girl - who they nickname ""Boo"" (Mary Gibbs) - from their boss and try to keep their jobs intact.<br/><br/>There's a surprising (and equally unsurprising) zealous energy to the material here. By having such a loose plot, the characters are free to roam in many different directions, trying to find a way to keep precious little ""Boo"" hidden from all the other monsters.<br/><br/>Speaking of the other monsters, Pixar's creativity as a group seems to bleed through Monsters, Inc. as each character has their own artistic design and color scheme to go with them. No two monsters look alike, and none look anything like the classic movie monsters or basic retreads of them, showing Pixar's high creativity. Even if you remain unfazed by the story or the plot, the art design of the characters is something that will hold your attention for quite sometime.<br/><br/>Monsters, Inc. is a charming affair that should be equally rewarding for adults as it will be their children. There's no reliance on immaturity, stupidity, or even blatant shallowness. There's a simple story handled appropriately under solid conditions from a great studio. What more do you need? <br/><br/>Voiced by: Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, and Mary Gibbs. Directed by: Pete Docter."

"jhuntmailing","Null","0","1","23 January 2013"," The perfect model for family entertainment.
","This review was written with the 3D re-release of 'Monsters, Inc.' in consideration.<br/><br/>A decade after its original release, 'Monsters, Inc.' is remembered primarily for it's lovable characters, particularly the one-eyed 'Mike Wazowski'. Released before Pixar accrued true worldwide regard with 'Finding Nemo', the fourth feature film from the studio is as much a popular classic today as its successors. A fairly complex premise (for a young audience), built on a wildly original concept, drawn from something so simple as a fear of monsters lurking in the wardrobe, allows for a rousing ninety minute adventure.<br/><br/>While from the same era, the animation is notably advanced in comparison to 'Toy Story' and 'A Bug's Life'. Textures are detailed, facial expressions appear more natural and Sulley's well-conditioned fur remains one of Pixar's most striking achievements, the many individual strands moving freely with his mass. Disney's 3D post-conversion adds depth without draining the bright colours, and takes good advantage of the few shots where objects reach out to the audience. Justifying the conversion alone is the breathtaking climax, where Sulley and Mike navigate thousands of doors racing through the factory, the added depth creating for the audience the same sensation - that of being on a roller coaster - that the characters feel. <br/><br/>The gag reel and end credit sequences remain intact, as does Randy Newman's beautiful original score, maintaining a consistent emotional resonance throughout. <br/><br/>'Monsters, Inc.' is a thorough family affair, with a beautiful story arc and an uplifting sense of closure, mediating on the strength and unquestionable loyalty of true friendships. The film's antagonist lacks the clever character-based motive that shapes Pixar's finest villains, which does little to oppose detractors of the feature's tyke-friendly nature, though this detail is almost irrelevant as the film has found its audience in the decade it's been playing. 'Monsters, Inc' may be one of Pixar's earliest, but it's also one of their best."

","Monsters, inc. is one of the best animation film ever produced, only surpassed by The Incredibles.<br/><br/>The animation itself is incredible, especially if you take into consideration the work that was done on the hairs of Sulley. The world they created is without par, extremely imaginative and full of details, and that's without mentioning the mechanics it uses to get energy, as well as the energy crisis within.<br/><br/>Each monster is well thought, wild in design, and nicely rendered. The colors are great, vivid, and cheerful. The humor is plenty, side splitting, and almost non-stop. The jokes are great, and the dialogs complete, natural, and logical.<br/><br/>The only negative thing I could say is that the ""evil"" part of the scenario was a little unimaginative, but fortunately, it's not the main attraction.

","Monsters Inc isn't a new film, but with its re-release into theaters I got a second look at it. This movie came out when I was a ""Wee Lass"" and so I could not tell you why I liked it other than the fact that it was a Disney movie. But I went to see it in 3D (not really necessary, although not awful) and I finally found out why this movie is a movie to love. This movie is an original story, and just how often do we get any of those? The monsters in the film work at Monsters Incorporated, where they have to scare little human children for electric power.You see them frightening human children who equally terrify them. One of these kids accidentally gets into their world and all hell breaks lose. The characters are witty, emotional and very well put together. John Goodman voices Sully, the monster who finds Boo and decides that he will help her return to her world, and his hardy heavy voice fits the big blue monster with a heart made of love. Billy Crystal voices Mike Wazowski, the little green fireball who's chalk full of craziness, and Steve Buscemi voices Randall, the slimy purple lizard like monster who stirs up trouble for the heroes and their little girl.<br/><br/>The story-line is fresh and charming and the characters each come into their own as this little girl turns their lives upside down and wins their trust, their protection and their love. The setting is vivid with imagination and the everyday lives of these monsters is very similar to our own. The monsters have to go to work, pay the bills and keep their girlfriends happy.<br/><br/>The movie gets a 9/10 for its originality, its quirky charm and the truly endearing characters who show you that just because they are labeled ""monsters"" it doesn't mean that they are beasts."

","1st watched 12/29/2012 – 7 out of 10(Dir-Pete Docter & David Silverman): Funny and well made animated film from the Pixar group with a simple story, but technically well executed. The story is about an alternate world where monsters gain energy for their existence by getting screams from children by scaring them after entering their world from their closet doors. The company, ""Monsters, Inc"", captures this energy and Sully, voiced by John Goodman, is the highest energy producer for them. His friend Mike, voiced by Billy Crystal, is his assistant. The evil character is the runner-up color-shifting monster that is behind Sully in energy points, but is found out to be cheating by capturing kids and extracting the screams out of them with a machine. One kid, named Boo by Sully, escapes and Sully and Mike have to figure out how to get her back to her real world and expose the evil monster's doings to the company. They do a lot of retread simple ""TV show""-type of humor around this story which makes the movie not as good as it could have been, but the animation is superb and unique enough to keep you interested until the end. The 3D is good and not over-bearing showing the perspective and size of some of the animated sets where the characters work in. This is not the best of the Disney animated films because of the simplistic story, but there is the usual expert craftsmanship that has definitely gone into this like so many of the others. The computer animation is very good despite it's 2001 release and I have to say that this is a worthwhile effort in the Disney cannon despite it's shortcomings in the story."

","Nothing warms me more for laughs than anytime I get to sit down and watch Monster's Inc. This is one Pixar animation that I hold dear to heart, I loved it so much that I didn't desire for them to make a sequel, because I felt they will wreck what is already a masterpiece. This is the best voice casting I have seen in any animation, the story of Monster's Inc. is just warm to the heart, as we follow the adventures of a little girl in the monster world. You just can't forget the voices of the top scarer James P. Sullivan aka Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) and his one-eyed assistant, Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal).<br/><br/>The idea for the Monster's Inc. story was born during a lunch in 1994 between Pixars production team of John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during the production of Toy Story (1995). Pete Docter thought it up, and after they were done working on Toy Story, he stepped aside to build the story, while others were working on other Disney/Pixar animations. When he was done with the first draft (which was far different from the final film) the name Monster's Inc was pitched in by longtime Disney animator Joe Grant (who worked on the 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs).<br/><br/>The movie plot underwent numerous changes over its writing and production years between 1996 and 2000. Its final story is about how monsters scare human kids to get their screams. The screams are then stored, refined and used as power, power in the sense of electrical power and fuel power. The flip side of this is that monsters are afraid of human kids, because they are believed to be toxic and one touch from a human child can kill them. There is a company in charge of this scream collection and refinement in Monstroplolis, that company is Monster's Inc. There in Monster's Inc our lead Characters are Sulley and Mike, Sulley is the top sacrer and Mike is his assistant.<br/><br/>One faithful working day, the lives of both Sulley and Mike would change and the faith of the monster world also, as Sulley meet a human child (Boo) in their scare floor in the Monster's Inc factory, panic broke loose and Sulley not knowing what to do and how to contain the problem allowed it to escalate to the point that all Monstroplois is aware of the existence of a human child in the monster world and the whole monster world is in a state of panic.<br/><br/>Monsters, Inc. won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and it lost the Best animated feature award to Dreamworks Shrek. It was a financial success and it received high positive reviews and it is a must watch.<br/><br/>A sequel to this wonderful movie is set to be released 12 years after the first, in 2013, and it will be a prequel to the original plot.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","'Monsters Inc' is one of the greatest Animation films of all time- There's no arguing that and it has become one of the classical children films.

At this place, monsters are sent through doors and their objective is to scare children for more power. One day, a little baby girl accidentally finds herself in the world of the monsters and so Mike and Sully must secretly get it back to its home without any one of the other 500 or so monsters finding the baby. During this adventure, another monster named Randall is after the baby and will kill Mike and Sully.<br/><br/>Here's something extremely funny about the film. The monsters are terrifying and appear to be ruthless foes but are extremely afraid of humans, in particular babies! The film has many laughable elements and constantly makes me laugh. This is one of the few classical films that I'll be able to enjoy forever! <br/><br/>The characters are a major strength in this film, in particular the relationship between Boo and Sully as well as Sully and Mike. The film takes many clever twists and keeps its audience engaged in the film. The animations look terrific for its time and 11 years has passed since the day it was released and still...The animations look spot on PERFECT! <br/><br/>The story is superb in this film and very easy to follow. Unlike many other failed Animation films, Monsters Inc keeps developing the plot and characters up til the last minute. <br/><br/>Definite must see and an extremely intense and funny film!"

The voices are provided by top Hollywood stars including John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn and Jennifer Tilly; all of whom demonstrate they can do voice acting just as well as they can do live action.

"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","13 April 2012"," Entertaining and endearing
","Not Pixar's strongest work - for me that's Wall-E - but still a great proof that the studio has the ability to turn the simplest of ideas upside down and give us something that we haven't seen before. Like in this case where the simple idea of monsters hiding in the closets of little children is given a completely new spin by making those monsters part of industry. They're just punch clock workers trying to earn a living. Ingenious idea, really.<br/><br/>And the execution supports and strengthens that idea beautifully. The whole world full of these hideously weird creatures is laid bare in front of us, but we quickly find out that they're just like us with their mundane lives, romantic relationships and bad fur days. And therein lies the strength of this movie and Pixar movies in general. The characters are immensely identifiable and sympathetic. The moment that you see any of these characters, the moment that they open their mouth and start talking, you get them. You start living their lives from their perspective. (Though I have to say that I saw the Finnish dub of this movie, in which the voice acting, while decent, wasn't anything special, so I think that the movie had already lost part of its charm at that point, because the English version is full of talented actors, so it's probably the better version of this film.)<br/><br/>For me the best part of this film was the relationship between Sulley (John Goodman) and Boo (Mary Gibbs). That little ninja girl is unbelievably adorable to begin with and then you add a ten feet tall blue hair monster cooing at her... It just melted my heart every time I saw it and made the ending even more precious to witness.<br/><br/>If there's anything wrong with this film, it's that the story isn't that strong. It's your basic someone screws up and the status quo has to be restored without that someone getting into trouble, but of course something goes wrong and hilarity ensues. Nothing special there, but it was enjoyable to watch, so I wouldn't really call it a flaw as Pixar has the talent to work with simple stories. For them it's more about the characters and the details, not the story.<br/><br/>So yeah, it's a good movie. Highly recommended for children and adults alike."

","""Monsters Inc"" came out on DVD this week, and now I have my own copy!! It is not very useful to try to evaluate this one against others since such an evaluation is so subjective.

Unbelievably good. I can categorically say it is the best picture quality I have seen on DVD, and the movement and facial expressions of the animated characters makes it almost feel like they are real.<br/><br/>Second, the story. How inventive! The only thing separating the monster world from the real world are the doors. The company, Monsters Inc, must have millions of them in inventory, computerized for quick call-up to send in a monster to get screams and charge up their energy cells.<br/><br/>The main characters are voiced by John Goodman (big, blue, hairy ""kitty"" with purple spots) and Billy Crystal (short, green, one-eyed monster) and their acting add so much. Plus the great music provided by Randy Newman. Overall and hour and a half of pure edge of your seat entertainment.

","""Monsters, Inc."" is among Pixar's best because it constructs a clever, convincing world from the single childhood experience of being afraid of what lies behind the closet door. Pixar opens that door and plunges the viewer into a funhouse mirror of society with puns, inside jokes and pop cultural references (""Scare Different""). Goodman, as his name implies, was an excellent job as the voice actor for the talented but naïve Sully and Buscemi oozes menace as his foil. The plot is sufficiently frightening to drive the story forward and the laughs are high-brow enough for adults and slapstick enough for the kids. In short, one of the few DVDs actually worth owning."

","When I was a kid, the monster I feared wasn't under the bed or in the closet. It was at the top of the attic stairs, and I'll let you in on a little secret. It was a giant gorilla. I just knew it was there, but I would gird myself to go up to prove I could overcome my fear. Once there, I would tempt fate by rotating the hand on an old clock my grandmother had stored up there, and it would bong out it's forbidding chime. Let me tell you, for an eight year old, it was SCARY.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm writing this review some fifty or so years later, so I got beyond the scary part. But you know, I still think about it whenever I'm at my folks' house and go up those daunting stairs. I move around pretty freely now and that old clock is gone, so I'm no longer petrified. Lending some credence to the central theme of this picture, I watched it today with my three year old granddaughter, and you know, in some cases it might be true - ""There is nothing more deadly or toxic than a human child"". But not my granddaughter, she's just a sweet kid. And she liked the movie. So that's good enough for me.<br/><br/>Of course, watching the movie with a kid has it's distractions, so I may have missed a few things. But I'll tell you what, I got the biggest kick out of the yellow snow cone reference and the HAZMAT team going by the CDA (Child Detection Agency) that came in to sanitize poor George who got a kid's sock stuck to his fur. Quite coincidentally, the film I watched just before this one was ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"", so the appearance of one Mr. Waternoose was more than serendipitous. There were other good bits too, like the nod to Ray Harryhausen and the idea of matching every kid with their ideal monster. I guess for me that would be King Kong. Go figure."
"djansen24","8","0","1","8 September 2011"," They didn't forget a thing with this movie!
","Well, Pixar did it once again. Simply a great film! As I watched this for the umpteenth time with my 2 boys, I was fascinated with how they tied up all of their loose ends while not forgetting to follow up on the most minute details. Monsters Inc. has all of the trademark elements of a first class Pixar film: good laughs, breathtaking animation, endearing characters (even the villains), and most importantly excellent stories. One has to enter this story with a certain suspension of belief (even by cartoon standards). The plot is absolutely ludicrous, but it takes itself seriously enough to envelope us into its world; in other words, the characters believe what they say. With that sense of incredulity placed to the side, feel free to enjoy the show, because it is a delight from start to finish. The little girl/s playing the voice of ""Boo"" is/are cute as ever (how do they get such good work out of children?). You care about all of the characters and you will probably even shed tears of joy at the end. The only quip I have (and it is a very minor one) is that the all-star Hollywood cast don't try at all to disguise their voices in their portrayals. They pretty much sound just like John Goodman, Steve Buschemi, Billy Crystal, etc. But the drawings and animation of their characters are so perfect that you quickly forget that Billy Crystal is talking and even really think he might just be a one-eyed, green skinned, little ball monster. One of the best elements to the great ambiance of the film the whole take on the ""monster in the closet/under the bed"" common childhood experience. It is an experience just about everyone of us can relate to, but then having it get flipped back on itself and making the monsters out to be just doing a job and being terrified of the kids was a stroke of genius! And wouldn't it be great if we could solve the energy crisis just by laughing more? I would like to live in a world like that... ;o)"
"lesleyharris30","10","0","1","11 July 2011"," One Of The Greatest Animated Movies Of All Time,
","Monsters, Inc. is a fantastic movie movie with an extremely well developed plot and an outstanding voice cast. After all these years, and so many amazing creations, I still consider it to be one of Pixars greatest work. In terms of humor, it always makes me laugh the most, with so much quotable moments. As well as that, it manages to maintain a lot of emotion and depth in to this insane universe, we gain a genuine care for these characters, viewing them as a lot more that just animated monsters by the end of it. <br/><br/>I have seen this film countless times, I watched it in the theatre when I was only four years old, and am still watching it today with as much enthusiasm and joy. It has amazing replay value and is a roller-coaster of different emotions throughout, which the best movies are. <br/><br/>The voice cast is this film could not have been any better in terms of casting. John Goodman is stellar as Sully, he adds so much to the character's demeanour. The relationship between him and Boo is one of the sweetest in any movie, and the ending still brings me to tears every time. I also love the bond between him and Mike Wazowski, one of my favourite duos of all time. Billy Crystal is phenomenal as Mike, every piece of dialogue is fantastic and the layers to this character are incredible, making him one of my favourite characters of all time. Lastly, such great protagonists need a good antagonist, and they found a perfect one with Steve Buscemi as Randall Boggs, he's an intimidating, somewhat sociopathic villain who we love to hate, and the movie would not be the same without him. <br/><br/>It is a feel good animated film that is timeless and fun for all ages. Hilarious and heartwarming, I could not recommend Monsters, Inc. enough, definitely worth the watch if you are looking for a good family or animated film. <br/><br/>In a world riddled with monsters, who enter the human world and scare children to power their cities, chaos breaks loose as a top scarer, Sully, lets a child loose, it's now up to himself and his best friend Mike to get her home."
"MovieGuy109","7","0","1","10 July 2011"," Monsters, Inc. is no masterpiece, but it certainly is entertainment
","Pixar's third feature is good entertainment especially with a comedian like Billy Crystal voicing. Not as emotionally powerful or complex as Toy Story and certainly no classic, but for the kids and most adults willing to accept an optimistic story, a fun ride. It is full of good storytelling and good visuals, plus a talented voice cast to follow it up. There are many missteps in execution but by the time you get involved with the plight of its characters, you will latch on to it. Kids will enjoy it and adults will most likely find something to their liking within all the slapstick and humor aimed at small children in paricular."

","Pixar comes back with a new and improved feature, and this time, there are talking monsters that scare kids, because it's their job, so they can heal their city. I thought the story was perfectly well-written, the laughs are meant to be good laughs, and the cast including John Goodman as Sulley and the incredible Billy Crystal as Mike was perfectly hilarious. The movie is set in a city filled with monsters, and their every-day job is to scare kids through their closet door, in the human world, only to fuel their city with power. But, when a human child enters the monster world, everybody freaks out, and it's up to Mike and Sulley to bring this little girl, with the name of ""Boo"", back home, before ending up in the clutches of the evil chameleon monster Randall. Actually, ""Monsters, Inc."" happens to be my personal favorite Pixar movie. Because the story was well entertaining, but not as entertaining as ""Toy Story"" or ""Nemo"", but well talented at entertainment and laughs. There was actually something that occurred to me that the story was talking about being scared for nothing, because the monsters overreact that kids are dangerous and toxic, and I think it's all in their heads. I think that's a story I'm well impressed at. Wow, I better hurry before a monster pops out in my closet, and scare the hell out of me!

In my opinion, it's Pixar's best, and why Shrek beat it for best animated feature at the Academy Awards - well I'll never understand that idiocy. The jokes are screamingly (no pun intended) funny, and the dialog is one of my favorite ever. I love every single character (Mike is my favorite), and all the voice acting is superb. The animation is fantastic and the cool twist on ""the monster in the closet"" is fun and very clever. One of my favorite scenes is when Mike and his girlfriend Celia are on a date at Harryhausens (a restaurant in Monstropolis) and Sully comes in with Boo and unintentionally crashes their date and Boo gets loose, it's hilarious havoc, and I love every minute, and of course every other scene in Monster's Inc. Like I said before, I love this movie, it's hilarious, creative, original, featuring awesome characters, this is a great film that everyone can enjoy.

","Who would have thought that a film about monsters could be so much fun? While this certainly isn't Pixar's most intellectually stimulating film, it is an enjoyable way to spend an evening as a family... unless, of course, your children are afraid of monsters.<br/><br/>The Story: Mike and Sulley are workers at Monsters, Inc., the huge power plant that keeps the city of Monstropolis running smoothly. Their job: to collect the screams of little children. Screams are what power Monstropolis, so every night the monsters must enter the world of humans in order to scare the children as they fall asleep.<br/><br/>But the children are not the only ones being scared. The monsters believe that children are poisonous and that just one touch from a human child will kill them. So when a two year-old girl follows Sulley back through her closet door into Monstropolis, the monsters' world is turned upside down.<br/><br/>The Good: As with many Pixar films, friendship and looking out for others is a major part of this story. The relationship that grows between Sulley and Boo is very sweet and he goes to great lengths to keep her safe. This is a wonderful example of what we should be willing to do to protect widows, orphans, and all those weaker than ourselves. Also noticeable was the contrast between good and evil and the lesson that laughter and joy are more powerful than fear.<br/><br/>The Bad: This film is very clean. Besides a few monster kisses and one use of the word darn, there's really nothing offensive here. One thing parents of young children may want to keep in mind, however, is the fact that the film is about monsters who come out at night and scare little children. While this is resolved nicely in the end, some young children may find a film about monsters to be more scary than funny.<br/><br/>Conclusion: While Monsters, Inc. may not be a very deep film, it is an extremely entertaining one! If you're looking for a delightful way to spend an evening, and you are not afraid of monsters, Monsters, Inc. may just fit the bill."
"paul2001sw-1","7","0","1","21 January 2011"," Lively and fun
","'Monsters Inc.' is a Disney (or at least, a Pixar) film. Which means one has a corporate satire made by one of the world's most powerful corporations; and a tale where two friends (one talkative, one cute) argue but always get together in the end to ensure that everyone lives happily ever after. If the template is familiar, the film also marked a move away from the realistic animation of 'Toy Story' (the first wave of computer animation) back towards something more obviously cartoony. It also lacks 'Toy Story's bleak undercurrents, but it's generally fun and inventive, even if you can spot the end coming a long way off. As an adult, I don't quite buy the idea that Pixar's films are the greatest of all time; but there's no denying that they do what they do well."
"KnightsofNi11","8","0","1","11 December 2010"," One of Pixar's best
","It's hard to say that anything that comes out of the studios of Disney/Pixar is anything short of genius. In my opinion, the studio has been on a winning streak since their first feature film, Toy Story (1995). Every single one of their films is unforgettable, and Monsters, Inc. shines just as much if not more than some of its partners. Much like Toy Story expanded on the childhood fantasy of toys that talk while you're not looking, Monsters, Inc. expands on a darker fantasy, and that is the infamous fear of the monster in the closet. It's a notion that every child has had once at least once in their lifetime, making this film instantly relateable.<br/><br/>Monsters, Inc. is set in the city of Monstropolis, a thriving metropolis inhabited by monsters that come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. The city is powered by screams, and the scariest monsters are in charge of collecting these screams from children in the human world. The protagonists of the film are Sully, the top scarer in the business, and his friend/co-worker Mike Wazowski. The two are a powerhouse duo and Sully is revered for his ability to scare children so well. But problems arise when he accidentally brings a child back from the human world. The story unfolds into something amazingly exciting, clever, and also very heartwarming.<br/><br/>Disney/Pixar are renowned for their humorous and cleverly constructed worlds their films are set in, and each of their films always has a great opening sequence to introduce us to these worlds. Monsters, Inc. is one of the best of their openers I think I've ever seen. Every aspect of the city of Monstropolis is a hilarious and yet tasteful pun. There are so many witty things that you can get anything from a good chuckle to a hearty belly laugh out of. Every single aspect of this setting stays true to the theme of this film and there are so many little things to pick up on. You'll always be watching for the next clever joke to be placed in the most unlikely places. Every pun and every joke in this film is very funny, but not over exaggerated, and none of it is hammed up with goofy dialouge or cheesy music. Everything is done with a lot of respect and a lot of wit. It is just what humor needs to be. Sure the occasional fart joke or potty humor is alright, but it can ruin a film if it's too excessive. Thankfully, Monsters, Inc. always knows what levels to take itself to and it never goes overboard.<br/><br/>Even after a brilliant opening sequence the film continues to get better with its great story and vibrant cast of characters. Disney/Pixar always manages to pick up some of the most unique talents to do the voice work in their films and they always get the best vocal performances out of these talents. Billy Crystal and John Goodman work amazingly well as a comedic duo. They are perfectly and eccentrically characterized. Billy Crystal in all his nasally hilarity is the zany and bizarre little guy, while John Goodman is the slightly more intelligent straight man, who is much better at keeping his cool. The two characters work together incredibly well, and their routine never gets old. Then there are other amazing talents such as Steve Buscemi, who is perfectly cast as the villain of the film, Randall. He is an odd salamander like monster, so who better to cast that Buscemi, right? No offense of course, I love the guy and everything he does. Of course I was anxiously awaiting Sully to tell Randall that he was out of his element, but unfortunately that never happened. Other stars like James Coburn and Jennifer Tilly show up for some great roles, and of course John Ratzenberger shows up for a scene as the Abominable Snowman. For those who don't know, John Ratzenberger has appeared in every single Disney/Pixar film to date.<br/><br/>Disney/Pixar is so consistently great but Monsters, Inc. really stands out as one of their most clever and extraordinarily well made films. The world of Monstropolis is put together so well and it all operates perfectly, with so much attention to detail and an incredible amount of thought put into each and every aspect. The story is a lot of fun and can even bring a tear to the eye, especially when it is voiced by such a fantastic collaboration of actors. I will say that the ending is very kiddy and everything works out a little too perfect for all the characters, but hey, it is a kids film so could you expect anything less. Monsters, Inc. is a fantastic Disney/Pixar adventure."
"oneguyrambling","9","0","1","29 November 2010"," As funny as it is furry...
","In Monstropolis kid's screams are like electricity and power the city. Monsters enter kid's closets through magic doors to harvest pure fear, only kids are becoming less susceptible and power is running low (these kids today, Oi!). A small child mistakenly enters Monstropolis and two monsters must try to help her back to her room unharmed The charm of Monsters Inc is showing big furry behemoths as nice guys just doing their job, even though by necessity some monsters must be nasty and mean. <br/><br/>It also makes light of the very ""monster"" concept, meaning hopefully kids assume they are film characters rather than an unseen menace. Sully and Mike are also voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal in the best ""name"" combination of voice actors since Buzz and Woody cleared their animated throats.<br/><br/>Funnier than most films have a right to be, and there is so much detail in every frame that you notice something new each time you watch it.<br/><br/>What you hope kids will learn: There is no reason to be afraid of monsters.<br/><br/>What they'll take away: Randall the slimy salamander-monster still is.

","Monsters, Inc. (2005) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Fun Pixar film about a company that operates by having monsters go into the rooms of children, scare them and then capture their screams. Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sully (John Goodman) accidentally bring one of the children back to Monstropolis and must find a way to get her back. This was another pleasant film from the company that seems to release one winner after another. As usual, there are many gags coming out of just about every place possible with many of them aimed at children but a lot of others are aimed at parents. You have to give a film a lot of credit when it can entertain adults just as much as children. I enjoyed the fact that the movie wants to make kids believe there are monsters in the closet and that they come out when the lights go off. For an animated movie to start with this premise and then work around to where the kids won't be scared is a pretty good little trick and it works wonderfully well. Crystal and Goodman do a terrific job with their vocal work and they make for a great duo. Apparently a lot of their dialogue was recorded with the actors together and this comes across as they seem very fresh and work extremely well off one another. Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi and James Coburn all turn in fine work as well. As expected, the animation is top-notch and looks incredibly good and especially the fur on Sully. I'm not sure what it was but his fur color and the way it moved just kept getting my attention."

","Don't get me wrong...I loved the movie, but let's give credit where credit is due. The movie was not without controversy. In 2002, famed artist and designer, Stanley ""Mouse"" Miller, sued Disney/Pixar claiming they appropriated and infringed upon a script, story and artwork he'd developed in 1997 that involved two stock ""monster"" characters that he'd developed in the 1960s. Since there were a number of ""incriminating"" issues, including a Pixar story artist visiting Mouse in 2000 (after describing himself as a fan of the artist and discussing Mouse's work with him at length), story and characters plagiarized directly and unchanged from Stanley Mouse's notebooks and script, and new Intellectual Property laws which require clear delineations between ""fair use"" and ""misappropriation"", Pixar was placed at an extreme disadvantage in any ensuing arbitration. Recognizing that they would lose a large portion of their $500 million box-office profits if the case ever went to trial, Disney and Pixar settled out-of-court, with Mr. Mouse winning a large, if undisclosed, sum of money and royalties."

It teaches a lesson... good conquers evil, laughter and love and friendship is more powerful than evil, fear, and nastiness. Good friends stick together and help each other, and also that we shouldn't be scared of things simply because they are unknown to us. I think there is a subtle race/ethnicity lesson here too. The monsters are afraid of the humans... they say they are bad, evil, and can bring death and disaster. The monster leaders have made sure that all monsters know not to touch humans, because they are just BAD. But when one human child gets into the heart of a popular and well known monster, and the monster lives and is not hurt in anyway for caring for and touching and being friends with this human, the rest of the monster world learns a valuable lesson in that humans are bad just because they are human, and that a child's laughter is the most powerful force there is!

Driver: yours truly, DVD watchers: grandchildren, Movie playing: Monsters, Inc. over and over and over again!

"insomniac_rod","10","0","1","17 August 2008"," A movie suited for all ages. Disney style.
","A really good movie that fits for all audiences. ""Monsters Inc."" is not strictly a children movie because it has a plot that gets the attention of kids and parents. <br/><br/>The plot has always been a mystery to me. Let me explain myself... The plot is VERY similar to the one of a Troma's 80's flick called ""Monster In The Closet"". The idea of the Troma movie is Horror oriented for children (you know, Troma style) and Monsters Inc. gives the plot a direction of fantasy. I don't know if there's a relationship between both movies.<br/><br/>Anyways, ""Monsters Inc."" has a beautiful plot, great animation effects, a perfect score, and best of all, a sense of humor that fits for all audiences. <br/><br/>I watched this back on the theaters in 2001 with my girlfriend at the time and we had a great time even though I'm a fan of Horror movies. That's the example of how this movie can be enjoyed by everyone. <br/><br/>Join Sully and Mike W. in this beautiful ride. It has moral lessons about friendship, responsibility, and best of all, the tenderness of children."

","This wonderful Walt Disney animation is a story about the strange world of monsters that usually invade the dreams of children and their world is energised by their screams of fear. One of the more successful monsters fails to scare a certain very cute child because he actually looks very cute and lovable himself. The child enraptured by him chases him into his world. This monster Sully and his mate Boo decide they love children and that there world needs to find an alternative energy source.<br/><br/>A very beautiful and enchanting film for the young and young at heart. My mom, who was a close friend of Late Ava Gardner and Gregory Peck, loved the film and thought it was very suitable for her grand children and so I do I. As my extended family in the USA are major share holders at Walt Disney I might be accused of bias but this is not the case it is simply a very good film to show children as it will help them deal with scary nightmares."
"Electrified_Voltage","8","0","1","16 June 2008"," Not one of Pixar's best, but as usual, it can entertain both kids and adults
","I got to see a bit of this movie a few years ago in high school towards the ends of the last day before Christmas holidays. I remember that I did not enjoy it, but also clearly remember that I was in a tired state, which the seemed to happen to me after the school's Christmas assembly for some strange reason. Therefore, that says nothing about the quality of ""Monsters, Inc."" I've seen it thrice since then, and while it has never been one of my favourites from Pixar, and may have more appeal to kids than adults, I certainly can't go as far as saying it's STRICTLY for kids.<br/><br/>Monstropolis is a city where only monsters live. This city relies on a company called Monsters, Inc. for its power. This company's employees enter human children's rooms through the closets and scare them to make them scream, as their screams are what generate the power for Monstropolis! Two monsters who work for Monsters, Inc. are James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (a big, furry, blue creature), and Mike Wazowski (a green Cyclops monster with no torso), who are best friends. Currently, Sulley is in the #1 position for causing the most screams, but Randall, his chameleon-like rival, is determined to top him! One night, Sulley sees that a toddler girl has come in through one of the doors! Residents of Monstropolis are convinced that human children are poisonous, so Sulley and Mike are scared when they first see her, but she seems harmless, and Sulley grows to like her, giving her the name, ""Boo."" Still, they must try to get her back home before any other monster finds her! <br/><br/>There definitely is humour in this movie, but a lot of it is perhaps more amusing for the kids. I personally found a lot of it at least mildly amusing, but overall, I didn't find the movie as funny as I had hoped. We have plenty of the standard slapstick here, but it sometimes seems too simple and childish, and not as funny as I usually find that type of humour. Mike Wazowski is a comic character, with his bitterness and sarcasm, which helps. Claiming he and Sulley are rehearsing a scene for an upcoming company play when their co-workers catch them talking about Boo is a highlight. Overall, I think ""Mike's New Car"", an animated short featuring Mike and Sulley, is slightly funnier than their full-length movie, but for the most part, I guess the humour in ""Monsters, Inc."" is good enough. Maybe funnier for kids, but adults could definitely get their share of laughs as well.<br/><br/>Other than humour, this Pixar effort tells a very imaginative story. It may not be the most well written one to ever come from the computer animation company, but still one that obviously took talent and imagination to write. The adventure that the two main characters find themselves on eventually gets quite exciting. As usual with Pixar, the animation is no disappointment, you can basically expect the same kind of great animation and colours here. So, this is not one of Pixar's best, but it is still another job well done from the company. I'm sure ""Monsters, Inc."" has a lot for kids, which is good, since these animated family films are supposed to entertain them, but also has entertainment value for adults as well, even if it's not equal entertainment value for both audiences like it sometimes is."

","Monsters in the closet scaring kids within this world are not doing so out of any desire to do harm ...They are just doing their job. That is in this Pixar filum that introduced James P. Sullivan and Mike Wazowski to the world, two monsters whose job it is to scare kids, where their screams are processed and turned into clean dependable energy. That is until a little girl named Boo enters the world and changes how things are done forever.<br/><br/>This film was beaten by Spirited Away at the Oscars but there is little to choose between them, especially as they focus on the story of a little girl whose journey takes her to a strange world inhabited by bizarre creatures.<br/><br/>The voice work by Billy Crystal and John Goodman is superb, and as you'd expect from Pixar the story and script are first rate, the direction is top drawer and the animation a vast improvement on the work done on ""Toy Story 2"".<br/><br/>This is an excellent film that's fun for the family, carries a good environmental message about renewable energy that will hopefully inspire the next generation that's coming along, is funny, charming and will make you laugh, cry and cheer as the antics of these big monsters keep your little monsters entertained for hours."

","So many reasons made this movie a classic..<br/><br/>The great imagination of it; with monsters' incorporation and business, as well as handling the main idea into that hilarious script.<br/><br/>The creative voices; actually, it's rare time to have the same fun out of the original as much as the Egyptian dubbed version of it too, with the voices of Egyptian starts like (Sami Magawry) and (Mohamed Henedi).<br/><br/>But maybe on the top of it is this main theme of the beauty who went to the beast's city, instead of the beast's palace, to discover the weakness, the innocence, and the comeliness in them both, and to assure the basic motif of the original novel whereas the relationship between man and the other isn't grounded on violence, savagery or ""intimidation"" inasmuch as love, respect and mutual understanding.<br/><br/>The character of (James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan) continues what (Humphrey Bogart) began, and proves, once more, that the superficially non-charming hero can be more charming romantically, even it was a real monster.<br/><br/>I hated the rash ending, where all the evil guys had been arrested easily, though the movie's makers could be forgiven, because they did great deal of work until these very moments.<br/><br/>In brief, it's a case where the wonderful scenes are the whole movie. And that's something exceptional that made me watch (Monsters, Inc.) for numerous times."

","There are things I do like about this film. I find some moments incredibly beautiful (such as one bit at the end), I like the selection of actors for voicing the characters (especially Randall), I like the CGI used and there are quite a few very good jokes. However, I just feel this is ""weaker"" than a few other Pixar films, such as Toy Story 2, Ratatouille, Cars and of course, Finding Nemo. I also find this a little bit too fast paced, for most of the film there is constant tension. Despite this, I do think that this film is well worth watching at least once and entertaining enough.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty easy to follow. The whole film is about monsters who scare human children at night, coming from the closet. As the film goes on and the plot unravels, we meet Sulley and Mike, two monsters who help each other in this scaring business. We then find out the monsters do it because they it helps power their world (like electricity and batteries do to ours). Soon a large adventure follows involving Boo...<br/><br/>I recommend this to children who do not mind constant tension and worry in animated films and for people who like other Pixar films. Enjoy! :-)"

And what better child social service could they have done than having the monsters try to get kids to laugh instead of scream and cry to power their city. I was impressed with ""Monsters, Inc."" which amounts to yet another gold star on Pixars resume. At this point Pixar can do no wrong.

","Disney makes films which give us happiness and warmth while Pixar gives us terrific animation. Together, they form a multi-billionaire industry making terrific films which the audience and the critics love to watch. And this is one of them.<br/><br/>Monsters Inc. has a very odd and different plot. Monsters scare children to provide electricity by collecting the children's screams but they are scared of the children themselves are they think that they would get contaminated by touching them. <br/><br/>Sullivan is the best scarer of the company Monsters Inc. and he, together with his best friend Mike, work as the best employees in Monsters Inc. But then when Sullivan leaves the door to the children's room open by mistake, he invites an unwelcoming guest, a small, terribly cute girl called Boo. And then the world goes upside down.<br/><br/>A team of monsters are in search of the girl while Mike and Sullivan try to rescue the girl by sending her back to the door where she came from.<br/><br/>But then they come to know that their own boss is involved with their rival and they try to stop them from taking the child by putting in all their effort and strength.<br/><br/>Now, after this summary, let me tell you some of the good points of the movie:<br/><br/>1) Excellent animation. Monsters are not shown scary and so it is a movie for all. Even the young toddlers would fall in love with the monsters.<br/><br/>2) Boo is too cute and I fell in love with her the moment I saw her. She was not shown too stupid and so her role fitted well in the movie.<br/><br/>3) Sullivan's voicing was great and I felt touched when he fought for Boo.<br/><br/>4) The yeti was really funny in the short role he had got. It was good to see that they showed Himalayas and didn't stick to one place only.<br/><br/>5) Mike was really funny and his voicing was almost perfect.<br/><br/>6) The plot is very different and not the same monotonous type.<br/><br/>Now, there were some bad points in the movie:<br/><br/>1) Celia's voicing was done badly. Her voice could have been better.<br/><br/>2) I found it stupid when they showed that Sullivan's boss wanted to kidnap all children and this was his motive. It was very stupid to show that this was the reason that he was bad.<br/><br/>3) Roz's voice made me almost doze off. Please speak a bit louder and clearer next time, grandma.<br/><br/>4) Mike got a bit annoying when he got angry at his friend Sullivan. He did not really look angry and his voice was more of a nagging type than an angry one.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was great but not as good as Shrek Still it deserves an 8 out of 10."

","Monsters, Inc. starts like any other day in Monstropolis for monster friends & work colleagues Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) & James 'Sulley' Sullivan (John Goodman), together they work or Monstrs Inc. the company who supply all the power for Monstroplolis by bottling children's screams. Sulley is a top scarer who enters kids rooms through their closets & scares them so they will scream & Mike is his faithful assistant, however there is a power shortage & kids these days just don't scare easily. Late one night while sorting some paperwork out Sulley comes across a young child on the shop-floor, a shocking sight as great care is taken to make sure the kids never enter Monstropolis as the slightest of touches from just one child may be enough to kill a monster. Sulley has to hide the child from the authorities & find a way to get her back to her own room, however he discovers a sinister plot to kidnap lots of children from their bedrooms in an attempt to solve the energy crisis...<br/><br/>Directed by Pete Docter, David Silverman & Lee Unkrich I personally think Monsters, Inc. is the greatest computer animated film I've ever seen & a film that I have great fondness for. The script by Andrew Stanton & Dan Gerson moves along seamlessly & has the perfect mix of humour, action & sentimentality. I loved the relationship between Sulley & little Boo as you can see him warming to her, surely this has to be one of the cutest & most likable on screen pairings ever, I think you would have to have a very cold heart not to feel a little bit of sadness at the end when Sulley has to say goodbye to Boo for the last time. They are also surrounded by some truly wonderful character's & friends, from the extremely funny Mike to his girlfriend Celia, from the slimy bad guy Randall & the adorable Abominable Snowman. I'm not a child, I'm not a teenager & by all counts the people around me keep saying I'm an adult but does that mean I can't enjoy a wonderful film such as this? Why do kids have all the fun? Quite frankly there is nothing that I don't like about this film, Monsters, Inc. is pure lovable brilliance from start to finish & it's as simple & straight forward as that.<br/><br/>The director's do a great job, they fill just about every inch of the screen with fantastic detail & visual delights. There is so much going on in both the foreground, background & corners of the frame, for instance I loved the scene when the blob creature slid over the grate & accidentally oozed down into it plus Celia's individual snake hairdo whom all have personalities of their own & loads more besides. The character designs are the perfect blend between cuteness & sliminess, this being a Disney film everyone is big & cuddly but they have a weird gooey multiple eyes & tentacles everywhere look to them as well. It's obvious that a lot of time & effort went into the production of Monsters, Inc. including the fact that it normally took 11 to 12 hours to render a single fame of Sulley because they animated each of his 2.3 million hair strands individually! You know that literally boggles my mind just thinking about it.<br/><br/>I can't quite believe that Monsters, Inc. had a budget of about $115,000,000, I love the film to bits but all that money?! Every frame is beautifully rendered & animated but why so much? Anyway, the film is an absolute delight to watch & for that sort of cash it should be. Nominated for & won lots of awards including winning an Oscar for Best Music & it lost out to Shrek (2001) on the Best Animated Feature which I am not having at all, Monsters, Inc. beats Shrek hands down as far as I'm concerned, there is no justice. The voice actors add so much to the film, Crystal & Goodman are perfect as are Steve Buscemi & the imposing sounding James Coburn as the villains, Jennifer Tilly makes for a squeaky & cute sounding love interest.<br/><br/>Monsters, Inc. is just about faultless as far as I'm concerned & hopefully it will appeal to the child in most adults while I'm positive any child will enjoy it immensely. It's totally brilliant in every way, there's nothing else to say. More than deserves it's place on the IMDb Top 250 films list. Watch it as soon as you can, that's an order not a request."

","Great Pixar animated film about two monsters living in Monstropolis - a land outside human land where monsters of all sorts live. Power is generated by the screams of children from Monsters, Inc. - a factory where doors of small children are presented in assembly-line fashion for monsters to walk through and scare children. I was overwhelmed with the concept of the film for its incredible imagination, innovation, and creativity. The folks at Pixar always seem to be able to pull films like this off with ease. At the heart of this film is the friendship of one huge, all-time(almost) scare monster and his assistant - voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal respectively. The characters are penned to fit the voices like hands to gloves. The puns and funny wordplay, particularly by Crystal, are an added bonus and raises much of this as just being another kid's movie. It isn't. What happens? Well, a child manages to come in to the monster world and chaos and fun ensue, but also an emotional quality is created with the depth of characterization of Sully(Goodman). The additional voices by Bob Peterson, James Coburn, and oily Steve Buschemi - not to mention Pixar stalwart John Ratzenberger as the Abominable Snowman(monsters like these had been banished - love the concept again!) greatly enhance the film. But it is the magical animation which seems real more often than not that really propels the engine of this film. This is impressive entertainment from a company that knows what entertainment is all about. In one scene, if you look closely, you will see the child in her room and have a small toy of a clown fish - a couple years before Pixar released Finding Nemo. Love the clever nature of these folks. Any film that can explain to my satisfaction, covering all bases, why monsters come out of closets has to be pretty good."

However, Sulley and his fellow monster friend, Mike, discover that Boo (the name which they had given to the child) is really very harmless. throughout the movie, sulley and mike attempt to keep boo hidden until tehy can get her back into her door and asleep in her room. however, this is not as easy as they might think!"

I liked the way they ended the movie too, they left things open for a future movie. I have probably watched this one over 35 times. What about Mike's car, do you think he would get another one. I would have liked to see what kind of car they would have designed for Sully. The old lady #1 was a good role it was very believable.

","In my opinion, the best animation movie ever made. Graphics may look ""old"" nowadays, but this is not the point. The story is based on a VERY clever concept, and the final result is very sweet. Monsters gain their energy consuming the cries of frightened children, and have developed methods and technology to ""steal"" it. The best ""frightener"" of the monsters has to deal with a... baby girl, that by accident enters the monsters' land, and ends up to treat her with love and care, and protects her from being seen, as babies are considered... health danger! Although the movie is full of clever humor, this is not its strong point against others like ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Shrek 2"": It's the story, the sweetness and the relation between the baby and the good monster that makes it an excellent film, not only for children! Highlight: The ""making of"" of the film, in which the ""actors"" make fun of each other, miss their words etc, as if they were real humans!"

She lovingly asks for us to put it on all the time, she calls it ""Monsters"".<br/><br/>There's lots to enjoy about this movie from the technology to music and of course the characters. You really can't say anything bad about it. First I gotta say that the voices were all very well picked. I get the biggest kick out of Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sulley (John Goodman). Their musical number at the end is cute too.<br/><br/>The one thing I personally enjoy the most about it is that it finds a happy medium that you don't always see in movies geared toward kids. By that I mean that it's not dummied-down so that ""kids can understand it"" but still keeps adults entertained. It also doesn't go overboard at trying to cram a message down your throat.

","In my opinion, Monsters Inc. is right up there with the best of Pixar, behind the two Toy Story films, because Monsters Inc. isn't as groundbreaking. But that's where the criticism ends. Monsters Inc. is nearly flawless as an animated feature and I can guarantee that kids will love this film and have fond memories of it. Adults will relate to it as well. The difference between Monsters Inc and rubbish like Scooby Doo is that this doesn't rely on fart-n-urine gags in order to garner laughs. Its humour is always good-natured.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it is neither ridiculous nor stupid, just a simple friend-finding exercise. Everyone will relate to Sully's pain when he loses Boo, the way anyone would when they lose a good friend. The moral of the story is easy to understand, even if it is a bit simplistic for my tastes. (Actually there are two, but the one that is implied the most)<br/><br/>The animation is outstanding as usual and is therefore not worth mentioning in any great depth. What can be said about Pixar's animation that hasn't been said already? Nothing, so lets move on.<br/><br/>The voice-overs are all great. No character in the film sounds 'lame', not even the minor characters. John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi and Jennifer Tilly, among others, all make their characters sound believable, even vulnerable if they're meant to be. They give them more than one dimension and therefore avoid the stereotypes that come with one-dimensional characters.<br/><br/>Well, what more can I say really? This is Pixar's third best film, behind the two Toy Story's and has no real flaws in plot, acting, animation or character development. Even by Pixar's undoubtedly high standards, Monsters Inc. is a movie to be proud of. Whether you are a kid or an adult, you should see this. If you haven't, see it as soon as you can. It'll grow on you, I can tell you that.<br/><br/>5/5 stars"

It eventually found its way into my Top Ten and it has stayed there ever since, not moving much at all.

They both have their hands full when a human child inadvertently stumbles upon the monster factory.

","Recap: Sulley and Mike work at the scare factory as the top team of scarers. See the monster town use children's scream as energy. But the factory is in a crisis, more and more children are not afraid of the monsters. And would they actually touch one of the monsters, the monster would die, or so the rumor goes anyway. So, as a result, most monsters are more scared of the children than the other way around. One night the terrible accident happens. A little girl enters the monster world! Panic! Afraid to get the blame for the accident, Sulley and Mike hides the girl and tries to send her back without anyone noticing. But something is going on at the factory, the top rival monster to Sulley seem to know more about the accident than he should.<br/><br/>Comments: I am not surprised the monsters having trouble scaring anyone. They're too cute to that. Once again Pixar has made a beautifully and spectacularly animated movie. Especially Sulleys fur is impressive. What the monster lack in scare-factor though they make up in fun-factor. Many monster have some fun feature or behavior. The story in itself is fun too. One should keep in mind though, that this is a movie made for families. That means it lack the suspense and some of the fun twists you might hope for in a movie made for a grown up audience. I guess most kids in proper age will love this, but their parents, or if you like me watch this anyway, will be entertained as well. The movie is fun.<br/><br/>7/10"
"asticht-2","8","0","1","9 August 2005"," Brilliant and unexpected
","Monsters Inc. is without a doubt a well conceived movie. The writing was very good and the storyline, contrary to what one professional reviewer from CNN.com said, does NOT drag in the middle. If anyone has seen the early trailer of this movie, it doesn't give justice at all to the movie. John Goodmans portrayal of the big blue monster Sully is warm, and touching. His interaction with the little girl he names Boo is absolutely delightful. There are actually several scenes where some really heartwarming and tear-jerking things happen. This is very surprising considering Disney hasn't really released a tear-jerker since the Lion King in 1994. Unfortunately Billy Crystals character named Mike while very much in character for him is not nearly as visible in the picture as many movie goers would like. Although he is a main character, his humor is very subdued and he is not as sarcastically funny as he is capable of. Even though John Ratzenbergers (Cliff Clavin from Cheers) role is a small one, his character Yeti is very comical and provides a few moments of comic relief during a particularly tense section of the movie.<br/><br/>The animation however is far more brilliant than Disney/Pixar's previous CGI releases Toy Story, A Bugs Life, and Toy Story II. The environments created for the characters is very cartoon-like in many respects, unlike the phenomenal realistic worlds created in this Summers hit Shrek. The animation is not as complex as Shrek was, but it is very obvious just looking at Sullys heavy fur coat to see the advances computer animation has taken since Jurassic Park rewrote the book on computer effects in 1993. All in all this movie is more geared to kids in the content of the dialog. Parents will find the movie enjoyable, but don't expect as much sarcastic wit and sexual innuendos as Shrek contained as this is a Disney movie after all. I recommend seeing this movie, you'll get a real kick out of the animated short film Pixar created for this release that precedes the movie called ""For the Birds"". It didn't hurt to have Lucasfilm release it's first trailer for Star Wars Episode II with this movie either."

","I enjoyed ""Monsters, Inc."", don't get me wrong. Over all, Monsters, Inc, was a good movie that I would recommend for the family and kids.

By the way, do some movie fans find it a little funny that these computer effects by Pixar look more realistic than other FX movies? :D <br/><br/>But was this the best Pixar film? No, not really. I prefer ""Toy Story"" and ""The Incredables"". This was more aimed at the kids if anything, which I know was the main audience. But Pixar does try to add a little adult humor, which I felt that we didn't get enough of. That's my only complaint. Because I didn't laugh a lot like in ""The Incredables"" or ""Ice Age"".

","When I first thought on what I have seen in this animated movie..well I think it seems pretty realistic in spite of all the imaginary monsters and a monster world! I mean look at that ""Monstropolis"" city scenes.They really challenged to create a parallel world for the monsters. All details of everyday life were considered (chairs have rear openings for tails; buildings have multiple doors of different sizes). And the the pastels are undeniably beautiful and easy on the eyes!!! And the way I think is that monsters were really created in different sizes,shapes,colors, contrasts. they are really creative animations. Out of ordinary! For example when you look at the Celia's hair you can see the innovative animation! Mosters Inc.is better than any animation movie I have seen including ""Shrek"" and the ""Finding Nemo""..The animation is better, the story is many times more innovative and the characters are more endearing and less clichéd. Maybe Sulley's attachment for a human kid is similar to the attachment of a mammoth for a human kid in ""Ice Age"" but this is really different. While Sully is the top scare-maker at Monsters, Inc.--the electric utility of the monster world he gains a compassion for a one he scared. He learns he can get the power he needs for the monster world by making the kid laugh.And that Mike Wazowski really learns something from his friendship.I think in every way marvelous animation.

Hang around for the credits, there are some of the funniest outtakes that you will ever see in your entire life-time. But one of the most interesting things about this film is that it is really unbelievably sweet without being sickly so. Most Disney films are full of sloppy over-sentimentality but this film isn't which shows how little an influence Disney has on Pixar studios. If you want to buy this film on DVD, I strongly suggest that you get the special edition which is made up of two DVDs. It has tons of special features and watching them you will find out that the crew that made this film are really adorable people. If you are feeling miserable, this film will almost surely cheer you up. It is smart without being vulgar which I find very good; people of all ages can watch this film.

Who would have thought that the monsters are afraid of little boys and girls, but they have to hide in closets and scare little kids at night because their screams power the electric utility company of Monsterville. With the help of a little child that is not at all afraid of monsters, our two heroes uncover a conspiracy of grandest proportions, but that's all I will tell you here.

"ertkd","Null","0","1","17 November 2003"," Loved it!
","**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>Monsters, Inc. is truly a film geared towards the whole family, not just children.  Monsters Mike Wizowski (Billy Crystal) and James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) are blue-collar workers of the monster world, collecting the screams of little children to power the city of Monstropolis.  Sullivan or `Sully' is the top scarer of Monsters, Inc., with Wizowski by his side as assistant.  The two monsters are complete opposites.  Sully's large size and intimidating roar makes for a very scary monster, while Wizowski is comparatively small and un-intimidating, though with a fiery personality. Their lives are taken for a sudden turn when a little girl named Boo (Jennifer Tilly) is accidentally let into the factory.  Sully and Wizowski's old goal of being named top performer in the factory changes, and they gear their focus towards the return of little Boo.<br/><br/>I felt that the central idea of this film is that there are `two sides to every story.'  For most children, a monster in their closet is a terrifying concept.  They believe that the `monster' is out to do them harm in their sleep.  In the film, we see this concept from the viewpoint of the monsters doing the scaring.  They are simply trying to make a living by sneaking through the many closets of the world to collect the needed screams for their city's power supply.  In fact, the monsters are just as scared of the children they are scaring.<br/><br/>There are many things to enjoy about this movie.  The computer animation used in the film really makes the characters come to life.  I was very impressed with how realistic the thick coat of fur on Sully was.  It was as if each hair were animated individually.  Towards the end of the movie, when Wizowski and Sully were hurled around by the roller coaster of doors I was almost dizzy from the way the scene was animated.  When I saw it in the theater, I almost felt like I was going up and down and around with them.<br/><br/>
I liked how there were a lot of high `camera' angles looking down on them. It really emphasized how vulnerable and out of control they were, as all they could do was hang on until their door stopped.  Another scene where I thought the angle use was interesting was back at Sully's place, on Boo's first night in the monster world.  A low angle was used as Boo walked towards Sully talking in her baby-babble.  Instead of this angle making Sully seem intimidating and `in charge,' we see a monster terrified of a girl a fraction of his size, covering his head with a spaghetti strainer and utilizing a trash can lid as a shield to protect himself form Boo's `toxicity.'<br/><br/>I thought that this film's theme was similar to that portrayed in Toy Story and its sequel.  Both films show a viewpoint that is opposite of humans. Toy Story suggests what life is like from the viewpoint of a child's toy, while Monsters, Inc. shows life as the monster lurking in a child's closet."

"eallen6","Null","0","1","11 July 2003"," Warm and fuzzy feelings of sweetness and inocence with sprinkles of laughter, sparks a world of energy!
","Walt Disney and Pixar Productions succeeded once again with the film, Monsters Inc. (2001). What a fun movie, with emotion and lots of humor. Monsters Inc. shows that life is greatly enriched and energized with the presence of joyful children. One of the scenes that emphasizes the great energy of a happy child is when the main monsters, Sulley and Mike, bring a child, Boo, to their home in an attempt to hide her. So that she does not cry and scream zapping the energy of the city of Monstropolis, Mike makes her laugh thus creating an endless amount of energy enough to light up the entire city. Early on in this movie, children are perceived as toxic intruders in the city. The monsters work frantically to get Boo back to her own environment. However, with all the chaos that develops in trying to complete this task, one monster, Sulley, learns the joy of having a child in his life. Two scenes demonstrate the enrichment of a joyful child in one's life. The first scene is when Sulley puts Boo to bed for the first time after bringing her home; his heart begins to soften with the sweetness of Boo as she sleeps. The second scene depicting this is near the end when Sulley walks out onto the Laugh Floor with a clipboard in hand. On the clipboard taped under the paperwork is a piece from Boo's door and a picture she drew of him holding hands with her. Clearly, Sulley is energized with the love and happiness of Boo in his life. Another movie that follows the same concept of a joyful child enriching one's life is I Am Sam (2001). How ironic that the two movies came out the same year. In the movie I Am Sam, a mentally-challenged father faces many obstacles raising his daughter from birth. The ultimate challenge he encounters is fighting the legal system that believes the child should be removed from his care and placed into a foster home. Yet, because of the love she gives him and the happiness she brings to his world, he is energized to continue his battle seizing what belongs to him.<br/><br/>Monsters Inc. suggests this theme throughout the movie as Sulley realizes that children are an asset and must be kept safe. No longer should they be scared. A wealth of goodness is added to life when happy children are present. Both the children and monsters benefit from the affect of humor as it creates laughter and radiates positive attitudes. A motif of children's toys is in almost every scene. With the toys in sight, it reminds us not to take life so seriously, that one forgets how to laugh and have fun. At the scream plant, the atmosphere is dull, dark and competitive at the beginning of the movie. It is all work and meeting quotas with the large scream board indicating each monster's performance. Near the end of the movie, you see the plant lit up with sunshine coming in the windows, balloons all-about, banners saying `Think Funny' and the board now labeled as the laugh board reflecting the `Joke of the Day'. Because Monsters Inc. focuses on the delight of children, it encompasses several angles with the majority being at eye-level, a level of a child. Early on in the movie, you see a deep-focus shot of all of the monsters coming onto the scream floor of the plant to begin work. This shot was adopted from the movie All The Right Stuff. The shot highlights the importance of these monsters and what they are about to do.<br/><br/>Pete Docter has brilliantly mastered the art of computer-animation with this movie. So much detail is involved. One example is Boo's T-shirt that freely moves while her body stays in place. Her movements express her energy level through the scene with catching Cheerios in her mouth thrown to her by Sulley. Docter eases small viewers' minds as he creates a vision of monsters who really are not evil but rather just like one of themselves. They see monsters get into trouble for being bad. And yet, he portrays most monsters in a good light reinforcing that a child can bring out the best in them. So he turns closets once feared by children like himself, into a stage of entertaining monsters filled with enthusiasm. Monsters Inc. is a wonderful, whimsical film showcasing that children as well as monsters benefit from each other through laughter and a positive outlook in their lives. Warm and fuzzy feelings of sweetness and innocence with sprinkles of laughter, sparks a world of energy!"

","This is another enjoyable animated feature from the Pixar studios and one of the reasons they can entertain a more older audience is the subtle references that they make from other sources. The story is about a world called Monstropolis where monsters live and their world is powered by the heat of childrens screams. Monsters go through doors that lead into the closets of children in the real world and its the monsters job to frighten children so that their scream can be harnessed and used for power. The top scream collector is Sulley (John Goodman) who is a big hairy monster and he works in the factory that builds the doors and where collectors are to pass through. Sulleys best friend is a big walking eyeball named Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and they discover that a human child named Mary and nicknamed Boo (Mary Gibbs) has passed through into Monstropolis and together they try and get her back but the alert has gone out and the monsters of Monstropolis think that humans are toxic and can kill you. Its always fun to watch these films and its because the computer animation that Pixar does is so detailed and intricate. Each hair on Sulley seems to have a life of its own. The stories are engaging as well as they seem to be about simple things that we can all relate to. Monsters waiting in the closet, we have all grown up thinking about these things and its fun to watch these old phobias come to life. One of the subtle references I was talking about is where Mike is eating in a restaurant called ""Harryhausens"". This is of course in reference to the great Ray Harryhausen who is a pioneer in special effects for films. This film also has the Oscar winning song ""If I Didn't Have You"" by Randy Newman and he has become a Pixar staple with his music. Very enjoyable animated feature that has more to offer than just a kids flick. Adults will definitely get a kick out of it as well!"

John Goodman and Billy Crystal do a great job as the main, ummm... actors in the movie, about a parallel dimension of monsters whose electricity comes from kids' screams.  While they pop out of the closet & scare the kids, a device collects the energy from the screams & powers the city. Unfortunately, one of the master scarers is thinking he can do better with new technology.  As a kid is accidently brought back to the monsters' side of the closet door, havoc ensues as the good monsters try to return her. The 'acting' is good, the plot is simple, but solid, and it was quite enjoyable."

","I'm not big on animated films but I truly like this one! The story revolves around monsters who must scare human children to get their screams since screams provide all the electrical power for the monster society. Monsters utilize the child's closet door as a portal. However, children don't scare easily anymore and production has dropped off. There's also the fact that monsters believe that human children can kill a monster with just one touch. So there's great danger when a child actually comes through the closet door and into monster society! One monster befriends the lost human and is trying to return her to her own bed. But there's evil afoot at Monsters, Inc, the monsters power company and the bad monsters want to keep the child. This is a cute film, and I liked it!"

","Let's face it.  All of Disney's good films were eons ago, or at least all the ones before Pocahontas.  Then after that, things went from bad to worse, with disasters such as Hunchback of Notre Dame (too dark for kids), Hercules (too stupid), Tarzan (worthless), Dinosaur (see Land Before Time), Fantasia 2000 (too short), Emperor's New Groove (Saturday morning animation), Lilo and Stitch (waste of time) and Treasure Planet doesn't look that good. Mulan was the only gem.  But then all of the sudden comes Pixar, a flower in the midst of thorns.  And my favorite of their pictures by far is Monsters, Inc.<br/><br/> The characters were wonderfully developed, the plot was intriguing enough, the animation was very, very good.  I really liked Billy Crystal playing Mike Wazowski and John Goodman playing Sully.  They did a great job, and the little kid Boo was very cute.  The movie had a lot of great lines.

","Monsters, Inc. is another triumph of computer animation from the wizards at Pixar.  As with the Toy Story series, the plot is taken from a ""what if?"" scenario in a child's imagination.  What if the monsters (whom everybody knows dwell in childrens' closets and under their beds) in fact live in a parallel world to ours? <br/><br/>
Monstropolis City is powered by energy garnered from children's screams, which are collected by the workers at Monsters Incorporated.  James P. Sullivan and his sarcastic assistant Mike are Monster Inc.'s top scarers, but when Sulley inadvertently lets a small girl into the monster world things start to go awry.  Monsters believe that human children are highly toxic, and in their efforts to put little Boo back where she came from, they uncover a fellow worker's sinister plan to revolutionise the scream-collection industry.<br/><br/>
One of the few down sides of the film is that at times it is just a little too cute, and Sulley definitely works best as a strong and straight-forward good-guy, as opposed to his attempts to be a moraliser and emotion-analyst. His computer-generated fur though is incredible.  Over one million hairs have been animated to move realistically in response to anything from a light breeze to a Himalayan snowstorm.<br/><br/>
The concept of a factory that has an exact replica of every child's closet door, and that of monsters living in a world not all that dissimilar to ours is certainly clever; but it is also the little details - such as a ""Grossery Store"" and ""odorant"" (rather than deodorant) - which really make the movie. Although the ending is a trifle schmaltzy, this is a film that kids will love, and adults won't mind watching again and again."

"pinhead1","Null","0","1","4 December 2002"," Not all the magic has died in Hollywood...
","Not everything in Hollywood has to be gratuitous sex and violence. At least that's what Monsters Inc. proves to moviegoing audiences of all ages. Animated by the now-legendary Pixar, Monsters Inc. tells the story of the best ""scare team"", Mike and Sully, in ""Monstropolis"" the world that exists on the other side of every child's closet door when the lights go out at bedtime. Mike and Sully's job is relatively simple; to make sure that each child visited by them is made to scream in fright, since Monstropolis' power supply is dependant on children's screams of fright to power their homes, heat, cars and so forth.<br/><br/>Monsters Inc. shows kids that the monsters in their closets are just workers like people in this world, and that their being scared is just  average, work-a-day employment for an industry for which they provide a raw material. The film does this in a fun way that many kids can relate to, much like seeing mom and dad go to the office every day, with co-workers, time off and a old fashioned, stuffed shirt boss.<br/><br/>Mike and Sully's day to day routine is disrupted, however, by an adorable, chubby cheeked little girl named ""Boo""., who thinks that the large, blue haired Sully is an endless source of fun and entertainment, following him through her closet to the scare factory, making the hulking ""scarer"" tremble, since he has been led to believe that a child's touch is fatal to monsters. He soon learns the truth, and eventually risks all to save little Boo and return her to the human world with the aid of his co-worker, friend and assistant, Mike.<br/><br/>This movie has something for the adults and children who watch it. Numerous ""hat tips"" to familiar adult icons of the entertainment industry, such as Harry Hausen and even the comedian Gallagher are interjected with tounge in cheek humour, where the kids don't have to understand the references... it's just another locale or funny piece of eye-candy for them. The real value in this movie is in it's replayability for your kids. If you have the DVD or video, you no doubt have a child who has asked you to let them watch it again and again. I know mine has.... the thing is, you *want* them to watch it again. It shows a tenderness and caring between charachters in their situations that, under the surface, transcends any differences. It doesn't matter to Boo that Sully is a great, big fuzzy monster with horns on his head, it';s his actions that she watches and his gallantry on her behalf that binds her to him as they go through their adventure together. And perhaps there's a message in there for all of us, not just the kids..."
"Thunderbuck","10","0","1","1 December 2002"," Oddly enough, truly great...
","I've posted a comment on Monsters Inc. before, but I wanted to follow up from the perspective of multiple viewings (my 2 year old daughter has taken to this movie like nothing else *grin*).<br/><br/>*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed Monsters Inc. on the first few viewings, imagine my amazement when I started seeing actual SUBTEXT in this cartoon.<br/><br/>Okay, so the ""accidental fatherhood"" theme has appeared in many other movies (Three Men and a Baby comes to mind), but it works here, and is referred to in the script a couple of times.  Monster Sully really becomes a ""father-figure"" to the little girl who accidentally makes her way to Monstropolis, and passes through the same stages many real fathers do, from utter terror to affection to love.  The strongest element in Monsters Inc is that it's very easy to believe in the relationship between Sully and ""Boo"" (the name he eventually gives the child, to buddy Mike's dismay).   When Sully inadvertantly scares the girl in a demo for new trainees his dismay is convincing and heart-breaking.  The scene where Sully finally returns ""Boo"" to her own room is really an understated, emotional masterpiece, from the girl's initial glee at being home (and the way she shows off all her toys to her new friend Sully--a marvellous detail) to Sully's heavy-hearted exit. A nice detail about that exit--the animators may have been tempted to show a teardrop fall from Sully's eye, but instead we just see his eyes visibly moisten as he turns to go.  I loved it.<br/><br/>The point that ""laughter is ten times more powerful than scream"" is actually a lovely touch, carrying the implication that a cooperative solution is always preferable to a confrontational one.  Even better, while this message is made distinctly, it isn't stated overbearingly.  It's a nice message for parents and labor negotiators alike.  It might be stretching, but I think there's even an environmental implication to this message that's not stated directly in the movie, but definitely seems to be alluded to.<br/><br/>More unstated messages come from Mr. Waternoose (of course voiced masterfully by the late James Coburn).  In the commentary track on the DVD director Pete Docter notes that Coburn brought a warmth and a vulnerability to the character that none of the writers had seen, and that kind of added dimension makes him that much more powerful as a villain.  He also represents a dangerous resistance to change, and to adopt a cooperative solution in favor of one that's even more exploitive; Waternoose's idea of innovation is not just to continue victimizing children, but to escalate that victimization to an unspeakable new level.<br/><br/>Okay, okay... I might just have too much time on my hands to start reading these messages into Monsters Inc, but I swear they're here.  And I don't think there's QUITE this much depth to, say, Shrek (which I continue to like a lot, BTW) or A Bug's Life or the Toy Story movies (which I also love, but for different reasons). ...And another note on the music: while Randy Newman's theme song ""If I Didn't Have You"" is pretty much a rehash of a lot of other songs he's done in the last decade or so, his score for Monsters Inc is marvellous.  His theme for the little girl is rendered in a few different ways, and the simple piano version that plays in the pivotal ""return"" scene is just plain wonderful.  And the swinging, big-band style score for the scenes in the Monsters Inc plant are very catchy.<br/><br/>Yes, I think Monsters Inc. is a genuinely great movie.  But I feel a little funny admitting that :-)"

The animators have given each monster its own personality, and the detail is amazing. How else do you describe the way the writers came up with all the details of the Monsters, Inc. company? This movie is so wonderful because it's not trying to scare kids like so many other monster movies. Although there are a couple of scary moments, this movie is gentle enough for even the youngest children to watch. This movie is by far the best one that the Pixar team has created.

","Monsters, Inc. is a great movie. It has cute characters, a fun story and fantastic visuals. This is definitely a movie you can watch with the kids. You won't be bored and the kids won't pick up any nasty new words.<br/><br/>The story of Monsters, Inc. revolves around Mike and Sully, the best scarers on the payroll at the Monsteropolis power plant. One day a human child is accidentally brought into the monster world and the race to find her and get her out of Monsteropolis is on. Mike and Sully are on the case but the somewhat shifty Randall is also showing undue interest in the child. Without giving away too much, let's just say that Randall is involved in an insidious plot to get more screams out of the kiddies while Mike and Sully just want to get her out of town so they can go back to work.<br/><br/>Of course, these little problems always seem to get worse before they get better. The power plant is crawling with CDA (Child Detection Agency) agents making it tough for Mike and Sully to sneak the kid back through the door into her bedroom, not to mention keeping her out of Randall's clutches. Their efforts to send the tyke home culminate in a chase in and out of doors leading to exotic locals all over the human world. How does it end? Go see the movie.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie is the imagination. The complex industrial environment of Monsters, Inc., the great details on the characters, the smooth colors and various cool visual effects. The casting of Billy Crystal and John Goodman in the lead roles works quite nicely, with Crystal's Mike Wazowski stealing the show. The ending chase through the power plant and in and out of the doors is fast-paced and exciting, with lots of action and great eye candy.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like about this movie were Randall's blatant attempts to kill off Sully. I thought this was just a little to violent; it doesn't quite fit the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I give Monsters, INC. a score of 7/10.

There is nothing typical about this film. We've all feared monsters in our closets and under our beds, but to watch their story told from their POV is brilliant. The jokes are original and fun. No over-familiar dialogue or cheap fart jokes here.<br/><br/>The character of Boo will melt your heart with her giggles and poignant innocence. Sully is a classic hero and Mike is a sidekick with just the right kick. Steve Buscemi voices the perfect villain and the secondary characters are stand-outs in themselves.<br/><br/>The chase scene through the door supply room is the most amazing CG work done to-date. And, the cinematography was dead on. The choice of shots furthered the story without overpowering or distracting the viewer from it. The greatest evidence of this is found in the very last shot--a lesser DP would have cut to Boo, but the filmmakers at Pixar knew our hearts resided in Sully's reaction.<br/><br/>Monsters, Inc. is a must-see for anyone who has ever been a child!"

","Disney is really starting to get in gear.  I am amazed at some of the brilliant films they have produced within the last few years.<br/><br/>Spoilers.<br/><br/>Monsters, Inc. is a great tale that strives for action and adventure as well as heart-felt emotions and good morals.  James P. Sullivan is a scary monster at its best in the industrial power plant of Monsters, Inc. and intends to keep up his good reputation.  Mike Wazowski is the comical, witty little one-eyed... thing... who intends to keep Sulley up on top.  However, Randall, a creepy, lizard-like monster, is out to do more than just get on top.  His plans are much more dire, and I think this is one reason I liked Monsters, Inc. so much.<br/><br/>First of all, the characters, although monsters, can easily be connected with.  We understand what Sulley is feeling when he gets attached to Boo. We understand why Mike is upset with Sulley when they're stranded with the Yeti.  The characters are so real that it's like I could reach out and feel them there.<br/><br/>I was a bit skeptical at first.  I thought that Monsters, Inc. would take place in a strange world with different physics and absolutely incomprehensible functions.  However, the movie tries its hardest to be as human-like as possible and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all with it.  It kept me in the loop on how things work.<br/><br/>The plot is very unique.  The toddler, whom Sulley names ""Boo"", somehow gets into the power plant and starts to wreak havoc on Monstropolis.  In reality she is not harmful, and the events that take place before she is finally returned are downright hilarious and intense.<br/><br/>The actual story was indeed excellent.  The problem amounted to unnerving heights as soon as they had Boo in the apartment, and even after that it continued to grow more and more.  I found myself hoping they wouldn't be caught, telling the characters not to go there, and I was even compelled to bite my nails.  The final conflict involving Randall and many doors is humorous yet, once again, intense (I especially liked the part when Mike and Sulley dive down into a door only to find that they're no longer falling...).<br/><br/>The music, composed by Randy Newman, starts out in the credits with a light jazz composition.  Usually I find jazz annoying, but this wasn't so bad. Once it got into the movie, though, he switched to a nice composition.  It wasn't a major factor in the movie, but it held up in the end when Sulley is searching for Boo.<br/><br/>There were some things I didn't like about Monsters, Inc.  For one, the evil villain, Randall, did not have a decent enough end.  I felt his story was unfinished as he was thrown through a door and beat down like an alligator. But, like it showed in the end, he could easily leave that house and find another, enter a closet, and easily return to the monster world.<br/><br/>Also, the end had two things wrong with it.  First, it was a happy ending. In real life, it's a half and half chance of things turning out to be good. But in Disney, it always seems to end nicely.  I think it would have been more emotional if, when Sulley said goodbye, it was for forever.  But I suppose that wouldn't appeal to some of the younger children.<br/><br/>Second, it was a little stretched out.  I felt that the movie did not wrap things up quickly.  Instead, it added more stuff in the end that I felt was not necessary.<br/><br/>Altogether, despite those little annoyances, Monsters, Inc. is a marvelous tale.  Its setting in a different world makes it so interesting, the characters add depth to the story, and the events are mellow and intense at the same time.  It's a great film."

"cheddar_fixxx","10","0","1","26 September 2002"," Pixar Have Done It Again
","*A FEW POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I had heard very, very good things about Monsters, Inc. (2001). All of the people that had seen in theatrically had told me it was fantastic, and it was sitting nicely at #119 in the IMDB Top 250 at the time that I wrote this review. Being that it had come from animated geniuses Pixar, I can't say that I expected something as bad as Kazaam (1996). I expected something terrific, but not as terrific as I got.<br/><br/>The story revolves around James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). They both live in a city called Monstropolis, and work at a factory named Monsters, Inc., where monsters are given a designated child of which they go into the bedroom of and scare every morning at work, as that is apparently bedtime for children in the human world, and the screams of the child fill yellow tanks that look like the oxygen tanks scuba divers use. The screams are then processed into electricity, which is used to power the whole of Monstropolis, but they cannot make contact with a child or any object from the child's room, as they believe that nothing is as dangerous or deadly as a human child. Sully is the top scarer currently working in the factory, and is at the top of the ladder on scares, and trailing just behind him is a sleazy monster named Randall Boggs (portrayed very well by Steve Buscemi). Randall is determined to get to the top of the ladder ahead of Sully, so one evening after work, when the scarefloor (where the business is conducted) is empty, Randall sneaks his door down to cheat Sully off the top of the ladder, and goes to fetch a trolley of tanks to get the screams. Roz, the dispatch manager (Bob Petersen (III)) is always up Wazowski about his paperwork not being in on time, on the scares he works with Sully, so Sully covers for him so Mike can go out for dinner to a sushi restaurant with his girlfriend Celia (Jennifer Tilly), the receptionist at the factory. Sully goes up to the scarefloor to collect the paperwork, and discovers the door sitting there while the rest have been put away. He goes in and investigates, and accidentally lets the child, which he later names Boo, out of her room. He panics, and throws her back in, or so he thinks. Accidentally collecting some toys, he runs and stuffs them in a locker. He then discovers that Boo is holding onto his back, so he stuffs her into a sports bag. He gets back just as Randall, noticing his child is not in bed, walks puzzled out of her room, and puts back the tanks and the door. Sully rushes to the sushi restaurant to tell Mike, interrupting their dinner, and making Celia, who has rattlesnakes for hair, very unhappy, and so begins a wild adventure to get Boo back to the her room, but run into many obstacles in the way, such as hiding Boo from Randall, who wants to kidnap her and extract her screams, using a scream extractor (go figure), hide her from the boss, keep her at bay thinking she is deadly, and save their jobs, but get attached to her along the way. There are many other little surprises, such as subtle references to the Toy Story films, those of which I will not give away here, as you should see the film for yourself.<br/><br/>The film is not, and I cannot stress this enough, just a kid's movie. Most, if not all, adults that view it will also like and accept it's morals, and appreciate it's sense or humour. It is a great movie for the entire family, as Pixar are renowned for.<br/><br/>Beau's Rating: *** 1/2 out of ****"

","With either John Goodman or Billy Crystal, you cannot go wrong. Put them together and you have a guaranteed success. That's exactly what ""Monsters, Inc."" is. These two actors know how do everything. I don't think they even need to be directed anymore. This shows in their dialogue throughout the movie; they never deliver a line incorrectly. Sometimes this movie is intelligent, sometimes it's very funny and other times it's both! The movie is stunning visually. The giant warehouse of doors is impressive. Sully's fur is a sign of how far computer animation has come since the days of ""Toy Story."" The story is very interesting as well and applies to everyone.

"the_cave_troll","8","0","1","21 September 2002"," an entertaining film for children of all ages
","Monsters, Inc. is the type of film Disney used to make.  Sure the computer animation is new, but the old Disney formula is the same here.  Great animation, lovable characters, a simple plot, and slapstick humor are what made Disney films like 101 Dalmations, Dumbo, Pinnochio, etc. all great childrens films.  Monsters, Inc, however has done what these films could not do by extending its audience beyond your standard 3-11 year old. <br/><br/>
The creators of Monsters, Inc. have paid enormous attention to detail in their work such that jokes like an ooze-generating monster mopping a floor, or an abominable snowman serving yellow snow cones (No, its lemon!) will entertain adults who normally don't find animation very interesting.<br/><br/>It is fortunate that Disney (Pixar in this case) has chosen to veer away from the formula that made its animated cartoons go ""over the top"" in the past.  Yes, I mean the singing!  The music chosen for this film goes over well and does not steal the show from the principal actors (Billy Crystal and John Goodman) and features a duet from the two at the closing credits (Oscar nominated song ""If I didn't have you"".<br/><br/>Crystal works well as the scare ""coach"" Mike Grebalski (spelling?).  Disney could have chosen ""over the top comedian Robin Williams for this part but wisely chose Billy Crystal whose comedy was light hearted and fun.  Goodman gave a stellar performance as scare legend ""Sully"", the scarer who falls in love with a little child.  <br/><br/>While there were some plot holes (how did Mike get back from the snow world?), I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to anyone, especially to those with children. <br/><br/>Buy Rating (0 = burn all copies of this  1 = good for USA network on Saturday night  2 = wait to come out on cable, network TV  3 = worth a rent 4 = buy it cheap on VHS  5 = buy it on DVD<br/><br/>5 of 5 stars"

"Beaucoul","Null","0","1","19 September 2002"," Majorly disappointing
","Wow. I was jacked to watch this movie with my grandkids. I thought it might be another Shrek, which we have all watched together numerous times. Shrek is clever and densely packed with humorous details such as the parking lot sign that states, ""You are parked in Sir Lancelot."" This movie however, is so un-clever, so artless, and so derivative, that it is offensive to me purely on an aesthetic basis. But my dislike of this movie doesn't simply stop there.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I am no big fan of Billy Crystal, whose character is supposed to supply the film with most of its comic moments. Unfortunately, the character has no identity other than Billy Crystal doing his shtick.<br/><br/>John Goodman's character fares no better. Imagine, taking a butt-ugly, terrifying monster and emasculating it in order to provide some touchy-feely revelation about the importance of positive reinforcement, and you get a grasp of just how low this movie will stoop to pander to its audience.<br/><br/>Perhaps the worst offense of all is that this is a comedy without laughs. Secondary characters are mindless oafs, drawn in such lazy, broad strokes that it is almost offensive to be asked to laugh at them. Most of the comic scenes fall flat, primarily because they are so derivative, you know what to expect before the punch line arrives.<br/><br/>What a let-down from Pixar, the studio that produced the great Toy Story movies. I'd like to think the blame for this mess can be fixed on the gross and retrograde hand of Pixar's parent studio, Disney. Pray that Pixar throws free the shackles on its next animated production."

"magic_marker","9","0","1","7 September 2002"," Ooh, the sweetest thing
","Quentin Tarantino once claimed (In a deleted scene from ""Pulp Fiction"") that there were only two kinds of people in the world; Elvis people and Beatles people. You could love both, but eventually you had to make a decision. Now there appears to be a new societal division forming- between ""Shrek"" people and ""Monsters Inc."" people. Now I love ""Shrek;"" it had moments of real wit and its target (the Disney empire) was long overdue for a thrashing. But ultimately I was left cold by it. The reason? It was afraid to be a fairy tale. It is true that young people nowadays would not respond well to fairy tales; Disney has transformed  fairy tales into something toxic and false, so new ways of telling them have to be invented. ""Shrek"" told a basic fairy tale story, but peppered it with post-modern references and nudge-nudge jokes to make it clear to is jaded and cynical young audience that it didn't REALLY believe in any of it, it was just having fun. That is, I think, the easy way out.<br/><br/>""Monsters Inc."" (Which is officially a Disney film but is actually made by the far more innovative studio Pixar) chooses a harder route; to tell a fairy tale straight, but in a way modern audiences will appreciate. In this, they succeeded masterfully.<br/><br/>The plot of ""Monsters Inc."" is well known by now. In the city of Monstropolis, which is pretty much like any city you know except that it is populated by monsters of all shapes and sizes, children's screams are the only source of power. To obtain them, the power company Monsters Inc sends professional scarers through a network of trans-dimensional doors into children's closets around the world. The rules of the job are strict; no children or even children's clothing must come into contact with a monster, for there is nothing more dangerous than the touch of a human child. The company's top scarer is ""Sulley"" Sullivan (John Goodman), who with his partner Mike (Billy Crystal) is in a contest with the number 2 scarer, the evil chameleon Randall Boggs (Buschemi, playing it smooth instead of whiny for a change) to break the all time scream record. However, Randall is actually engaged in a shady plan that involves one of his assigned kids. When that plan backfires and the kid ends up in Monstropolis, Sulley is left alone to deal with her, and with the utter chaos that ensues.<br/><br/>
There is so much to love in this film, but I must draw attention to the relationship between Sulley and the child, who he nicknames ""Boo."" Somehow, and truly I am at a loss to explain it, the scriptwriters, animators and actors pulled off the amazing feat of making the relationship touching without being nauseatingly sweet. Boo is the most adorable little kid in animaiton history, and I think the reason for this is that she was actually voiced by a real three-year old, and not by some affected adult (After all, what do adults really know about what it is like to be three?). The scriptwriters got her to say some incredibly funny things, but her innocence makes them funnier, since she is not trying to be self-aware. John Goodman is wonderful at conveying Sulley's gradually mounting affection for the little tyke, making it more humourous and moving by spicing it with some understandable aggrivation.<br/><br/>I loved the reference to Tex Avery's legendary animated short ""Feed the Kitty,"" (Which must have heavily influenced the filmmakers; Boo also calls Sulley ""kitty""), and this film has plenty more to entertain- particularly some wonderfully designed snow sequences and a virtiguous closet door chase that is one of the best ever. ""Monsters Inc"" is a film I will watch again, and from me, that is high praise."

Well, not precisely living there, but they do come through the closet door to collect children's screams which they need to power their city, Monstropolis. Of course, little kids are also said to be highly toxic to monsters, so those are just as afraid of children as vice versa. Imagine the panic when it transpires that one of those disease-carrying creatures is loose in Monstropolis. Aahh!<br/><br/>After Shrek upped the ante in CGI technology, Disney and Pixar could not well sit back and let Dreamworks have the first Animated Oscar without a fight. As a result, they surpassed everybody's expectations - and Shrek - by a long shot. The got the wake-up call in time, and - even if the Academy Awards tell us otherwise - this round goes to Disney. Much of the success of this movie is, of course, the merit of the voice cast. Like Billy Crystal came to realise, Mike Wazowski may be green, bald and not even have a profile, but he clearly walks like Crystal, talks like Crystal, IS Crystal. Sulley is a very lovable monster and hero (he's welcome in my closet any time), while Boo is just adorable. And then there's Steve Buscemi's evil slimy rotten villain of a lizard...

However the monsters in this movie are in fact just regular working Joes from ""Monsters, Inc."" the company that supplies power to their home world by capturing childrens screams. As soon as thats done they nip back home via the portal that exists behind every closet door in the world.

However youd hardly notice; the film has the CGI sheen and spectacular action scenes weve come to expect, along with a plethora of visual gags & in jokes (including tips of the hat to Pixars previous movies), and a razor sharp script that will once again ensure the film appeals to adults as much as kids.

","Surely, the film was not as bad as I expected when I entered the cinema.<br/><br/>The story is nothing for adults but for the little kids it's a film extraordinary to cope with their fear of monsters in the closet.<br/><br/>Anyway, the whole movie has been drawn quite nice and there is a good sense of humor but compared with Shrek it's just another movie.<br/><br/>I think there are too little ""hidden"" jokes referring to other movies or every-day-life-issues. I couldn't laugh out loud many times (unlike to the Shrek screening ;-) and as I left the theater I thought, OK, what we are doing next?"
"GEM-20","6","0","1","11 November 2001"," Good, but it is no ""Toy Story""
","Seeing this film with my kids, I noticed something that was quite different than the experiences of the ""Toy Story"" films and ""A Bug's Life"": The kids were having a better time than I was. That was really too bad, because I wanted to have the fun too, but I could not find it.<br/><br/>Maybe I am not as dazzled as I was with ""Story"". Computer animation is fantastic, but movies still come down to one thing: story. I just did not feel that the ""Monsters, Inc."" tale was as good as the previous efforts of Disney/Pixar.<br/><br/>Before I go into a long talk of the failings of this film, let me first state that kids do enjoy it. From their standpoint, taking in an average of the 3 of my children, I would rate it ***1/2 out of ****. I know they will go to school, tell all their friends to see it, and there will be ""Monsters, Inc."" toys under the Christmas tree this year.<br/><br/>So much for the kid review. From my viewpoint, this film tried to appeal utilizing many of the same methods of the ""Toy Story"" movies. Unfortunately, those films were better. ""TS"" gave us the idea of lives existing somewhere that we can't see. And, instead of Buzz Lightyear and Woody, replace them with Sulley and Mike. <br/><br/>In ""TS2,"" Woody gets the girl and Buzz is the one driven to fulfill the mission. In ""Monsters,"" Mike gets the multi-legged girl and Sulley focuses on the job. There is even that moment between Sulley and Mike where they have an argument and go their separate ways. Seems very familiar.<br/><br/>I guess I hoped for something funnier. This one has funny moments, but it seems to be going more for the ""Cute"" factor. The little girl, Boo, has a very cute face that can evoke many emotions. Sulley and Mike, voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal, are quite good too. <br/><br/>Walking out of the theater, I had the disappointing feeling that I wished the movie could have had more. While the kids rate it ***1/2, my rating is either ** or **1/2."

"divaclv","Null","0","1","9 November 2001"," Another good effort from Pixar
","Like the previous work from the gurus of computer animation, this one gets high marks for artistic excelence.  The fur on Sully's coat is alone worth the viewing--rich and vividly detailed.  Sully's partner, Mike Wazowski, is built on more simple lines--basically, a walking eyeball--but is given a full range of expression that makes him, well, human.<br/><br/>Sully and Mike work at Monsters, Inc., a power company that fuels their dimension with the screams of frightened children.  This is dangerous work for the monsters--kids are not only becoming increasingly difficult to scare, they're believed to be a biohazard (any relation to current events is both coincidental and handled in such a manner as to not be disturbing).  So naturally, panic breaks when a toddler named Boo slips through the portal into Monstropolis.  Sully and Mike are given the task of getting Boo home; en route, they fend of the machinations of professional rival Randall (a nasty chameleon-like creature) and the Monsters Inc. CEO Waternoose (a crab-like being well-voiced by James Coburn) and of course, realize humans might not be so bad after all.<br/><br/>As with all previous Pixar films, the supporting cast is colorful and entertaining.  Among the highlights: Mike's girl Celia, who looks like the love child of Cyclops and Medusa, and Roz, a slug with cats-eye glasses who seems to be a compilation of every dour-faced, embittered, nicotine-and-caffene-addicted drudge I've ever worked with.<br/><br/>Despite the high-quaility animation, ""Monsters, Inc"" lacks the captivating quality that would have rocketed it into masterpiece territory.  The characters aren't as engaging as those in the Toy Story films, nor is the humor as infectious as Shrek's.  But the film has its moments; in particular, the climactic roller-coaster chase through the closet-door portals that grant the monsters access to the human world is a highlight.<br/><br/>""Monsters, Inc."" may not be perfection, but it's a beautifully rendered and overall fun journey into another world and that's always a good thing in my book."

Boo was a spoiled brat, so I identified with her more than with Mike and Sully, even if I have to play their role (adult) in real life.<br/><br/>Seems a shame that a message about conservation and corporate greed can only be made by a large corporation, but here it is.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you meet Mike-- ask him how he managed to make Kindergarten the best three years of his life.

"jhclues","8","0","1","8 November 2001"," Entertaining Fare for the Whole Family
","At one time or another, every kid in the world goes through the dread Monster-in-the-Closet experience; it's like one of Life's Rules.  And for those who remember the chills of the dark bedroom, the stark terror of the moment the light goes out and you're left all alone with the Thing of your imagination, at long last there are some concrete answers to allay the fears of PCCSS (Post Childhood Closet Stress Syndrome), thanks to the good folks at Pixar.  `Monsters, Inc.,' directed by Peter Docter, and featuring the talents of Billy Crystal and John Goodman, takes you behind the scenes of those haunted hours of childhood and explains the whole business.  Which happens to be the whole point:  It's a business.  At Monsters, Inc., it's the job of all the scariest creatures around to supply the power for the city, which is generated by the screams of the children found on the other side of closet doors.  The bigger the scream, the more power.  From one floor of the factory that is Monsters, Inc., closet doors are affixed, assembly line style, so that the best of the best (or maybe that's the worst of the worst) can step through (it takes them into a child's bedroom) and do their thing.  The screams are then collected in canisters and the city has power.  <br/><br/>	The monsters earn points for the most scream power collected, and at the top of the list is James P. `Sulley' Sullivan (Goodman) a big, hairy, hulking monster who is assisted by the one-eyed (and it's a big one) Mike Wazowski (Crystal), a monster in his own right, though not of the scaring kind.  But Sulley has some competition; the number two scarer is Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi), more sinister than Sulley, and not beyond stooping to some underhanded schemes to get to the top spot on the roster.  It's a tough racket, and Sulley and Mike have no idea just how low Randall is willing to go to get what he wants.  It's a plot, however, that ultimately has a far-reaching effect on the whole city, and it falls to Sulley and Mike to try and put things aright with their world.<br/><br/>	Beginning with the premise, the story is clever and funny, and it's all brought to the screen with exemplary execution.  The Pixar process is simply amazing; the depth and dimension of the animation is brilliant and gives new definition to this genre as an art form.  Consider, for example, how very real the expressions and emotions of the characters are conveyed.  That, combined with the fact that the story moves along with an excellent pace and perfect timing, makes for a satisfying and enjoyable time at the movies. <br/><br/>
	Docter also assembled a top notch cast for his project.  In addition to Crystal, Goodman and Buscemi (who are terrific), the cast includes James Coburn (Henry J. Waternoose), Jennifer Tilly (Celia), Bonnie Hunt (Flint), Mary Gibbs (Boo), Bob Peterson (Roz), John Ratzenberger (Yeti), Frank Oz (Fungus), Steve Susskind (Floor Manager), Jeff Pidgeon (Bile), Daniel R. Gerson (Needleman & Smitty) and Sam `Penguin' Black (George).  Entertaining fare the whole family can enjoy, `Monsters, Inc.,' is a real experience for the little ones, and certainly presents something with which the adults in the audience will be able to identify, whether it be a memory from childhood or helping one's own child face the unknown of the Closet-in-the-Dark.  It's a movie that actually offers a little bit more than meets the eye, and it's a demonstration of something I've always said, that it's a kind of magic. And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10."
"Chessack","8","0","1","3 November 2001"," An adorable addition to the Pixar repertoire
","Monsters Inc. follows in the footsteps of its predecessors in being an extremely charming movie that is fun for the whole family. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would recommend it to both children and adults. Pixar has had many great hits in the past, the most shining examples being the Toy Story movies. Monsters Inc. is clearly designed to be similar to those movies, and to appeal to the same crowd that they did -- and for the most part, it succeeds.<br/><br/>The performances (vocal) by Billy Crystal and John Goodman are excellent, as one would expect. There are a few other recognizable voices that make cameos as well (can you figure out who plays the Abominable Snow man? It took me a few minutes). The animation is, of course, first rate (if you get a chance, perhaps on a second viewing, which this movie is worth, pay attention to the way Mike's one eye shows so much expression, and to how the fur movies on Sully with the breeze).<br/><br/>This movie isn't quite as good as Toy Story, though. Where it lags behind its predecessors is that the story is a bit, well... obvious, once you get the feel for it, and it is slightly slow in the beginning. The ending is exciting, however, and that makes up for the slow start. The one real disappointment (if you can call it that, since it is minor) is that the movie doesn't have very many interesting supporting characters. Boo, Sully, and Mike are the main stars, but other than one or two slimy villain-types, there really aren't many other interesting characters in the movie. And that's a shame, since the monster world certainly could have given us plenty of nifty personalities.<br/><br/>That said, Monsters Inc. was fun, and gives the viewer much to laugh at, and maybe even a thing or two to sniffle at along the way. Boo, the little human girl, was absolutely precious -- I wanted to take her home with me. I recommend this one to children of all ages -- especially those of us over the hill.<br/><br/>My score: 8/10"
"boris-26","Null","0","1","7 November 2001"," It's why we go to movies, to be entertained!
","Within ten minutes into MONSTERS, INC, you know you are in for a fun packed ride.  The town of Montropolis is powered by the energy found in children's screams.  It's up to Monsters Inc (the local power company- what ConEd is to Manhattan) to keep the city packed with screams.  It's has the wacked logic of a Gary Larson ""Far Side"" cartoon come to life.  What I loved are the amazing details- the purring snakes in Celia's hair, the various shaped monsters that populate the town, the amazing facial expressions of Boo, the human child that wanders into Montropolis.   There is almost no preachy moral to the story, no real social message, just 90 minutes of endless fun (oh, and the fate that awaits the bad monster, I think I broke blood vessels laughing too hard!)"
"Scottie-3","6","0","1","7 November 2001"," Its heart outshines its technical achievements... as it should
","""Monsters, Inc"" is essentially about embracing your fears, and<br/><br/>learning to laugh at them. A very timely message, don't you think?<br/><br/>It's true that the little girl is absolutely adorable (but not<br/><br/>saccharine), but the heart of the film is the growing relationship<br/><br/>between Sully (big furry blue monster, voice by John Goodman)<br/><br/>and this pre-verbal little girl he calls ""Boo."" At first, she's sort of a<br/><br/>pet that he's apprehensive about. Predictably, she becomes much,<br/><br/>much more to him. Sully learns to be a father.<br/><br/>This movie made me cry. And laugh. It does have some lagging<br/><br/>moments, and isn't quite on par with ""A Bug's Life"" or ""Toy Story 2,""<br/><br/>but it's darned good. (I've never been a big fan of the original ""Toy<br/><br/>Story,"" which seemed more concerned with ""gee-whiz-look-what-we-can-do-with-computers,"" rather than story<br/><br/>and character, at which the subsequent Pixar films have excelled.)<br/><br/>Technically, it's years ahead of ""Shrek,"" which, in my opinion,<br/><br/>offered nothing beyond lifelike-looking characters (who<br/><br/>nevertheless do not move in a lifelike fashion) and a dash of hip<br/><br/>cynicism. Watch this movie and notice that the characters move in<br/><br/>a completely convincing way, that fur and hair behave as they do in<br/><br/>life, but that the movie does not call attention to it. ""Monsters, Inc.""<br/><br/>is concerned with more important things."

","Being a big fan of these type of animation movies such as TOY STORY, A BUG'S LIFE and SHREK, I had high expectations for MONSTERS INC. They were met. Not only are the computer graphics impressive, but the story is original and entertaining with moments of great action, good comedy, and even some genuinely sad parts.<br/><br/>The voice-over chemistry between John Goodman and Billy Crystal is excellent. Like Eddie Murphy in SHREK, Billy Crystal was hilarious and definitely stole the show. Crystal seems to be ideal for voice-over work. Both the lead voices are perfect for their respective roles, and I thought James Coburn was also perfect for his character, Henry J. Waternoose.<br/><br/>I loved the premise of the film. The idea of monsters going off to their jobs of scaring children to power their city is at the same time original and vaguely familiar. Boo is one of the most adorable characters I've seen in a long time (and Mary Gibbs, the young lady who does the voice of Boo, is equally adorable), and I LOVED the relationship which was developed between Boo and Sully (Goodman).<br/><br/>This movie is everything an animated movie should be. It and Shrek are two of my all-time favorite animated movies, and it's hard for me to choose a favorite between the two (which is interesting, since I'm sure one of the two will win the first Oscar for an animated film this year).

","Exciting, humorous, longing, tension-filled, cute... Pixar's new ""Monsters Inc."" covers an enormous range of emotions in the course of its hour-and-a-half running time.  Frankly, it feels quite a bit longer than that -- the movie absolutely draws you in.<br/><br/>John Sullivan (""Sully"" - voiced by John Goodman) and Mike Koslowski (voiced by, of all people, Billy Crystal!) are the top ""scaring"" team at Monsters Inc. -- a major company in another dimension, where the society is powered by the energy contained in kids' screams.  To ensure that there is power to run Monstropolis' everyday society, the Monsters need to keep scaring kids and getting those screams -- ""We scare because we care"" is the corporate slogan, showing that M.I. is the driving force behind that dimension's economy and society.<br/><br/>Close behind Sully and Mike, though, is the treacherous Randall (voiced by Steve Buscemi), a multi-limbed chameleon-like monster with a scheme to top Sully and Mike and keep the company in the black.  Naturally, things start to go wrong when a human child from the other side manages to get into the Monster's dimensions... particularly since common knowledge holds that kids are actually toxic and poisonous to monsters!<br/><br/>You'll gasp in awe, you'll be convulsed with laughter, and you'll smile sadly at the amazing visions, witty humor, and brilliant storyline.  I cannot recommend this film enough; I'd go see it multiple times at full price in the theaters.<br/><br/>(This is, of course, helped by the ""introductory"" animation -- a hilarious piece called ""For the Birds"".  *grin*)<br/><br/>P.S. - my guess is that Pixar put together their standard run of ""bloopers"" for the film, to be run during the credits, but are holding the new credits back a month or so to get people to come and see the film again during the Christmas season.  I'm pretty certain I will!"

Monster's Inc. is a fantastic effort from Pixar, one the features spectacular animation, great humor, and most importantly, a heart of gold. Rarely do any<br/><br/>family films hit such an emotional note as beautiful as Monsters Inc.'s final line. Even after leaving, just simply thinking about it gave me a familiar lump in my throat and watery eyes. Billy Crystal and John Goodman are perfect. Enough<br/><br/>said. The best character in the entire movie is that of Boo, the child. She steals every scene she's in, even topping the two leads. Her big eyes and sweet voice just melts my heart. This movie, in my opinion, is superior to Shrek, in many ways. While Shrek was initially funny, the jokes got old. One thing I know about Monsters Inc. is that many jokes flew by so quickly, that a second viewing is essential to get it all in. After viewing Shrek for the second time, I realize that the jokes were only funny once. Honestly, go see Monsters Inc., with kids in tow or not. This one is a charmer for all ages and a healthy break from the usual summer and fall fare. 10/10"
"erichvm","8","0","1","5 November 2001"," Genuine Warmth and Fun
","The folks at Pixar have done it again, showing that they are in touch with both their inner children and real ones.  Monsters, Inc. has all the usual eye-candy; although the Toy Story films as well as A Bug's Life have made it more difficult to marvel at what's becoming an expected level of perfection, one must only consider Sully's fur, which ripples and sways in the wind (and from his own snoring) with complete realism.  The story is typical Disney, but any hokiness is avoided by the genuine warmth of the attachment between Sully and Boo, the human toddler who has accidentally crossed over into the universe of monsters hidden behind the closet door.  Goodman's characterization matches well with Pixar's visualization, creating a lovable lug, and Boo is simply irresistible, notably her baby-talk.  The only real weak link is Billy Crystal's sidekick Mike.  There seems little reason for the character, frankly.  He just gets to be the cranky, manic pal of the hero, the annoying but good-at-heart fast talker.  It's not that Crystal does a bad job, but the character's a little adrift.  The movie also acts as a kind of allegory about our reliance on power sources that are rooted in others' suffering (eg., oil), but one needn't pay THAT much attention!  You REALLY WILL laugh and cry at this one.  And you'll leave feeling better about everything.  Trust me."
"asticht","Null","0","1","5 November 2001"," Brilliant and unexpected
","Monsters Inc. is without a doubt a well conceived movie.  The writing was very good and the storyline, contrary to what one professional reviewer from CNN.com said, does NOT drag in the middle.  If anyone has seen the early trailer of this movie, it doesn't give justice at all to the movie.  John Goodmans portrayal of the big blue monster Sully is warm, and touching. His interaction with the little girl he names Boo is absolutely delightful. There are actually several scenes where some really heartwarming and tear-jerking things happen. This is very surprising considering Disney hasn't really released a tear-jerker since the Lion King in 1994. Unfortunately Billy Crystals character named Mike while very much in character for him is not nearly as visible in the picture as many movie goers would like.  Although he is a main character, his humor is very subdued and he is not as sarcastically funny as he is capable of. Even though John Ratzenbergers (Cliff Clavin from Cheers) role is a small one, his character Yeti is very comical and provides a few moments of comic relief during a particularly tense section of the movie.<br/><br/>The animation however is far more brilliant than Disney/Pixar's previous CGI releases Toy Story, A Bugs Life, and Toy Story II.  The environments created for the characters is very cartoon-like in many respects, unlike the phenomenal realistic worlds created in this Summers hit Shrek.  The animation is not as complex as Shrek was, but it is very obvious just looking at Sullys heavy fur coat to see the advances computer animation has taken since Jurassic Park rewrote the book on computer effects in 1993. All in all this movie is more geared to kids in the content of the dialogue. Parents will find the movie enjoyable, but don't expect as much sarcastic wit and sexual inuendos as Shrek contained as this is a Disney movie after all.  I recommend seeing this movie, you'll get a real kick out of the animated short film Pixar created for this release that precedes the movie called ""For the Birds"".  It didn't hurt to have Lucasfilm release it's first trailer for Star Wars Episode II with this movie either."
"lynxspyder","10","0","1","5 November 2001"," Another animated film in the tradition of Toy Story that gets it right.
","Monsters, Inc. is a delightful film about two employees, Sully and Mike, who work for the Monstropolis' power plant after which the film is titled. While the film isn't as knee-slappingly funny as others in genre (for example, I didn't think it showed as much humor as Toy Story), it is certainly full of elements that will please adults and children alike. Younger children will likely not quite understand the business of Monsters, Inc. and the nature of the jobs the monsters do. My 4-year-old, for example, didn't quite grasp the whole concept of what the company Monsters, Inc. was all about. She still enjoyed the animated characters and the slapstick humor, however.<br/><br/>One of the things that sets Monsters, Inc. apart from other such films is that its plot is a bit more involved than most. The twist at the end involving the company conspiracy (yes, the plot is that involved) is surprising even to adult viewers and part of the reason that adults will really like the film.<br/><br/>What really makes the film work, however, is not the plot and the humor, but the main characters themselves. You can't help but like Sully and thus have a vested interest in the events that affect him. John Goodman is the perfect voice for the giant, furry monster who, while being the company's leading scarer, is also the kindest and most selfless character. Billy Crystal is hilarious as Sully's sidekick, and Steve Buscemi appropriately voices the villain Boggs. I also couldn't help but like James Coburn as the company CEO and former mentor to Sully. It's interesting to me how the appearance of the animated Waternoose actually suggests Coburn without looking a thing like him (Waternoose, after all, is a multi-eyed, multi-legged, crablike creature). And Boo? What can you say about Boo? She does all of the things that one expects a tiny child to do, and it's no wonder that Sully is unable to resist her charms. You find yourself laughing at Boo just being a little girl.<br/><br/>Monsters, Inc. is the best films I've seen all year. It's one of the few films that I could sit back and just plain enjoy."

Instead of being a series of gags held together by a loose story line (Shrek), this is a wonderful tale of friendship and the value of open minds with great gags to accentuate the smiles.<br/><br/>Billy Crystal and John Goodman are perfectly cast as the monsters who are thrust into the task of protecting an innocent child from the CDF (Child Detection Force) after she accidently makes her way into the world of monsters.<br/><br/>You'll laugh, you'll smile, and sometimes you'll wish you could hear the movie over the audience's laughter.

","Shrek was put together excellently in every aspect.  Visually, Monsters Inc. is also very stunning.  While I was watching it, I couldn't help but notice the completely realistic fur on Sully.  But that's the problem, the movie didn't really grab my interest...if I'm staring at something like camera angles, lighting or computer effects, the chances are that it's not utterly brilliant and superb.  I do have to admit though that I had laughs throughout the movie (not as much as there was in Shrek) and I also couldn't help myself to adoring the little girl ""Boo"".  When you're adoring a little computer generated kid, it may be lame, but at least you know that the people at Pixar did a pretty good job putting it together.  And being a woman (estrogen-filled), there's also a lot of cute things that you just can't stop saying ""awwww"" too or shedding a tear.<br/><br/>The one thing I really noticed though was that my 4-year-old nephew was laughing to death and I was not.  As oppose to Shrek where I was laughing to death and he was not.  Do you see the difference in comedy?<br/><br/>

Were it not for the gags, and other good laughs in the prior three I'd say Monsters was better.<br/><br/>
In terms of the animation - the animation is awesome, quite smooth and very subtle.  For lack of a better word the animation becomes almost non-existant.

In their world, the screams of small children create the power that runs the city--and nobody's better at scaring kids than Sulley.  He does a dangerous job (it's widely known that children are toxic), and he does it with pride.<br/><br/>Of course, in every workplace there's an office backstabber, and Monsters, Inc. has its own resident workplace bully in the person (monster?) of Randall, the second-best scarer in the factory.

"tombrazelton","10","0","1","3 November 2001"," Better Than ""Shrek""
","A lot of reviewers have been comparing this movie to this year's earlier digitally animated ""Shrek"". If they're not using that movie as the yard stick, then they're comparing it to previous Pixar efforts ""Toy Story 1 & 2"" and ""A Bug's Life"".<br/><br/>Personally, I think ""Monsters, Inc."" is beyond compare and is a strong enough movie to stand on it's own 5 legs.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie WAY more than ""Shrek"". ""Monsters, Inc."" has characters you care about and it's loaded to the hilt with great jokes for both kids and adults. Although ""Shrek"" was a good film, I walked away from it feeling like it was trying to be all things to all people and it didn't satisfy as thouroughly as this film.<br/><br/>""Monsters, Inc."" knows it's audience and respects them with it's clever premise - monsters live in another universe powered by the ""Scream Energy"" they collect from hopping out of kids closets and scaring the bejesus out of them. But in the end, we learn a laugh is more powerful than a scream. Great lesson and very inventive!<br/><br/>All of the characters that inhabit Monstropolis come in a great variety of shapes, colors and personalities. You can tell the animators had a lot of fun creating them. The voice over work of Billy Crystal and John Goodman was spot-on. They have excellent chemistry and are a treat to listen to.<br/><br/>The action elements of the film are not to be missed. The last 30 minutes are filled with an exciting chase set within jaw-dropping surroundings. The final moment is a wonderful, touching moment that plays magnificently with the special relationship Goodman's big, blue Sully has with the 3 year old girl ""Boo"" who he has taken under her wing.<br/><br/>""Monsters, Inc."" is a very effective movie for fans on all levels."
"Geordie-4","9","0","1","5 November 2001"," Pretty entertaining
","Well, this film is not quite Toy Story.  I found it very entertaining, but it seems odd that Monsters, Inc. is based on how many screams can be extracted from kids owing to their fear but that they turn out to be harmless.  Well, maybe this is not a problem.  But something nagged at me. Anyone else?  Well, apart from this I found it v. entertaining. <br/><br/>
John Goodman voices Sully, the best scarer in town and Billy Crystal does his best friend and partner, Mike Mozkowski.  They have been told that kids are dangerous, but when a kid escapes during a scare, Sulley learns they aren't.  Of course he has to keep the kid under wraps in order to avoid panicking the city.  This has some overtones that might disturb folks in the wake of Sept. 11.  So Sulley learns of a plot by his rival, Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) to trap a kid and keep them in Monstropolis so that there will never be an energy crisis.  Boo, the kids that Sulley ends up with is caught in the middle of this and Mike and Sulley want to save her from the nefarious Boggs and the CEO of Monsters Inc.  Henry J. Waternoose (James Coburn), who is incahoots on this plan with Boggs.  Sulley and Mike manage to get Boo home and avoid capture by Boggs.  <br/><br/>I was sitting too near the front of the theater to be able to honestly appraise the look of the film.  I still have a crick in my neck from looking up.  But it looked fairly dynamic and alive.  I thought John Goodman was terrific in endowing his character with a lot of kindness and gentleness. Billy Crystal's voice I hardly recognized, but he was great too.  There was great variety in the nature of the monsters.  Very cute.  I didn't find the story quite as compelling, perhaps for the reason I mentioned at the beginning of this review.  But nevertheless, this is still quite a lot of fun.  The look, the sound, the attention to detail, the sound, it's all there.  Another strong Pixar flic."

"JehuDVD","8","0","1","26 October 2001"," The CU Film Critic takes on ""Monsters, Inc.""
","Whether you love or hate what's been making its way out of Walt Disney Studios for the past four years or so, one thing's for sure.  Walt's gotta be rolling around in his cryogenic chamber.<br/><br/>Since `The Lion King,' with the exception of the `Toy Story' films, Disney's animated films have been going downhill in a hurry, on a slippery slope to the pit where we find such cartoon masterpieces as `Rock-a-Doodle' and `The Secret of Nimh 2: Timmy to the Rescue.'<br/><br/>That said, it would be nice for the folks at Disney to bring back the animated musical as we know it before Dreamworks' Jeffrey Katzenberg drops them with the film industry equivalent of a Stone Cold Stunner.<br/><br/>THAT said, the newest computer-animated film by the geniuses at Disney/Pixar is the most fun I've had at the theatre since last spring.  `Monsters, Inc.' is a tale of blue-collar workers who just happen to be blessed with such distinguishing characteristics as purple fur, antennae, horns, etc.<br/><br/>Apparently, in the world of monsters (which may very well be Greeley, judging from various hints we're given), electrical power is all driven by one source- the screams of small children.  If you've spent any time in a church-sponsored preschool, this concept won't come as a big surprise.  Of course, in order to harness this power, myriad creatures are employed at Monsters, Incorporated, to enter our world through childrens' closet doors and collect these shrieks of terror to be put to use at the power plant.<br/><br/>As my fourteen year-old sister would say, `How cool is that?'<br/><br/>We get the voice of John `Walter' Goodman as James P. Sullivan (Sully, for short), an enthusiastic ogre of sorts with blue fur, a big smile, and horns. Imagine Bigfoot after two weeks at Wonka's chocolate factory, and you've got a pretty good idea.<br/><br/>Sully is the perpetual Employee of the Month at Monsters, Inc., spending all his free time boning up on job skills, and constantly breaking `scare records' with his patented system.  His best friend and manager is Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a one-eyed, green gumdrop with harms and legs. Wazowski is the monster equivalent of George from `Seinfeld,' slightly neurotic but goofy enough to be fun.<br/><br/>When the two buddies inadvertently let a child into the monster world, catastrophe ensues.  Children, of course, are considered toxic to monsters, making the job of scream collectors even more hazardous.  This attracts the attention of the scheming villain Randall, voiced by none other than the devil himself, Steve Buscemi.<br/><br/>Cartoons, computer-generated or not, don't get much better than this. Cartoons are all about fun, and you won't have more fun at any other movie this fall.  It's great.  The monsters' names are Mike, George, and the like. The animation is top-notch.  Shrek has nothing on this film.  I sat hypnotized for a good eight minutes of the movie, captivated by the incredible detail what was given to various clumps of blue fur.  A guest appearance by the Abominable Snowman made me roll out of my chair (upon presenting his guests with yellow sno-cones, he reassures them, `they're lemon.').<br/><br/>Also, this is Disney, so keep an eye out for cameos by characters from other films.  I counted three.  See if you can do me one better.  `Monsters, Inc.' may not have been part of Walt Disney's vision, but I get the feeling he at least would have approved.  Want one more reason to go see this movie? Five words.  `Star Wars Episode II Trailer.'<br/><br/>It's high time a family movie makes its way to the top.  I'm gonna endorse this one with an `A.'"

The fur on the big guy Sulley has to be seen to be believed. I still like 'A Bug's Life' more than this movie. Maybe because it was the ultra bright colours in 'A Bug's Life.

","That about summed it up for me. The movie's plot moves away from the childish simplicity of the Toy Story movies, and as such there isn't as much room for heart and charm. The plot is more complicated than either Toy Story, so there's not as much room for freedom in having the characters mess around from point A to point B; everything feels a bit rushed.<br/><br/>The CG was, as expected, stunning (especially the ""door room"" towards the end... You'll see what I mean.) I got a weird feeling watching this movie, like Pixar was trying to force John Goodman and Billy Crystal to have the same sort of Woody/Buzz chemistry that Tim Allen and Tom Hanks have, but it just falls short somehow.<br/><br/>Highlights of the film include the Star Wars: Episode II trailer shown beforehand (which was also good, but not great), the short film ""for the birds"" which also ran before the movie, and some of the more incredible visual effects... But that's it.<br/><br/>Matinee(sp) viewing if you must see it now, otherwise I'd recommend renting."

But while Shrek revolved around gross-out humor Monster's Inc. had slapstick, stand-up, cultural, and ironic humor that I thought made it a more real and substantial feel.

","'Monsters Inc.' is one of the computer-animated successors to the brilliant 'Toy Story'. It lives up to the tradition of brilliant animated films both kids and adults can enjoy. It's even better than 'Shrek', and 'Shrek' was pretty damn good!<br/><br/>The story follows Sully (voiced by John Goodman), a giant, furry monster, and his friend Mike Wazowski(Billy Crystal), a green eyeball with limbs. They're from 'Monstropolis', a city of monsters in another dimension and their job is to collect 'scream energy' by, you guessed it, coming out of closets (which, as we know from 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', are interdimensional portals) and making kids scream. However, there's trouble at work (kids are getting too hard to scare, rivalry with another monster) and everything really starts falling to pieces when a little toddler comes through a door into Monstropolis. Monsters are terrified of kids, whom they regard as toxic. Which is reasonable enough.<br/><br/>The animation is gorgious, it's very funny (on different levels), fast-paced and not too sentimental either.

Ever since Abbott and Costello there have been teams with a big straight-man problem fixer and a short, annoying but lovable troublemaker who talks too much. It doesn't work nearly as well here as in ""Ice Age"", although it comes nowhere as low as Jar Jar Binks territory (""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"").<br/><br/>Despite all that, and the sort of generic plotting you expect in kids films nowadays (if you're over 30, aren't Disney flicks all starting to look alike to you?), I enjoyed it and can recommend it also to adults.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Kids (and their parents will have fun, too)<br/><br/>-- Comedy lovers who've already seen ""Toy Story"" or ""Antz"",<br/><br/>and don't mind seeing a kids film from time to time.<br/><br/>I'll give ""Monsters, Inc."" a 7 out of 10."

","Although I have always been a fan of the 'classic' children's movies (E.T., The Lion King, etc.), I had never seen one of the newer animated movies. But I'll definitely go and see more of them now!!<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie, had quite a few laughs (I might even say more than I did watching any other movie lately!) and i can certainly recommended it to anyone, young or old, simply because it has everything you could wish for in a movie: hilarious jokes, touching scenes, nice music, nice characters to get attached to, and so on.<br/><br/>And.. don't leave the theater when the credits begin to fill the screen! there's more to come!!!!"

","Very funny movie and easily the best yet of all computer animated flix. Excellent, well rounded characters, great dialogue, excellent plot twists and top notch animation round out all of this movies strong points. Weak points? Well, none really, maybe a couple slow(ish) parts but overall it's an entertaining ride from start to finish. Good entertainment for the entire family."

","Silly Funny as terrific this movie gives kids a knowing of that there's monsters but their good so that why their not as afraid as kids usually are. The see something like Buffy the vampire slayer or goosebumps or are you afraid of the dark and kids get freaked.  My little cousin can handle watching surgery's on T.V. with me.  but couldn't handle seeing Are you Afraid of the dark it scared her so bad.  Now she's older and can handle but other may not.  This movie brought what no movie really has ever done bring two cute monsters to the big screen and not to mention their friends.  John Goodman was so good i'm a fan and he does great at cartoons.  Billy crystal was actually good at playing Mike he made you laugh and Sulli(john goodman) brought those two characters as best friends alive on the screen so funny and so good you have to go see this if you haven't even if you have go see it again."

It wanted to get too involved in a plot...The whole conspiracy thing with Randall and Waternoose was way over kids heads, and really got silly trying to develop.  I do also feel the movie played way too long, and could have ended about 15 minutes sooner than it did.  <br/><br/>Still a cute, colorful, vibrant film...excellent performances by Goodman and Crystal as well Tilly and Buscemi....Boo was too too cute<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

"MichaelM24","Null","0","1","11 March 2002"," a full-filled family movie
","The majority of so-called ""family"" or ""kids movies"" recently have been full of lame-brained ""jokes"" such as bathroom humor and gross-out stuff. In MONSTERS, INC., we have a terrific family comedy that kids and parents alike can enjoy, with not a single gross-out joke or spot of bathroom humor to be seen. Kids will like the comic situations, and parents will get some of the more grown-up jokes, but both will delight in a fun-filled adventure about monsters and the world they in. Billy Crystal and John Goodman are spot-on with their vocal talents, with Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi, and veteran James Coburn rounding out the supporting cast. It all moves at a pretty good pace and has good honest laughs scattered throughout the story. One moment may be a tad scary for real little kids (the scene where Buscemi's Randall is threatening to physically extract Boo's screams from her), but the film is pretty light the rest of the time, with everything building up to a fun, thrilling climax involving the millions of closet doors the monsters use to enter the real world. A good-spirited kids movie that the whole family can enjoy."
"jean_paul_arends","Null","0","1","8 March 2002"," Between Shrek and Monsters inc.
","Let's make a comparison between two mayor animated feature length movies: Shrek and Monsters inc. With Shrek Dreamworks proved that they could make an hilarious comedy (whether you like the voice casting and fart jokes or not) which looked stunning in the visuals. One thing lacked though, something that the guys at Pixar are well known for: Articulation. And i don't mean only facial articulation, i also mean: with the body-movement While Shrek tries to copy human-like poses with waving arms, straightening your hair etc, Monsters inc. shows real animation-like poses, reminiscent of two dimensional cartoons like Tom and Jerry. (they even skip frames to make characters move even faster then normal) In the documentary that is included on the dvd the guys at dreamwork brag about making Fiona less humanlike in her environment otherwise she stands out to much. What they mean is: We couldn't do any better. I'm not bashing Shrek. No, i liked Shrek. A lot. I thought Pixar couldn't top this one. But then i saw Monsters inc that blew me away. Shrek may have a more adult approach that works really well. But storywise they made a few mistakes. I think i'm quoting somebody by saying: It is not okay to judge somebody by appearance but they do make jokes about size. All in all without being too nittpicky, a highly enjoyable movie. Monsters inc. has a cute story to tell and some people who commented about it being too tame should consider this: It's much easier to go for a cheap laugh then to tell a story that could move you without it being cruel or rude. Shrek aims for parody and thus is ment for an older audience (but kids will like it as well, maybe on a slightly different level) Shrek has some awesome photorealistic settings but rather pathetic looking backgrounds. The guys start bragging again about 3 million different leaves that move on trees independently but it's hardly noticable. Pixar choose a much brighter color palette giving it a more cartoon-feel. And what about characters? Monsters inc. has plenty: The animation on Randall is superb. Boo is really cute. While shrek has a beautiful animated princess, Pixar goes overboard Mike Wakowski. While not the funniest character in the movie, his animation is nearly flawless. (And don't get me started on Sulley ) Love the snowman as well. And the nerdy monster with the braces. The little monster that shouts: ""Mike Wakowski"". Shrek doesn't top Monsters inc. Just wait untill you see the spectacular doorchase-scene. Let's be honest people. Shrek was a pretty damn good movie but didn't have so much settings and should be considered a well-done-parody on disney animations (while still beeing a story on it's own). Job well done. Monsters inc wasn't as hilarious as Toy Story but did tell a touching story. (and yes you could guess the ending after 20 minutes, But before you get to that point the story has taken different directions that make it worthwhile) Nonetheless:  Animation-wise i'd prefer Pixar because they obviously know how to make a proper animated flick. But i'm still curious enough to see what dreamworks is up too. Both companies are both improving their work to ""stay in the race"". Dreamworks is still learning from each experience. I dunno, i kinda like it. Makes it worthwhile to go to the cinema. And please let's just forget that piece of crap: Final Fantasy."

","*May contain spoilers* *May contain spoilers*<br/><br/>The idea of the film is nothing short of brilliant. The monsters of our childhood do exist. Only they exist because they need to collect the screams of the children so Monsters' city will have enough electricity supply. And technically it is flawless. Pixar has come long way from its first computer animated film. It succeed each time to go a step further and this is no exception. However the technical achievement get lost in a story which is as thin as ice and also suffer from the fact that Disney had to put its usual inserted messages(this time: friends are forever and laugher is stronger than scream). Dream Works' Shrek has proven that an animated film can be wild and sarcastic. Monsters Inc. stays however on the safe side and as always with Disney very politically correct. And that is a shame because what could have been a wild film turn out to be only a cute one. Yes I enjoyed it and laughed from it but I wish it was less politically correct(The ending leave no question in your mind that we are heading for a sequel). Pixar should think of breaking away from Disney. It will only do them good and give them the opportunity to do what they really want.<br/><br/>P.S. Do not miss what is shown before Monsters Inc. A short film named ""For the Birds"". Simply hilarious. It proves that with the right thing Pixar can do even better."

","The one-two punch of Disney/Pixar delivers another touching, yet side-splitting film that can be enjoyed by adults and kids alike.<br/><br/>
The Monsters, Inc. industry, in which monsters scare kids and use their screams as energy to fuel the town, runs like any other busy corporation. There's voice mail, time cards, even a scary secretary, who is the bane of green eyeball Mike (in a hysterical voice performance by Billy Crystal). Life is going swimmingly until the scariest monster of all, Sully (John Goodman, also outstanding) discovers that a little girl has snuck into a world where she doesn't belong. Boo turns his world upside down!<br/><br/>The animation is awesome, and funny characters such as Lydia, the scary receptionist and especially the abominable snowman light up the screen. I could find nothing objectionable, and even if you don't have kids there is enough funny lines and touching moments to entertain anyone. I recommend it!"
"fepp","10","0","1","4 March 2002"," Wonderful animated movie!
","This movie is just plain wonderful! Incredibly funny, told with a great tempo and with a lot of humour.  No dead moments at all!  The story is based on a single assumptions, that monsters in the closet are real, and that they scare little kids in order to get energy to power their city.  From this assumption, a wonderful story about a big threat to this lifestyle and kids everywhere is spun. <br/><br/>On the visual nitpicking side, the computer animations are better than earlier attempts like Toy Story, but they are still somewhat deficient when it comes to humans. The hair on the main character Sulley is superb, and there is a wonderful sleighride scene with swirling snow that is exquisite! However, the humans are still doll-like, and the complexity of human hair has not been handled.  Most of the monsters look like slightly soft rubber, which is a bit disappointing... for some reason, it does not look quite right (except for the furry monsters).<br/><br/>But the movie does not depend on the computer generated graphics to entertain, it would have been just as much fun if it had been handdrawn the old way.  Computer graphics allow for more dramatic pans and roller-coaster rides, and are good enough not to detract from the action, which is quality enough. <br/><br/>Here in Sweden, there was a short movie about birds before the main movie, which was just wonderfully hilarious.  It would be very nice to see more of that kind; little animated movies are definitely fun before the main course!"

"phiggins","Null","0","1","20 February 2002"," Travels in hyper-reality (and a spoiler warning).
","There are moments in this film that will make any sane person gasp in awe. The computer graphics (which, according to one IMDB reviewer, require ""no talent"" to create) are astounding.  Certain shots (close-ups of lights, for example, or the entire scene in the snow) are both incredibly ""real-looking"" while simultaneously ""artificial"".  The main character's fur is worth the price of admission in itself: it is a marvellous feat of the graphic arts. So real that you want to reach out and touch its wispy, floaty, dreamy depths.  The climax, involving millions of doors to the ""real"" world, is simply fantastic - both in its imaginative qualities and its emotional impact.  Of course, this being the fourth instalment in Pixar's travels in hyper-reality, the novelty has worn off slightly.  Never again will we feel that virginal buzz (geddit?) of ""Toy Story"" with its remarkable, shiny, tactile, other-worldly glow.  No computer-animated (a misnomer, by the way: these films are animated by humans not computers) movie after that can ever have the same effect.  Which does not mean that ""MI"" is a disappointment. Far from it: after the - yes - disappointing ""Bug's Life"" and the strangely forgettable ""TS2"" this is a definite return to form.  ""MI"" tells the story of Sully and his pal who work for ""Monsters Inc"", scaring kids to use their screams as a source of power for their world.  Which is a pretty cool idea, really.  There are no prizes for originality when it comes to the rest of the story, I'm afraid, but it doesn't matter, because the movie is so gag-packed, so enjoyable, so light and refreshing and entertaining and innocent and clever and spectacular that if it doesn't win the Osc*r for best animated feature then there ain't no justice.  Oh, and if ""Shrek"" wins, then there will be serious trouble.  It's interesting to compare the two, in fact: ""Shrek"" is a clever-clever, movie-references-packed, up-to-the-minute gag-fest that, in a few years' time, will appear hopelessly dated.  ""MI"" is a simple, beautiful, intelligent, witty and fast-paced kids' adventure that will look fresh and inventive when it appears on TV every Christmas for ever.  And there, my friends, you have it. In an age where Hollywood usually means crass ineptitude, it's heart-warming indeed to see that someone out there is still making great movies for kids of all ages.  If ""Monsters Inc."" were a live-action or ""traditionally"" animated movie it would be just as good.  And that is its real strength: it relies not on great visuals (though they are great) but such unfashionable qualities as intelligence, wit, economy, imagination and inventiveness."

","Monsters Inc. is a very well produced kid's animation which can be watched by almost ""all the family"" - some elderly relatives may get confused by the pace of it all, but that's their fault.<br/><br/>The movie breathes quality and I have no doubt it will ascend to same classic status as other Walt Disney pictures such as ""Snow White"" or ""101 Dalmatians"". Captivating moments abound, the entire film is *very* well produced, and the voice acting is superb. ""Shrek"" or ""Toy Story"", while looking gorgeous, still have a computer animated feel to them - not so with Monsters Inc.<br/><br/>The film's universal appeal and top film status is also due to the quality of animation, the original ideas in the story - like the doors or the CDA (Child Detection Agency) - and just the sheer fun ness of the characters and the vast backdrop of the Monsters' metropolis. The director's attention to detail and the film's novel and often hilarious concepts, suck you into the Monsters' world and enthral.<br/><br/>If you're an adult, Monsters Inc. probably isn't as funny as ""Shrek"", but kids will get more laughs. Hopefully, if there is a sequel, some more adult geared jokes could be chucked in.<br/><br/>Overall, Monsters Inc. is a tremendous film which will undoubtedly stand the test of time."

","Perhaps I've seen too many 'twist' movies lately, but I really was expecting to see a monster called 'Zinc' as a sort of play on words. I couldn't really understand why else would they have chosen such a rubbish title! I mean, how many kids are going to understand it? How about: 'Mum, there's a monster in my closet' ? OK, not too great, but Monsters Inc? There wasn't even a scary squid to squirt a bit of this famous 'inc'. Overall, I think the film is good, but, save for a few bits of genius, it's not in the same league as the 2 Toy Story movies, and is definitely not as good as 'Shrek' which was the best animation movie since Buzz Lightyear and Co. (Now, I've started doing it. It could have been 'Monsters.Com'. Anything's better than inkless 'inc'). The great bits are Billy Crystal's 'eye', which confirms that he is best suited to hiding his body from us; the very original concept of the 'monsters-eye view'; and the chase on the doors, which I think is probably the best bit of any animated movie I've ever seen. It's the meat and veg of the film which I found a bit wanting. A sub-plot was craved to take the heat out of the little girl's interference with the monster world. There seemed to be a lot more mileage to be had from the doorways to different worlds, but I expect we'll get that in 'MI 2' Oh no, they can't use that title. 7 out of 10, but overrated, I'm afraid."

","First, let me just say that it is a very, very good and funny movie, but I will come back to its many good points. I have to say that as a Pixar / Disney movie it lacked something from the pervious Toy Stories, but at first I could not quite put my finger on the problem. However after reviewing other digital movie I now can see the main problem. Lets start with Titan A.E. digital quality mostly excellent, however no realism in most scenes, other then the people which often seemed cartoonish. Final Fantasy, very, very good graphics the people very real, although the surrounding environment, was the Fantasy. Now Shrek not commenting on the story line, the environment from the grass to the buildings were just perfect, and put the unreal characters in a setting which MADE them real, so we felt that the film was real. Toy Story 1 & 2, again especially in the 2nd the environment was perfect, also because it was in a place which we all recognises (an average city) it made everything seem real. Now finally Monsters Inc, the graphics were another step up from Toy Story 2, however all the realism was gone. This was because of where the film was set, take the scene where Sulley and Wazowski are walking down the street, on the way they pass funny cars, a Jelly Monster, and a giant and you feel that the realism we got in Toy Story is lost. Having said that the world they created was very funny, and for a change you could feel in the graphics Disney's involvement, leading to many cartoonish environments, with a Pixar's touch. Having said all that this film was brilliant, and the graphics on the little girl Â‘Boo' we excellent. I could comment on the fact that the story line is very predicable, but it's aimed at kids and so is very easy for them to understand. As I said earlier it is a very funny movie, with a lot more comedy then Toy Story had. All the characters have certain funny quirks and mannerisms, which adds to the laughs. Also I have to say that although John Goodman did a very good job as Sulley, for me Billy Crystal made the movie his own, as the voice of Wazowski bringing more then an extra dimension to the character. Although I have to say I didn't for some reason connect to the characters as I did with Toy Story, but that could just be me. Another thing that I have to point out is the ending, well after the ending, like Toy Story 2 there's funny outtakes, but then there more and takes credits to another level. I would recommend people to go and see the movie just to see the end, and was still sitting even when the screen went black waiting for more. Well to wrap up this review this film has style, great humour, a fine plot for kids, great graphics and more, yes go and see it."

And guess where they get it from? Children's screams! The scariest monsters in Monsters Inc. go through doors to children's rooms, and scare them. Their agents collect the electricity from their screams. But the monsters are just as scared of the children as the children are of them! If a child's sock is on a monster's back, it's a 2319 and the CDA (Child Detection Agency) comes and blows up the sock! The top scarer at Monsters Inc. is James P. Sullivan, aka Sulley. He's a big cuddly monster that for some reason children find scary. The second scariest monster is Randall. Randall is resentful of Sulley for getting all the praise in Monsters Inc. Sulley's best friend is his agent, Mike, a sort-of mini cyclops who is totally harmless - but can split your sides, he's so funny! To tell the story briefly, Sulley & Mike find a cute little toddler in their world, whom they call Boo. In their quest to return her home, they get mixed up in Randall's plot to take over Monsters, Inc. When the time comes to return Boo, Sulley realises he doesn't want to. He's bonded with Boo and gained her trust. But he has to, and they shred her door because she knows too much about the monster world. Because they've shredded the door, Sulley will never be able to see Boo again. Sulley becomes the head of Monsters Inc. and they don't use screams for power - they use laughter. They go through the doors and crack jokes to the kids instead of scaring them. But then Mike resurrects Boo's door - and this is a very touching moment, as Sulley has saved one tiny piece of Boo's door. Mike says, ""It only works if you have every piece."" and then Sulley slides it in - and goes through the door. He is greeted with 'kitty!' which is what Boo calls him. And then it ends...Monsters Inc. is funny, moving, and it's Pixar. All I can say is MIMO - miss it, miss out."

","Monsters inc. is not just an animation movie. This is the movie that will go down in history as the perfect animated movie. This was one movie I watched without being distracted by the 3D rendering. Most Animated Movie distracts the viewer from the story by dazzling spectators with fancy animation. But this movie is definitely different. You can easily forget that they are digital imagery and fall completely in love with the characters. It brought back memories of my childhood. And I would grade this as the best movie in all my 33 years of watching movies.<br/><br/>The concept and fast paced story of this film is so unique that you will sit through the entire movie without a blink.<br/><br/>The fluidity of motion achieved in the character animation surpasses Bugs Life, Toy Story and even Final Fantasy. The visual realism created by the fur on the Monster was very realistic. The behavior of fur in wind and snow was true to life. Good animation are those that does not give the impression that its synthesized imagery. The whole object of computer animation is to give the illusion of events and characters without actually filming them. And this movie does that beautifully without distracting you with the creators' technical aspects of animation."

","Pixar has come up with another winner, as with most animation it relies on all the pieces coming together to make it work, if the animation is great but the story is lousy, it's just a well animated lousy film, but this is one where everything works perfectly. The animation is what you'd expect from Pixar ie damned good the story is fabulous the characters are lovable and watchable and the voices give the characters personality <br/><br/>On a par with Toy Story, Monsters Inc is a company that generates power by making kids scream ('we scare because we care'). The scarers are just run of the mill Joes who clock on and off during their shift, and aim for the exalted title of scarer of the month. Sully is the king of the screams, a big bluey green bear like monster who wins scarer of the month time after time. His friend and sidekick is Mikey, an eye on legs basically, who is the comic sidekick to the rather more serious Sully. Mike and Sully work on the factory floor as a team, Mike controls a conveyor which brings the doors which allow Sully access to the kids via their closets. When Sully goes in, does his act to make the children scream, Mike collects the energy, which is used to power the City the Monsters live in. The monsters work under the myth that if a child touches them they die, which gives some comic touches. One monster who comes out of a bedroom with a sock attached to his back is 'decontaminated' by the Monster Inc equivalent of SWAT. Things get more complicated when a door is left on the factory floor one evening and when Sully goes through it to check who's scaring in it, he accidentally brings back a human infant with him into the monster world. This causes all sorts of mayhem as the monsters search<br/><br/>for the little girl, and Sully tries to keep her from harm as he gets to like her more the longer she's around. You really have to see it to understand the story but it well worth it. As with the latest trend, especially from Pixar there are a few in jokes, the main one being Mike taking his girlfriend to the poshest restaurant in town which is called Harryhausen's, with his girlfriend bearing more than a close resemblance to one of Harryhausen's best known figures Medusa, from Jason and the Argonauts. Again a trait of Pixar's is the out takes at the end so make sure you don't leave before the credits finish. A great family film from Pixar, who seem to be the next generation Disney and as long as they keep this standard up, they'll certainly be up there with them."
"bix171","10","0","1","1 February 2002"," Pixar's Expanding Vision
","Every bit the equal of the `Toy Story' films but with larger vision, Pixar continues to explore the universal endearments of childhood; rather than have toys come to life, this time it's about the monsters that come out of the closet at night. Pixar's focus is not about scaring children but about the act of scaring children: it's a job to the main characters, portrayed as working-class stiffs trying to meet their quotas at an energy supply corporation that uses the kids' screams to produce power. It's a brilliant concept, naturally, but Pixar takes it further by creating a fully realized metropolis that exists as a sort of cross between the New York of the forties and the big city in any Marvel Comic, inhabited with pleasingly shaped creatures that complement the ambience and sleek lines of the settings. As in the `Toy Story' series there's as much for grownups as for children and repeated viewings seem almost mandatory (an inviting prospect); but this time around, there's a healthy skepticism towards corporations that's clearly adult. Another winner from Pixar/Disney."

They seem to be the last animation studio these days that has FUN animating.  There appears to be an unwritten rule now that you have to take animation way too seriously.  God forbid you have fun making cartoons, right?<br/><br/>Okay, end of mini-rant.  Now, while ""Monsters Inc."" isn't as downright *perfect* as the ""Toy Story"" movies, it's very close.  It's about on par with ""A Bug's Life"".  And with all that said, I have to say that this is one of the most charming and imaginative movies of the year.  The visuals are particularly amazing (the chameleonic Randall is a stunner, and check out the great lost visual gag from ""Terminator 2"" towards the climax), so expect this to become a huge cult hit on video."

","Check that the closet is closed & hope that mummy has left your door open so you can see the landing light! Yes the monsters are back to scare you, but don't take it personally its just their job or so Pixar claim in their latest triumph Monsters Inc.<br/><br/>Rather than aim for the teen/adult market as Shrek did with its constant reliance on knowing in jokes Monsters Inc is a classic children's tale and the spirit of such tales appeals to all. Playing on every child's fear, not only are the monsters employed to frighten children  - collecting screams as an energy source for their home of Monstropolis - but they are actually scared of kids and once a child escapes into their world the chaos begins!<br/><br/>As with the Toy Story movies at the core of this film is a great double act, here between co-workers Sulley (John Goodman) & Mike (Billy Crystal). Other great actors bring their vocal talents to the supporting cast such as Steve Buscemi & James Coburn although this film is more a two man show than previous Pixar releases. Goodman & Crystal make great leads, Goodman the more laid back thoughtful beast with Crystal his hyperactive, excitable sidekick, a perfect marriage between actor and character. It goes without saying that the world of Monsters Inc looks breathtaking, a fully believable world with monsters of all shapes & sizes everywhere, indeed like all of Pixars movies repeated viewing is a must so rich in background detail is the film.<br/><br/>Unlike the failure that was Final Fantasy this film not only delivers the goods visually but also story wise. Another trademark of Pixar is that the plot is the most important thing, the animation complementing & being used for the good of that. This is no more apparent than in Monsters Inc, which despite not being quite as laugh out loud funny as the Toy Story films has an unparalleled richness of character & plot. There are too many highlights, the Child Detection Agency, the cameo appearance of the Yeti - voiced by the excellent Pixar regular John Ratzenberg. But the climatic door-to-door chase scene stands out, rivalling anything that live action cinema let alone animation offers us for thrills. All in all not only an excellent animated movie, but an excellent movie full stop and a great cinematic start to 2002."

","Monsters, INC. is a great movie that almost works at the same level the TOY STORY movies and SHREK does (I only compare it to them because it's an all computer animated film). Watching this movie I got increasingly jealous that I wasn't a kid. This is one of the cutest movies in HISTORY!!!!! The gags, while mostly for kids hold there own in the adult world, not as tightly as SHREK did, but it works. The sappiness of the movie is drained out by the pure charm of it. Every time I hear PIXAR is making a movie I get as excited as a Star Wars fan about EPISODE II (in which teaser trailer shows up here). While it probably won't turn as many heads as TOY STORY 2 and SHREK, it will be noticed. PIXAR is by far the MOST imaginative studio out there, they cover EVER corner of what would seem to be a CARTOON to make it it's own world! It was almost as if the writers had went into a closet that was left opened by a monster and explored their world and got to know every little crack and stain about the place, then came back here and made a movie about it. I don't want to talk about the goings on of the film because everything is  such a sweet and intelligent surprise. Most of all, it should be noted that I was in the theater with a BUNCH of screaming, talking, loud children, and in any other case I would have been annoyed but MONSTERS, INC. put me in such a cute and loving mood that I couldn't wait to hear the next little kids say, ""Is that man real?"" MONSTERS, INC. ***1/2 (out of ****)"
"localboy","Null","0","1","14 January 2002"," A little too warm and fuzzy
","Monsters Inc. creates a secret world where monsters really exist. They work for a company called Monsters Inc. and are busily scaring children all over the world to collect their screams, which are used to power the city of Monstropolis. However, the monsters live in fear of any contact with the children they scare, believing that they are highly contagious. So when a baby girl accidentally crosses over from the human world, it's the beginning of a chaotic adventure for the hero, James P 'Sully' Sullivan and his friend, Michael 'Mike' Wazowski.<br/><br/>The voices have been well cast with Billy Crystal and John Goodman working well together as the voices of the main characters. Goodman is Sully, a big, blue hairy monster and Crystal is Mike, basically a giant eye on legs. Steve Buscemi is the villain Randall Boggs, an evil chameleon lizard intent on taking the top scarer award away from Sully. Even the smaller roles have been filled by the voices of heavyweight Hollywood actors such as Oscar-winner Jennifer Tilley (Mike's girlfriend Celia) and James Coburn (grumpy factory manager, Henry J Waternoose).<br/><br/>Made by Pixar, the animation company behind the ground-breaking Toy Story (the first fully 3D animated feature film), Monsters Inc. shows just how far technology has developed since those early days. The characters' expressions and movements are fluid and completely convincing. However, the inventive storyline will ensure that audiences are only barely aware of the computer wizardry at work to bring Monsters Inc. to life.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it's not quite as witty or as much fun as similar animated releases like Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life or more recently, Shrek. Those movies worked well on two levels - providing enough cuteness and action to keep the kids happy as well as plenty of 'in' adult jokes to keep the grownups entertained. Monsters Inc. just doesn't have the big laughs and veers a little too often towards warm and fuzzy. The producers definitely had small children in mind when making this movie.<br/><br/>All in all, however, this clever behind-the-scenes spin on monsters in the closet is sure to keep kids captivated during the holidays. But make sure you're on time. There's a very funny animated short about birds shown before Monsters Inc.<br/><br/>Rated a monstrous 7/10."

","2001 was supposed to be the year where Dreamworks for once would win the animation war against Disney with their great Shrek. Unfortunately for Spielberg & Co., Pixar would come to Disney's rescue again. Pixar seem absolutely infallible, and they fortify that feeling with Monsters, Inc.<br/><br/> Monsters, Inc. is a funnier and warmer film than Shrek and, to me, that forms the most important part of a good animated film. It still doesn't quite reach the peak as Toy Story and A Bug's Life did, but the difference is slim.   The story is extremely original and well-written and is bound to keep both adults and kids pinned to their seats through the whole film. (Only one kid started crying, which must be considered acceptable casualties since the film is about monsters.) Even the ending is cut right before the last mandatory reconciliation, making it much stronger. If the story or the incredibly entertaining characters won't do it for you, the animation surely will. There are some details and scenes here never done before. This is, technically, the best achievement in CGI filmmaking so far.<br/><br/> As a footnote, before the movie you will be fortunate enough to see Pixar's 3-minute short For the Birds, which is the funniest short film I have ever seen. <br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

There is nothing more dangerous than touching a child!! but what happens if one comes into the monster world?!?!<br/><br/>over all i would give this film 7 out of ten."

Obviously, the animation was the best of any film to date. I hope that Dreamworks makes enough movie from their (superior film) SHREK that they can attain the level of Pixar's animation.<br/><br/>Sully's fur was phenomenal, my jaw literally dropped at the first few moments it was displayed, and then later during the Himalayan scenes when refraction of snow and ice, and the influence of wind came into play. It was a funny movie too, and I usually hate Billy Crystal."

","A great number of the previous user comments (and a great number of those coming after mine, I would suspect) make the comparison between this animated movie and Shrek, Harry Potter, (the upcoming at time of press) Lord of the Rings, and Pixar's earlier shows. I'm not here to rehash all that.<br/><br/>Let me start out by saying that you'll read no spoilers here. Also, to each his own. While the overwhelming number seem to enjoy the film (as did I), others did not, and some of them make objective sense.<br/><br/>That said; this is a truly clean movie. I am not one of those people who can read SEX into smoke plumes, but I detected no 'signals' (hidden or otherwise) of any sort. Adult themes do not come into play here, save the usual kissy stuff that may have offended a century ago, but not today. I would recommend the show to almost any age without reservation. This is a movie that (on the basis of suitability alone) should feature a prominent place somewhere on your video shelf.<br/><br/>Next, the storyline. I liked Shrek, mind you, and Pixar's previous movies. Lord of the Rings is on my 'must watch' list as well, but Monsters, Inc is good enough to appeal on several levels at the same time. It is something new, although you might catch on to the 'most powerful' energy source (untapped at the beginning of the show) as soon as it is featured. If your children liked it at 3, they'll like it at 13, 23, and 30, but for more and different reasons.<br/><br/>I have a heard a great deal about Harry Potter, prominently from the Christian fundamentalists who thoroughly disapprove of the entire concept. I'm a Christian fundamentalist-type myself, but don't let me put a crimp in your enjoyment. Never did like the chap, even when I first heard of him. Personally, I would prefer David Eddings' books be made into movies, except the gentleman doesn't want to do so. At any rate, Monster, Inc will never suffer that kind of adverse 'publicity', and I strongly doubt its effects will seem dated 50 years down the track (which will happen to Harry Potter, believe me!) Animation had its privileges; I still love Mickey Mouse and he's fairly old for a house rodent.<br/><br/>Many shows require you to suspend your disbelief, and turn your brains off. Monsters, Inc doesn't require you to do so - at least, it does it for you very subtly. Just watch it. This show is a keeper."

"RawkStah","7","0","1","1 November 2001"," It's from PIXAR. They know funny and CGI.
","Monsters, Inc. ***<br/><br/>Parents  you might want to make sure that your kids don't read the next sentence.  The monster in your closet is REAL.<br/><br/>That monster is big and scary and is gonna make you scream and is gonna keep on doing it until you grow up.  Tough.  That's the way it is.  But, don't think that it actually WANTS to scare you.  It's not mean, it's just doing it's job.  See, that monster works for Monsters, Inc.  Monsters, Inc. supplies all the power to Monstropolis, and your screams provide that power. Sadly, you haven't been doing your job lately.  You're growing up too fast. You don't scare easily.  And, because of that, Monstropolis is in an energy crunch.  So, when that big scary monster shows up tonight, make sure that you scream really, really loud.  Just don't touch the monster.  Children are toxic.  You don't want to hurt the monster, do you?<br/><br/>You might want to take a quick break and calm your children down now. Reality is tough.<br/><br/>Much like the Toy Story franchise, Monsters, Inc. presents us with a look into a secret world.  A world of monsters.  Guess what?  Those monsters are just like us, but not in a Twilight Zone episode kind of way.  More like the going to work, having friends and families kind of way.  Unlike most of us, however, the monsters are computer generated.<br/><br/>Synopsis time:  Monsters, Inc. is roughly a day in the life of James P. `Sully' Sullivan (Goodman), and his friend Mike Wazowski (Crystal). They're best friends, roommates, and partners at Monsters, Inc. (`We scare because we care.')  Sully does the actual scare-jobs, while Mike is, for lack of a better term, his crew chief.  Mike handles the logistics, the paperwork (poorly), and everything else not involving the actual scaring of the children.  Sully is the top scarer in the company, followed closely by Randall Boggs (Buscemi)  a sort-of cross between a gecko, a chameleon and a snake.  The head of Monsters, Inc. is Henry J. Waternoose (Coburn), a crab thing.  Waternoose is concerned both about the current energy crisis and about the quality of the new scarers.  They're just not all that scary, and tend to be just a little stupid and/or clumsy.  Waternoose wants Sully to help train the new recruits, Randall wants to be in first place, and Mike just wants to make Celia (Tilly), a mix between Medusa and a cyclops, his girlfriend.  Mike is in a hurry to get on his date with Celia and, once again, forgets to file his paperwork.  Sully decides to do it for him. Mike left the paperwork on his desk on the Scarefloor.<br/><br/>Now, the mechanism by which the monsters emerge from a closet is this: a child's ID card is scanned into a computer.  An automated system then summons up the other' side of the closet door in that child's bedroom. The door is inserted into a slot on the Scarefloor, power is applied to the door, a storage battery is attached to a receptical next to the door, the monster goes into the door, scares the kid, and comes out.  No doors are supposed to be on the Scarefloor after the end of a shift.  But, guess what Sully finds?  He peeks into the bedroom, to make sure no monsters are present before he shuts the door down (so he doesn't trap the monster). But, a big problem arises  the little girl (Biggs) that has that closet comes out, and into Monstropolis.  This is not good.  This is one of the worst things that could happen.  And, she really likes Sully, whom she renames Kitty.  Her name is Boo, at least according to Sully.  Begin wackiness in T minus 3... 2... 1... make audience laugh now!<br/><br/>Overall, Monsters, Inc. is very well done.  Then again, it was done by the same people behind the Toy Story franchise and A Bug's Life.  And, it's certainly in the same vein.  The writing is tight, the pacing is perfect, and the characters are entertaining.  Most importantly, it won't make grown-ups stupider or bored.  There are times when the movie is a bit dark in tone, but not too much, and certainly not too intense for kids.<br/><br/>As far as the animation goes, well, it's PIXAR, for the love of pete!  It started off as a subsidiary of Industrial Light and Magic.  Of course it's going to be outstanding.  However, the competition is tougher in 2001 than it was in the late 90s.  Square Pictures Final Fantasy raised the bar considerably in terms of what can be done with computer animation.  Sully is a hairy monster.  Hair all over.  It's so close to being done right that you can just feel it, but it's not perfect.  It's not distracting, but it's not quite perfect.  Yet.  But, in terms of the light-sourcing and the physics' that the monsters obey, it's dead on.  Same with the facial expressions. Even though Boo looks like a plastic toy (this could be by design, of course, since it's intended to be cartoony, while Final Fantasy went for realism), the range of emotions she's capable of displaying is amazing. Then again, PIXAR was able to make a desk lamp convey emotion (in the groundbreaking Luxo, Jr.).  You're not going to go wrong with seeing Monsters, Inc."

","I gave this movie an 8, because it had a cool chase scene, and the little girl was almost universal, like the Sims. Then I saw Shrek on DVD, and I wonder why people think Pixar and Disney would even compete against Dreamworks at the Oscars! Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, Waking life, Shrek, Blood: the last vampire, Final Fantasy, is there even room for Monsters inc? The plot is cute, but to quote my designated driver: ""that's such a bootleg ending!"" Shrek was predictable and fun and funny. Monsters Inc was predictable. Period. Shrek also creatively used conventional cinematographic techniques, Monsters Inc just showed you what was happening. The richness of expressions was also limited by the lack of development. Shrek made you feel Cameron Diaz beneath the digital expressions of princess Fiona. Sully only gave you cliches expressions-growl, surprise, sadness, resolution, endearment. You see what I mean? Comparing the two is worse than having a boxing match between Mike Tyson and Hillary Clinton! We love Hillary, but she's no heavy weight."
"GuyCC","9","0","1","2 December 2001"," Another Good-Natured Pixar Romp.
","Pixar is among one of the best things to happen to the Disney Studios in years.  From ""A Bug's Life"" to both ""Toy Story"" movies (and even their shorts, if you've had the chance to see them), their outings have been a lot of fun.  ""Monsters Inc."" was no different.<br/><br/>The movie felt a bit ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" to me in that the ghoul's and monster's fright-making was simply just their ""job"" for them.  When not scaring and causing frights, they led ""regular"" everyday lives outside of the haunts.  Kind of a ""behind the scenes"" look at the monsters under the bed (or in the closet, in this case).  It's a fun concept, and John Goodman and Billy Crystal pulled off the characters of Sulley and Mike very well.<br/><br/>While I still believe that the best CG animation I've seen this year was ""Final Fantasy"", the range of emotions for Mike, Sulley, Boo and the others display went much, much farther.  Boo was a cute character.  Funny, easily distracted, vulnerable... she represented the average child (about 2-3 I'm guessing) for her age.  And again, while ""Final Fantasy"" was just jaw-dropping in terms of animation, ""Monsters"" had its own wonderful set of effects, lighting tricks and surprises to be found.<br/><br/>The humor in it was very funny.  Everything from physical gags to self-reference and in-jokes, the film has something to offer on every level (the Yeti being my personal favorite ""Don't worry, it's lemon!"")  It also had its fair share of action scenes that offered a fair share of ""wows"" and fast pacing.  Unfortunately, the soundtrack didn't really stick in my mind, as I can't remember, much less whistle any of it after the film being over. But that is a rather moot point in a movie that was supposed to be mainly slapstick with a message about how children see their fears, and laughing produces more results than scaring.  A nice little message for times like these.<br/><br/>But the one moment that got me the most about the entire film took place in the last two minutes: Sweet natured and simple, but not sappy with a huge musical score swelling in the background to force the viewer's emotions. I honestly don't think they could have ended this film any more perfectly.<br/><br/>An enjoyable film.  Too bad I didn't see any ""outtakes"" at the end like Pixar's other efforts.  Maybe there will be something for the DVD. A good watch for 2001."

"jay_domingo","8","0","1","1 December 2001"," A blend of refreshing concepts for animated flicks
","Coming from a streak of months of not watching any new movies just leaving myself to vegetate from work and school (and reading comments from imdb.com), this film was a much needed respite from all the ruckus of life.<br/><br/>Having read all the comments here, most people express that Monsters, inc. either did not meet their expectations (as set by the previous toy story series) or gleefully accepted the movie. I highly respect those opinions. I do not aim to bleedingly criticize the movie constructively, but more on to comment on my appreciation of the movie.<br/><br/><spoilers> The movie capitalizes on the age-old idea of the ""boogieman"" or ""monsters"" coming out of children's closets. The twist in the whole plot is that, monster's are actually personified as also having the same lives as humans. Ironically, the monsters who scare the wits out of the children are also equally, if not more scared than their human opposites. The monsters believe that humans are toxic that even little kids aren't even spared from this belief. </spoilers><br/><br/>Some flavors of different movies in the past years has been subtlely used to enhance the plot. The creative use of the concept/plot was further expounded by the brief, yet lively built characters of the animation which makes the film more easier to absorb for its target market: children.<br/><br/>
But then again, even if pixar/disney's alleged target audience was children, i'm sure it did not leave out some of the adults who were still young at heart and was intensely intrested to take some time off and just have a great time with their loved ones (or in my case myself).<br/><br/>The subtle, yet amuzing blend of refreshing or familiar concepts make the film more likeable to its intended audience, and chances are, you might yell alongside with other youngsters: MIKE WAZOWSKI!<br/><br/>C'mon guys/girls, when was the last time that you sat on a theater and felt that the movie has some new concoctions to offer to this world, which seems to be running out of creative ideas. =)<br/><br/>No Technicalities, just pure fun and animation (with a little bit of drama on the side too)."
"Wildkatt","7","0","1","3 December 2001"," Disney is finally creative again
","I get to the point (no spoilers whatsoever):<br/><br/>Unique story teaches values.  Some unique jokes.  Some cliche/old jokes. Good animation (for 2001, of course!)<br/><br/>This movie is aimed at younger kids, but enjoyable enough to watch as an adult. (In fact, I (23) saw it with two friends, one 26-years-old and pregnant with first kid, and my 27-year-old boyfriend).  Appropriate for all ages.<br/><br/>Whole lotta cuteness going on in the movie, but I didn't find it sickening (I tend to find cuteness sickening).<br/><br/>I'd give it a 7/10, boyfriend gave it a 6/10, friend would give it a 9/10 or 10/10.  It's definitely worth seeing.<br/><br/>The short bird cartoon done by Pixar (""for the Birds"") at the beginning of the movie was GREAT.  The mannerisms of the birds were right on, and made me grin so hard my eyes started to tear (right at the beginning).  Reminded me of watching the  Great 'story' & imagination.

","The Pixar animation company is very good at what they do.  They always manage to keep up with the development of computer animation.  And their latest masterpiece, ""Monsters, Inc.,"" shows you how far they have come, and how excellent they are.  This movie had a lot of laughs, and a few tender moments as well.  It put a nice twist on an old childhood fear: what if the monster in your closet was afraid of you?  I enjoyed a lot of in-jokes, including the use of animation legend Ray Harryhausen's name.  The best character would have to be Randall, whose reptilian moves and chameleon color changing style were very well done.  Pixar did the right thing by not including a ""blooper reel"" in the closing credits.  Otherwise, they would have looked like they were trying to be like ""A Bug's Life.""

","In the workaday world of monsters, Monsters, Inc. is the prime power provider.  The workers at the company get the energy by emerging from kids' closets and scaring the beejeezus out of them. The subsequent screams are then bottled and used to power Monstropolis.<br/><br/>The company's top scarer is James P. Sullivan, aka Sulley (voiced by John Goodman). His sidekick/best friend is Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). Here's how it works. Doors from kids' rooms appear from a giant warehouse in the company's behemoth building. The scarer opens the door and steps into the kid's bedroom and scares the heck out of the little tyke. As the screams come, they fill up empty canisters, the kind in which one might find helium for balloons, which the sidekick keeps at the ready. Then the monster steps out, the leaderboard reflects the changes (they're very competitive there, you know), and another door is procured. The sidekick takes care of all of the paperwork. But kids aren't getting scared the way they used to, and there's a power shortage afoot.<br/><br/>There's one huge rule, though. Never come in contact with one of the kids, or any of the stuff from their rooms. The kids are toxic and will kill you on contact. (At one point, a particularly gruesome monster comes out of the room with a tiny sock velcroed to his fur; an emergency is declared, and a crack Kid Detection team races in to decontaminate the scene - and the monster, who gets quite a nasty shave. It's all innocuous enough, but it's also reflective of current events, although the movie was certainly written a while ago.)<br/><br/>One evening, Sulley offers to do the paperwork so Mike can go on a date with his beloved Celia (Jennifer Tilly). There aren't supposed to be any doors left on the floor after hours, but there one is, and Sulley's just inquisitive enough to open it. Whoops! A kid comes out. Hilarity ensues. Sulley races to get Mike, and they both panic. I mean, think of it! A KID, there in Monstropolis! They fear for their lives! And of course all the while the kid, whom Sulley names Boo, is being a cute, adorable, curious little rugrat. <br/><br/>This film was done by the Pixar people, the same nice folks who brought Toy Story and A Bug's Life to you. The animation is wonderful, although I'm not sure it's quite on par with Toy Story as far as the monsters go. The animation of the little girl, however, is fabulous. The animators must have kids of their own, because every nuance I can think of that a little kid would have was captured beautifully in this movie. <br/><br/>The actors providing the voices are a lot of fun, too. Whoever cast John Goodman and Billy Crystal is probably suffering from a dislocated shoulder from patting themselves on the back so much. The two stars have great chemistry, bordering on Laurel and Hardy-ish.<br/><br/>This is a bellyacher of a film, although admittedly it's not one that the intellectual snob would particularly enjoy. While the audience is the teeter-totter set, there is no overabundance of flatulence jokes - in fact, there aren't any. This is good clean (literally) fun."
"Hitchcoc","9","0","1","28 November 2001"," Very Creative
","I had heard a lot about this before I went (which I hate), but it was still a pleasant surprise. What I loved was the workaday world of the monsters with their factory, their doors, their business, so like the corporate life of the non-monster world. The character's have gentleness, commitment, and a positive view of the world. While some of it is scary (the whole premise of monsters in the closet is scary anyway), it walks a nice line between being too saccharine and too violent. There are some great lines, and the imaginative world created and based on the scream/energy concept is quite clever. For those that take three year olds to movies, I don't know many that don't have something that would upset someone this age. This film is about monsters. They can't be too tame or they will lose their monsterness.<br/><br/>While there are harsh things, the closing scene is done with great sympathy and on terms that we can all live with. It is also about risk taking to do the right thing. This is not Citizen Kane but it sure ain't bad."

The story concept behind Monster's Inc., although clever, isn't quite as clever as that of the Toy Story series (particularly Toy Story 1).  The plot, in addition, is much simpler and less involved than those of either Toy Stories.  Still though, this is a great movie simply because of its enormous adorability factor--a big furry monster, a goofy eyeball monster, and an absolutely adorable little girl (without a doubt the most adorable character I've seen in any movie ever, animated or live).<br/><br/>I won't say anything about the details of the story as most have below.

"Dilip","9","0","1","25 November 2001"," Perhaps Pixar's best film; technically excellent animation, great color and music, and fun story!
","""Monsters, Inc."" was a thoroughly entertaining, fun, and exciting film!  I loved Pixar's animation, of course, and the story was funny and interesting. There is a scene in the first two or three minutes of a monster's scaring a sleeping child (actually, a simulation at the Monster utility company), and a second scaring simulation 2/3 or so through the movie which some children as old as 6 or 7 may be disturbed by, but otherwise the film is great for all ages!<br/><br/>The ingenious plot takes place at a utility company in Monstropolis, a world of monsters.  In 8-hour shifts, the citizen monsters go through bedroom doors of sleeping children; the screams that the monsters evoke are the energy currency of Monstropolis.  But even as they scare the children, the monsters themselves are afraid of humans.  What happens when a child accidentally enters an ajar door and comes into the world of the monsters?<br/><br/>I found that I enjoyed this film even more than Pixar's earlier ""Toy Story"" or ""Toy Story 2"" (both also excellent films!).  ""Monsters, Inc."" is one of those few films that I left the theatre feeling that I would like to see the film again soon while it is still playing on the big screen.  I found the plot and animated characters (especially the main character monsters, Sulley and his sidekick Mike, and the so cute 4-year-old Boo - perhaps misnamed as she was, in fact, rather brave) to be captivating, the colors and music contributing to a fun ""retro modern"" style.  The humor could be appreciated by all ages, and I enjoyed catching a brief reference to ""Toy Story"", when Boo picks up a toy featured in that movie.  I loved the chase scene through the seemingly endless doors, and the scene with the Abominable Snowman, who was trying to be helpful (sno-cones, anybody?!).<br/><br/>This film is certainly worth seeing again on the large screen and then owning when it is out on video.  The animation is rich; careful repeat watchings will no doubt reveal additional interesting detail, such as reading of all of the headlines in the scene where Boo is discovered in Monstropolis.<br/><br/>Don't miss seeing ""Monsters, Inc."" while it's playing in theatres, so you can enjoy the rich colors and animation.

But the world is turned upside down when a little 3-year-old, Boo, invades monster land.<br/><br/>Everything is so imaginative in this movie. Even with just an eye, an eyebrow and a mouth, Mike's character is so expressive and fun. His girlfriend, Celia, who has medusa hair has snakes that share the same emotion as Celia. But as great as the character design is, it's the heart of the characters like Sully, Mike and Boo that make this movie such a great family flick. Best of all, both kids and adults can enjoy it.

First, this is the second in a disturbing series of coincidences where Pacific Data Images / Dreamworks SKG is first to market with a similar theme to Whatever-Pixar-Has-Announced.  It happened with Antz / Bug's Life and now it seems with Shrek / Monsters.  While not plagiarism, it is nonetheless eyebrow-raising that the same theme (hero bugs and misunderstood monsters) ends up in both studios.  PDI/SKG's screens are crowded and rich, but can't hold a candle to Pixar animation - and their storytelling falls far short as well.  Originality?  To take a William Steig book and then completely remove any trace of the author's celebrated illustration style is disturbing.  And as for the characters, they all seem, like the ants in Antz, to be made of the same basic animation model, stretched and colored to turn them into the needed creature.  It's the cheap way out, and it shows. Pixar's animation techniques are visually stunning - see this in a theatre - don't wait for video/DVD - the fur on Sully alone is worth the price of admission.  Shrek had its moments - but that was the point - moments - but not a film that hangs together - gags, funny voices (you listen to ""Donkey"" it's because it's funny to hear Eddie Murphy in a home-boy dialect as a donkey, not because of the riveting dialogue).  The acid test?  I'm, far too old to be moved by a kid's movie - and I was, as with even some of Pixar's shorts - near tears near the end.  I wouldn't rent Shrek again - there's really nothing to go back to look at - but as usual, I'll likely go pay to see Monsters again... how can a character with one eye emote  more than most with two?  Bravo Pixar!  Memo to PDI/SKG - you don't go down in history for cutting corners & me-too.  Try again."

","It's amazing how far CGI acting has come. I've accused some movies of having gone too far with the use of Computer Generated Images (CGI) and leaning on it a bit too much but in this case, the movie was all CGI and so it should be. Monsters, Inc. is basically a good old-fashioned cartoon, just tens times better than anything we used to watch as kids. And the interesting thing is that cartoons are no longer for children. More and more of these animated movies are appealing to the adults as much as they are to the children. <br/><br/>Monsters, Inc. is about something that every child knows aboutmonsters in their closet. We've all had our own monsters that we were terrified of as a child and they always seem to come from that spooky closet in our room. How did these monsters get here? What are they doing here? Monsters, Inc. takes us into the world of bedroom monsters. Every closet in every child's room in the world is connected to the monster world. While the children don't really get anything out of having the daylights scared out of them, the monster's world is powered by the screams they generate out of children. Everyday, some monsters' jobs are to go and generate power by going around to the human children of the world and scaring thembut the one thing that is absolutely not permitted is for a child to enter the world of monsters<br/><br/>Why was this movie so good? Lots of things. They have fantastic actors as voices for the characters. John Goodman plays the main character of Sulley (big blue furry monster) with Billy Crystal playing Sulley's buddy and sidekick, Mike Wazowski (one-eyed gumball looking fellow). With actors like these two fellows, it's hard not to have good material to work with and I wouldn't be surprised if Billy Crystal adlibbed some of his lines.<br/><br/>
What also added to the quality of this movie was the ability to capture the emotions and expressions of these characters. Unlike animation of the past, computers have been able to mimic human emotions and expressions with great accuracy. This has allowed for the audience to feel closer and relate to these fantasy actors and create an overall more enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>Sometimes technology gets in the way of storytelling. It's happened in lots of movies where Hollywood thought that it could rest on the crutches of technology in place of a good storyline. Monsters, Inc. doesn't have this problem. On a basic level, the story is simple. The monster world is turned upside down when a little human child accidentally enters their world. But what the movie has been able to achieve beyond that is create a story that has good believable characters, even if they are fictional. The characters carry the emotions of what they face across the screen to the audience and the more the audience believes them, the better the story is. It's also nice to see that the humor is not just targeted at young children. I quite often heard adults laughing louder than the children and that's a good sign that the movie is appealing to everyone. I don't have any children but the friends that I went with all enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a very good movie. The animation was amazing, the voice actors were excellent and the story was entertaining. Go see it."
"sngbrd39","Null","0","1","24 November 2001"," What is this strange feeling?
","I don't believe I've ever had this feeling walking out of a Disney/Pixar film. Oh, sure, it happens during Disney films, but never when Pixar is involved. I can't quite pinpoint what it is. I guess it could be best described as...disappointment.<br/><br/>Well, it was unfortunately bound to happen someday. The good folks at Pixar have given us a sub-par (by their very, very high standards) film. Oh, sure, the cast was top-notch, especially Billy Crystal and John Goodman as our protagonists Mike and Sully. The story was awfully creative. Seeing those monsters in our closet as real, working people was a great idea. What went wrong? It felt like the movie was lacking something, that the old charm from the ""Toy Story"" movies was gone. Many of the jokes, especially in the first part of the film, fell flat. It felt as if they weren't even trying, or else that they were trying too hard. Much of the first half of the film was spent looking at the screen in bewildered silence. <br/><br/>However, there were also some pleasant surprises to be found. Ever since I saw young Boo in the advertisements for this film, I was sure she was going to be one of those characters who was so cute that she made you want to gag. As it turned out, despite one or two sickening moments, she wasn't too bad. The scenes between her and Sully were filled with very well-played emotion, making the audience feel warm and fuzzy instead of nauseous. Also, normally the endings to these movies are pretty weak. Although it was weaker than that of, say, ""Toy Story 2"", it was much better than what I expected, filled with both funny and touching moments. <br/><br/>So, if you decide to see ""Monsters, Inc."" be forewarned of this: You too may have a slightly hollow feeling inside upon walking out of this film, and you too may ask yourself, ""What's wrong with this picture?"""

","Near the end of the film when Sullivan takes Boo back to her room and she is handing him her different toys, one of the toys she hands him is a Jessie doll. Jessie is the Cowgirl in Toy Story 2. If you look even closer you will notice that she also hands him the ball from ""Luxo,"" one of Pixar's first animated shorts.<br/><br/>Watch the end of the credits. Anybody else see all the names on the ""Human Child Scream Research Team""? What a cool job. Making kids scream...<br/><br/>
Near the end of the film when Mike and Sully throw that Chameleon looking thing out of the door and into a trailer, you can see a Pizza Planet sign in the background. Pizza Planet was the pizza restaurant in both Toy Story films."

","Hey, I know I'm the type who loves those evil rated 'R' movies that ask for NC-17s, but I love this movie too.  In fact, I love Pixar.  They haven't made a bad movie yet (although I didn't care as much for 'A Bug's Life'), and this movie is no exception.  This movie has a sophisticated sense of humor, and is just as satirical as it is endearing.  Sure, you know the plot of the movie and the final result around 10 minutes (I'm guessing, i didn't look at my watch at all during the movie), but who cares?  The movie is full of humor and great graphics.  Unlike 'Shrek,' which I noticed somebody liked better, this movie wears its heart on its sleeve.  'Shrek' tried to make itself out to be an attack on Disney (and it was good for the first 20 minutes), but then it turns into an overly-sappy movie worthy of Disney. This movie never pretends to be bitter and mean, but is a bit tongue-in-cheek.  <br/><br/>*Possible Spoilers* This is a movie which makes monsters in the closet friendly.  They collect screams to power their city.  But, the kids don't scare as easily, and there is a power shortage.  By way of an evil plan, a closet gateway (read Door) is left around for Sully to find, and the kid terrorizes the monsters.  The evil plan is to kidnap the kids and steal their screams to power the city. Sully and his partner Mike try to put the girl back, and eventually succeed, but not before being exiled, returning, and such. *End spoilers*<br/><br/>Well, this movie fully understands subtle humor, and the college crowd (that's all that was there pretty much when I saw it) loved the movie.  Even the gay joke is innocent, and subtle.  The monsters are cuddly and friendly, and everything in this movie seems to work for the best.  It gets a little sappy in a few spots, but it never pretended to be anything but happy, not to mention the kids probably love it.  So, check out this movie...especially if you loved 'Toy Story.'

The humor was directed equally to children and adults, and the adult humor (and drama) was subtle enough to pass by a child without phasing him or her.  The plotline was both simple and complex, almost Lucas-like in this duality. Kids would enjoy the simple lower-level plotline without having to understand the more detailed, suggestive plot that is diverse enough to entertain their parents.  My family enjoyed this movie.  My daughter asked to see it a second time when it was over and I honestly considered it. The casting was done with perfect decision, even down to the smallest cameo (John Ratzenberger) as the Abominable Snowman, which looked strangely identical to the same one from the old Rudolph Christmas special.."

Just look at Sully's fur as it moves because of the changing environment.  There are jokes for adults and children alike. And if you thought the chase scene between Sid's dog and the toys was amazing, you haven't seen nothing until you've seen the chase scene involving the roller coster of doors.  I would feel confident to say that that scene is one of the best chase scenes in motion picture history."

","When I first saw the ads for ""Monsters Inc."", I didn't have very high hopes. Sure, the animation by the great Pixar computer-cartoon gurus (""Toy Story"", ""A Bug's Life"") was impressive as always, and the characters were clever-looking, but the images I saw just weren't zapping me the way I've come to expect from a Pixar film.  I went into this one with low hopes, expecting the mildest product from the studio yet.<br/><br/>Well, consider me standing corrected.  ""Monsters Inc."" is second only to the incomparable ""Toy Story"" as the best picture Pixar has released so far. It's chock-full of imaginative visual moments, quirky characters, unexpected gags, and a surprisingly sincere story about the love between a goofy little toddler and the blue furry monster who befriends her.<br/><br/>The monster is James ""Sully"" Sullivan (voice by John Goodman), the top scarer at Monsters Inc., a company that collects the screams of children. These screams are needed to power the sprawling city of Monstropolis, an alternate universe where all of our childhood nightmares live just like you and me.  Sully loves his job and enjoys working with his partner, googly-eyed Mike (Billy Crystal); the only sour spot on his day is Randall (Steve Buscemi), a menacing chameleonic monster who's desperate to be the top scarer.  And of course, like all monsters, Sully is terrified that one of the children it's his job to scare will escape through their closet into Monstropolis.  Human children are toxic, dontcha know.  Well, if you guessed that a kid makes it to Monstropolis, you're already way ahead of the writers here.  Still, the child, a little pigtailed girl named Boo, is not what you expect, and Sully finds himself curiously drawn to her even as the CDA (Child Detection Agency) and Randall are closing in.<br/><br/>All this is presented with real ebullience and flair by the Pixar team, led by ""Toy Story"" co-writer Pete Docter, here making his directorial debut. This light-as-a-feather bedtime tale is socked home with imaginative animation and character designs throughout.  These folks are masters of the tiny detail that does it all; from the three-lensed glasses on a Monsters Inc. assistant to the ""rancid garbage"" deodorant Mike sprays on before a big date, it all works wonderfully, goosing the humor and giving us a sense of total immersion in a big, funny world.<br/><br/>Enormous credit must also be given here to the vocal cast, who invest their performances with real wit and warmth.  Goodman's Sully is a charmer, Crystal is ideal comic relief, and Buscemi provides his trademark slimy bad-guy vibe (this time for a bad guy who is literally slimy).  Other standouts are James Coburn as the crablike head of Monsters Inc.  and John Ratzenberger as an oddly familiar abominable snowman (think ""Bumbles""), but the real stroke of genius here is the use of Mary Gibbs, the two-year-old daughter of a Pixar employee, as the voice of Boo.  It is so much more effective and endearing to have a real little girl's voice emanating from this adorable animated creation than if an actor was just doing a little-girl imitation.  Pixar's animators make Boo jump and dance, but Gibbs makes her LIVE.<br/><br/>The film is a never-ending series of impressive visual set-pieces, culminating in a wild chase through a gigantic hall of children's closet doors.  All of this is set to a lively jazz-tinged score by Randy Newman, who only bobbles the ball in a final number that seems as if it was meant to score a song-and-dance number cut from the film (obvious dance interludes, stuff like that).<br/><br/>My only real gripe with ""Monsters Inc."" is a rather anticlimactic finish that sends us out on a curiously downcast note.  Still, there's so much energy, exuberance, and life racketing around this film that it makes up for the wrong note at the end.  Today, as Pottermania takes over American theatres, please remember that Mike and Sully are still holding forth right across the multiplex hall.  And remember...they scare because they care."

","In Monsters, Incorporated, monsters make their living scaring kids through their bedroom closets. The reason? To power the City of the Monsters with their screams. (Point to ponder: why don't the monsters do their own screams? If they can roar, they can definitely scream.) One day, a human kid enters their world, turning the lives of every monster upside down. Particularly those of professional scarer James P. 'Sulley' Sullivan, the big blue furball, and his roommating buddy Mike Wazowski, the little green blue-collared eyeball and a devoted friend to Sulley.<br/><br/>Mike and Sulley race against time to return the human kid back to the human world, sandwiching that into the dramas they currently have in their respective lives at that time. Mike is trying to win the affections of snake-haired receptionist Celia while trying to avoid confrontations with mumbling slug monster Roz over a job-related assignment. Sulley is doing his best to keep his Top Scarer throne from being usurped by closest rival Randall, the slithering slimy chameleon type. Monsters, Inc. CEO Henry J. Waternoose the crab-legged rounds up this grotesque cast.<br/><br/>True to tradition, the Disney-Pixar duo never fails to deliver superb animation that stretches beyond our imaginations. They show it in their creativity of various monster species, in every possible shapes, sizes and positions eyes relative to their faces, and not to mention excellent casting of voiceover actors. Crystal accentuates Mike's brashness, with the occasional obnoxiousness that comes with being a loudmouth. Goodman shows an exceptionally kind and gentle side to Sulley, opposite to what the furball is known for at Monsters, Inc.. He is warm and loving, and dotes on the human kid (ugh!!). In one scene, he actually feels sorry for scaring her. Together, Mike and Sulley compliment each other perfectly in a clown-straightmonster antic that is reminiscent of Abbott and Costello. Celia could not be more beguiling as Tilly's voice. Buscemi's Randall is every bit as slimy and cold-blooded as his reptilian counterpart.<br/><br/>But, the film falls flat in its thin storyline and excessive slapsticks. Gone are the deep and serious emotional contents of previous Disney films, instead `Monsters, Inc.' focuses on comical antics almost to the exclusion of all else. While this approach keeps the under-12 fully entertained, it can leave the rest of the older-aged audience peeved at times. Mike and Sulley's attempts to return the human kid to Earth comes across like an extended version of a Mickey-Donald-Goofy situation comedy. Although that is not a bad idea, it does not make the story any more interesting than it already isn't. Mike is occasionally annoying when he breaks into comedy. Yes, he is supposed to be the funny monster opposite Sulley, and therefore gets most of the comedy routines. His problem is that not all of his routines delivered their punches. Case in point: Apartment scene of Mike's Â‘motivational' speech to Sulley when Sulley is doing morning exercises. But he is not alone. The frequent monster-infected-by-objects-belonging-to-human-kids gigs dehydrate with every repetition. John Ratzenberger's brief appearance as the abominable snowman provides a little relief, only a little .<br/><br/>`Monsters, Inc.' is not bad compared to most animated films of this year. It is at least more family friendly than the summer-released `Atlantis: The Lost Empire'. But Disney & Pixar's fourth animated film isn't so good next to its predecessors. It lacks the heartfelt storytelling of `Toy Story 2' and the wit and colorful characterization of `A Bug's Life'. It is enjoyable for a good laugh, but only if you are young enough at heart.<br/><br/>Spellcaster's Level 6"

","In recent years, most Disney films have sacrificed heart and human emotion for ""look, no hands, ma!"" animated virtuosity, manic ""comedy"" performances by the likes of Robin Williams, and sloshy musical numbers with one eye on a Best Song Oscar and the other on a #1 Hot 100 chart position.<br/><br/>Thankfully, ""Monsters, Inc."" rectifies the situation by being smart, witty, and cracking good fun--WITH a heart. Produced in association with Pixar, the visuals are stunning; you are actually tricked into thinking you're watching live action and certain points. <br/><br/>But savvy effects a good film does not make. Enter John Goodman and Billy Crystal, who give voice to the film's unlikely heroes: Sully, a teddy bear-ish, blue-and-purple monster who is the good natured ""#1 Scarer"" at Monsters, Inc.; and Mike, Sully's wisecracking, one-eyed best buddy and colleague. Goodman and Crystal are pitch-perfect together, making their characters' comfortable, affectionate banter sound easy and natural.<br/><br/>When Sully and Mike's lives are turned upside down by a ""child security breach""--Sully accidentally lets a 4-year-old tyke into the monster world--the gags and action never stop. What's most effective, however, is the growing bond between Sully and ""Boo,"" the nickname he gives to the toddler. It is sentimental and sweet without being manipulative or cloying, and offset by Mike's reactionary, seething resentment.<br/><br/>This movie has it all: lovable characters for the kids; witty visual and verbal gags aplenty for the adults; and a rollicking good story for everyone.

If you like Toy Story (1 or 2) this movie will definitely entertain you and live up to your expectations.  I also thought Shrek was funny, but Monsters Inc was a lot more original and adorable.  It was truly for kids, but can be enjoyed by any open-minded adult.<br/><br/><<MINOR SPOILER AHEAD>> When I saw it (with my boyfriend) The theater was packed with families, and very small children.  The audience's response to the movie was great, I just have to mention that at the part when ""Kitty"" was leaving ""BOO"" one little boy behind me started to cry, and it was just so adorable.  I laughed through the whole movie, and the ending was perfect.  I left the theater with a smile on my face.<br/><br/>This movie will no doubt become a Disney classic, **** (out of 5) don't miss it!"
"SomethingLikeHuman","9","0","1","13 November 2001"," What a great idea for a movie!
","Everything in this movie is gold!  The plot, the computer graphics, the actors, everything! The thing that most sticks out in my mind is the character Boo.  She has to be the cutest thing ever! Even the toughest of guys will have to agree. Admit it, a lot of times in movies kids can  get somewhat annoying, not here! Boo is just perfect.  John Goodman as ""Sulley"" also plays his part perfectly.  A genuine 4 star movie."

","Monsters, Inc. was a very good movie, though not as good as either of the previous 2 Pixar ""Toy Story"" movies.  I also felt the target age of this movie was higher than of any of the previous movies. There are explanations in this film, central to the plot, about things like an energy crisis and how the company, Monsters, Inc., provides the energy, by causing screams and bottling them (?).  There is adult dating, and funny references to things you'd hear around the office (ie. not around the elementary school). There is a complicated system by which the Monsters actually GET to the rooms to scare kids.  Easy concepts for adults, tough for little ones.<br/><br/>One other thing that tripped me out a little was that there were also many references and demonstrations of how monsters pop out of closets or out from under beds and scare the bejeezus out of poor little kids. This can be a little traumatic for little ones.  Along these same lines are a few scenes involving a walk down into a dark, very scary looking dungeon-like corridor, and a few of a type of torture machine that slowly wheels up to a captive victim, who is held immobile in a special chair.  Relatively short scenes, but they scared both my 6- and 3-year-olds.  I was not expecting this and it kind of irritated me.<br/><br/>On the whole, it was an enjoyable movie.  To be honest, the most enjoyable part for me was the short animated film that preceded the main attraction, a VERY cute and funny short called ""For the Birds."""

","Voice acting- Excellent....the best casting and acting you could hope for the characters as presented in the film<br/><br/>Animation- Wow... What else would you expect from Pixar? Beautiful color scheme, great imagination, spot-on characterization.  ""Sully""'s hair is, in a word, incredible, as are many of the minute details Pixar pays attention to.  In my opinion, Pixar again sets the standard for a living, breathing, stylized 3D animated world.<br/><br/>Plot- Good..... Paced well and wildly imaginative.<br/><br/>With all the above accolades, you would think I rated this movie a 10, like I did Toy Story 2.  I love individual components of this film.  But I couldn't bring myself to.  Something's missing.  When I go to see a movie in this genre, I want to be transported back 20 years (I'm currently 29) and walk out of the theater with a stupid grin on my face. The somewhat complex plot (for this kind of film) and some scenes only an adult would get the subtext to keep me from rating it higher.  Don't get me wrong... I enjoyed the movie, but I just didn't have the stupid grin on my face after seeing it.  Kids will love it for the characters, action, and color, but I just can't see a kid under 10 being fully engaged in what's going on.  Too simplistic for adults, too complex for younger kids, it's heart is pulled in different directions.  Still, I give it an 8/10 because it is a great movie despite my quibbles and it has tremendous production values.  If you're going to see it, do so on the big screen."

","When I first saw Toy Story, I was amazed. When I saw Toy Story 2, I was stunned. <br/><br/>Those are Pixar's ""masterpieces,"" or rather were their masterpieces.<br/><br/>Monsters, Inc. has taken the title of masterpiece easily. I have no idea how they can possibly top this. <br/><br/>What makes it all the more impressive is the consistent internal logic the film uses, the sheer attention to detail, and the humor. It is also worth mentioning that this is rated as it is for a good reason, this film IS for everyone. It's totally wonderful. <br/><br/>I cannot wait for this to come out on DVD home video. <br/><br/>If you have kids, if you were a kid, if you know a kid, or if you once saw a kid go see this movie. If you are an adult, if you will be an adult, or if you once saw an adult then you need to see this movie.<br/><br/>It is just that good. It will withstand multiple viewings. It will withstand the test of time. I predict Oscar nominations galore.<br/><br/>Fantastic."

","People can ""Shrek"" about it all they want. Here's the real deal: ""Shrek""-style cynicism and sarcasm are easy. The ability to look at the world with a childlike sense of wonder and creativity is a gift. It's a gift the Pixar guys and gals are copiously endowed with. There are more clever, witty ideas in any given five minutes of any Pixar flick than there are in the entire running time of 99% of the crass Hollywood rubbish being foisted on the movie populace. It's a small miracle that these folks are able to do what they do, to say nothing of the technical advances they achieve. To those who say there's no difference between the flicks, please, watch ""Toy Story"" and its sequel. The advances in fabric motion, just to name one small aspect, are amazing, and take another step in ""Monsters.""<br/><br/>It's the attention to detail that makes the Pixar movies so great -- detail in the nuances of how a character behaves or what his life is ""really"" like, detail in the background of scenes, even in small supporting characters. These films are a long time in the making and it's time well-spent. What a treat to be able to sit in a theater with people of all ages and backgrounds, laughing and having a great time. There are few movies for children that adults can abide, much less enjoy. Most of them are insults to the intelligence of the average two-year-old, much less Mom & Dad. This movie, full of life, good cheer, and sincerity, makes the likes of ""Pokemon"" seem even more like the drab, lifeless and uninspired toy commercials they are."

"Nosferatu33A","Null","0","1","12 November 2001"," A wonderful movie, Pixar has done it again.
","Pixar is more than adept at animation, and this movie is another prime example.  This is the first movie I have had the opportunity to see at the cinema where the audience had applauded at the end.  A moving plot involving Sully and ""Boo"", superb animation, and a talented ""voice"" cast formed a movie that everyone will love."
"cinemaniac1942","9","0","1","12 November 2001"," Pixar works its unique magic once again
","Pixar hasn't made a bad film yet.  In fact, it hasn't yet made a film that can be classified as anything less than excellent.  ""Toy Story"" (1995), ""A Bug's Life"" (1998), and ""Toy Story 2"" (1999) were all wonderful films with amazing state-of-the-art visuals and clever humor that children, teens, and adults can all enjoy.  ""Monsters, Inc."" is a film worthy of its predecessors' high acclaim.<br/><br/>The voice talents and humorous sensibilities of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi excel in the well-written story line, which is satirical and at the same time innocent.  The story itself is, as usual, exciting and full of laughs and thrills.  It's a fantasy about the innocence of childhood and the classic good-triumphing-over-evil theme.<br/><br/>The characters are so real, especially little Boo who wanders from her bedroom into the world of closet-monsters.  The animation has gotten so advanced that you can see every hair on lead monster Sulley's body rippling in the wind, and the facial expressions and mannerisms have gotten so real that they should start handing out Best-Actor Oscars to the animators and voice-overs.  Speaking of Oscars, ""Monsters, Inc."" should definitely contend for the new ""Best Animated Feature"" Oscar (though it's gonna have heavy competition from ""Shrek"").<br/><br/>Hopefully in the future we will see more intelligent G-rated movies that all ages can enjoy.  While ""Shrek"" was an excellent movie, it didn't have the level of innocence that ""Monsters"" has that can let parents feel easy about the content their kids are viewing and hearing.  As long as Pixar is doing their thing, parents and their kids should be happy on their nights out at the movies."

","Although the plot, jokes, and dialogue of this movie may be a bit complicated for very young children, Monsters Inc. will please almost everybody.  Like Bugs Life and Toy Story, there are slapstick gags for the kids and wisecracks for the parent who take them.<br/><br/> The gags come fast and furious, and they're built around a clever plot. The  animation is high quality, but not flashy.  The characters and the plot are central to this film, not the visuals.<br/><br/>Arrive on time so as not to miss the animated short that precedes the movie"
"japamo","9","0","1","12 November 2001"," Immensely entertaining, especially during the current chaos
","After reading some of the comments regarding an alleged ""Shrek""/""Monsters, Inc. rivalry, I simply want to conclude that I enjoyed both heartily (bought the ""Shrek"" DVD yesterday, will definitely purchase the ""Monsters, Inc."" DVD) and that both are highly accomplished animated features.  On the ""Ebert and Roeper"" TV show, critic Richard Roeper somewhat dismissed the film as something the kids would enjoy, but something where the adults would be glancing at their watches every few minutes.  I can assure Mr. Roeper that my eyes did not stray ONCE during the film;  the poor fellow must be jaded by so-called sophisticated movies.<br/><br/> I will not rehash the plot.  I will say that all elements that constitute a movie, from background to characterization, were dazzling, convincing, and comprehensive.  Monstropolis emerges as a fully fleshed out dimension uncannily mirroring our own - even up to the minute, with the simultaneously uproarious but sobering scene where a monster returns from the human dimension with a child's sock stuck to his back and he is manhandled (monster-handled) by decontamination crew members. Mike Waslowski (Billy Crystal) and James P. (""Sully"") Sullivan (Goodman) move easily through this world.  While the ""Odd Couple"" pairing is obviously not new (as admittedly, the plot - BUT WHO CARES?), Crystal and Goodman add spicy spin to their camaraderie.  Despite Crystal's comedic presence, Goodman anchors this movie with his hulking and massive but ultimately sensitive and caring character, well, at least a good part of the time.  Boo gives Sully a run for his money in the  presence department.<br/><br/>Despite superficial plot similarities to Toy Story (especially in the climactic dimensional door pursuit - yes, a potential Disney theme ride) and yes, even a smidgen of ""King Kong), ""Monsters, Inc."" stands on its own as a fascinating, well-rendered, multi-faceted piece of work.  It is NOT a sickeningly cloying, sweet movie.  Its moments of tenderness are balanced with some unsettling moments (e.g., Sully's scare demonstration (scared me, too) which terrifies Boo, Boo's restraint in the ""Scream Suction"" device by the nefarious, reptilian Randall, and Sully's/Randall's fight, where Sully is being strangled by his invisible enemy).  Sully's and Boo's developing relationship mixed in both laughter and tears  The dialogue and presence of the supporting characters was natural, matter-of-fact, and all the more funny for it.<br/><br/>In short, ""Monster, Inc.""'s plan came wonderfully together.  Unlike some commentators, the movie DOES have messages, not only of love and devotion and self-acceptance, but also about having the courage to risk altering a lifetime of conditioned thinking and behavior when it proves to be misguided. Pixar, you've done it again.  Keep doing it...please!  ""Monsters, Inc.<br/><br/> One quibble:  Boo spends a considerable amount of time in the Monstropolis dimension.  I wonder what her parents were thinking when she was missing. Perhaps the Monstropolis dimension is on a different time line, where hours there are the equivalent of minutes in our dimension (time relativity and all).<br/><br/> Out of 5 stars, I would rate ""Monsters, Inc."" 4 1/2 stars(a slight demerit to familiarity of plot, but again, WHO CARES?)  Rejuvenate heart, body, and soul.  See this movie!"

"jon.h.ochiai","9","0","1","12 November 2001"," Behind the Closet
","Pixar and Disney's ""Monsters, Inc."" is great fun for all.  It was a suprisingly good movie, with a interesting and often touching story by Jill Culton, director Peter Docter, and others.  To their credit along with Peter Docter's direction, the story telling is coherent and entertaining throughout.  John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi are just terrific in their voice roles.  The cutting edge computer animation is awesome.  <br/><br/>The idea that monsters scare children at night, to collect power for Monsters, Inc. to power the Monster city is novel.  But kids are getting harder to scare, jaded.  So times are tough for Monsters, Inc.  Sometime  is spent setting up and introducing Monster, Sulley (Goodman), and his bud, Mike (Crystal).  Sulley is a star scarer and his rival is the nasty Randall (Buscemi).  The movie really moves once Boo (a cute Mary Gibbs) enters Monsters, Inc. through her bedroom closet.  Sulley and Mike must get Boo back home.  The relationship between Sulley and Boo works.  MI is sentimental, and has a cute message about  courage and fear.  It does all this in 90 minutes.  Monsters, Inc. is an enjoyable package."

"Brogan","10","0","1","10 November 2001"," Where the Wild Things Are.
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** MONSTERS INC. reminded me of the classic children's book by Maurice Sendak, ""Where the Wild Things Are.""  Both stories are about the imagination of monsters living in children's closets, but these monsters aren't dangerous, they are harmful and friendly.  Where in ""Wild Things Are"" the monsters enjoy the company and playtime with the main child character, Max. MONSTERS INC.  the monsters are actually terrified by the presence of a child or anything that is human for that matter.  In fact, the monsters are more afraid of the children than the children are of them, nice irony. MONSTERS INC. is about two power plant factory workers in the city of Monsteroplois, James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal).  Sulley is the number one monster frightner for the factory, as Mike is Sulley's loyal assistant, roommate, and friend. The monsters have assign doors placed in front of them which leads them to the closets of real world into children's bedrooms so they can scare the children. The monsters of the city need the screams a child gives when they see a monster, that is how they get their energy.  The film even does a witty sub-plot to the real-life California rolling blackout energy crisis.  Sulley is admired by his co-workers and his boss Henry J. Waternoose (James Coburn), while Mike has a flirting romance with the company secretary, Celia (Jennifer Tilly). Everybody likes the winning duo except for the jealous Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) a chameleon-like monster who adapts his skin to his surroundings so he can hide. Randall has been putting in unofficial ""scare hours"" so he can be the top monster at Monsters Inc. It's when Sulley accidently opens up one of Randall's closet doors to find a small girl, who Sulley calls ""Boo"" has enter into the monster world.  There is a eariler scene that is horrifying realistic in today's time when a child's sock is stuck to a monster and the decontamination a monster goes through for his and everyone else's protection.  With Boo in the monster world, things can be catastrophic. Sulley and Mike try to hide Boo (even dressing her up like a monster) as they look through the billions of closet doors, to find the right one to her bedroom, as Randall wants Boo for a diabolical scheme that he plans to use her for.  But it when Sulley and Mike try to help Boo find her way home, that they begin to both feel like parents and want to help and protect the infant child. After getting a sour taste of this year's computer animated films (yes I'm talking about SHREK), MONSTERS INC. proves that Pixar and Disney animation is a winning combination and shouldn't be competed with.  Where SHREK was full of potty jokes and mugging the camera, MONSTERS actually tells a story that has a lot of depth and meaning behind it.  SHREK wanted to do cut-down jokes (especially to Disney films), MONSTERS INC. instead takes a different path and does jokes about life in general and the monster's lives are similar to our own. I found MONSTERS INC. to be another winner from Pixar, who are so far 4 to 1 on my scoreboard for successful computer animated films (only Dreamworks SHREK being the only point for the other team).  If people are asking themselves, ""gee there's SHREK, FINAL FANTASY, and JIMMY NEUTRON, how can MONSTERS INC. be any better?""  Well that's simple, it's like saying how is a ride at Disneyland better than a ride at a carnival.  Where a lot of film studios and companies are adapting to computer animated films, Disney always manages to stay a few steps ahead of it's competitor's.  First, look at the millions of hairs that cover the wooly Sulley, the scenes when he runs you can see the hairs gently move from the breeze.  Second, the human child of Boo looks more realistic than any of the generic humans in SHREK. Third, there is much more color with the Pixar films, I figured this out when ANTZ and A BUG'S LIFE were released three years ago.  Finally, the messages and morals behind the Pixar/Disney films are more original, where MONSTERS tells the viewer that don't judge a book by it's cover, that the most terrifying looking things can be the most caring.  And that it's difficult to be a parent but with teamwork and care, it can work!  Where SHREK is doing the things aren't what they seem moral which Disney did 60 years ago with DUMBO, and DUMBO was much more cuter, charming, and more touching than a obnoxious loud orge. It doesn't surprise me that MONSTERS INC. was directed by former SIMPSONS producer David Silverman, and Pixar veteran Peter Docter.  Disney had some competition this year for computer animated films, while Dreamworks had a royal flush, Disney won by having the royal flush straight, and should win the Oscar for best Animated film this year.  Until the magic and wonder of Mr. Potter is released, this is one film that Potter fans (children and children at heart) will love and wanting more, just like I did!  ***** (out of five)"
"wmson","Null","0","1","10 November 2001"," Pixar's best work so far, but there's more there
","There is more to this story than just it's fantastic look and action. In Pixar's best film yet, there are also themes of loyalty and friendship, as well as betrayal and forgivness. The relationship between Sully and Mike is so well represented despite their being such an unlikely a pair. John Goodman's Sully is so well voiced you could cry (and a few of our group did at one point, but it was a moment lost on the youngest in the crowd). The writers have to be congratulated for a great story that was well told through dialogue and action. And there are many quick jokes in the background for repeated viewings to catch. Despite the glare of future marketing by Disney (I can already see the ride based on the chase scene through the factory where the closet doors are stored), this is a sweet movie and perfect for discussion of more than just what you've seen on the screen."

"San Franciscan","Null","0","1","12 November 2001"," The most entertainment of all of Pixar's offerings so far.
","It took me forever to see ""Toy Story"", mainly because the trailer seemed so gimmicky and because its refusal to give away any plot gave me the impression that it was solely flash with computer animation without substance. Plus, the fact that it was hyped to death made me sick of it before I even had any idea what it was about. But I finally got myself to watch it over a year later on home video and liked it more than I thought I would simply because--thank GOD!--it didn't fall into the trap that the trailer gave the impression of, that is, just try to throw computer animation on to what would otherwise be a lame script just to help it sell.<br/><br/>Now that I understand Pixar's deliberate attempts to keep the plots of their releases basically hidden as much as much, a refreshing change of pace for Hollywood, I can genuinely look forward to their releases. I enjoyed A Bug's Story, and Toy Story 2 was even better than the first one.<br/><br/>But THIS one... this one is the first that I've genuinely fallen in love with. This is the first Pixar release that I'm going to rush out an nab on DVD the second it's available. It's cute, charming, imaginative and is simply so much of a sheer delight for me that I can't resist it.<br/><br/>Should I try describing the basis plot? I'm not sure. People are probably all aware of the basic concept by now, and word about what goes on it is probably being spread like wildfire, so I doubt it's necessary. But let me talk about the things I enjoyed most without going into detail just in case:<br/><br/>I adore Sulley. He's the first Pixar character I've genuinely fallen completely in love it. His design is wonderful, his expressions perfect, and I just can't get over how beautifully every hair on his form is animated! Gorgeous work here, and computer animation at its finest and most expressive. Even a wildly critical artist like myself is impressed with this feat!<br/><br/>I also love the impressive grand finale sequence, I love it with filmmakers come up with a completely unusual approach such as this one. Speaking of which... ...the absolute best thing I loved about this movie most of all. Rather than giving us the typical gosh-wow-flash-bang-zowie Hollywood-style animated flashy ending, this one takes a completely different route--and it's about time an animated film tried doing this! It ends on a hauntingly touching quiet note that captures you simply and effectively.<br/><br/>***SPOILER*** The only thing I didn't like about the film is how the credits afterward insisted on using a gimmicky, cutesy song which sounds like a mere excuse to throw a song in to make the soundtrack CD more catchy and popular. After the perfect ending, even with a few added seconds of silence present, this song destroys the otherwise perfect effect that the ending creates. I personally would have liked the credits to have started rolling with either silence or, perhaps, a softly gentle piece of childishly innocent music quietly floating in the background to be sure the mood of the finale wasn't disturbed."

"giancarlorocks","Null","0","1","3 November 2001"," A pure gem...
","Comparisons will be many when viewing Monsters, Inc.' to its' Pixar siblings. Yet in doing so would be a great injustice. With a witty blend of adventure, warmth, humour and fantasy, this film stands above the rest and dutifully lives up to its' expectations. Monsters, Inc.' is the fourth in a series of films from Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Pictures. Its' last outing was Toy Story 2' and up until then was the best film in the series. Now, Monsters, Inc.' will have many viewers having a difficult time debating which one of the films is the best yet.      Starring the voices of John Goodman as Sully and Billy Crystal as Mike Wazowski, this film follows our two lovable (and toy-friendly marketable) heroes as they unleash the worst of their horrors  a human child.  With another inventive and flexible plot, the creators of this film have assembled a fresh and fast paced comedic adventure with enough warmth that will even be conveyed to the smallest child in the theatre. The plot bases itself on a hidden city where monsters such as our two heroes scare children in order to capture their screams. Yet, there is only one problem, our monsters are actually afraid of the very children they scare. After an error occurs, a child travels into the lair of these monsters creating havoc and frenzy that only Pixar/Disney can create so well. This computer-animated film is truly a gem and displays the advancements Pixar have developed for their filmmaking. One will marvel at the technological advancements in computer animation and find themselves wanting more.  Notice Sully's fur and examine how the ripple effect affects each other fur on his body in a fluid and poetic motion. Furthermore, look at the scales when he breathes. This is just an example of the tireless effort invested in this film for a great picture that satisfies on many levels. Or if you have seen the film, notice the joyful, exasperated, detailed smile of Sully that ends the film on a touching note. The film indeed has many great points and will be pleasing to both children and adults. That said, there really is not much more to say than to sit down and enjoy a real treat.  From the creepy voice of Steve Buscemi as the villainous and slimy Randall Boggs, to the company head Mr. Waternoose voiced by James Coburn. One can analyze and hypothesize all they want, but what it comes down to is that this film will bring families together in thrills and laughs and will ultimately satisfy many. Furthermore, one must respect an animated film that contains a little twist that can catch many off guard with their gullibility when watching a children's film.  It seems as if Disney/Pixar are simply getting better as they go along, yet, what can they do next to top this? We will have to wait and see<br/><br/>Giancarlo's Rating: ***"
