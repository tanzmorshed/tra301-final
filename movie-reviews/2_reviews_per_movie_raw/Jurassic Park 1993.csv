"ivo-cobra8","10","156","169","10 October 2015"," A Spielberg Cult Classic Film and a great science fiction action adventure film of all time.
","Jurassic Park is a 1993 American science fiction adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg. It is the first installment of the Jurassic Park film series. It is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton, with a screenplay written by Crichton and David Koepp. The film centers on the fictional Isla Nublar, an islet located off Central America's Pacific Coast, near Costa Rica, where a billionaire philanthropist and a small team of genetic scientists have created a wildlife park of cloned dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is the second Steven's Spielberg Classic cult Film. A great science fiction/action/adventure film. This film is great edge of your seat action sequences. It has a wonderful cast with wonderful performance of their characters. John Williams music score is excellent the same like is in Indiana Jones films. Beside Raiders of the Lost Ark is the second Best classic movie in the franchise. Jurassic Park (1993) was nominated for 3 Academy Awards for Best Sound, Best Effects, Sound Effects Editing and Visual Effects.<br/><br/>I love this film to death! It is been 22.years since we got this awesome adventure dinosaurs flick. I know a couple of friends of mine that love this film including me. It is a cult classic film and It has a heart. We have Tyrannosaurus Rex chasing the group, Velociraptors chasing Tim and Lex after they are reaching the visitor center and they are in inside the main kitchen. Dilophosaurus killing Nerdy. We also have Triceratops in it and Brachiosaurus. They are other dinosaurs used in the film: Gallimimus, Parasaurolophus and Alamosaurus they both had a cameo scene in it.<br/><br/>The special effects creating the dinosaurs by Stan Winston are FANTASTIC! The dinosaurs were created with groundbreaking computer-generated imagery by Industrial Light & Magic and with life-sized animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winston's team. To showcase the film's sound design, which included a mixture of various animal noises for the dinosaur roars, Spielberg invested in the creation of DTS, a company specializing in digital surround sound formats. Stan Winston and his team did a great job animating live Dinosaurs on a screen. Steven Spielberg did a wonderful job directing this film, it is definitely my second best childhood film from Steven Spielberg. The first best film would be Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) which I love this film to death. The screen play written by Michael Crichton and David Koepp did a great job and the plot of the film was just awesome.<br/><br/>The plot: During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.<br/><br/>The crew cast all did a wonderful job of acting. The acting of this film was terrific and believable.<br/><br/>Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant, a leading paleontologist did a wonderful job portraying his character. He act the character like he was written on his skin. Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler, a paleobotanist. did a wonderful job like how she cared about an ill Triceratops. I was really surprised how the character cares about an ill dinosaurs that she barely know and she wanted to help him was out stating! Laura Dern for me in this film was a heart and a key watching this film of how a good hearted person she is. Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician and chaos theorist was really good in his acting and his character. Richard Attenborough as John Hammond, InGen's billionaire CEO and the park's creator was awesome playing his character. It is really a shame Richard Attenborough died last year and he isn't with us anymore. Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello as Lex and Tim did a wonderful job portraying John Hammonds grand children. I didn't know Samuel L. Jackson was in this film I really didn't know that. The whole cast was awesome in here.<br/><br/>Music by score by John Williams is fabulous and fantastic I always love this song to death.<br/><br/>There is everything in this film I love. How Dr. Grant, Lex and Tim are fighting to survive when they are trapped alone in the park. How tough and strong they are they don't panic and screaming they are fighting to come back save home. Lex and Tim are cornered by a pair of raptors inside the main kitchen. In one of the most terrifying scenes in the entire film, the raptors stalk through the dark kitchen, searching for the kids. Eventually, Lex and Tim manage to lure one of the raptors into the freezer and lock it in, but the other raptor chases them out of the kitchen. The scene was the most memorable to me and terrifying. Another terrifying scene is when Ellie discovers Ray's severed arm in the maintenance shed and she sees the raptor that eat Ray try's to eat her, that also scared me a lot. After the power was cut off on the electric fences and the kids with Alan are climbing over the fences and the power is turn back on by Ellie and Ray the fence electrifies Tim and he fly's down off the fence. The scene was awesome but also terrifying and real.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what else you would want in a movie like this?! It is a perfect 10. I love this film to death! I love this film to death!! The action sequences are also awesome, the plot, the cast everything is great about this film."
"bluemoonrising26","10","101","112","22 November 2011"," Criminally Underrated By IMDb!
","Simply one of the greatest films of all time. How on Earth it is only rated as 7.9/10 I'll never know.<br/><br/>It has a great plot, structured of course around Michael Crichton's equally brilliant novel, and the graphics are absolutely superb. Jurassic Park, along with the sequel 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park', had Dinosaurs that were actually convincing. Of course, there was some artistic license involved - certain behaviours of the animals were exaggerated or entirely fabricated - but that in no way detracts from the film. They are certainly better than those in the comparably average third instalment in the franchise, 'Jurassic Park III'. Living in the 21st century (or 20th, as it were) this film gave us a recreation of these creatures that was genuinely believable.<br/><br/>For all their fancy graphics and obscene budgets, films such as 'Avatar' will never compare to the likes of Jurassic Park."
"FrankBooth_DeLarge","10","350","408","5 September 2005"," A Groundbreaking, Heart Stomping, Dino Sized film
","In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.<br/><br/>The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn't seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn't the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.<br/><br/>This is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn't even in the top 250. Today, people don't appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90's, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn't understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.<br/><br/>This spawned two sequels. The second one wasn't bad, but the third wasn't very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.<br/><br/>The story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone's life is at stake.<br/><br/>The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.<br/><br/>Younger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren't scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.<br/><br/>Watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.<br/><br/>Enjoy"
"STACorpus","10","163","193","4 October 2005"," incredible movie
","Even though it was adapted from a book, this unique story was destined to become an incredible film. Great casting, decent acting, great special effects, beautiful and perfect score by John Williams, incredible directing. I believe this movie has to be one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Although not entirely true to the book, (though someone should never say a movie is not good because it is not exactly like the book because that really doesn't matter) Steven Spielberg made this story a landmark in special effects and a standard for thriller films to be compared to. It also contains some scenes that are instant classics, such as the first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the scene where the T-Rex chases the jeep. I will keep this movie in my list of favorites and classics till the day i die."
"Go_rated_R","Null","390","479","16 August 2001"," One of the greatest films ever made.
","I don't know why I loved this movie so much.  Maybe it was the utter amazement when I first saw the Brachiosaurus eat from a tree.  Or maybe it was my adrenaline rushing when two 12 year old were attacked by velociraptors.  It might possibly be the chills that went down my spine when the T-Rex first made his terrifying roar.  Whatever it was, it made me write this review.<br/><br/>Allan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie (Laura Dern) are two successful paleontologists who are asked by a rich man John Hammond to come at his park for a major tour.  They agree and are taken to an island where ""Jurassic Park"" logos are everywhere.  The two paleontologists have no idea what they are getting themselves into.  The first dinosaur to make an apearance is the Brachiosaurus, which both of them are extrememly amazed by its giant apearance, and so is the audience.  What the two of them don't know is that there are much more terrifying and carnivorous dinosaurs who are about to escape and run loose....<br/><br/>Directed by the mighty Steven Speilberg, Jurassic Park relied on more character development than any other creature-feature.  Usually you get second-rate actors who can't act, getting terrified by monsters that don't really exist.  Jurassic Park was the opposite.  It changed the way we looked at the world, and it will forever.  Based on the novel by Micheal Crichton, Jurassic Park was an amazing movie.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, Jurassic Park bedazzled us with dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs that are EXTINCT.  There are a lot of cool cameos and the stars give great performances.  The whole family should watch this movie.  Not for the glossy title, but because of the dinosaurs.  I remember being a kid when I first watched it, and I remember loving this movie so bad.  The climax was excellent, and I am not saying what happens, unlike the sequel to this film (Jurassic Park 3).  A climax-less bad film, that was.  But this....this was magic.  And yes, it was a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The magic of this film is what brought me into dinosaurs, too.  I had a ""Jurassic Park"" marathon today and I watched this movie, and I can still feel the magic.  You will feel the magic too once you see it.  I just have absolutely nothing to say except that Steven Speilberg will put a spell on you.  Even if you don't like creature-features, this movie will entertain you.  Steven Speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will. And the ""life will find a way"" speech is here, ready to make someone feel that creating dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years is a good thing.<br/><br/>Absolutely needless to say, Jurassic Park was a golden diamond.<br/><br/>10/10 (One of the greatest films ever made)"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","53","62","18 November 2003"," A time when I thought dinosaurs were real
","My first epic movie to see on the big screen was Jurassic Park. I was only 8 years old and I had no idea what I was in for when I watched this movie. I was terrified but so enchanted by this world. Steven Spielberg brought back the dinosaur genre, a genre that was only used with caveman movies. Not to mention did it with incredible special effects. I remember seeing this movie for the first time and asked my mom if the dinosaurs were real or if they made giant robots. Those dinosaurs not only looked real but were absolutely terrifying. But what an adventure we took with Jurassic Park, the land where anything could happen with a crazy billionaire and upset employees who pretty much destroy the world for a nickel. One of the most memorable movies of all time that still holds up to this day, Jurassic Park is a film not to be missed.<br/><br/>Billionaire John Hammond, has recently created Jurassic Park: a theme park populated with dinosaurs cloned from the DNA extracted from insects preserved in prehistoric amber. After a park worker is attacked by a dinosaur, Hammond's investors, demand that experts visit the park and verify that it is safe. Gennaro invites Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician, while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler. They are joined on the island by Hammond's two grandchildren Tim and Lex. Hammond asks Malcolm, Grant, and Sattler what their thoughts are about having recreated dinosaur species. The group sets off to explore the park. The head computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, is secretly in the employ of one of InGen's corporate rivals, and has been paid to steal fertilized dinosaur embryos. During his theft, Nedry deactivates the park's security system, allowing him access to the embryo storage. The group is now parked in front of the T-Rex's cage and now they are fighting for their lives in Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>I think one of the most memorable scenes is definitely the raptors chasing the children in the kitchen. What a tense scene that made you hold your breath the whole way through. You have to love Jeff Goldblum in this movie, when he tries to ""save"" the children from the T-Rex and instead pretty much gets his butt kicked, he gets saved later and as they are chased in the car by the T-Rex the only thing he can say as this giant monster is catching up faster and faster with each footstep, he says ""must go faster"" so calmly, how funny! But there is a moment that scares me more than the dinosaurs that I'm surprised no one noticed in the editing room, the granddaughter is scared to death screaming at Sam Neill that the lawyer left them and he replies with a dark look ""that's not what I'm going to do"". I responded that with ""I have much darker plans for you"", I mean his look was just so creepy! I digress, Jurassic Park is still a very fun movie that is the ultimate adventure. It's timeless and I can't wait to show my kids one day, what a great movie with wonderful effects and a wonderful cast and crew.<br/><br/>9/10"

","What can I say? Jurassic Park is one of the most underrated movies ever. Yes, I did say underrated. True, it is the fourth highest grossing movie ever (for the time being) and was a motion picture bible for eight-year-olds across the country, but it has never been regarded as artistically superior. When, in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive movies ever. It contains all of Spielberg's magical strokes of genius from fantastic art direction and wonderful camera techniques to astounding technical quality ( which comes from his well known control over technology). The minor flaws of a theme park are masterfully embedded into the art direction, script etc. and the acting is superb. This is one of the only movies I've seen with great acting by children. Spielberg's camera usage ranges from foreshadowing the appearance of dinosaurs with extreme up-angles to exquisitely composed scenes of the dinosaurs' ""interaction"" with the characters. Aside from technical quality, Jurassic Park bears powerful social messages of human intrusion and destruction of natural environment and the self-revering nature of man. Also, it had an undeniable effect on cinema being one of the first movies to use CGI at such a large scale. However, the most ingenious aspect of the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs as animals rather than ruthless monsters. At many times throughout the movie, the humans are portrayed as antagonists and the respect and appreciation of the dinosaurs is wonderfully developed. And, best of all, like star wars you can analyze the movie all you want or just sit back and enjoy the ride."
"stephie-12","10","176","222","26 February 2004"," Groundbreaking!
","This was obviously the most sophisticated portrayal of dinosaurs at the time, and it doesn't age a bit.  Sam Neill plays Dr Alan Grant, a paleontologist who is persuaded to check out Richard Attenborough's new theme park, only to find that he has managed to clone dinosaurs.  There is plenty of action, and the dinos look so real as to be positively scary!  Sam Neill puts in his usual incredibly brilliant performance, and you can really believe he is acting with the creatures!  Jeff Goldblum as usual seems to play himself, as Professor Ian Malcolm, an expert in chaos theory who is convinced the park is a bad idea.  The cast are amazing, the effects are amazing, this whole movie is amazing.  It doesn't get any better than this!"

","''Life, uh... finds a way.''<br/><br/>One of the best & most iconic movie quotes of all times.<br/><br/>I don't know what can I say about this movie that hasn't been said. Really...<br/><br/>Considering this movie was made in 1993, visual effects are of incredible quality, as you see it better on blu-ray. When it comes to story, it's completely original, nearly flawless. I can't say too much about the acting. I believe acting is not the movie's strongest point. But still, it was enough for that movie. You don't need to be like Marlon Brando in a sci-fi movie about dinosaurs and has great visual & sound effects. The movie is very fun to watch.<br/><br/>I also sensed a small message like, ''don't mess with nature''.<br/><br/>Best thing about the movie (for me) was the score. Especially the ''Welcome to Jurassic Park'' scene. Of course we're talking about John Williams, the guy who wrote the theme for Star Wars, so that's not a surprise.<br/><br/>Highly recommend it.<br/><br/>9/10"

","JURASSIC PARK was the film that ignited my interest in filmmaking and drove me to get a degree in it, so I will always have a soft spot for it. I was eleven when I read the book, but all the technical stuff lost me and I never finished it. A couple years later when I heard the movie was coming out, I decided I would just see it instead. With advance tickets selling out fast, my mom was lucky enough to get some a few days before it's premiere. We stood in line for roughly thirty minutes before we finally got in. Even as the lights were dimming, I still had no idea what to expect. Within moments I was glued to my seat. The opening sequences remains one of my favorite scenes in any film and continues to give me goosebumps to this day. For the next two hours, I sat in my seat just staring at the screen as these marvelous, life-like creatures that were unlike anything I had ever seen before. The film was full of awe and scares. I walked out of the theater virtually trying to catch my breath. What a thrill ride the film had been, and I eventually went back and saw it a few more times. The film was a turning point in my life, as I said, because I walked out saying to myself, ""That's what I want to do."" Sure the characters aren't deep and the dialogue isn't great, but who cares when the film is this entertaining? The actors are good in their parts, especially the always great Sam Neill, and the dinosaurs are incredibly life-like. The action is great, and the pacing (after a slow start) is relentless. The film has a few continuity flaws, but none of them matter. This film is great entertainment."
"Pythonman","9","197","259","8 June 2005"," As said, the Definitive blockbuster movie
","What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? Who knows. We all know that this has some of the greatest special effects, even today. Also, if there's anything that can match the awesome T-Rex, it's the movie's musical score. I swear, listen to it more than once, and you're bound to see the movie yet again, if for that sole reason. It's that powerful. Oh sure, acting isn't this movie's strong suit, but who looks for acting in a Dinosaur thriller? Who?!<br/><br/>Anyway, I think I've made my point. Jurassic Park: One of America's greatest classics. Steven Spielberg created magic with this movie. If you haven't seen it once, you haven't seen it at all."
"rahmannoodles22","10","22","25","19 December 2013"," Welcome to Jurassic Park.... Noodles Review
","Look up the word ""awe"" in the dictionary... ya know what you'll find? Jurassic Park. And now in 3D! Usually, I don't really like post- converted 3D in movies, but this one won me over. Ever since I was a little kid, I've always loved Jurassic Park (I think we all did) and I'd always heard that it was one of the best movie theater experiences ever. Unfortunately, I wasn't born when this originally came out so I never got the chance to experience that... until now! And damn, were they right when they said it was an awesome movie theater experience because it sure as hell is. It's so fun, engrossing, and thrilling to watch it on the big screen, with all the sound surrounding you (the sound in Jurassic Park has got to be some of the best sound in a movie ever). Jurassic Park is also one of the most monumental movies of all time. It defined CGI. The CGI and special effects in this movie still holdup today and are even better than most movies today.<br/><br/>The story of Jurassic Park is that a really rich guy has cloned dinosaurs to make an amusement park full of living dinosaurs (you would do that if you could too). Because they are these live dinosaurs in the park, his investors say that he needs approval from experts, so he recruits Dr. Alan Grant (a paleontologist who is more or less the protagonist of the movie), Dr. Elli Sattler (a paleobotanist), and Dr. Ian Malcom (a mathematician who's character is pretty much the show stealer). Through a number of circumstances, the dinosaurs get loose and all hell breaks loose. Now, we have our movie being one of the most awe- inspiring movies ever; as well as being one of the most suspenseful movies ever. When the characters first enter Jurassic Park, you see the many dinosaurs in the distance and the theme (one of the greatest movie themes of all time) is playing in the background. Your jaw just drops. And the dinosaurs look awesome. Sometimes they're CGI, sometimes they're animatronic. Sometimes they're amazing... oh wait, that's all the time. One of my favourite scenes is when the T-Rex is attacking the car and a flashlight shines in its eye and the eye dilates. That just shows how detailed and alive these dinos are.<br/><br/>But the dinosaurs don't wreak havoc until about halfway, or even 3/4, through the film. Even yet, the movie does a brilliant job of immersing you into it, bringing you onto this island, and getting you to care for the characters. The dialogue and acting are so good that you feel as though you're there with the characters (it drags sometimes but it's easy to get past that). And when they're in peril, you feel as though you're in danger too. I just can't stress how substantial the suspense in Jurassic Park is. The 3D does add to that, too. The 3D in this movie is probably the best post-converted 3D I've ever seen and it works really well.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is really a movie that everyone should experience (notice how I didn't say ""watch""). If you get the chance, see it in theaters and have your mind absolutely blown. The movie is full of awe and imagination; it sometimes makes me feel like a little kid again. The characters are likable; their dialogue is believable and sometimes humorous. The dinosaurs are awesome. The suspense is intense as hell. The soundtrack is perfect. It's a classic..."

","Steven Spielberg is known for making great movies like, ""E.T."" and ""Schindler's List"". But on June 11 1993. He released my favorite movie, ""Jurassic Park"".<br/><br/>What make's this movie great is the special effects. They really brought the Dinosaurs to life. It also had some nice suspenseful scene's. Also, the acting was good. Sam Neil does a nice job as Alan Grant and Richard Attenborough does a great job as John Hammond. Plus, the theme song was incredible. Sometimes when you listen to it, it feel's like you're going to cry.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Jurassic Park"", is a great film and it is definitely worth watching."
"Dragoneyed363","10","120","158","4 May 2008"," The best dinosaur movie there is; one of the best movies in general
","I first saw this back when I was little. If I remember correctly, it was also a big thing when it came out. I even had a backpack with a Velociraptor head sticking out of it for school. It was such an amazing achievement as a movie itself and the film is so wonderfully done that there's no doubt of why it has held up as long as it has and will remain the best dinosaur film ever created.<br/><br/>The dinosaurs in this film look more realistic than any other prehistoric film, or even most movies today that try to pass off crappy CGI has reality. The acting was spectacular, and aside from how wonderful the creatures look and how vicious and exciting they were like no other dinosaur film had had them before, the plot and characters were solid and incredibly entertaining where you didn't think they would be so amusing. <br/><br/>I will have to say again that one really huge reason why most people loved this movie was because of the special effects, but here again, isn't that an accomplishment in itself? Having your audience enjoy the film because of how realistic and fresh you are able to make it feel and look? I have never seen another movie with better effects than this one, ever. I am sure none of these horrible effects dinosaur movies that have been coming out lately could ever live up to the greatness of Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>I am always going to love Jurassic Park for it's witty, unbelievable maneuvers and incredible screenplay though, as well. It was so properly thought out and executed, where most might have been expecting it to be nothing but high levels of adrenaline rushes with brainless action, which there was pulsating action, it just certainly wasn't as mindless. Many who dislike Jurassic Park really just have all the same reasons the average movie-goer would have for disliking a film, yet I haven't heard anyone fully describe and explain, well, what they truly thought were faults with this film, which gives me reason to believe that Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, for I, myself, have no faults with this film, except that I have seen other films that I enjoyed more. . . just a little more."

If you haven't seen this movie yet, get out from your cave and see it right away. I have seen this movie umpteen times and it still shocks and suprises me. If you have a DVD player I suggest that you buy the Jurassic Park 2 pack as soon as possible. The movie sounds and looks great, and the extras are cool too. So to summarize go see this. Spielberg is a true genius. Almost all of his movies were great. 10/10!"
"Rob Paul","Null","100","132","9 July 1999"," Still a land mark in film making
","It's hard to believe that it's 6 years since this film appeared at the cinemas. At the time it was a truly ground-breaking film, managing for the first time to portray dinosaurs in an extremely realistic manner, unlike those plasticine monsters that we were forced to watch in previous monster movies. Jurassic Park will also be remembered as the movie that finally made George Lucas sit up and realise that it was possible for him to make his prequels.<br/><br/>In hindsight, while it is still an extremely well directed and tension filled movie, the script did seemed dumbed down in order to appeal to as many people as possible - but that's really irrelevant since this film is all about dinosaurs. One of Spielberg's brilliantly directed films, it even managed to make me forget Spielberg's previous disaster of a movie - do you recall HOOK?<br/><br/>8/10."
"Leporinum","10","22","26","18 June 2015"," Unlike anything the world had ever seen before.
","This movie was released during my childhood while I was already a dinosaur enthusiast. I saw it 2 times at the cinema and as far as I can remember these were the only 2 times I ever saw an audience applaud at the end. It made an big impression. Computer generated images were new at that time and we didn't know what to expect. But I think I can speak for everyone if I say we were blown away. The dinosaurs looked so real. And even in the years after that computer generated images in other movies were just not as good and realistic as in Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>Another thing that made this movie is the soundtrack. John Williams (the composer) absolutely nailed it! The music at the arrival to the island combined with the the adventure ahead was just breathtaking.<br/><br/>So you have a good story, good actors (I loved Jeff Goldblum for his humor), state of the art special effects and an thrilling adventure. This makes it still my number one of all time and I don't expect that to change anytime soon (or ever)."
"sophiebrooks-75145","9","10","11","28 September 2018"," Such a classic.
","This movie is definitely one to remember. Despite being filmed in the 90s, Jurassic Park continues to be a classic to this day. 
Watching the movie now highlights the contrast between the effects then and the special effects available now. This, along with some acting that is a tad overdone, are the only real critiques I would give this film. 
The child actors were especially hilarious to me-the young boy, Timmy, has moments that really capture a reaction that a child in real life would have (""I threw up."" ""Well that's ok! That happens sometimes""-Allen-is one of my favorite quotes). 
Another extremely influential aspect of this film is the music that plays over certain intense scenes and the iconic theme music in the opening/closing. The music combined with the diegetic sound of the dinosaur stomping/approaching builds the suspense and creates an intense tension in the audience. 
As a classic worldwide, it's no wonder that this movie provided the basis for generations of movies to follow."
"OlieRendch","10","13","15","26 August 2013"," A milestone in cinematic history, a huge achievement in CGI effects, and by the most well-known director in the world.
","Jurassic Park. An island full of dinosaurs who terrorise people; a simple premise but extremely well done. From beginning to end this film is just an enjoyable watch. Back in 1993 when it was released these never-before-seen effects had to have wowed audiences, and even now it still holds up with the anamatronics, CGI combo, it is really good; I've seen worst stuff in other movies and TV series. The characters I thought were pretty well done and acted, you really didn't want certain things happen to certain people and I really like Sam Neil as Alan Grant. Now, I was really exited to watch my favourite film on the big screen and especially in 3D, I watched it in IMAX as well, something I had never done before, and boy did it deliver. The 3D in this movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, better than Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 by far. Jurassic Park in the third dimension brought a whole new life too it, just some of the scenes with the trees, and leaves and then an awesome scene in the kitchen was good in 3D. So yes, I think Jurassic Park will continue being my favoured film for a long time to come."

","This movie is simply a legend. A date in history of cinema.With Terminator 2, Jurassic Park is one of the first movie that shows wonderful CGI. And now, it is forever one of the best, until his 21 years. Everything is just awesome. Spielberg at the summum of his art, John Williams create another time a legendary ost, and all the actors are just more than best, and especially two of the them. Richard Attenborough(RIP) play John Hammond, owner of Ingen and creator of Jurassic park. He is a very great actor (and director). He don't play John Hammond, for everybody who love cinema, he is John Hammond. And Sam Neil, what can i say about him ? Simply he is one genius. He is at the best with playing Alan Grant. For some people, he became just one role. Watching him in another program, i am sur that somebody would automatically said : it's the guy from Jurassic Park, Doctor Grant ! And that is the best for an actor, he leave his mark in the collective inconscious. Sam Neil is more an actor, he is a great man."

","After a worker is killed in an accident at the dinosaur theme park 'Jurassic Park' owner John Hammond calls in experts Dr Alan Grant and Dr Ellie Sattler as well as mathematician Ian Malcolm to visit it the park and clear it to open to the public. 'Jurassic Park' is no ordinary theme park; it is on a remote island off the coast of Costa Rica and it contains real dinosaurs! It is explained how these have been created by extracting dinosaur DNA from blood in mosquitoes preserved in amber. The first ones the visitors see are harmless herbivores but they are told that the park also contains some of the most famous carnivores such as Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor; something that both excites and concerns the scientists. After an introduction the visitors, along with Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim, and the company lawyer take part in a tour of the park. As they travel things go wrong for two reasons; a tropical storm is heading for the island and, more importantly, a corrupt company employee as set up a computer program that will turn off various security systems including the electric fences that protect the guests so he can attempt to steal dinosaur DNA sell it to a competitor. Once things do go wrong those on the tour find themselves fleeing for their lives following a T Rex attack on their vehicles while those at the park headquarters try to find a way to get the systems working again. Inevitably not everybody will get out alive.<br/><br/>Like most people who watched this in the cinema when it was new I was amazed by the special effects that brought long extinct creatures back to life; watching it again over twenty years later and they still look fantastic. If one didn't know that dinosaurs died out millions of years ago you could be excused for thinking you were watching real animals. While these were the films big selling point it would have been for nothing if we didn't also have a good story acted by a fine cast luckily we have both. The action isn't rushed; a significant amount of time is spent introducing all the main characters and explaining the characteristics of the various dinosaurs. This means that by the time everything goes wrong we care about the protagonists and know which characters to look forward to seeing die! There aren't a huge number of deaths and those there are aren't overly gruesome; the goriest moment is the brief sight of a severed arm. Despite its UK-PG rating it is surprisingly intense at times and has plenty of genuinely scary moments. The cast do an impressive job; Sam Neill and Laura Dern impress as the two leads and there are also fine performances from Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeff Goldblum and Bob Peck. Child characters are often annoying but Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards are pretty good as Tim and Lex; especially the latter who is a great screamer! Overall I'd defiantly recommend this to anybody wanting a genuinely exciting film that is suitable for most ages."

","It still baffles me why this brilliant movie isn't in the top 250 movies for IMDB! it's amazing! I think this is the kind of film that people take too seriously and don't see the obvious reasons what make this such a great movie.  For one such as ""Jurassic Park"" it represents everything a summer blockbuster should be, (and why Spielberg is the king of 'blockbuster summer' movies).<br/><br/>In all fairness, a film like this is only worth watching for the special effects (which still remain top-notch).  It is a dinosaur movie- it does exactly what it says on the tin- it thrills and amazes and never lets up, it is perfect popcorn fare and not since ""Jaws"" (the first proper summer blockbuster!) has a film so brilliantly had such an affect on movies which were to follow. Essentially it is ""Jaws"" on-land and it does so perfectly, with great pace great set-pieces.  I wish this film was in the top 250, if any movie deserves it , ""Jurassic Park"" does, not just for being such a great film but also for revolutionising films from there on out!!<br/><br/>Brilliant!!!"

","Perhaps more so than any other director in film history, Steven Spielberg has locked into that most desirable niche of movie-making: pleasing everyone at the same time. When his spectacular action-adventure Jurassic Park was first released in 1993, he left critics, film buffs, casual viewers, parents and children equally spellbound. Twenty years later, the film has been re-released in both 3D and IMAX, allowing a new generation to experience the magic, and old fans the chance to relive it again.<br/><br/>Eccentric millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created the ultimate theme park on a secluded island, and he wants to offer a sneak preview to a select group of individuals (Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern). Of course, the prehistoric attractions don't much appreciate being detained for the amusement of others, and begin to cause havoc as soon as they take the opportunity to escape from their enclosures. An extremely imaginative plot adapted from Michael Crichton's novel of the same name, it sets the foundation for a rip-roaring battle for survival.<br/><br/>For many viewers that first saw Jurassic Park as pre-teens, the greatest thrill will come from appreciating, to a greater degree, the way the film deftly builds suspense. Cleverly building up to the revelation of the 'meatasauruses' by stunning us with the visual treat of cuddly herbivores, when we do finally meet the imposing Tyrannosaurus, it is one of cinema's most exhilarating set pieces, only to be topped some time later by the thrilling cat-and-mouse game in the kitchen.<br/><br/>It is a testament to the incredible skill of the animatronics and visual effects team that the film's most dated quality is the occasionally cheesy dialogue that burdens Lex and little brother Tim. The dinosaurs are clearly the main event, but the undercard of Jurassic Park spares no expense, with touches of class including Dr. Grant's personal evolution from a child apathist to a fully-fledged family man and a miasma of Shelley-esque criticisms of man's innate desire to play god while drunk on the illusion of total control.<br/><br/>To call this the movie event of the year would be to make the grossest of understatements. Experiencing this glorious monument to total escapism on the world's biggest cinema screen is simply mandatory for anyone was has ever felt goosebumps in a theater. Bring your kids- they'll never forget it.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

Jackson, Wayne Knight, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards.<br/><br/>The film is based on a novel from Michael Crichton the book come out 1990 the movie come out 1993 and Michael Crichton helped writing a script for the film. It was brilliant direction from Steven Spielberg about scientists tampering with nature, the film is also mixed with horror in which velociraptor try's to eat Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) who finds a Ray Arnold's arm (Samuel L. Jackson). The effects are top notch, the CGI for 1993 is still good I love the design for T-Rex and the velociraptor fighting on the end. I love Brachiosaurus in this movie I love those dinosaurs so much.<br/><br/>The story is original a group of scientist cloned dinosaurs they about to open a amusement park for people lead by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) who invites on a island of Isla Nublar, four people paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and a lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) to gave him their opinions. All three disagree with John Hammond that tempered with nature is wrong and only a lawyer agrees with John because he thinks the park will make a fortune. One of the employees Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) is planning to steal dinosaur eggs and during a preview tour, he causes a security power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok. Dr. Grant stays with the kids Tim (Joseph Mazzello) and Lex (Ariana Richards) alone in the park and he has to return to resort complex, meanwhile John Hammond, Dr. Ellie Sattler, Ian Malcolm, Ray Arnold and Robert Muldon (Bob Peck) trying to get the power back.<br/><br/>I love Dr. Alan Grant I love the character he was a great hero, great adventurer great paleontologist and great researcher. I love Sam Neill his character was writen on his skin. I love the kids Tim and Lex Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards they were great kids who were Hammond's grandchildren I love them. The most heart in the film was Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) because she cared about the animals she was a great human been she wanted to help a sick triceratops which I love the character so much. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) I really miss the actor I love his character I love what he try to do I love him to dead it is a shame he is no longer with us. I like Dr. Ian Malcolm in this movie he wasn't annoying in this movie Jeff Goldblum was likable and decent.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes in the movie are: The T-Rex chases the jeep down the road with Dr. Sattler, Ian Malcolm and Robert Muldon in an exciting car chase of an action sequence. I love in which Dr. Grant and kids are climbing over the fences and the fences are electricity high voltage the fence electrifies Tim and he fly's down off the fence great breathtaking scene ever. I love that scene. I love the action sequence in which Lex and Tim are cornered by a pair of velociraptors inside the main kitchen and fight for their survival. Another favorite scene of mine is when Ellie discovers Ray's severed arm in the maintenance shed and she sees the raptor that eat Ray try's to eat her. I really miss this movies and I miss my childhood. My best friend from my childhood was a huge fan of this film he collected comic books, action figures and he borrowed me his VHS tape of this film because I never seen the film before and I loved it.<br/><br/>I love this film to death it has everything atmosphere, good wonderful effects, good scares, awesome thrills, breathtaking suspense on your sit, wonderful directing, great acting from everyone everything that makes the best movie in the adventure animal franchise.

","I will start off by saying the novel Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton is my favourite novel of all time. I first read it when I was 12, and about a year before the movie came out.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I was pumped for the film. I loved dinosaurs since I was six years old and couldn't wait for the movie.<br/><br/>Even at that age I was a movie buff and knew that movie adaptions of books are never 100% accurate. And Jurassic Park was no different.<br/><br/>Obviously marketed towards young children, the movie toned down a lot of the violence which happened in the novel. Understandably. But the movie was still full of jump scares and still retained the adventurous side of the novel down to a T.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg always amazes and this film possessed the cutting edge of technology at the time. The CGI and practical effects were amazing. This is how a movie with CGI should look like today. Have real environments with CGI elements. Unlike most movies today where 99% of the screen is CGI.<br/><br/>Steven takes us on an amazing adventure through Jurassic Park along with fine actors such as Sam Neil, Jeff Goldblum, Linda Dream and Sir Richard Attenborough. The science behind the movie made it seem like it could really bring dinosaurs to life.<br/><br/>I always wondered what a dinosaur would look like. And Jurassic Park showed me. A beautifully shot film with an equally beautiful score by John Williams.<br/><br/>Check out the novel if you haven't read it as well"

Today I can watch this movie and still be thrilled by the product. Being older now I see the appeal to both children and adults. The characters are relate able and you feel immersed in the Jurassic experience. The music is amazing and adds to the adventurous feel of Jurassic Park. As a kid I saw many adult characters as role models and now I watch and laugh at all their clever quotes.

"estebangonzalez10","10","5","5","9 June 2015"," My all-time favorite movie going experience
","""God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs.""<br/><br/>Since we're only a couple of days away from the premiere of Jurassic World I wanted to share some thoughts on one of my all time favorite movie going experiences (perhaps my favorite). I was only 12 years old when Steven Spielberg released Jurassic Park in 1993 and from the second the movie started I was at the edge of my seat. From the breathtaking and groundbreaking visuals, to the outstanding cast, and the magnificent score everything about Jurassic Park made me fall in love with it. The dinosaurs had come to life before my very eyes, and Spielberg masterfully wrote a thrilling script that had me sweating for two full hours. I can never forget the thrills I felt during the T-rex scene and that final climax with the velociraptors in the museum's kitchen. I remember thinking there was no one cooler than Sam Neill's Alan Grant and I wanted to be Tim Murphy (played brilliantly by Joseph Mazzello). The rest of the cast was also amazing: Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Ariana Richards, Bob Peck, and Samuel L. Jackson. Many will consider Jaws as Steven Spielberg's most terrifying film, but for me it was Jurassic Park because I got to experience it on the big screen and it was my first memorable experience at a theater. I had seen many other films that had made an impact on me prior to this (Star Wars, The Goonies, Raiders of the Lost Arc, and E.T.) but none in a theater, so Jurassic Park holds that nostalgic value and it will forever remain one of my favorite films. It also became the first film I went to see again at a theater because I couldn't get enough of this world. There are so many quotable lines from this movie and many memorable scenes, and I realize it is going to be impossible for Jurassic World to live up to that standard but I am still highly anticipating it while I relive some of my childhood memories with Jurassic Park. It's a masterpiece."
"ironhorse_iv","9","8","9","6 April 2013"," Hold on to your butts, it's now in 3D. Jurassic Park is Rex!
","I don't really like paying for movie tickets just to watch old movies converted into 3D. I can watch the 2D version at home, with no cost. Still, Jurassic Park is one of those movies. No matter, if you watch it in 3D or 2D, your jaw will dropped seeing the realistic lifelike dinosaurs on screen. I had watch this movie over and over again over the years, and it always is a blast to watch. In my opinion, it's one of the best movies of the 1990's. Jurassic Park is the story of a theme park on a tropical island near Costa Rica, populated with cloned dinosaurs that turn amok, and those left on the island, must find a way to escape. Jurassic Park shows the potential danger of technology. Owner John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) spared no expense making this park, but in an attempt to increase efficiency and save money, wants Jurassic Park to be able to operate with a minimal number of staff run by weasel Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) and Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson). Therefore, he has the park designed to be operated almost entirely by a huge computer system that automates virtually all of the park's systems and functions. What he doesn't know is that Dennis Nedry, has been paid off by one of InGen's corporate rivals to steal dinosaur embryos. During the theft, Nedry deactivates the park's security system to allow him access to the embryo storage room. Jurassic Park was written by Michael Crichton in 1990, the beginning of the information age, where everything was getting computerizing, but few knew the dangers of it. People are still suffering from computer theft even today. Another danger of technology is how men shouldn't play God by cloning extinct animals. The movie mirrors the lesson teach in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Still the science in the film might be far-fetch. The idea of bringing dinosaurs to life after 65 million years is unlikely even with future technology. Soft tissues that contain DNA are nearly impossible to preserve and the chances of extracting enough DNA of a single dinosaur to produce one are slim. Still, it's interesting. If it does happen, you know that chaos will come close in hand. This serves as an example, where technology fails to keep us save, and prove disastrous. Still the movie fails to explain why Hammond didn't use all the staff that he has. They were paid to be there, so when the hurricane comes to the island. Surprising the film footage of the storm was Hurricane Iniki that hit Hawaii where they were filming. So that was really a hurricane that being shown there. Anyways it would make sense to have the staff there to make sure the island is secure, but he send them off the island for something that was a merely a small storm, keeping only two computer guys and a game hunter? What? The movie would be a little bit more interesting if only we, the audience got to see the whole staff in danger as well, like Michael Crichton earlier novel, 'Westworld' that has a similar plot. Instead we only see a small group of dinosaur experts try to escape the island rather than a whole island in chaos. This small group is leaded by paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern). Harrison Ford was first ask, but he turned down the role of Dr. Alan Grant as people might mistake the character for Indiana Jones. In my opinion, Sam Neill was perfect for the role. They are joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim Murphy (Joseph Mazzello). The kids are bit annoying as they do idiotic stuff or have stupid dialogue. Most of the movie, I really wanted them to get eaten by a dinosaur. It make sense for all those characters to be in the island, except Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), a mathematician that the lawyer brought in. While Jeff Goldblum is given some of the best lines in the film; the reason why his character is there is still a question to me. He doesn't know anything about dinosaurs. Still, I do like his flirting with Chaos Theory. The movie differs from the book in a bit. I'm glad Steven Spielberg took out the Hupia theme from the story. It wasn't needed. Different characters end up dying, while other characters that supposedly died in the book, live in the film version. Surprising the whole character of Tina was written out of the film. The film has amazing visual and special effects by the use of animatronics. The film is noted as one of the first movies to use CGI. Director Steven Spielberg was worried that computer graphics might look like 8 bit type cartoon quality but upon seeing ILM's demo animation of dinosaurs. He decided to shoot nearly all the dinosaur scenes using this method. In my opinion, the stop motion they did film wasn't too bad as well. The early CGI, this film use is surprising is better than a lot of modern day CGI that low budget companies use. Jurassic Park's soundtrack compost by John Williams is truly anthem of our childhood. The music is spectacular. Not a lot of people know this, but while Steven Spielberg work on Schindler's List, he placed post-production in the hands of George Lucas. In many ways, you can see Luca's influence in the film. It was while supervising post-production on this film that George Lucas decided that technology was good enough to begin work on the Star Wars prequels. The movie is a must- see movie, not only if you love dinosaurs, but also if you love Sci-Fiction. Give it a try if you haven't saw it already. An adventure 65 million years in the making is waiting for you."

","John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) creates this park called ""Jurassic Park"" where he recreates the dinosaurs using DNA found in fossils (but also having to use frog DNA to complete it - don't ask me why, I don't quite remember all the technical stuff).
But before Hammond can open it to the public, he has to get it approved. So, he hires some fossil finders (played by Sam Neill and Laura Dern) to go to the park and look through it without telling them what occupies the park. Anyway, they go there and Hammond gets them to take his grandchildren along after the fossil finders express concern about the park's safety with the dinosaurs. A hippie scientist-type guy Dr. Ian Malcolm (played by the great Jeff Goldblum) also accompanies them as well as a lawyer.
That's where things start to go wrong. The dinosaurs escape. I won't say anymore, though.
I loved it! I think it is one of the greatest films of all time and is certainly a classic. I don't understand why everyone thinks this film is scary. It's not - apart from a couple scenes like the start and something later on. A lot of film writers should watch this and take notes on how to do tension as this film has brilliant tension.
It has quite a good sense of humour, and ""Jurassic Park"" is generally suitable for children, though you might want to fast forward the very start and maybe one or two other scenes, but generally, I think that children can watch it, though it depends on the individual child and what they can or can't handle.
Another brilliant subplot in the film is with Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and his dislike for children. During most of the danger, he is stuck with Hammond's grandchildren. There is great chemistry between him and the children.
Jurassic Park is a brilliant movie.
Hats off to you, Mr Spielberg!"

","The focus of Steven Spielberg's ground-breaking thrill-ride Jurassic Park, is a wondrous island theme park off the coast of Costa Rica populated by genetically engineered dinosaurs, masterminded by billionaire visionary John Hammond (a superlative Richard Attenborough), ready for business as soon as a handful of experts can declare it legally and naturally safe for paying customers. Soon we see a group of scientists head to Isla Nublar including paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), his paleobotanist colleague Ellie Satler (Laura Dern), and mathematician Ian Malcolm (a fast- talking, vintage Jeff Goldblum), a chaos theorist who recognizes that knowledge without discipline equals disaster. Of course he's right, and the park's maiden tour turns into a nightmare for the visitors, who include Hammond's two precocious grandchildren. Compounding this mayhem is the park's systems-control expert, who plots to sell dinosaur DNA to a rival corporation, and must sabotage park security to carry out his scheme. When a tropical storm threatens the island, our unscrupulous employee seizes the opportunity, leaving the billion-dollar attractions to roam free, as all hell breaks loose. What ensues is special-effects nirvana!<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is an astonishing success in one sense and one sense only: It is the monster of all monster movies, guaranteed to challenge weak bladders and flutter heartbeats with its astounding full-size live-action mechanics and computer-generated imagery. But more than anything, it is Spielberg's pop culture wizardry that sells Jurassic Park. He retains a child-like glee in making us jump while giving flesh and blood characters the fright of their lives, with every mind-boggling moment of wonder and terror - from the gentle gracefulness of a gigantic Brachiosaurus walking across a green pasture to the horrifying attack of a T-Rex during a rainstorm to the first appearance of the dreaded Velociraptors. Spielberg orchestrates the action with effortless verve and, only the most Scrooge-like viewer will fail to be transfixed by the thrilling action and the sheer scale of the director's vision. T-Rex and his chums are indisputably the stars here but Jurassic Park is still a very character-driven movie, and part of what makes the film so successful is Spielberg's insistence that the dinosaurs may overrun the park, but never the film. Every character has something to do, and they are the focus of every scene with all actors pitching in commendable performances.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park exists now as one of the pinnacles of popcorn cinema - a terrific thrill ride that is more than just the sum of its special effects. It may be easy to look at Jurassic Park as of a bygone era, but no rose-colored glasses or nostalgic impulses are needed to remain in astonishment at what Spielberg was able to create. It remains as potent an entertainment as ever - a watershed moment in cinematic history!"

","Steven Spielberg's phenomenally successful sci-fi adventure thriller is graced by state-of-the-art special effects from the team of Stan Winston, Phil Tippett and Michael Lantieri from George Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic in this movie,Jurassic Park.It is based on the novel of the same title by Michael Crichton and it stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Ariana Richards, Joseph Mazzello, Martin Ferrero and Bob Peck. The story centers on the fictional Isla Nublar near Costa Rica in the Central American Pacific Coast, where a billionaire philanthropist and a small team of genetic scientists have created an amusement park of cloned dinosaurs.<br/><br/>The screenplay follows Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler,two dinosaur experts as they are invited by eccentric millionaire John Hammond to preview his new amusement park on an island off Costa Rica. By cloning DNA harvested from pre-historic insects, Hammond has been able to create living dinosaurs for his new Jurassic Park, an immense animal preserve housing real brachiosaurs, dilophosaurs, triceratops, velociraptors, and a Tyrannosaur Rex. Accompanied by cynical scientist Ian Malcolm, who is obsessed with chaos theory, and Hammond's two grandchildren, they are sent on a tour through Hammond's new resort in computer controlled touring cars. But as a tropical storm hits the island, knocking out the power supply, and an unscrupulous employee sabotages the system so that he can smuggle dinosaur embryos out of the park, the dinosaurs start to rage out of control. Grant then has to bring Hammond's grandchildren back to safety as the group is pursued by the gigantic man-eating beasts.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park remains an incredible viewing experience and it never ceases to be entertaining. It's not an entirely faithful adaptation of Michael Crichton's popular novel, but the creative liberties it takes prove enormously ingenious.There is a lot of good things to say about it like the performances are top notch, the score is brilliant, and the special effects still hold up at present times in what is easily one of Steven Spielberg's best sequences of sustained awe and sheer terror since Jaws."
"brando647","10","17","24","2 May 2008"," I LOVE this movie!
","This film is easily one of my favorite movies. I saw this movie when it came out in theaters back in 1993; I was only 9-years-old and, though some scenes scared the crap out of me, it blew me away. I was amazed at how, for the first time in a movie, I felt like I was watching REAL dinosaurs. For those who haven't seen this movie (there are people like that?), it centers on a billionaire's attempt to create a new amusement park on an isolated island creating bio-engineered dinosaurs; when a group of specialists are brought in to examine the park, things go terribly wrong.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the story of this film; I loved it so much I had my parents buy me Michael Crichton's novel and I read it 3 times through the course of my fifth grade year. It was then that I fell in love with the work of Crichton and found myself reading the rest of his work. While, yes, the movie did divert pretty heavily from the book, I still felt it was a great adaptation. It's Spielberg's version of Crichton's story, so I don't mind the mass differences. The movie is much more family-friendly than Crichton's novel and I would love to see a another version eventually, a darker version that sticks closer to Crichton's novel. Unlike most instances when I can say ""The book was better"" or ""The movie was better"", I don't feel the need in this case because they were both fantastic.<br/><br/>The cast did a terrific job. Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Richard Attenborough...all were great in their roles. Though my favorite performance came from Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm, the arrogant chaos theoretician. I've been a fan of Goldblum for a while and I thought he was the perfect choice for the role in this movie. Of course, I have to rave a bit about the film's special effects. As I mentioned before, this film contains probably the most realistic dinosaurs seen in cinema. A seamless combination of practical animatronics and CGI were used to bring the dinosaurs to life. By now, the effects seem a little dated but they continue to stand strong even now, 15 years later.<br/><br/>This movie is one of those films that every must see. It grossed $350 million in the US alone. The film marked yet another milestone in special effects in cinema. And most importantly, it's just entertaining."
"eamon-hennedy","10","10","13","11 June 2003"," The way all blockbusters should be...
","This is a film that has truly stood the test of time and has remained a modern classic of the Hollywood blockbuster system. Deservedly becoming the biggest film of all time in 1993 and launching the most entertaining film series ever made, Spielberg's film contains all the cliches a blockbuster should have and ensures that it remains good fun. We have the courageous scientist in the shape of Sam Niell, his fiesty girlfriend courtesy of Laura Dern, a doom and gloom expert in the causes of the problem at hand thanks to a brilliant performance from Bob Peck and the quirky scientist type who prophesises doom from the get go in the shape of Jeff Goldblum. This is fun and has remained so for the last ten years.<br/><br/>Where the film has remained so good over the past decade is in its use of CGI and at the time state of the art special effects. They still haven't dated and look fluidly real as if the technology had only been made yesterday. Undoubtedly the dinosaurs are the star here (none of the actors have headlined each film with a change of performer for each one, Goldblum in the second installment, Niell returning for number three), but it doesn't matter because the dinosaurs here are truly movie stars in their own right and like characters in an ensemble film they all get their moments. The T-Rex gets to cause spectacular destruction, the Raptors get to be the vicious and conniving villains of the story, the Brachiosaurus ensures it grabs our awe while the Tricerotops gains our sympathy.<br/><br/>However, Spielberg ensures that it isn't just the dinosaurs who are the stars here. He creates tension in the way that only he can with prolonged set pieces such as the T-Rex attack and the moment Alan and Tim have to race down a tree with the threat of a car falling on top of them. Sure it ain't art, it's great entertainment and it is great fun and it here where Spielberg ensures the film classic status. He uses the two hour frame to set up events and the story in the first hour and then let the chaos rip in the second with suspenseful action sequence after suspenseful action sequence and it works. While you may not look to performances in a film like this, it does have some fantastic actors. Niell seems surprisingly well suited to being a Spielbergian hero who starts of disliking children only to have his heart melted at the end. He appears to be having great fun playing the guy who saves the day. Jeff Goldblum almost runs away with the entire film as Malcolm, the quirky off beat nature of the character ensuring many a great one liner while Richard Attenborough is heart breaking as the Walt Disney like John Hammond whose dream becomes a violent nightmare.<br/><br/>The film is great fun from beginning to end and deserves to be up there with Jaws and King Kong as one of the all time great monster movies."

"bkrauser-81-311064","9","6","7","10 January 2014"," A Well Loved Generational Shift Movie
","I recently had a conversation with a friend about the filmography of the great Steven Spielberg. My friend, who is considerably younger than me, tried to argue Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) was not the horrifying, stupefying train wreck that it was. While I could probably go into the technical reasons that movie is an abomination, my arguments were limited to a concentrated level of hatred indirectly flung at my friend with reckless abandon. I stopped myself before things got out of hand but I realized one thing; generational bias does matter when it comes to movies and our discussion hit a little too close to home.<br/><br/>It matters for many when I say I prefer Jurassic Park (1993) over Jaws (1975). I'm not saying one is a better movie over the other, all I'm saying is I prefer the movie that first capitalized on my obsession with dinosaurs when I was six, over one I saw in high school because I wanted to be a Spielberg completest. I much rather watch the movie I saw peering through holes in my own clammy palms than the movie I tried figuring out ""what that guy was in."" To put it bluntly, in the imagination of the child I was and the child I still am inside, Jurassic Park is first in my heart.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is still the premier movie I recommend to Spielberg novices. It encompasses everything that artificially created the childhood of those raised in the nineties; a childlike sense of wonder, visionary special effects and a score by John Williams who composed the anthems of at least two generations. Additionally the film showcases the acting abilities of thespian veterans Richard Attenborough and Jeff Goldblum, familiar faces like Laura Dern, Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Night and strong novice performances by Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello.<br/><br/>Under the surface of Jurassic Park lies its cautionary tale written by David Koepp and Michael Crichton. A modern retelling of Frankenstein only instead of one misunderstood ogre the characters are faced with a menagerie of primal monsters. That and the movie doesn't mind cranking the scare-meter up to eleven. Those who have seen the movie no doubt will instantly recall the scene with the children versus the velociraptors. It's a scene that would have made anyone in the audience scream lengthily along with Joseph Mazzello's character.<br/><br/>Those who know me know I'm not a fan of the theme of science and technology overreaching and causing something horrific. If we were scared of every boogie man that could happen, we would have never left that cave. That's not to say we shouldn't acknowledge the dangers of bringing dinosaurs back from the dead. We should acknowledge that it's a double edged sword for sure. But there's no doubt that finding our limits is what makes humanity great and we shouldn't limit ourselves because Mary Shelley, Michael Crichton or Jerry Falwell tells us to.<br/><br/>But if you're looking for deeper meanings in a Spielberg film (other than the phallic appearance of E.T.) you're trailing up the wrong Devil's Monument. Spielberg's main goal is to entertain. Does that make him a less talented or less important director? Does that make him a huckster of the Barnum Bailey variety? I would argue that film can be used as an art form, as a form of entertainment and/or a form of storytelling with many, many overlapping traditions in-between. If a director's intent is to tell a good story which is what Spielberg does, then who am I or anyone else to judge? Movies are the things of dreams and Spielberg doesn't cheat in giving you the goods.<br/><br/>A great yarn, a pulse pounding theme park ride, a childhood memory; Jurassic Park is all that and more. It was a movie that intelligently combined the cheap thrills that made Jaws so daring and revolutionary, while smuggling in ethical quandaries about the darker side of scientific discovery. On a related note, those in the know, no doubt have heard about the mammoth they're planning on cloning. Regardless of the hardships experienced by the characters of Jurassic Park, who isn't excited to see something like that?<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"
"KineticSeoul","9","6","7","10 April 2013"," Still holds up today!
","I remember watching this movie when I was just a elementary school student and wasn't all that entertained with this movie. Except the dinosaur parts since it just didn't meet my prospect of things when it comes to a entertaining movie when I was a kid. But watching it now, I can really appreciate this movie and what it does. In fact it's one of the best dinosaur or some creatures that attack people type of movies I have ever seen. I recently saw this movie in theaters in 3D and it still meets even today's standards when it comes to great movies. Steven Spielberg is a visionary director and he really put everything he had into this movie. The CGI still holds up but what amazes me is how they used animatronic dinosaurs for the dinosaur scenes. This movie came out in 1993 and even the cinematography still hold up. The characters are well grafted into the story and stands out despite the two annoying kids. Even if it does have slightly clichÃ© moments with one of the character predicting all the outcome but most of the people just won't listen to the guy scenarios. But then again this movie came out in 1993. The build up is just fantastic in this movie and although a bit far-fetched the way it's shown makes it believable, like everything in this movie is possible. The plot is about a rich old guy that decides use his money to clone dinosaurs and make a dino theme park but things just doesn't go according to plan. And it really does seem like a real theme park, mainly because of all the small details and effort that is put in the settings and backgrounds. Even the freaking theme song is so darn catchy and memorable. Go watch this movie in theaters now! It's what movie going experience is all about.<br/><br/>9/10"

I also think the story is amazing. I don't see how anyone could hate this film or give it a 1 out of 10. Also as you may know, Dr. Grants character is based on the famous paleontologist Jack Horner.

","Jurassic Park is one of Spielberg's best movies. i was so awed by this movie when I first saw it. Everything is just about amazing regarding this film. The story is about a dinosaur park off the coast of Costa Rica. There were rumors that the park was in serious trouble, so the owner John Hammond decides to get a dinosaur expert, paleobotanist, a scientist, a lawyer, and his grandchildren to endorse the park. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs are free from their domains after the power went out. Now everybody must have their survival instincts in hand. The acting is very good. I Liked Sam Neill as Alan Grant. The special effects were amazing. The dinosaurs are pretty darn perfect. The sound effects are excellent as well. I really loved the music in this film. John Williams did such a fantastic job with this score and themes. Overall, this is must-see movie. I rate this movie 10/10."

","First chapter from trilogy that gives exciting , sweeping fun and entertainment provided by giant animals made by means of incredible combination of computer generator -ILM, Industrial Light Magic- and Animatronics models . This original ideal is based on Michael Crichton's novel and writing credits by David Koepp . The picture starts on Isla Nublar, a small island 120 miles off the coast of Costa Rica , a group of construction workers and animal handlers offload a large container, the creature within unseen. During the process, the animal tries to escape, an act which leads to a mass panic , and the death of one of the workers . The island in property the billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) ; as Jurassic Park's owner brings to various paleontologists (Sam Neill , Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum) to the island of Costa Rica hoping to convince them for an incredible adventure and where Dinos were allowed mix freely and to breed . There are living dinosaurs and various prehistoric creatures genetically engineered by means of DNA cloned extracted from Jurassic animals found in mosquitoes preserved into amber from cretaceous period . During a preview tour , Nedry (Wayne Knight) disables the security system so that he can make his escape with some stolen embryos , this enables all the dinosaurs to escape their enclosures . Then , the theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok against the paleontologists and the curator's grandsons (Joseph Mazzelo , Ariana Richards) .<br/><br/>This is an enjoyable first entry , plenty of spine-tingler thrills , chills , emotion and lots of fun . The Dinosaurs are the real protagonists , they're terrifyingly awesome and almost completely convincing. Simple dialog and plain tale , but the story is very exciting and inventive . In the film appears numerous predator animals and colossal carnivores as Tyrannosaurus Rex , Velociraptors, Behemoths , Spinosaurious , Stegosauruses although most of creatures are large herbivores harmless and feed on vegetables as large dinosaurs , triceratops and Brachiosaurius accompanied by a herd of Parasaurolophus . Humans try desperately to escape of dinosaurs and they are chased through leafy jungle by fanged giant animals , specially by the Tyrannosaurus and of course by attack of the Velociraptors . In fact the prehistoric animals are truly the film stars , they are terrifyingly awful and create abundant and quite potent screams and scares . There're some stirring and exciting scenes dealing a van dangling over a cliff and Tyrannosaurius pushing while the starring are seized in a cord where the actors give vigorous physical performances . The biggest interpretations are by Sam Neill as a nice , resourceful paleontologist , Jeff Goldblum as a likable mathematician and Wayne Knight as greedy man with mean purports . Magnificent especial effects totally convincing are for combination of models in charge of Stan Winston Studio and computer animation from Phil Tippet , Dennis Muren along with Industrial , Light and Magic of George Lucas . As always spectacular music by John Williams and excellent cinematography by Dean Cundey , both of whom are Spielberg's habituals . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Steven Spielberg , plus including his typical touches . Rating : Above average , well worth watching . It's followed by Â¨Lost worldÂ¨ directed again by Spielberg and Jurassik Park III by Joe Johnston . The film will appeal to teenagers and and growns-up , but no for small kids by violent, realistic and gory attacks by monsters animals."

","Well, I have to hand it to Steven Spielberg, even though he often annoys me. He made us pay attention to archeology and the Ark Of The Covenant; he educated us on Great White Sharks;, a made us love an ugly little space alien and he even made Whoopi Goldberg look good. Wow, say what you will, the man has done some amazing things in the world of film. Here, he brings dinosaurs back to life and gives us another classic adventure story, unlike anything seen up to this time. <br/><br/>I rank this one right up with the best of all-time among great adventure stories. Few people can forget how stunned they were when they viewed these life-like dinosaurs for the first time on screen. And who can forget the T-Rex in the first frightening scene and the Raptors in the last intense scene? This is truly memorable stuff. To this day, those scenes can still get your attention.<br/><br/>The movie has always been fun to watch, and not just because of the thrills or special effects, of which there are too many to recite here. There is humor in here and characters are interesting, led by Richard Attenborough as the scientist who creates Jurassic Park. The kids in here - Joseph Mazello and Ariana Richards - do a fine job of acting, as good as the adults.<br/><br/>This isn't perfect by any means. There are some negatives such as the usual Spielberg plugs for liberal/secular causes, but I'd rather keep this review on the positive side, since it was so entertaining and ground-breaking, in a way, with the special effects, plus anyone who is slightest bit interested has already seen this movie at least once and probably more."

","Jurassic Park is one of the greatest if not the greatest science fiction movie(s) of all time. This was the movie that inspired me to get into filmmaking and inspired my love for dinosaurs. The combination of animal-electronics, practical effects, and groundbreaking CGI make the world of Jurassic Park as well as the dinosaurs feel real and one of the greatest technical achievements in cinematic history and still holds up perfectly today. Unlike movies like Avatar that rely on a cookie cutter story to afloat the CGI, Jurassic Park features a thrilling adventure story that captures the excitement of seeing park that has recreated dinosaurs. The movie explores the themes of consequences that happen when mankind plays with nature that is explored perfectly. The cast is excellent in their performances especially Jeff Gouldblum who brings a lot of comedic spark and flare as Malcom.

What makes Jurassic Park such a milestone in motion pictures is the fact that the film is the first one to bring Dinosaurs to the screen with creditable mix of pushing C.G.I. to the limit and using Stan Wilson's Studios animatronics work and to this day the effects are superb and the Dinosaurs look very much alive in the film they did a great job bringing these creatures to the screen<br/><br/>Jurassic Park still reminds one of my favorite films even today because it's one of those films that are masterpieces and being I love Dinosaurs as a kid it was just perfect<br/><br/>The plot of the film centers around Paleontologist Dr.Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr.Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) get involved by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to his theme park off the coast of Costa Rica where he owns a island Isla Nublar Along Dr.Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldbulm) and Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) to visit his theme park he calls Jurassic Park where they have cloned Dinosaurs and brought them back to life. After an accident where an worker was killed they asked to give their opinions on the park to keep the investors at ease. They are later join by John's grandchildren Lex and Tim Murphy (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello).<br/><br/>Along with these characters we are also introduce to Ray Arnold (Samuel L.Jackson) who helps run the parks computer systems with Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) and Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck)<br/><br/>Just when it seem everything was going as plan the power suddenly begins to fall in the park leaving the fences to the dinosaurs to be shut down letting the dinosaurs free and the visitors fighting for their lives.<br/><br/>The plot of the film does feature some from the novel but it is pretty much original from the story that was written and it worked like a charm with the story being a story driven action thriller that has kept viewers on the edge of their seats each time they watch it. From the story to the climax of the film you are given a thrill ride and story driven film.<br/><br/>The Dinosaurs feature in the film are Tyrannosaurus Rex,Velociraptors, Triceratops, Parasaurolophus, Brachiosaurus, Dilophosaurus, and Gallimimus they are detail to make them look and feel like real Dinosaurs it still a beautiful piece of art to see how well they give these animals justice and gave movie fans a wonderful look into how these animals might have been in the past. Real and C.G.I. The Dinosaurs are just amazing to watch on screen. <br/><br/>The movie brought something for everyone from thriller action scenes to moments that made your heart race the film deliver on so many levels with the infamous Break out Scene of the T-Rex to the Raptors in the kitchen Jurassic Park has created some of the greatest moments in movie history that leaves you on the edge of your seat at the same time be in awe by the film's impressive work of art.<br/><br/>The cast worked very well together to bring the story to life and they pick the right stars for these roles, Sam, Laura, Jeff, Richard and everyone made the character memorable along with classic lines from the film like ""Welcome To Jurassic Park"" ""Hold onto your Butts"" ""Ah ah ah you didn't say the magic word"" <br/><br/>Music in Jurassic Park is just phenomenal with Mr.John Williams doing the score for the film anything he touches with his music turns to gold his music is like listening to a story and it just beautiful.

"Tyson14","10","3","3","6 June 2015"," A film 65 million years in the making
","Most film fans will have one film that ignited their love of cinema. For many that movie experience will come at a young age and in a dark theatre where the large screen envelops you in a whole new world you never thought possible. For me, like many of my generation, that film was Jurassic Park. Of course I liked many movies before that point but it opened my eyes to the potential of the medium like no other film, before or since. Scorsese talks about the religious-like experience cinema can create in its audience and watching Spielberg's classic for the first time I can fully appreciate what he means. It instilled a sense of reverential awe in me and whilst I had witnessed fantastical places like Oz and Tatooine I had never truly been transported to a foreign world as I had with Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>It's a hard film for me to talk about rationally. It holds such a special place in my heart that I will never be able to find fault with the film, so instead I'm just going to gush about the movie's many positive attributes. Attributes like the groundbreaking special effects. The film is always assured of its place as one of the great technical achievements in cinema. CGI had been used in films for many years before but never quite to the point that you believed wholeheartedly in the events and creatures on screen. It is remarkable to think how far computer graphics have come since 1993 yet the film still looks utterly convincing, even more so than both of its inferior sequels. I can only put this down to the seamless blending of effects from the use of CGI, model work and animatronics. The film constantly tricks the audience into believing the dinosaurs were real by having creatures the cast could directly interact with. Because CGI has become so advanced now filmmakers rarely rely on the other types of effects work yet without them Jurassic Park's major moments would never have worked as well. Just imagine the T-Rex scene with the children trapped in the car, it is frighteningly believable because the creature is really there. Much of the critical attention is given to the computer wizardry but for me Stan Winston and his team are just as crucial to the film's success.<br/><br/>Whilst the story is little more than a reworking of Westworld it is still so taut and full of genuinely magical moments that any familiarity in its conceit is immaterial. I can think of no other film with quite so many memorable sequences. The movie is packed with them, big or small, from the reverberating cup of water to the first dinosaur reveal, it is a film that has created more indelible memories than most filmmakers achieve in their entire careers. The cast are, with the possible exception of Laura Dern, perfect for their respective roles. When you compare it to a lot of modern blockbusters the film is surprisingly small in scale. Sure, you've got giant prehistoric creatures stomping around but the film doesn't have a sprawling cast of characters and it has no end-of-the-world climax. Yet it is the narrow focus that makes it all the more effective. Each character is given time to develop and whilst they may fulfil defined roles in the story they do at least feel like real and believable people. Jurassic Park may be a theme park but the film is more than just a thrill ride as you feel emotionally invested in the characters and events on screen.<br/><br/>I've waffled on and not even mentioned the brilliant score by John Williams (a score so amazing it still sounds fantastic when slowed down by 1000%) or the film's perfect balance between comedy and scares. The film is a masterclass in blockbuster filmmaking and a bona fide classic."
"bencsik-laszlo91","10","3","3","11 May 2015"," A dream came true
","I have seen Jurassic Park so many times and every occasion made me love this movie even more. It is a timeless classic which was made with heart. Spielberg created this movie with commitment and passion, he wanted a dream come true, a dream of so many kids who are in love with dinosaurs. In that era profit was not the major priority unlike nowadays.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park's visuals are still amazing, even after 22 years it could stand its ground. Back in those days CGI was revolutionary but the high use of practical effect is the main reason of greatness. Sound effects are also outstanding, everyone can recognize T-Rex's roar which can be awesome and scary at the same time.<br/><br/>Spielberg added horror elements as well, this made some movie scenes even more intense and terrifying. Without doubt the T-Rex scene is the perfect example for this. He perfectly built up the tension and let the thrill culminate, with this technique he created one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history.<br/><br/>Besides being a great movie it is able to come up with meaningful thoughts about re-creation. Characters were put into situations where they have a chance to mull over and argue about the resurrection of dinosaurs. This is a perfect environment for topics like: scientists who want to play God again, what the nature sentenced to extinction should not be bothered, Is it possible for mankind to live with nature peacefully? etc. There are plenty of characters to represent each side and they have enough time to engage in an interesting discussion.<br/><br/>Sam Niel was an excellent choice for the role of Alan Grant. Laura Dern was also great and Richard Attenborough played the dreamer well who can't accept failure. The presentation of Hammond and Malcolm sometimes looked like a Yin-Yang to me (the color of their clothes were the evidence for that). Without doubt the highlight was Jeff Goldblum. Some of his quotes still appear in my everyday life. Kids were also lovely which is a big statement if we try to compare them with today's child actors.<br/><br/>John Williams does not need an introduction, he is a mastermind. Music completely harmonized with scenes and the main theme gives me goosebumps every time. After Star Wars and Indiana Jones he was able to create a completely different catchy melody.<br/><br/>It is not just a blockbuster, Spielberg created something unique which is able to overarch ages and entertain different generations."
"robsta23","9","3","3","22 April 2015"," A Lot Better Than It Appears To Be
","I remember having a conversation with my cousin, asking him why Jurassic Park intrigued him if his priority when it comes to film is good character development. He said it has good philosophical discussion, and he pointed out the scene he was referring to: the ""life finds a way"" scene, and I had forgotten this gem within the movie. And recently a friend of mine pointed out that Dr. Grant ties two female ends of seat belts together to strap himself in which is a great metaphor for this motif of the dinosaurs supposedly being all female.<br/><br/>These philosophical aspects, including the amazing scene focusing on a debate of whether it is responsible to try to add dinosaurs back into the swing of things altogether, raise the movie up higher than the mere B movie critics believe it to be. But is there anything wrong with the overall fun and excitement of this seemingly simple people? We see dinosaurs on-screen for the first time in a much different way - both with the use of animatronics and digitally. We also have the quirky characters such as Wayne Knight and Jeff Goldblum's characters to add to the fun.<br/><br/>The film is pretty aware of itself, making references to King Kong and displaying the dinosaurs as a spectacle to future park-goers, just as the idea of the effects to make the dinosaurs are a spectacle to us as movie-goers. It also draws attention to its potential horror towards little kids with Dr. Grant illustrating the idea of a velociraptor to a cocky kid, and the grandkids that tag along for the park ride that are shown screaming on-screen.<br/><br/>What a great, underrated movie by Spielberg."

"petra_ste","10","3","3","29 November 2014"," Something about Spielberg
","Steven Spielberg has always been at his best with blockbusters. Although he is a master storyteller and a peerless technician, his serious movies, while always worth watching, can undermine their pathos with an excess of sentimentalism (""James, earn this!"", ""Give us free!"", ""I could have saved more!"") and an array of weak endings (Minority Report, AI, War of the Worlds...).<br/><br/>However, Spielberg's childlike glee and exuberance serve him well in more lighthearted fare (although the horrendous Kingdom of the Crystal Skull really gave me pause). NOBODY could craft an exciting action set-piece as well as pre-2000s Spielberg: his best efforts (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark...) remain unparalleled in escapist cinema.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park, smartly adapted from Michael Crichton's novel (is there a better premise in modern science fiction?), is one of Spielberg's triumphs. <br/><br/>Performances are tone-perfect; Jeff Goldblum's witty Malcolm is a crowd-pleaser, but my favorite character remains Sam Neill's Alan Grant, whose evolution from sour child-hater to caring protector gives the movie some much needed humanity lacking in the sequels - see Jurassic World and Chris Pratt's tediously infallible action figure.<br/><br/>John Williams' soundtrack is phenomenal, conveying both awe and terror, excitement and sweetness - one of the composer's best works.<br/><br/>The attention to the smallest detail is palpable. See how chaos expert Malcolm and benevolent ""creator"" Hammond (Attenborough) are clad respectively in black and white, symbolizing disorder and order, yin and yang. It's a small touch, but few other blockbusters bother with this kind of things.<br/><br/>And those special effects... with a few irrelevant exceptions, it's mind-boggling how well they have aged. With their blend of practical effects and computer graphics, they still look amazing after twenty years (they have a WEIGHT, a physical presence), while today most special effects-heavy films are instantly dated, a garish slideshow of vaporous CGI.<br/><br/>Still, the main star here is Spielberg. Scenes like the T-Rex breakout, the jeep chase or the hide and seek with the Raptors have earned their place in the collective memory of action cinema. <br/><br/>Followed by four mostly worthless sequels.<br/><br/>10/10"
"tbills2","9","3","3","11 January 2014"," Welcome to Jurassic Park
","I remember first seeing Jurassic Park in the movie theater alongside my family as a young kid. I remember us having very close front row seats probably because we didn't get there early enough and the theater was packed. The movie begins rolling and I'm watching the movie and I'm enjoying it and I'm enjoying myself and it's a really good movie! But then when the scene with the T-Rex comes up, you know, that scene where the T-Rex escapes through the fencing of his no longer electric, electric cage........I got so scared during that scene! I was so frightened that I had to excuse myself out of my front row seat, walk all the way down the aisle, out of the theater into the lobby, acting like I was just leaving to go use the restroom. Yeah, right, I picked the moment smack dab square in the middle of the very best part of the whole movie to just go leave and use the restroom. Who was I fooling? I didn't have to go pee. I was terrified! I probably almost peed my pants! The T-Rex looked so real, and felt so real! It sounded real too! I know though that I at least made it through to the part where the massive T-Rex starts spinning the kids' vehicle with his huge snout, with the kids trapped inside it, but once the T-Rex started stomping their SUV, crushing the kids underneath, all while letting out a spine tingling and ferocious roar.....I was out of there, and in a hurry! I went and hung around in the restroom for a little bit, not really doing much. When I got back to my seat in the theater, it was at the time when the T-Rex is chasing Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum in their speeding away vehicle, where Goldblum is laying on the back of the jeep, all too injured to move but not too hurt to punch out a few wisecracks, and then the T-Rex explodes out of the trees and is right on their tail! I thought that I might have to go to the restroom again. I sat back down and was able to make it through the rest of the movie just fine, and my dad knew that I had been a little shaken up, so he rest assured me and let me know that it was all okay.<br/><br/>I loved Jurassic Park back when I first saw it then and I still love it now today. It's one incredible feature. The whole point of just sharing with you my recollection of when I first saw Jurassic Park on the big screen was that...the dinosaurs looked so dang freagin' real! Way to go, Steven Spielberg! The CGI special effects of Jurassic Park's dinosaurs is truly impressive and groundbreaking stuff. I know Spielberg wasn't planning on using computer graphics on the dinosaurs, fearing that the computers wouldn't be advanced enough to replicate realistic looking reptiles that an audience could believe, but upon further digital exploration, some technicians tinkering around with some software, Spielberg and the technicians had a moment of discovery realizing that they could indeed use computer animations for the dinosaurs, and that the technology was good enough after all! Boy, does it show! That's called fate, my friends. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park are awesome and incredible! They're a mammoth cinematic achievement on a behemoth scale!<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is a great, beloved movie, thanks to Michael Crichton who wrote the novel, Steven Spielberg, and special thanks to the actors, Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Ariana Richards, Joseph Mazzello, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight, Bob Peck and Martin Ferrero whom all give better than good performances, great performances. Steven Spielberg did an outstanding job directing. The theme by John Williams is beautiful and inspiring. I love that tune! The Jurassic Park is one of the great sets of any movie. I rate Jurassic Park a 9, I cannot give it an all out 10 because the movie is too mainstream and commercialized, and also, there's that one scene with Laura Dern and the raptors that takes place in the maintenance shed that wasn't quite on par with the rest of the film's scenes. That scene needed a little bit of tinkering. The scene with the stampeding herd of gallimimus is possibly Jurassic Park's best part. The T-Rex scene, too, is just as spectacular. My favorite moment is probably when the characters first see the giant brontosaurus, and the other dinosaurs, and John Williams score is blaring in the background. ""They do move in herds."" Wow, what an amazing movie Jurassic Park was, and still is! I love Jurassic Park!"

","From the creative and futurist mind of Michael Crichton comes this incredible and terrifying movie called "" Jurassic Park. "" Yet it took two exceptional directors, Steven Spielberg and George Lucus, to bring this imaginative story to life. The movie concerns an eccentric Billionaire named John Hammond, ( Richard Attenborough) who decides to buy an island off the coast of Costa Rico and build a huge enclosure for recreated Dinosaurs. When it's finished he invites the foremost authorities to endorse his park which include Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), a Palo-botanist, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) a Chaos Theorist. The Zoo which Hammond creates for his attractions is a gigantic and impressive enclosure surrounded by electrified fences, automatic controls and computer protected alarms. So safe is the public that Hammond also invites his grand children. (Tim Murphy and Ariana Richards) However, no sooner does the grand opening tour begins, when things begin to malfunction. This sabotage is programed by one of the employees who is set to make a fortune by betraying his employer. The animals getting free is bad enough, but the terrifying ordeal has just begun, when the worst of the dinosaurs, the T-Rex is also set free. Horror gives way to terror when the children are preyed upon in the jungle tour, but they also have to race about in the open park, with all sorts of hungry creatures awaiting them. The movie is filled with frightening and terrifying scenes and only the screams of the audience is left within the walls of the theater. Samuel L. Jackson, BD Wong and Wayne Knight add credibility of this film which because of the Special Effects and enhanced modern CGI make's it a Classic for everyone. Easily recommend to all audiences. ****"

"talarisw","10","5","6","16 April 2013"," Dinosaurs and humans collide in Steven Spielberg's classic about a billionaire who opens an amusement park where he brought back to life Dinosaurs!
","Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest directors of all time and is the king of Hollywood blockbusters and this is one of his greatest movies. What I love about Spielberg is how he's always thinking outside the box and doing things nobody else has and in result he had made one ground breaking movie after another making other similarly themed films look absolute in comparison. I mean only Spielberg would have the for-site to license the Jurrassic Park book by Micheal Crichton even before he finished writing it and long before it was released because he saw the movie potential. Before I get to the Dinosaurs let me talk about everything else. First I must praise Micheal Crichton for his brilliant concept. The story gives a plausible(granted not realistic) explanation to how people could resurrect Dinosaurs. The movie starts off strong as in a classic horror movie fashion we get a glimpse of a dinosaur, a Velociraptor attacks a human but we never see the Raptor it self. With a movie like this you expect the first fifteen minutes or so to be exposition and set-up and you expect that we have to wait awhile until we some Dinosaours. Well, all that's true but it's not a problem because Spielberg keeps the pace moving so nicely, it's never boring or slow. Spielberg just gives enough exposition that he needs to give, a old billionaire named John Hammond has a park with real life Dinosaurs and to please a lawyer who represents his sponsors he persuades two archaeologist and a scientist to come along to check it out and give their approval and our story begins. As great as the special effects are you need a great story and great human characters. The story is simple but well done, it makes a ludicrous premise of Dinosaurs being brought back from the dead into 1993 believable and that's because the movie takes it self seriously it's never comes off campy or ironic. The story is similar to Frankenstein as they show what happens when ""man"" play God. I like all the characters here. Richard Attenburrough is perfect as John, the old man who created the amusement park. I like that they never make him a bad guy or even crazy just misguided and you even feel bad for him when his amusement park dosen't go the way he hoped. The more or less hero of the story is Alan Grant played by Sam Neil, an up-tight archaeologist who dosen't like kids but later does after protecting John's grandkids from Dinosaurs, nothing really deep but a good fit for this story. In fact none of the characters are really deep but still strong characters capable of holding this movie. I like Laura Dern as Ellie, Alan's partner who's tough and fearless. Wayne Knight gives a memorable performance as the double crossing Dennis, who is the only true villain. Samuel L. Jackson is also good as one of the guys who operate the park. My favorite character might be Dr. Ian Malcolm played by Jeff Goldblum. I like how John described him as a ""rock star"" with his shades and leather jacket. It's hard to explain but Jeff is just so appealing and he brings some humor to the movie. I also really like Bob Peck as the expert hunter Rob Muldon, he's like the Van Henlson to Dinosaurs. I like his rivalry with Raptors and I feel bad when he's killed by one of them, I wish he would of came back for a sequel. But the best thing are the dinosaurs themselves. The special effects are amazing, especially for 1993. The Dinosaurs look real and I don't mean real looking for a movie I mean they look like their really alive. Nothing mechanical or cgi looking about them. The special effects are groundbreaking and some of the best in movie history. First we see the Brachiosaurs, which looks great as well as seeing a Triceatops which looked all too real. but the real moment comes when we see the most iconic Dinosaur of them all the Trannosaurus Rex, who emerges after the power goes out and Ian, Alan and the kids are stuck in a car in front of the T-Rex cage and it attacks the kids in the car. The special effects on the T-Rex looks frighteningly real and I love it's roar. Later the T-Rex chases Ellie, Rob, and Ian in a car which was also great. I also love the Dilophosaurs who attacks Dennis, I love how it's like a rattle snake but unfortunately the real Dinosaur dosen't have the neck fan or shot venom, that was created by Crichton but this is way better. The best Dinosaurs are the Velociraptors, no one even heard of them until this movie. That's one of the great things about this movie is that they introduced us to some lesser known Dinos. I understand for theatrics Spielberg had to make the Raptors more menacing then they really were but he did a great job at making the Dinosaurs be animals acting by instant not monsters. I love how intelligent they made the Raptors. The Raptors are my favorite Dinosaurs in this movie and they steal the show. Although the ending was a little contrived when the T-Rex came out of no where to save ""our heroes"" from three Raptors, two of which some how escaped a locked room but it made for a good climax any way. I also love the score by the great John Williams. The is def-intently the greatest Dinosaur movie of all time."

","Growing up, Ray Harryhausen was my movie hero - he specialised in putting on screen things which didn't exist. For the last 35 years his place has been taken by Stephen Spielberg, simply because he makes such very, very good films. And he has been known to put something impossible on screen every now and then, too.<br/><br/>To synopsise, a theme park is set up on an island, populated by dinosaurs reconstructed from prehistoric DNA extracted from mosquitoes preserved in amber. During the ""test drive"" of the park, attended by palaeontologists, things go horribly wrong...<br/><br/>Michael Crichton's book, though very enjoyable, is filled to overflowing with technobabble, particularly with regard to the park's computer system. And, if one is brutally honest, it recycles the basic idea of Crichton's own Westworld some 20 years earlier, albeit different theme park, different victims.<br/><br/>Spielberg strips away, simplifies, gives us a range of very human humans as potential (and actual!) victims, and a moderate amount of exposition so that we always believe what happens, and then sets off on the first of a number of spectacular set pieces. The story is minimal and almost incidental.<br/><br/>The cast are all good. Jeff Goldblum is not always to my taste, but Sam Neill's sincerity and dignity compensates. But this movie is never about the cast, nor the story.<br/><br/>The dinosaurs (and their integration into the movie) are nearly flawless - there are one or two points where the gallimimuses don't convince 100% that they belong against that particular background plate. They vary between mechanical/animatronic effects and CGI - and this is quite near that dawn of CGI for photo-realistic characters wholly integrated into movies - and it was impossible to distinguish which shots are physical and which are photographic. If you don't believe how truly remarkable Jurassic Park's dinosaurs were, particularly for their day, try comparing them with any CGI monster from the SciFi channel's specially commissioned movies nearly 20 years later, and see how unconvincing CGI critters can be, and how woefully they can be integrated into backgrounds (or, indeed, NOT integrated!). They stand up as well now as they did when the movie was first released and, given how far CGI has come since then, that is a testament to their quality.<br/><br/>If I had a criticism, it would be that the film is rather too leisurely in dealing with the set up - with the benefit of hindsight, the disastrous events of the second half of the film could have started a little earlier. However, this is more than made up for by John Williams' wonderful score.<br/><br/>Addition: April 2013 The recent 3D conversion is quite superb: you would never know that the movie was filmed flat."

","I watched this movie when I was kid. I went to take the form for entrance exam for my 9th grade, and while I was returning home I saw that Jurassic Park is being shown in a Cinema Hall. And I had seen some of the promos on star TV of that time, and discussed with some friends and relatives that this could be a good movie. So I went to see the movie at the age of 13. I saw the film and enjoyed the scariness a lot. Then after that several times whole school with teachers went to see the film and whole family went to see the film. And remained in my memory as an unforgettable event. Now whenever I see this film on my DVD with a lot of clarity and surround sound it still gives me the same enjoyment and thrill as it gave me when for the first time I saw it. This movie Jurassic Park is marvelous and I love it and I love it a lot. I do not want to say anything more, just I love it."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","8","11","3 August 2007"," Big summer movies simply do not get better than this
","One of the very first things we learn during the credits after ""Jurassic Park"" is that it is based on a novel by Michael Crichton, and that the screenplay was written by Michael Crichton with the help of David Koepp. It's for the best that he decided to pen his first screenplay since 1978's ""Coma"" when ""Jurassic Park"" went into development because it's hard to imagine a screenplay based on his dark sci-fi horror novel being successful in the same way this screenplay was. Crichton, writing a screenplay based on his own work, opted to change the tone and much of the plot for this Hollywood production. Rather than the dark sci-fi the novel is, ""Jurassic Park"" the movie is a fun, relatively light-hearted action adventure, and the decision to change the tone might go down in history as one of the smartest screen writing decisions in history.<br/><br/>This is simply an exceptional film. Technically, it is an astounding achievement. As of 2007, fourteen years after ""Jurassic Park"" was released, its special affects are still excellent compared to many mainstream films. Steven Spielberg did no wrong with this film; you can't really criticize anything about it. The public likes Michael Bay because he blows up a lot of expensive stuff and films the explosions, but if one was to list the flaws in one Michael Bay film they could fill dozens of pages. But really, what's wrong with ""Jurassic Park""? The answer is: nothing. You can't fault the gorgeous cinematography, as there are more greatshots in this film than all the summer blockbusters of recent years put together and you certainly can't fault John Williams' classic score. So where does the criticism come from? Some think ""Jurassic Park"" could've been darker and dealt more with its central theme- don't mess with nature. Some think ""Jurassic Park"" doesn't build suspense for long enough, and shows the dinosaurs too often. This claims are without basis because ""Jurassic Park"" never claimed to be a deep film with heavy subtext (there is subtext, but it is dealt with only superficially), nor did it want to be ""Jaws"" (more like ""Indiana Jones"" with dinosaurs). One thing that has to be understood is that this is an action adventure. It eliminates the majority of the science and techno-babble from Crichton's novel, condensing it to a few minutes near the start of the film. The cast is memorable, in particular Sam Neill as Alan Grant, who really reminds me of Indiana Jones in a sense. The character is adventurous, smart, and funny and I really can't imagine anyone else playing him quite as well as Sam Neill did. Laura Dern, an exceptional actress who should've won awards for certain performances in certain David Lynch films, is good here as are Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough. The child actors could've been more annoying, which when speaking of child actors in general is a compliment.<br/><br/>There are few films in existence as exciting as ""Jurassic Park"", and there are very, very few, if any at all, summer blockbusters as perfectly-made and memorable as this. If you're looking for intriguing science fiction dealing with intricate themes, this is not the place for it. There is depth to ""Jurassic Park"", but for meditative science fiction there are certainly better options. Watch this if you want to be entertained, or just to see an example of utterly phenomenal film-making.<br/><br/>****/4"

","Everyone knows what happens in ""Jurassic Park"", so I'll just talk about a few aspects. I think that it's fitting that the movie was released in 1993. With baby boomer Bill Clinton now in the White House, it was clearly a new era, and this movie looked like it was representing a new era - think of it as being 1961, with young John Kennedy as the new president (which it would have been for my parents)*. The fact that Steven Spielberg also released ""Schindler's List"" that year and won two Oscars for it backs up this aspect.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ""The Lost World"" was beyond pathetic. It was just a repeat of the first one and was totally predictable. So avoid that one and stick with this one. I never saw ""Jurassic Park III"". While in Maui during spring break, 2003, I went on a helicopter ride and we flew over the area where parts of ""Jurassic Park"" were filmed.<br/><br/>*As it was, Rob and Laura Petrie on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" were loosely based on the Kennedys.

Jurassic Park turned me into a dinosaur fanatic.I liked characters and found them memorable (especially Malcom). The Velociraptors are one of the most sinister villains in any movie I've seen. I would fit them in between the Joker from The Dark Knight and the Emperor from Star wars. This movie is one of the many reasons I love Spielbergs work.

","I was raised on a diet of dinosaur and monster films, and so when Steven Spielberg gave us Jurassic Park in 1993 promising unbelievably lifelike prehistoric reptiles, I was at the head of the queue (metaphorically speaking of course, since I pre-booked my tickets!!). Needless to say, Steve's amazing big screen version of the Michael Crichton bestseller not only delivered on the promises, making the film a deservedly huge box-office success, but it also redefined special effects for years to come.<br/><br/>Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum play three scientists who are invited to a multi-million dollar theme park featuring cloned dinosaurs, which the owner (good old Dickie Attenborough) hopes the trio of boffins will endorse. However, when one disloyal employee sabotages the park's computer system in order to try and steal valuable embryos for a competitor, the guests get to see the exhibits extremely close-up, and must fight for survival against the mighty T-Rex and a pack of intelligent and voracious Velociraptors.<br/><br/>The film's plot is a somewhat stripped-down version of the book, and the narrative suffers occasionally for the lack of detail, but with Spielberg at the helm, the result is still a juggernaut of an action film that provides enough thrills, spills and adventure to make it unmissable for fans of creature features. The director manages to pull off some spectacular shots that are amongst the most memorable of his career (such as the simple yet iconic 'water-ripples' as the T-Rex approaches), and with the industry's top FX wizards at his disposal (including ace animatronics expert Stan Winston), he has made a film that still looks amazing a decade and a half later.<br/><br/>The best of the trilogy (although part IV is currently in the pipeline, so we shall have to wait and see what happens with that one), Jurassic Park is an excellent piece of cinematic escapism, and way better than anything Spielberg has given us in recent years (I'm still reeling from the latest Indy film and the debacle that was War of the Worlds)."

","Science has advanced so far, to the point that scientists are able to clone dinosaurs to populate an island. Turning it into a maximum security theme park seemed to be a good idea, but when human mischief and a breakdown of said security occurs, the result is terrifying.<br/><br/>One of the unwritten facts in cinema history is that some folk, no matter what he does, will deride Steven Spielberg's achievements in movie making. Be it popcorn bonanza's such as this dinosaur riot, or the serious, emotionally wrought likes of Schindler's List which was released this same year, Spielberg is not a popular name amongst the arty farty set. Thankfully, those people are in the minority because Spielberg and his movies cater for the mass majority of the honest cash paying movie fan, he is by definition a fan himself, to hear him interviewed and chatter away about cinematic greats such as David Lean is as enlightening as it is as entertaining as his best work.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park finds Spielberg directing like a child locked in a sweet shop, all the tools available to him are used with gleeful abandon, the result being one of the most enjoyable sci-fi/fantasy/monster/disaster movies of the 90s. Going on to make a lifetime gross, at the time of writing, of $914,691,118 after being made for just $63 million, I think it's safe to say that Jurassic Park is loved by a lots and lots of people. The charges of the actors being secondary are of course warranted, at times stilted and plain, Laura Dern, Sam Neil, and even Richard Attenborough, possibly do their respective career phone ins; but that's OK in a film of this type, besides, elsewhere Jeff Goldblum rises to the challenge as Ian Malcolm, all quirky and sly, Goldblum gets to look cool and gives the picture it's comedic relief.<br/><br/>However, we are ultimately here for the terror, the rampaging dinosaurs expertly assembled at ILM are a pure feast for the eyes, with Spielberg brilliantly creating edge of the seat set piece after set piece. Craftily he lulls us into a false sense of security {aided by screenwriter and novel writer Michael Crichton of course}, it's all lovely, vegetable eating dinosaurs and kiddie friendly fodder. But then, oh then, it's hello T-Rex, Raptors and thrills on the edge of your seats, from that point in it's time to strap yourself in for a magical roller-coaster ride. Thank you Steven Spielberg, Hollywood would be a poorer place without your efforts. 9/10"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","7","10","6 August 2008"," Dinosaurs Are Back To Roaming...And Devouring
","I've always admired Steven Spielberg for his attempts to make different movies. Even though not all of them are exceptional, I've always liked watching them and 'Schindler's List', 'Jurassic Park', 'Saving Private Ryan', 'The Terminal'...just to name a few, rank among my favourites. 'Jurassic Park' is an exciting action adventure. I don't even remember how many times I've seen it but I do recall that I've enjoyed it every single time.<br/><br/>The special effects are stunning. The dinosaurs look eerily real. Next to being detailed and well tones, the movement looks very realistic (as in most films one can see the go-motion which Spielberg had cleverly avoided). I wonder why filmmakers today don't use this kind of special effects instead of going entirely CGI. Thanks to the cinematography, the whole park is spectacular to watch and it has just as much an important role as the creatures. The background score and brilliant sound effects manage to create that chilling mood.<br/><br/>Another thing that makes 'Jurassic Park' so exciting to watch is the suspense element which is very well built. The viewers wonder who will die next, which dinosaurs will show up, what's the fate of the main characters etc. The opening sequence already gives us the feel that it will be quite a bloodfeast. But, the events that follow thereafter are more 'laidback'. Spielberg starts the story by introducing the park and once the viewer knows all there is to know about the park, the action begins. Though some seem to find the plausibility of the theory about dinosaurs being revived and set to roam the world, problematic, I'd say enjoy it for what it is. It's not supposed to be a philosophical movie with deep meaning (but if someone sees it that way and appreciates it who am I to complain).<br/><br/>The cast do a great job. Sam Neill and Laura Derns do a cool job of taking over roles that were offered to the likes of Harrison Ford, William Hurt, Robin Wright Penn, Juliette Binoche and Sridevi. Richard Attenborough always has a pleasant presence even though his character is initially somewhat of a jerk. Jeff Goldblum's charismatic Ian provides some comic relief. Poor Samuel L. Jackson and Bob Peck get devoured but at least they do put up one hell of a battle. Joseph Mazzello is a little annoying but cute and sometimes funny. Ariana Richards screams a lot but otherwise she's adequate.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was because of my fascination with dinosaurs that I loved this movie as a child but for me 'Jurassic Park' has stood the test of time. I had just revisited it last night for the nth time and it felt awesome to watch. 1993 was perhaps the best year in Spielbergs career because that's the year he gave 'Schindler's List' and 'Jurassic Park'."
"Spielbergian","10","7","10","7 July 2008"," Absolutely breathtaking!
","When I first saw this movie, it was like no other movie I had ever seen. It completely changed my perspective on movies, is one of my favorite films of all time, and most importantly was the gateway to other films (Mainly Spielberg)<br/><br/>I think this is one of the greatest movies of all time for many reasons. The plot is spectacular, adding tons of suspense and action to the story. But what I most highly praise about this film is the visual aspects of it. Not just the special effects, but every single frame of it. I just love looking at the props (the tour cars, computers/programs running, the fences & signs, etc), the location, and main sets (The visitor lodge, the lab, the dinosaur paddocks). In my opinion, the most iconic scene in movie history, is when the cars enter the gate and you see the gate close as they enter the park ... It truly makes me say wow. The island setting is breathtaking, the art direction and sets are amazing, but overall, the most amazing aspect are the dinosaurs ... who look incredibly real! The CGI in JP opened up a whole new door for films, yet the effects in JP are even more appealing to the eye than 60% of the CGI in films today. And that's huge for a movie made in '93! And another thing, why I love this movie, is that unlike the other 2 JP movies, this one is set in an island theme park. Everything is new, the dinosaurs are in their paddocks like at the zoo. It's cool, like they're going to a theme park!<br/><br/>But what I most enjoy about the movie, are the action sequences. I've seen hundreds of movies, yet my favorite scene of all time is the scene where the Tyrannosaur escapes and attack the cars. It's just so amazing. The rain just adds a certain tone that draws you in, adding tons of tension; And when I see the Rex exit the fence and roar ... I'm blown away! That scene truly is the most thrilling and intense action sequence in movie history. The next scene is when the tour car falls down the tree. Man, that scene is intense, and also one of the best. Another (Well, not quite a scene) scene that's really tense, is when Ian is sitting in the jeep and he sees the footprint's water shake. The music, along with the tremors is really exciting. Lastly, The Raptors in the kitchen is another great scene which can be really suspenseful.<br/><br/>Next, the acting ... Which I like. Goldblum is absolutely brilliant as Malcolm, and his acting gives this movie a twist. Neill, the 2 kids, and Attenborough really give this movie a heartwarming feel. And I love Samuel L. Jackson's performance. Also the director is a real strong backbone to this film. Kudos to Spielberg.<br/><br/>Another part I truly love about this movie ... aside from the action ... is the look. And what I mean by it, is the setting and the props. I'll explain it. OK, this movie is just so brilliantly shot, with beautiful settings, props, and stages. I'll give some examples. One good example is when you see the visitor lodge for the first time. One of the best looking scenes is when you see the tour cars coming our of the tunnel, and the mountains have mist overhanging them, and then you see the fence in the background ... Brilliantly shot! Another great scene, is when they're waiting in the cars, and Tim takes out the binoculars and looks out the back window. I love that scene! It's just so ""cool looking"". I mean, it pans out and you see the rain running down the window, and the green glow of the binoculars in the dark night. Wow!<br/><br/>After you have seen this, you'll want to experience this over and over. I have seen this so many times, I even saw it last night, yet I want to watch it again right now.<br/><br/>I know I've gone on and on, and I hope I didn't bore you. It's just I love this film so much.<br/><br/>This is truly an amazing film. 10 out of 10 for everything I have listed."

","What a movie! What a fabulous movie! Steven Spielberg does it once again with ""Jurassic Park."" He proves that he can do anything and that dinosaurs weren't monsters, they were animals. It may not be accurate to the book, but it's still a masterpiece.<br/><br/>In case you don't know what it's about, it's about the idea of genetically enhanced dinosaurs who are engineered to be harmless, and how a group of scientists are invited to see them and judge them on how safe and how real they are. But, something goes wrong...and that's where the action comes in.<br/><br/>One thing that I liked was Jeff Goldblum. He was always my favorite actor. I find him to be a natural actor and the way he delivers his lines is great. It's like he's not even sticking to the script, he's just making it up as he goes along. Also, a beautiful score by John Williams. You can't get better than that."

","Jurrasic Park is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The characters are excellent and show real emotion. The special and visual effects in the movie are amazing. The story stays to it's topic and the way they find the DNA of the Dinosaurs is just brilliant. Steven Speilburg makes this movie, I mean without him I don't think that the movie would of survived without them.The ending of the movie was great too. Which is very important in a movie like this. Not to mention the small things that only a quick eye can catch, like the ""Dinosaurs rule the Earth"" banner in the gift shop.Well, that's my summery of Jurrasic Park and hopefully you'll go out and buy or rent the trilogy. Because, you don't know what your'e missing. -Angsw8"
"smashattack","10","7","10","11 December 2001"," Almost perfect.
","Jurassic Park really is 65 million years in the making. I mean, wow. I have never seen a movie that combines action/adventure, intellectuality, in-depth characters, excellent storyline, great graphics, and perhaps one of the best soundtracks ever made (John Williams, of course) in one movie.  How the makers of this movie fit all this really baffles me. What else really amazes me is how close the movie was to the book (especially compared to other books made into movies by Crichton).  Don't let that statement fool you; Jurassic Park the movie is nowhere near the book, but the essential parts have not been ripped out of the book (like all of Crichton's books). Michael Crichton, John Williams, and Steven Spielberg--what an excellent combination!  Crichton wrote the awesome book (and the screenplay for the movie, too, I think), Williams composed and conducted some of the best contemporary/thriller music ever made, and Spielberg made the frightening dinosaurs so much more freaky. The only thing wrong with it was that it wasn't as close to the book as I'd hoped, although, like I said earlier, it maintained the essential parts, which is unusual in Crichton's book-to-movie transformations.  The book explained things a lot better and I could really connect with the book a little better.  I can connect with the movie, too, it's just that I needed to watch it several times before I understood exactly how everything happened the way it did. Watch this movie.  It has hardly any disappointment in it, if any."

I ADORE everything about it, and, even though a lot of people say this, I think even the scenes without dinosaurs are great.  They just add to the plot and the suspense.  I don't care what anyone has to say about this movie, because it is my favorite movie of all time, even better than my second favorite, ""The Matrix.""  Enjoy, fellow dino-lovers."
"Platypus82","10","7","10","12 September 2001"," Absolutely fantastic piece of moviemaking
","Okay, after writing reviews on The Lost World and JP3, and ranting and raving about just how awfully bad these movies are, especially compared to the prequel, finally I'll tell you just WHAT's so great about this movie. It's got everything. Yes, it has the, at the time spectacular and totally new dinosaur effects- but it also has great dialogue (bits of Malcolm's chaos theory strewn in without getting too scientific for a mainstream cinema audience- if you want the hardcore stuff, read Crichton's book-, Malcolm's sarcastic remarks), an INTERESTING STORY (it's the general idea of man trying control nature which goes wrong, but there are those subplots of Grant and children, Grant and technology, some rivalry between Malcolm and Grant, Hammond's not the greedy, nasty guy from the book [which is why he gets eaten in the book] but just an idealist trying to make his dream come true, and so on...), great music- it's just perfect. I've watched this film over and over and I love it every time. Someone reviewing TLW cleverly remarked that Jurassic Park has its fair share of plot holes too, only nobody seems to criticize them. Jurassic Park does have a fair share of ""flubs"" (there's a whole website dedicated to listing them), starting with the cliff that appears where the Rex paddock should have been, but also equipment seen in the background, crew seen in the background, robotic arms just disappearing, towels that suddenly change color, the emergency bunker directly next to the raptor paddock and so on and so on and so on. But these are not ""plot holes"", they're continuity issues, and sometimes smaller flaws of logic. ""The Lost World"", while I don't know how many of these smaller mistakes it has, already shows how acting, character development, dialogue and especially story move into the background and emphasis is on more dinosaur effects, more intense action scenes and mroe spectacular shots of people getting eaten, accompanied by a hearty ""CRUNCH"" of course. The first time I watched it, just after having seen JP3 I actually liked it, the second time I was more sceptical. There's a lot copied from JP (or Godzilla, or Hatari), and just about everything else is pretty stupid. (Hammond wants to show people dinosaurs for money, so for safety reasons he does this on a remote island with all sorts of security measures. Still, the project fails and the creatures break out and eat people. Now they have the brilliant idea of TAKING DINOSAURS ON THE AMERICAN MAINLAND to show them for money!!) And JP3 is merely a waste of time and money. It's got dinosaur effects and it's got action scenes but it's, if I may quote a newspaper critic, ""nothing but a slasher move, albeit with nonhuman villains"". Some STILL like this, say things like ""Gimme more dinos!"" or ""TLW didn't have enough blood and guts"" but this is what was so great about the first movie. It's got the effects PLUS characters you can identify with (in the sequels you don't give a damn who gets eaten. They could have eaten Goldblum's daughter for all I would have cared) PLUS an exciting storyline PLUS good dialogues PLUS the best soundtrack I've ever heard! But with a franchise like this they just can't help but squeeze money out of it until it's dead..."

Jurassic Park was a one of a kind film in ti's day it had amazing CGI and truly mind blowing automated prosthetic dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Wayne Knight and Samuel L. Jackson. as a group of people who are invited and who work on an island called Isla Nublar, no one knows what it is and for five years a man named John Hammond has been setting up a sort of biological preserve off the coast of Costa Rica, but this preserve is much different than any other it doesn't house animals it houses dinosaurs, a species of creatures not seen for over 5,000 years. now a group of scientist have the great opportunity to see these amazing creatures before anyone else, but in the blink of an eye this amazing experience turns into a swift rampaging nightmare that unleashes an awesome fury the likes the world has never seen before. Now theses scientist have to out run some of the most deadly predators the world has ever know. Jurassic Park is a high tech pulse racing, mind blowing and eyeball freezing adventure that won't let up till the very end. I very,very highly recommended this amazing film.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","10","4","5","10 June 2018"," A rare breed of film seldom seen anymore: a true masterpiece.
","'Jurassic Park (1993)' is a landmark achievement, in as many ways as possible. While some of the exclusively digital dinosaurs don't hold up quite as well as the rest (despite having been only relatively recently surpassed by their peers - depending on budgetary constraints, of course), there are times when the superb CG almost seamlessly blends with possibly the best practical effects I've ever seen to create phenomenally believable, groundbreaking special-effects that truly are, still to this day, some of the best of their kind. Seriously, both the Raptor rigs and, specifically, the to-scale T-Rex are nothing short of breathtaking. They work so well not only due to the flick's fantastic technical prowess but also thanks to its beautiful blending of its core techniques (those created by clay and those by computer), its legitimate reactions from the compelling characters and its uncanny ability to put the audience right in the middle of it all, making you feel genuine wonder, fear, suspense and elation as if you're really sat alongside these long-extinct creatures. It's difficult to stress just how important the characters are in making it all so utterly believable, as well as so utterly captivating. Each of them feel like fleshed-out people, written to perfection by screenwriters who know how to get information across to the audience in a very organic way. It's almost as entertaining watching these people just converse with one another, discussing the morals of bringing extinct creatures back from the dead, as it is seeing them navigate the survival situation in which they are inevitably placed. It is only because we care so much about all the core players that the suspense sequences work so well, that we are kept on the edge of our seat every time a dinosaur lurks around the corner and that we grip our chairs when they leap for their prey. These scenes are some of the best in cinema, perfectly constructed with restraint and splendour. It's also difficult to describe how affecting even the simple moments can be, the moments in which we are asked to sit back and stare at the mere sight of a dinosaur. These should have dampened with time and yet they haven't, still eliciting the awe they did when they first hit the big-screen. They emulate the imagined magic of seeing one of these animals in real life for the first time. Running underneath all of this are some compelling themes that eagerly invite analysis, with the central debate being a tough and intriguing one. The picture is simply one of the most engaging I've ever seen, one that puts an ear-to-ear smile on your face just because it's so utterly amazing. It balances all of its core tenants impeccably, being a proper 'summer blockbuster' that's incredibly intelligent as well, to the point that every second is just supreme entertainment. It can make you lean forward in your seat or well-up with awe and, in general, have a blast from beginning to end. The movie is, without a doubt, a true masterpiece. 10/10"

","Jurassic Park is an adaptation of the novel of the same name written by Michael Crichton. Even though the movie cuts various parts of the novel, it manages to capture the essence upon which the story is built.<br/><br/>This movie combines elements of science fiction, horror, and suspense which makes this film a singular achievement in the realm of cinema. Despite the ubiquity of CGI in today's big budget blockbusters, no other movie has utilized visual effects more effectively to tell a story than Jurassic Park. <br/><br/>The casting is so good that there is no element that can be criticized. Both the child actors do a wonderful job as they have as much screen time as their vastly experienced compatriots. John Williams, Steven Spielberg's frequent collaborator, has once again given an iconic score that has one of the most memorable tunes ever written.<br/><br/>There is hardly any aspect of Jurassic Park that I did not enjoy. In the beginning, there is a genuine sense of wonder at the unbelievable feat of recreating dinosaurs. At the end, we dread the sight of these creatures due to several horrific incidents during the course of this movie. It combines all these elements due to which it can be enjoyed by children and adults as well. It is a memorable movie and I cannot give you any more reasons to go out there and watch it right now."

","This week I've been watching the ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy in preparation for ""Jurassic World"" which hits theaters next weekend. I am ashamed to say that I've gone twenty-two years since this movie came out without ever having seen it. I think that likely had to do with the fact that I've just never been that big into dinosaurs, and so the general theme of the film just didn't appeal to me. Having watched it, I can say that I enjoyed it quite a bit.<br/><br/>I'm giving the film an 8/10 stars, albeit with thoughts of giving it just a seven. I decided to go with the eight because I think that if I try to be as objective as possible, the film probably deserves that. It's an extremely well made film about the dangers of science run amok. The dinosaurs at times look a bit awkward, but, hey--it was 1993...animation and CGI effects have come a long way since then. Still, the film has aged relatively well. The story is good overall, and the acting is not half bad, though I would say that it has more of a feel of an 80's popcorn movie than a 90's blockbuster hit. Throughout the film I could see shades of ""The Goonies"" and ""E.T."" in Spielberg's filmmaking style.<br/><br/>That said, my relative disinterest in the whole dinosaur vibe still was a bit of a wall toward getting into the film, which is why I say I toyed with the idea of only seven stars. But this movie is definitely fun and engaging, and I would recommend it to just about anyone. If you've never seen it before, you're sure to find yourself catching a scene or two that immediately screams ""classic movie moment"", and it's a great movie to just enjoy with the family for an evening of escapism from the real world."
"TomConnors","10","4","5","24 July 2013"," 3D Blu-Review
","Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite films, it is a masterpiece and a landmark in film history. For anyone unfamiliar with the story, the Steven Spielberg adaptation of the Michael Crichton novel is about a rich entrepreneur named John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) who has designed and built the world's first amusement park with live dinosaurs. Hammond needs specialists to sign off on the park before the insurance company will allow him to open for business so he enlists Dr. Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) to take the ride through Jurassic Park, along with us. Of course after the ride begins things start to go wrong, due to sabotage, and chaos ensues as the dinosaurs take over the park.<br/><br/>The movie is a fast paced, suspenseful, and well done, in the tradition of ""Jaws"", not an exact reference of the source material but the version that was meant to be. The effects are still astounding and the movie still works 20 years later. The film's 20th anniversary 3-D convert is excellent. It has a lot of depth and the movie lends itself well to the added dimension. The movie was ""sweetened"" for the 3-D release, adding just some environmental elements for 3-D and the soundtrack was also tweaked to engulf the audience more.<br/><br/>The only new extra is a short featurette on the conversion of the film, that is also in 3-D, nice touch. The original blu-ray from the box set and a DVD is also included in the 3-D combo-pack. The extras on the blu-ray are a very good combination of older extras and a new documentary, which has counter parts on the sequels in the box set (or separate releases that are now available).The only changes are environmental objects for stereo- viewing, and the soundtrack has also been enhanced to engulf the audience. No there has been no real ""changes"" made, so no need to get upset that it is really more than what it is, a 3-D version of the classic film.<br/><br/>Well worth the upgrade, though I now have more copies of ""Jurassic Park"" than I can countÂ…you want one???"

The computer generated images are so life like and their mobility is very smooth, not jerky or blurry like in some movies. Jeff Goldblum is extremely good and funny in his role as the chaos proponent Dr. Ian Malcolm. Sam Neill is great as the older dinosaur specialist and Laura Dern is a good back up.

","Some alchemy makes everything about ""Jurassic Park"" gold. So many elements shouldn't work, but do: the dinosaurs should age with the technology that created them, but they don't; the acting and writing should register as corny, but instead they come across as charming. I am an admirer of the movie, but more than that, I am one of many people for whom it has become something of a touchstone experience. Like lots of others, many of whom are in my age range (I was about 10 when the film came out), I have seen it countless times and still watch it every couple of years. Every character has become a familiar, friendly face. At this point it is the people more than the dinosaurs that seem to drive the film, and I can't resist speaking their dialogue along with them. I use some lines even when I'm not watching the film; ""I can afford more glasses,"" I've often said in Wayne Knight's voice when my wife has been unable to find her glasses, and ""That's, that's chaos theory"" in Jeff Goldblum's stutter is another favorite of mine. But as well as I know the movie, I still see new things on each viewing. When I saw the 3D re-release in theaters in May 2013 I noticed details I had never noticed before, like the mermaid on the restaurant facade where Dennis Nedry meets the ""secret agent"" from InGen's rival corporation, and the ""Moet & Chandon"" label on the bottle that John Hammond opens at the dig site in Montana. The enduring freshness of the film will keep me coming back, as if I could ever stay away from such a fun, nostalgic trip."

And the story is still compelling and fascinating, but then I guess we have Michael Crichton to thank for that.

"jzappa","10","4","5","10 February 2011"," The Definitive Evolutionary Thriller
","The father of the summer blockbuster tradition's third time around making the most commercially successful film ever is a real cinema signpost, presenting wonder- and terror-stimulating highlights, the more stunning of these concerning the ferocious, realistic dinosaurs that trail through the film with a still amazing simplicity. Just as intimidating, though, maybe more, are those features of Jurassic Park that determine it as the meteoric forerunner of a mint entertainment kingdom. Even while seizing the imagination of its enormous audience, this film sets the stage for the amusement park rides, sequels and souvenirs that assure the Jurassic Park event would continue for over a decade.<br/><br/>The calculation of this cinematic marketing takeover didn't seem like it could be surpassed, because a whole age bracket had become infatuated with dinosaurs, turning the fossils of long ago into the monolithic props of the '90s. This at times almost unbearably intense thriller is still today a riveting, worthily scientific story of a classified theme park, branded for the age throughout which dinosaurs existed. Jurassic Park's centerpiece is actual sentient dinosaurs, which have been produced through the regeneration of dinosaur DNA taken from blood unearthed in prehistoric mosquitoes sealed in amber. The film describes this procedure by way of a ""Mr. D.N.A."" cartoon.<br/><br/>Crichton, who adapted his source with David Koepp, relishes such particulars and illustrates his plot as a beguiling, fanatically comprehensive discourse on both the promise and harms of prevailing technology. The coolest character in Crichton's story, wry chaos theorist Ian Malcolm, is among various scientists taken to Jurassic Park to examine it before its opening. Faced with the seeming foolproof environment of this mechanized paradise, Malcolm is incredulous. He repeatedly refers to applied mathematics as a means of indicating that supposedly faultless representations have a way of toppling once they contend with the real world.<br/><br/>Theoretically, this plot is custom-made for the talents of the man who could buy everyone on Hollywood's Power List, merging the alarm of Jaws with the state-of-the-art parable of E.T. and Close Encounters, and sure enough including the trial of constructing the dinosaurs themselves. In a few key scenes equaling the fright rate of Jaws, the difference is that this film's dinosaurs tread on its humans both literally and metaphorically, however persuasively sympathetic and amusingly distinctive the cast is. They show just for concise interludes, yet the they rule Jurassic Park in every sense. Remarkably fluid and realistic, they set an exorbitant benchmark for the still budding CGI. However, thinking about how those effects were pulled off aren't prone to arise while the film's in progress. The key to the dinosaurs of this undeniable pleasure is that they form a conquering fantasy. We believe we've hung around in a dinosaur-filled realm.<br/><br/>That realm, on an island nearby Costa Rica, is the innovation of John Hammond, a tiresomely cheery gray eccentric who enlists Drs. Grant and Sattler as members of a party presumed to give Jurassic Park its stamp of support. But a quaint thing occurs en route to the Tyrannosaurus pen. Thanks to an business saboteur attempting to appropriate dinosaur embryos, power within this programmed theme park is deactivated. Enormous, unpleasant, ravenous creatures begin to roam free.<br/><br/>Helming the dinosaurs' exploits is Spielberg's forte, and the professional dreamer's excitement is unmistakable. He has an immense party with every single roar and shudder indicating the advanceing threat, as when Malcolm notices a mud puddle tremble. He also hurdles to the test of composing inspired duels, as in a tremendous sequence where brutal velociraptors hunt Hammond's two grandchildren through the outsized kitchen of the visitor's center. Anybody can show a battle, but it takes Steven Spielberg to portray just how the pots and pans might go soaring at the thump of a velociraptor's tail, or how the children might mislead their cunning assailants. In considering such a scene, it also helps to behold the broader picture. Who but the most represented filmmaker on AFI's 100 Most Inspiring Movies of All Time could persuade an audience that there are dinosaurs at large in a kitchen by any means? But the film's deserving centerpiece is the sequence where the Tyrannosaurus scrutinizes and masticates a Jeep containing desperately frozen-stiff characters is one of the most exhilarating scenes ever put on film. It's hopeless discerning the effects from the real, and it's equally as suspenseful when you're 22 as when you're 5.<br/><br/>His fourteenth film keeps us nervous while leaving much of its actual brutality to the mind. When it's dinosaur dinner time, Spielberg sidesteps obvious gore, getting a superior quiver out of showing farm animals that are left near the famished creatures and swiftly vanish. To give the velociraptors a fitting initiation, he starts the film with a character whose upper body stays seen while the rest of him is being accosted off screen, a la Jaws. Such tense and gruesome strokes are joined with over-romantic ones and intermittent droll sight gags and observations. As an action adventure, as an auteurist visualization, as a blockbuster, as a humanist assertion, however capitalistically inclined, it's a tour de force."
"gizmomogwai","9","4","5","8 February 2008"," An extraordinary movie experience
","I was 9 when this movie came out, and it became a big part of my childhood. I watched it many times. To me then, it was the perfect movie. Hence, it's hard to look at it nowadays and rate it objectively. I'm familiar with it and still love it, but it's not the kind of film I most love these days. How do you express that this movie is still extraordinary and entertaining while also admitting it's not very deep concerning story and characters? (Although I liked the characters). Should I admit that the ending, with the rex sneaking into the building somehow and eating the raptors, is imperfect? How'd it get in? Does it matter? Was seeing the rex one last time worth it, as Spielberg thought? Spielberg was, at any rate, at fine form here, with such great detail packed into the film. This was King Kong for its generation- the recreation of ancient dinosaurs, only this time more convincing than ever. The special effects are great, better than Jurassic Park III's and only outdone by the first sequel The Lost World.<br/><br/>I think, with such great dinosaurs, one shouldn't overlook the fact that the humans are good too. Sam Neill and Bob Peck play their parts well, Laura Dern shows range from charming enthusiasm to fear to disgust to professionalism, Richard Attenborough's enthusiastic and proud. What of Wayne Knight? I believe Ebert said something about his part not really fitting, but I don't see it that way- again, having grown up with this movie, it became a standard for other movies, and I see little wrong with it. The music in this movie is also excellent. Still a great film, even if not the greatest film."

","You don't need me to tell you that ""Jurassic Park"" (hereafter JP) has indelibly ensconced itself in humanity's consciousness. You don't have to be a paleontology or prehistoric animal or dinosaur buff (as I am), or have seen JP in the theater after waiting at 10 p.m. in insanely snaky long lines (as I did) or own the VHS video or Michael Crichton novel that inspired JP (as I do) to appreciate the movie's special status in movie lore as the font of realistically animated extinct beasts. Yep, JP is immortal. But it is not perfect. Why? Well, it's the insidiously asinine and anticlimactic climax! Our intrepid team has cleverly eluded the velociraptors throughout the extended chase sequence at the island center culminating in the atrium with the Tyrannosaurus skeleton. However, the cunning theropods have surrounded the team. How does the team escape? One more brilliant plan? No! The T-rex which masticated and spit out the tour jeeps earlier in the movie materializes behind them out of nowhere to chomp and spit out the raptors and smash his skeletal relative, and provide the necessary distraction for our crew to flee!!! Our toothy savior! Wow, how does a 3-7 ton slavering monster sneak behind you unnoticed? How did he get into the atrium anyway? Presumably, he must have broken through a back wall. But why? What is his motivation? Why follow puny humans when he has his pick of fleshy hadrosaurs, ornithomimids, or ceratopsians? Admittedly, the sequence is exciting, but it really is just a dumb version of the ""dinosaur in the machine"".<br/><br/>I understand Spielberg was so enamored of the T-Rex that he couldn't resist bringing it back for the JP climax. Shame on him! :0 He should have resisted the urge. Even the center exploding would have been better.<br/><br/>Is it too late to make or discover an alternate ending?"
"Mark1988","9","4","5","8 April 2007"," Great Fun; Spielberg Creates Prehistoric Magic
","Spielberg's Jurrasic Park deserves the cult following it has generated. Essentially the forces of the Jurrasic period are let loose on a team of unsuspecting experts miles away from civilization who must then rely on their cunning to survive the onslaught. Sounds simple but by god is this movie breathtaking.<br/><br/>Jurrasic Park stubbornly refuses to be classified as 'mindless', 'simplisitc' or 'boring'. It isn't high drama or socially relevant but it is entertaining. The best advice you can have for any film is to enjoy and respect what the director is trying to achieve. Spielberg is trying to tell an interesting, if not far-fetched, story hence we are obliged to sit back and enjoy it in all it's glory.<br/><br/>Bearing this in mind, Jurrasic Park is great fun. The acting is subtle and witty, particularly Sam Neil and Jeff Goldblum. The younger actors fulfill their roles very well, a facet of the ensemble which can often destroy a film. Even the support characters with limited screen time are given sufficient opportunity to be developed.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the special effects are unlike anything witnessed on screen. The dinosaurs are stunningly realistic and still hold up 10 years later. The photography is also deployed effectively, only giving little wisps of the more intimidating creatures until a scene's climax. The sound too will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck. The audio and visuals combine perfectly throughout. The scene in which a T-Rex's gait sets off vibration tremors in a harmless cup of water is unforgettable! <br/><br/>Despite these bells and whistles, no film is complete without strong direction. Spielberg displays why he is one of the most famous directors of our time. The dramatic pacing in this film is spot on. Characters are well developed before the inevitable 'something goes wrong and we must now run for our lives' scenario sets in. And unlike some of his other films, Spielberg is not overly dependent on special effects early on, letting the viewer's imagination fill in the gaps.<br/><br/>This is simply a fantastic movie. As far as an engaging and well-constructed adventure goes, Jurrasic Park thoroughly deserves its reputation."

"Movie_Reviewing_101","9","4","5","2 August 2006"," Spielberg at his best!!
","Jurassic Park is one of those films which everyone has heard of. It's presence is apart of our ever day culture, and has lead to a huge franchise, spawning two sequels, toys, video games and other high quality merchandise.<br/><br/>The film is about the billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) and his dream to own the most spectacular theme park on the planet. Jurassic Park, a park filled with living, breathing dinosaurs. But after the death of a park worker, Hammond must convince his investors that the park is actually safe. And to do this he invites three scientists, Dr Alan Grant (Sam Neil), Dr Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) And Dr Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to his Island to give their expert opinion and to convince the investors that the park is safe. The film also stars two child actors (Ariana Richards) and (Joseph Mazzello), who play Hammonds grand children Lex And Tim. But after a security breach, the group get separated. Sattler and Malcolm are reasonably safe in the visitor centre with Hammond. Whilst Grant and the kids must safely out run dinosaurs and get back to the security of the visitor centre and of the island in one piece.<br/><br/>This film is by far Spielberg greatest achievement. Forget E.T Jurassic Park is the best. With it's breath taking blend of CGI produced by ILM, and the outstanding animatronics created by Stan Winston, the viewer has no problem believing that the dinosaurs are real. The scene of the T-Rex attacking the car is one of the most spectacular scenes in movie history and is definite to stay in the minds of anyone who witnesses it.<br/><br/>As well as the amazing plot which was based on the novel by Micheal Crichton. And the breath-taking special effects. The film also has a beautifully mastered soundtrack composed by the brilliant John Williams. Without this the film would be nothing, and would just have been a lonely film reel catching dust in some old storage room.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is one of the greatest films in it's genre and is a definite must see for anyone who is a fan of dinosaurs or Spielberg. The film is rated PG in the UK and PG-13 in the states.<br/><br/>Milligan =D"
"Hellrazr360","9","4","5","1 June 2006"," Hold On To Your Butts
","Jurassic Park is one of the films I just couldn't stop watching when I was younger. Although I used to watch it just for the roar of the T-Rex, the movie was still a perfect way for me to kill two hours on those boring Sundays I still deal with. While the idea of a movie that has the plot of ""resurrecting"" dinosaurs, the movie does an excellent job in making the plot believable and actually made me think: ""If we had the right preparations, could we create dinosaurs?"" It sounds crazy, but the movie really gets you thinking that after the easy-to-follow description of how they brought back the extinct lizards. As a movie directed by Steven Speilburg, the least one could've expected when watching a movie like this for the first time would be excellent CGI, and let me tell you, this looks better than many movies of today, and it's over twelve years older than them. Not only do the dinosaurs look astounding and believable, but the action they're put in (along with the actors) is equally satisfying and thanks to all-around great acting performances, there's plenty of well-done suspense throughout the film as well. But one of the many parts of this movie that immediately made me dig it was the music. The theme music in this film isn't only instantly recognizable, but it's also unforgettable and always a joy to listen to when watching a movie as fun and thrilling as this. While Speilburg has made (and still does make) some disappointing flicks he's still one of the top directors in my eyes and this one in particular stands out as a big hallmark. If you're looking for real entertainment that's larger than life, look no further than this thrill ride through the jungle."

"gottogorunning","9","4","5","13 August 2005"," Great Movie
","This movie was really great. Don't get me wrong. I loved it. But I really think the first half of this could have been A LOT better. The action doesn't even start until an hour of viewing. But what follows is absolutely terrific. It scares you at times when dinos pop out of nowhere and it is one f/x movie that people really liked. Most movies of this kind (Independence Day, Godzilla, Armageddon, etc. Which I liked ALL of) are movies that don't really please like this movie. It's got really smart action sequences and fairly good acting but I think they should have used more popular stars, but you mostly concentrate on the dinosaurs, which do good acting jobs. I thought they would have been nominated for Best Actresses. The f/x are another thing. They look really good! Only if the first half was more exciting but oh well. The rest of the movie makes up for that mistake. That leaves one more thing. The sequel. I thought the sequel was top notch. It was even better than this movie. In my opinion, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is just slightly better than the first because it starts out with more action. That's unlikely for sequels. Watch them both. They will be remembered for generations. Until they become extinct. Or when the next blockbuster hits with great f/x and good script. Crowd-pleaser's are so hard to find these days, aren't they?"
"gjwslw-2","9","4","5","3 June 2005"," Truly incredible film-making
","I've watched this film many times and have yet to see a technical flub. The only disappointment is Jeff Goldblum. He was the only distraction of an otherwise brilliant film and singlehandedly destroyed Jurassic II. Attenborough was certainly the highlight of the actors and the rest of the cast (excepting Goldblum) were adequate to good. The real star of course, is the brilliant film-making. The only other film that impressed me as much was the original Star Wars. I would give a 10+ for Star Wars compared to a 9 for JP because SW used humor as well as fabulous technique. Too bad so many movies become too tense that the director doesn't realize the audience needs a little break. A prime example was ""Psycho"". The tension just kept building right up through the attack on Janet Leigh. It was about unbearable until Anthony Perkins rolled her car into the quicksand to hide it and it only sank halfway before giving a burp and sinking the rest of the way. The only laugh in the movie but in the perfect spot."
"boo_4ever","9","4","5","14 March 2005"," Dino -mite! (sorry)
","As a kid who was fascinated by dinosaurs JP was a dream come true for me. I was obsessed with this film. Because of this I still love the series - even Lost World and JP3.<br/><br/>A lot of people miss the point I think when reviewing Jurassic Park films. For me anyway its all about the dinosaurs and the set pieces involving them. I don't watch for the in depth science talk or character development. Altho having said that the science babble in the first film here partly inspired my love of science.<br/><br/>By todays standards Jurassic Park takes a long time to get going and unless you are interested in the science behind it you're going to get pretty bored during the first 45 mins or so. Until of course you are hit when one of the most memorable moments in film history - the Rex attack. From then on its a dinosaur onslaught, and while I think the dino attacks are better done in the later films, here they still pack a punch.<br/><br/>I loved everything about this movie. Even the music has become synonymous with some of my favourite summer memories."
"Brad2002","9","4","5","14 February 2004"," Brilliant idea ( may contain spoilers )
","What makes this movie good is the idea behind it - what if you could bring extinct animals ( in this case, Dinosaurs of course ) back to life using DNA? It's one of those ""I wish I'd thought of that"" ideas. Another thing that makes it good is it's the first Dinosaur movie ( that I know of ) to realistically portray dinosaurs ( due to exceptional visual effects ). The story revolves around, as mentioned, a rich entrepreneur using science to create a dinosaur theme park on a tropical island. He invites several 'experts' to the island to get approval at which point, due to a containment problem, the dinosaurs run loose and create havoc and terror for the humans. Again, the real value of this movie is the original idea behind it and the very good story built on the basic premise."

I can say that I started to be more interested about the dinosaurs after this film,reading about some of them in some books and websites. Other thing very important about this movie, is to think about cloning and the consequences behind of it; I mean,one of the news I read those days, was about some scientists that found the corpse of a mammoth in a good state and already think about cloning it.

I fear that mass produced CGI is flooding the theatres these days with, in my opinion, unsatisfactory results. When I walked out of Jurassic Park, I literally had to re-school myself on the fact that dinosaurs have indeed been extinct for 75 million years and did not ""come out of retirement"" to make this movie!"

Steven Spielberg adapts the novel faithfully and brings the dinosaurs to life with amazing technology which still amazes me to this day. John William's score is still as unforgettable as ever, it's just a really beautiful and moving score that suits the movie perfectly. Sam Neill and Laura Dern are perfect as the leads and Richard Attenborough is a great support.<br/><br/>The standout here, though, are the special effects. The dinosaurs are re-created beautifully and all the action scenes are genuinely believable and never hokey. When this came out in 1993 audiences worldwide were amazed, they had never seen something so amazing and it topped the box-office (until Titanic arrived in 1997).

","The biggest attraction of this film back in 1993, of course, was the realistic computer graphic animation of the dinosaurs by SGI coupled with the realistic sound effects and the good use of suspense built around them both.<br/><br/>After I first saw this movie in the theatre 24 years ago, I laid in bed awake for hours, not from fright, but from the lingering excitement of the entire experience. Up to that time, nothing like it had ever been done on that scale. This is hard to remember when, since then, the Discovery Channel came up with the whole ""Walking with ..."" series of documentaries on dinosaurs, early man, and creatures before the dinosaur that use the same techniques that this film did, and thus people have become accustomed to this level of realism in animation both on the small and large screen.<br/><br/>Thus with the ""shock value"" of the animation removed, this movie doesn't seem quite as ""5-star"" as it did during its first run. The dialogue, in particular, seems a bit thin now. One aspect of the movie that still impresses me that doesn't get much mention is the outstanding use of sound and sound effects. For example, when the T-Rex first appears in the movie, it is not just the sight of the thing that terrifies, but its tremendous roar. It is still great action adventure viewing for the entire family."

The close-ups of the details created by ILM on the dinosaurs were absolutely wonderful, believable and outright realistic.<br/><br/>As far as adaptations go Michael Crichton wrote the screenplay himself, so regardless of my personal feelings, I accept the story to be as close as was workable to the original literary work, though it felt heavily like a ""Westworld"" remake...with dinosaurs.<br/><br/>It earns a 9.1/10 for actually making it feel real, from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"HelloTexas11","4","25","53","27 October 2007"," not a fan
","I've seen Jurassic Park probably five or six times, and each time I hope I'll like it better than the last, and I never do. A perfectly wonderful book by Michael Crichton is given the 'Spielberg' treatment and aside from the wonderful special effects, betrayed badly.<br/><br/>Where to begin? First and foremost, one of Spielberg's worst tendencies is to find annoying personal characteristics endearing. The two children aren't precocious and charming, they're little brats, no matter how hard the director tries to paint them otherwise. The character of John Hammond, in the book, was as I recall a rather devious, unscrupulous man; here, he is portrayed as a cheerful, slightly ditsy, misguided Santa Claus. And Laura Dern manages to almost single-handedly sink this movie. Her perpetual ""I don't know whether to laugh or cry"" expression is probably the single most irritating element in a film full of them. And everyone smiles WAY too much.<br/><br/>Spielberg, for all his supposed genius, also delivers some of the most excruciating action and danger scenes on record. Whenever one of the human characters is in a spot, it is inevitably his or her own stupid fault. They can't lock the door, they won't turn the flashlight off, they're too scared to jump off the fence, they can't run fast enough... every damn scene is like this, to where you want to reach into the screen and slap the hell out of them.<br/><br/>Sam Neill comes off best, in what is really a thankless role as the straight man for all this nonsense. But he's dragged down by the same sappy script.<br/><br/>Well, what about those special effects, you might ask? Yes, the dinosaurs are spectacular and very believable (much more so than the humans really) and they are the only reason I'm giving this four stars out of ten. In 1993, we were still being blown away by filmmakers constantly upping the ante when it came to mind-blowing effects and sure enough, Jurassic Park was state-of-the-art when it came out. Since then, I daresay people have become more blase about such things as they have become more routine.<br/><br/>To be fair, there are some wonderful sequences in Jurassic Park and it's certainly worth seeing at least once. I suppose ultimately that is the most maddening thing about it; it could have been so much better, not just another summer blockbuster, but a truly great motion picture. It's a real shame that it's not."

","What a great thing of wonder would a theme park full of dinosaurs be, if only it was all that straight forward. A great cast leads this classic dinosaur experience.

And of course you have to give a shout out to John Williams' fantastic score in the movie as well. There's nothing I can think about that's bad in this movie.

"ismaelslgd","9","2","2","22 July 2019"," Unlike the dinosaurs, Jurassic Park never gets old
","I was the dinosaur kid growing up. Books, toys, movies, drawings, my eight year old imagination was often filled with images of meat-eaters, plant eaters, T. rexes and triceratopses. So one could figure that watching Jurassic Park for the first time was a milestone for me. Technically, I did not see the suspenseful opening scene the first time because I was cowering through it. After that, the movie eased up and I was able to take in all of the thrill that the characters, story, music and, yes, the dinosaurs brought to it. The film was everything I had hoped it would be.<br/><br/>A decade and a half later Jurassic Park still holds up as an incredibly rewatchable movie, right up there with big hits like The Dark Knight and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's also super quotable. Instead of covering my eyes in the opening scene I enjoy anticipating each line as it comes, almost like a game. Ian Malcom's character, played by Jeff Goldblum in perhaps his most iconic role, has some classic deliveries. ""Dino d-droppings? Droppings?"" That line itself is too much fun, and there are dozens of others that stay with you.<br/><br/>Do not think I am all tongue-in-cheek about what makes the film enjoyable, however. Jurassic Park is extremely well made. In addition to the dialogue, the story is very effective. While it can be corny at times, its strength lies in the fact that it does not try to do too much with the dinosaurs and with the carnage people often associate with monster films (which is what JP is at its core). This allows the film to be more concentrated on one location and a small set of characters, and thus make the overall story stronger. It also helps with the suspense! With Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg has mastered the art of the monster film by not revealing too much of the dinosaurs too early. These were techniques he certainly learned while working with B-movies and ones he further cultivated with Jaws as well. But Jurassic Park's effects blow the shark flick's out of the water. Not only does the CGI from Jurassic Park look more realistic than the one from Jurassic World (released more than two decades later!), the crew even created legitimate animatronic dinosaurs that were as close to perfect as anyone has ever attempted. Put that all together and you have a film whose special effects make it timeless.<br/><br/>I haven't even gotten to the music yet! John's Williams' score for the film is tied to its legacy in the same vein as the dinosaurs and Ian Malcolm are. I cannot imagine the film scored any other way. The music will stick with you just as much as the memorable lines.<br/><br/>I may be biased towards Jurassic Park, as it is intrinsically tied to my childhood. But unlike other movies from my early days, I still find myself watching it again and again. The story may not be the deepest, although it does contain an important message about the power of the natural world, but the craft and wonder that is behind the production make you feel transported whenever you watch. It is a special moment when John Hammond steps out onto the field and utters the famous words, ""Welcome to Jurassic Park."" Even on the twentieth viewing, it still feels as if you have arrived for the first time."
"truemythmedia","9","2","2","8 May 2019"," Master of the Blockbuster
","Is there any piece of this movie that is not iconic?<br/><br/>Every set piece, every character, every bit of dialogue, every swell of music, every dinosaur... just... Wow!<br/><br/>Sure there are flaws in logic here and there, but I expect that from Spielberg. In his blockbusters he always puts the fun of the movie ahead of the logic of the movie, but always in a way that doesn't betray the other parts of the film which make it fun. This is what makes him the master.<br/><br/>There are directors with higher box office totals, more awards, and higher rotten tomatoes ratings, but none of them create the holistic works that Spielberg does. His blockbusters have something for everyone without leaving anyone feeling like they were paid lip service and frustrated."

","My parents took me to see this at a drive-in theater when I was 5-years old. I hope they didn't have to pay for my entry because I spent the majority of the film hiding beneath the dashboard. In fact, I was so traumatized by the experience that the next time I went to Chuck-E-Cheese, I hid under a table. Then years later, I saw the movie again when I was about 13-years old and I absolutely fell in love. The storytelling is simple. Man creates island of dinosaurs, needs experts to come out and validate safety/accuracy of park, and then things go horribly wrong. It's simple but very effective. Each shot tells a visual story in itself and enhances the writing in a way that drives the story forward without every feeling rushed or too slow. The acting is incredible. The music is something that's stayed with me for years. Although, that's partly because I've watched this movie at least 15 times since I fell in love with it. Great movie with great scares and I absolutely recommend it to any action and thriller movie fans."

"njt-63687","10","2","2","14 February 2019"," My all-time favorite movie...but, it needed something more - Part 1
","Very few films get a 10/10 star rating from me (most get 9/10 or less) and JURASSIC PARK has made it to this high rating. It is my all-time favorite film out of ANY film. The sequels fared well, but none of them got higher than 9/10 stars.<br/><br/>However, even my favorite film is not without its flaws. These are based on my own personal opinions and not actual flaws from the film itself. When I say ""flaws"", I mean there could have been things to make my favorite film even better than it already is. So, without further ado, let me say what would have improved this film that it didn't feature.<br/><br/>1 - THE RAPTORS
No, I don't mean they should have had feathers, as many people have said many times over. What I mean is they should have had much more screen time and depicted as less vicious than they were. They have become my favorite of all the dinosaurs...and probably one major reason this is my favorite film. I sympathize with them and fiercely defend them.<br/><br/>Let's start out with the intro scene when the Raptor is being hauled by a large crate and about to be moved into a tight security pen. For the Raptor inside, it must have felt like it was about to go to a prison cell. Indeed, the pen itself DOES look like a security prison for inmates. I'm sure this must have scared and confused the animal. So, what does a confused, frightened animal do? Defend itself...hence, the scene as it played out. It grabbed the first thing that was within its reach. Unfortunately for Jophery, it happened to be him.<br/><br/>Now, let's go to the scene when they feed the Raptors a sickly-looking black bull that even I would never touch, let alone eat. Do you REALLY think the Raptors actually ate that thing? Notice when the harness is lifted back up, there is NO blood on it? At least, I never noticed any blood on it. What I believe they did in the pen is cut the animal loose from the harness and shook the trees to put on an act for the visitors. If I were a Raptor and was offered that bull to eat, I'd have thrown up from the sight of it. I suspect at least one of the Raptors did the same thing. The sound of them ""devouring"" the bull while the trees shook may have been one or more of the Raptors vomiting.<br/><br/>Mr. Arnold being killed by the Raptor in the maintenance shed may have been a defense action...or, perhaps he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Since his death was never actually depicted...only showing his severed arm on-screen...it's possible that he may have teased and provoked the animal into attacking him. Who knows? And, Muldoon's death was justified. He hated them from the beginning and wanted them destroyed. The Raptors weren't stupid. They knew they had to get rid of him before he got rid of them.<br/><br/>When it came to the Raptors ""stalking"" Tim and Lex in the kitchen, I believe it was a mistake. They initially came for the food that was left on the table in the dining room, but the kids misunderstood and went to hide. Why did the Raptors follow them into the kitchen? They probably thought the kids had more food in the kitchen. After all, what do you think kitchens are used for? Although it seemed like one Raptor was charging at Lex (only for it to bang its head against a shiny cabinet after being fooled by her reflection), I believe its intention was not to kill her, but merely catch her. Perhaps, it was hungry and believed she could be a chef and maybe wanted her to make some food.<br/><br/>But, once it was injured, it became angry and believed these humans were a threat to them. That belief set the remainder of this film in motion as we've seen it. One Raptor was kicked in the face by Grant, which only made the Raptors even more angry than before. By that point, they were on the defense and attempted to defend themselves from Grant, Ellie, and the children until the Tyrannosaurus Rex showed up and finished them off.<br/><br/>Speaking of Ellie, I forgot to mention why the Raptor seemingly ""attacked"" her in the shed. All the noise she and the equipment were making probably got its attention and was curious to see what was going on. When she started screaming, the Raptor was probably confused by this two-legged creature and probably wanted to try and help her calm down. Unfortunately, Ellie took it the wrong way and, thus, the scene played out as we've seen it.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, there should have been a stowaway Raptor hiding in the helicopter when the survivors were flown away from Isla Nublar. This also goes for each of the sequels. All five films should have had a Raptor that goes home with the survivors. That would have made this film (and its sequels) even better than they were.<br/><br/>End of Part 1"
"wisemantonofski","10","2","2","4 February 2019"," A Majestic Spectacle of Film
","A game-changing masterpiece in film, Steven Spielberg brings dinosaurs back to life before your eyes with ground-breaking special effects and a genius for intense and exciting film-making. Its not just about having big scary monsters stomping around, Jurassic Park gives the dinosaurs a transfixing majesty and wonder that its sequels would fail to grasp. This film goes beyond being just another monster movie, with more character and more heart than any others in the genre, dealing with themes of ambition and the consequences of playing God with nature. With an exceptional score by the legendary John Williams which further drives home the feelings of swaying melodic wonder, this film may well be the reason I have such high standards when it comes to film."
"mitchell5954","10","2","2","11 January 2019"," One of My Favorite Movies Period
","Jurassic Park is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of all time. If I made a list of my favorite movies Jurassic Park would be in the top twenty or even top ten. It's an amazing experience that everyone should see if you love cinema. The characters are great and fun, it's grand, it's suspenseful, and the effects look monumental. These are among some of the best effects I've seen on film.<br/><br/>The music is also iconic and has a lot to do with why the film is as good as it is. John Williams, in my opinion, is the greatest composer to come out of Hollywood. He's done some of the most iconic themes in movies. You have Jurassic Park, The Lost World, The Star Wars films, The Indiana Jones films, Superman The Movie, Home Alone, among others. He is a legend in the world of music.<br/><br/>The cast is great as well. I often feel like these people are very underappreciated. Of everyone in the cast the one who has gone on to do the most by far is Samuel L. Jackson. Jeff Goldblum was big for a bit after this film but he pretty much went nowhere by the 2000s. He also gets a lot of crap from critics now which I feel is undeserved as I actually like him as an actor.<br/><br/>Sam Neil hasn't done much either in the 2000s at least as far as American films go. He's done some TV shows which went nowhere. I feel he's one of the most underappreciated actors as he's personally one of my favorites.<br/><br/>The same applies with Laura Dern who's probably one of my favorite actresses. Richard Attenborough also does a great job as John Hammond. He is greatly missed. The rest of the cast does good work as well.<br/><br/>Overall, if you want a grand and epic experience or just want to see a great monster movie than here you are. Hell, if you're a fan of dinosaurs in general than this is the movie to watch. This and Land Before Time made me fascinated with dinosaurs as a kid. It was one of my favorite films then and now."

","Jurassic Park is a 90s adventure film and is part of a four movies series. It was directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Sam Neill and Laura Dern. The plot is fantastic and was well thought. It is about a rich man who decides to invest in a revolutionary development by some great scientists. It consists of getting Jurassic mosquitos that bit dinosaurs in order to acquire their genes. This would lead them to bring dinosaurs to the present time. So he asks a few archeologists to approve a kind of dinosaurs zoo, it will not end well. The cinematography is excellent. In one scene, some kids are hiding from two lethal dinosaurs. In another, you can see how a dinosaur is being born. This movie may sometimes be harsh and maybe scary for kids under 8.

"milosucro","10","2","2","18 July 2018"," An Awe-Inspiring Thriller
","I have yet to see a movie whose practical and CGI effects have aged as beautifully as Jurassic Park. This film also brings a sort of thoughtfulness that similar science fiction adaptations often neglect. While much of the movie showcases the violence and chaos that resulted from the hubris of Hammond, it also gives viewers a chance to feel the awe of the paleontologists when they first glimpse the living flesh of the fossils they had studied for decades. The low camera angles in most of the scenes let the viewer feel as though they are in the park, gazing up at the Brontosaurus for the first time. The ""evil"" in this film is not the dinosaurs, but rather the individuals trying to exploit them for monetary gain and power. It showcases the folly of man's arrogance in their attempt to control and breed creatures who thrived millions of years longer than humans, and continue to adapt despite their efforts to control them. ""Life finds a way"" despite all."
"zdfranz","10","2","2","21 June 2018"," One of the best blockbusters ever.
","There's a line in a trailer for the upcoming sequel Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom in which Chris Pratt's Owen Grady asks, ""do you remember the first time you saw a dinosaur?""<br/><br/>I do.<br/><br/>It was twenty-five years ago, back in 1993, when I watched the original Jurassic Park in theaters for the first time. I was nine years old, and the dinosaurs seemed so real. It wasn't so much the CGI, though that was state-of-the-art and holds up shockingly well. It was the wonder of seeing something for the first time, the spectacle and power of prehistoric life on the big screen.<br/><br/>With that in mind, and the imminent arrival of said sequel, it felt more than appropriate to revisit Jurassic Park as it celebrates its silver jubilee.<br/><br/>The movie was such a landmark, its easy to forget it was based on an equally successful book by Michael Crichton. The relatively simple story didn't change much from page to screen. You all know it anyway:<br/><br/>Idealistic promoter recreates hundreds of dinosaurs with preserved mosquito blood; group of scientists travels to exotic island for sneak peak at theme park of the resurrected beasts; things go terribly wrong; those visitors that don't get eaten spend the remaining time running and screaming.<br/><br/>It's funny-based on this description, the movie sounds like a disposable piece of horror schlock. Nothing could be further from the truth. But how?<br/><br/>Let's start with the most obvious reason-it was directed by Steven Spielberg. And this at a time when he was in his prime, the king of Hollywood. He'd already made Jaws and E.T., and still had future hits like Saving Private Ryan and Lincoln to come. But while he delivered with expected, well-rounded expertise, there's one aspect of Spielberg's approach that's worth highlighting above all others.<br/><br/>It stems from the fact that Jurassic Park the novel is darker and more violent than the movie. In fact, James Cameron (The Terminator, Aliens) nearly nabbed the rights to direct the film instead. By his own admission, his version would've been more intense and graphic-closer to the source material, and almost certainly rated R.<br/><br/>That would've been interesting, but hardly suitable for most nine-year-olds. That's where Spielberg comes in. As with Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark and War of the Worlds, he possesses the special ability to create tension for all ages. Whether a child or adult, when you watch his movies your pulse is racing, nerves consistently brought to the brink but never over the edge. You leave the theater not afraid, but exhilarated, a smile of sheer energy spread across your face.<br/><br/>But he doesn't do it alone. There are so many other reasons why, a quarter-century later, Jurassic Park still feels new. Take John Williams' legendary score, which nearly upstaged the dinosaurs themselves and remains popular today. Or the way David Koepp's underrated script peppers in saving doses of humor (""I'm always on the lookout for the next ex-Mrs. Malcolm"").<br/><br/>Who were Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum before this movie? Certainly not household names. They were never really movie stars, either. Instead, they were-and are-skilled actors that lend Jurassic Park an envious on-screen pedigree among summer blockbusters. And despite many modern complaints of 'annoying' child stars, Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello have consistently avoided such a label. The credit is theirs, displaying a genuine combination of fascination and fear, making them simply what every actor hopes to be-part of the movie.<br/><br/>Like Star Wars, Terminator 2 and Toy Story, Jurassic Park broke technological ground. But also like those movies, it connected with its audience beyond mere scale and pixels. This is why, twenty-five years later, we keep coming back to the original. And why its next twenty-five will roar just as loudly."

I always like the sci-fi take (here getting DNA and bringing up lost species, marking area, carnivores-herbivores, violent nature of certain species and so on) in these sorts of movies.

My favorite scene is when the raptors invade the kitchen to search for the kids, and i also liked the final battle between the T- rex and the two raptors. The Robert Muldoon vs. raptor scene was also epic. The film was also a big box office success and spawned 3 sequels, The Lost World, Jurassic Park 3 and the all new Jurassic World.

"abouhelier-r","10","2","2","1 June 2015"," Jurassic Park
","During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough. When I first saw this film it was the most mind blowing film I had ever experienced. On paper, the movie was made for Steven Spielberg: combining the scares of Jaws with the high tech, romance of E.T the Extra-Terrestrial , Close Encounters of the Third Kind and of course adding the challenge of creating the dinosaurs themselves. This 1993 dino-fest, has gone down in movie history as the film that cracked open the Pandora's box of cgi. This film is a true movie milestone, a real experience and it made an entire generation of children fall in love with dinosaurs. Jurassic Park changed the entire game of film making for ever, creating cgi dinosaurs that still holds up 20 years from then: good work Steven! He steped the bar so high that it's still there today. Michael Crichton who co-wrote the film with David Koepp presents his story on a fascinating and detailed note on both the possibilities and evils of modern science. Moreover, characters are all very good as each one of them have something special that make them human. Sam Neill isn't particularly close to children, Laura Dern actually has a strong female role and has a good chemistry with both Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum; who is one of those supporting characters that steals the entire show. Jeff Goldblum character is so much fun, he's smooth and smart, not this goofy guy that pops jokes every once in a while. Ian Malcolm is actually a well written character with a great brain and he seems to foreshadow what is going to happen. Plus, Richard Attenborough's character has so many layers which is very interesting. Each one of them are important and not just funny, they are likable characters who seems like real people with backgrounds and who all relate to the story. ""Welcome to Jurassic Park"" doesn't quite cover it. Spielberg did such a good job engrossing us into this world. From just a visual and technical aspect this film is near flawless. Watching this film 22 years later, there obviously some point where you can tell it's cgi but for the 95% of the film the cgi is still outstanding. The realism with which they were able to create those dinosaurs is amazing. They are all indeed a triumph of special effects artistry. Steven Spielberg created one of the most jaw-dropping scene in movie history. The brachiosaurs Neill and Dern see for the first time are tall, majestic leaf-eaters, grazing placidly in the treetops. There is a sense of grandeur to them. Half of that is due to John Williams brilliant theme. This music is fantastic! I love it so much, I may even love it more than Star Wars. This very scene when Sam Neill stares at them, with this music, at that point everything's okay with the world. Everything's perfect. We don't make movies like this anymore. That kind of silence in a movie when a character stares at something and the music swipes you into it. I miss that awe. Nowadays most of the movies are so quick-edited, so packaged and ready to be delivered on a theatre, so an audience could sit there and not be bored. This movie takes its time to tell a story, get you to the characters, make you understand the plot and then the dinosaurs are everywhere. Clearly dinosaurs dominate Jurassic Park in every way. Amazingly graceful and convincing, they set a sky-high new standard for computer generated special effects. They create a triumphant illusion. You believe you have spent some time in a dino-filled world. Plus, Spielberg built up an imminent sense of threat over the first hour of the movie. In fact, Jurassic Park keeps its viewers on edge of their seats while leaving the real violence to the imagination. Besides, this film has the best jump scares ever, that I won't spoil if you didn't already see the movie (but if you don't I beg you to), because Spielberg didn't go for the numb cliché. He knows how to create legitimate tension in his film and it's not just the tension in the last half which is so fun and impressive but the sustain wonder through the entire first half of the film. Two set pieces ares especially effective: the first one is a scene where a T-Rex mauls a car with screaming children inside, and the other one is when the children play hide and seek with two velociraptors in the park's kitchen. Everybody can stage a fight, but it takes Mr Steven Spielberg to show just how the plots and pans might go flying at the stroke of a velociraptor's tail. This scene also helps to look at the bigger picture. Who but Steven Spielberg could convince an audience that there are dinosaurs loose in a kitchen at all? Jurassic Park smacks everyone in the face with awe, imagination, and all the things that are the reasons why movies are made. Tastes in movies are subjective but in my opinion the answer to: why movies are made? Definitely is movies such as Jurassic Park, Star Wars or even recently Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy. <br/><br/>Overall Steven Spielberg, the man who invented the summer event movie took Michael Crichton's book and transformed it into an awe-inspiring legendary blockbuster, using every inch of the screen he was given with cool characters, impressive cgi, wonder and danger. Jurassic Park changed entertainment at a genetic level."

","This is one of the best 90's movie ever. I cannot believe this movie is more than 20 years old now. The movie has better CGI than some movies made nowadays. The dinosaurs are sooo real it's unbelievable. If you haven't watched this movie, you have to do it right now. I watched this movie when I was a kid and about 3 years ago I had the great idea of watching it again. No regrets at all. The movie was fresh as it were filmed some months ago. I didn't remember it so well done.<br/><br/>The OST is amazing, John Williams made a great job here, as he's always made. It has funny scenes (like the toilet one or the Dr. Ian Malcolm's laughter at the helicopter) and some scary ones(like the kitchen scene at the ending or the ones with the T-Rex)."

","The content of this movie is as the title says, but what special about it that the writers added a full rational logic behind the story, that will make the viewer wish that it is almost real. The characters were well written, including the casting, I can not imagine any other actors doing better jobs than Sam Neil, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Wayne Knight. Moreover, the directing is some other great part that made the movie successful but a normal guy like me can not really talk about it, but I will refer the viewer to watch documentaries and behind the sets to feel the great work that happened in the early 90s. This movie is definitely one of the top movies in my All Time Movies.

"screechpu","9","2","2","22 March 2015"," One of my first movies, still a classic
","Jurassic Park is a film that gives a solid perspective of the old moral question of whether or not man should play God when dealing with other species on the planet. We are shown in various examples that man has little understanding of ecosystems (namely extinct ones) and the variables that arise that can completely alter the outcome.<br/><br/>The story centralizes around John Hammond's (Richard Allenborough) dream to bring dinosaurs into the modern day, and share the creation with the world by means of an amusement park. Initial problems arise with the park, which causes his company lawyer, Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) to require experts to visit the location and determine it is safe. Between the two, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), a paleontologist, Dr. Ellie Satler (Laura Dern), a paleobotanist, and Dr. Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) are brought to investigate the park's various systems. A combination of flawed practices by the geneticists and a greedy programmer, Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) creates chaos when the dinosaurs escape into the park.<br/><br/>One of the first examples I noticed to show mankind's lack of understanding is when Dr. Satler notices some of the plant life near the visitor's center and identifies it as toxic, even going so far as calling it a life form that will defend itself, violently, if necessary. The plants were chosen simply because of their appearance, with little regard to their actual make-up. This plant variable also appears again when the group is examining a sick Triceratops and Satler is attempting to find the source of the poisoning by examining the dinosaur's droppings.<br/><br/>Another example is first shown when Drs. Grant, Malcolm, and Satler are going through the tour of the laboratory and are shown that dinosaur DNA is supplemented with frog DNA to fill in the gaps that are present in the amber samples they have. The dinosaurs are modified to be only female through Dr. Wu's (B.D. Wong) team of geneticists. Later on, it is discovered by Dr. Grant, Lex (Ariana Richards), and Tim (Joseph Mazzello) that the dinosaurs are in fact breeding, shown by the egg shells they find while making their way back to the visitor's center. Grant goes on to explain that some frogs are capable of changing gender in a single-sex environment, thus being able to breed. Since frog DNA was used to complete the dinosaur strands, it is a cause of the dinosaurs being able to reproduce.<br/><br/>Human greed also further creates chaos when Nedry creates a complex program to shut down the security and power systems throughout the park so he can steal dinosaur embryos for a rival of Hammond's. With the systems down, the dinosaurs escape their containments and begin to roam freely in the park. A highlight of the unpredictability of the dinosaurs is shown by the Velociraptors effectively hunting the team in various points. The level of intelligence of the raptors is completely underestimated by the humans, as they employed an ambush on Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck), and demonstrated the ability to problem-solve by opening doors and communicating.<br/><br/>Overall, it is shown that there is much about nature that man does not know. Exemplified here is an extinct ecosystem that man only knows about from fossil records. Though fossils give much insight into the past, it is not a complete picture. Also, there was a level of excitement on being able to accomplish the revival without looking into other methods that might have proved safer and more secure. The moral question is always present, that even though we have the capability to do a great act, it might not always be wise to actually do it. Especially when dealing with a living creature (plant or animal), as Malcolm stated in the movie, ""Life finds a way."""

","They have a T-Rex... enough said. If you need more to see this film then here is Ebert's review.<br/><br/>(As the film opens, two dinosaur experts (Sam Neill and Laura Dern) arrive at the park, along with a mathematician played by Jeff Goldblum whose function in the story is to lounge about uttering vague philosophical imprecations. Also along are Attenborough's grandchildren, and a lawyer, who is the first to be eaten by a dinosaur.<br/><br/>Attenborough wants the visitors to have a preview of his new park, where actual living prehistoric animals live in enclosures behind tall steel fences, helpfully labeled ""10,000 volts."" The visitors set off on a tour in remote-controlled utility vehicles, which stall when an unscrupulous employee (Wayne Knight) shuts down the park's computer program so he can smuggle out some dinosaur embryos. Meanwhile, a tropical storm hits the island, the beasts knock over the fences, and Neill is left to shepherd the kids back to safety while they're hunted by towering meat-eaters.<br/><br/>The plot to steal the embryos is handled on the level of a TV sitcom. The Knight character, an overwritten and overplayed blubbering fool, drives his Jeep madly through the storm and thrashes about in the forest. If this subplot had been handled cleverly - with skill and subtlety, as in a caper movie - it might have added to the film's effect. Instead, it's as if one of the Three Stooges wandered into the story.<br/><br/>The subsequent events - after the creatures get loose - follow an absolutely standard outline, similar in bits and pieces to all the earlier films in this genre, from ""The Lost World"" and ""King Kong"" right up to the upcoming ""Carnosaur."" True, because the director is Spielberg, there is a high technical level to the execution of the clichés. Two set-pieces are especially effective: A scene where a beast mauls a car with screaming kids inside, and another where the kids play hide and seek with two creatures in the park's kitchen.<br/><br/>But consider what could have been. There is a scene very early in the film where Neill and Dern, who have studied dinosaurs all of their lives, see living ones for the first time. The creatures they see are tall, majestic leaf-eaters, grazing placidly in the treetops. There is a sense of grandeur to them. And that is the sense lacking in the rest of the film, which quickly turns into a standard monster movie, with screaming victims fleeing from roaring dinosaurs.)"
"DEATHSukka4","10","2","2","15 November 2014"," The Movie that killed a Genre...
","What was the last great dinosaur movie? Mind drawing a blank? That's the power of Jurassic Park, still working its magic from Summer 1993. The film decimated dinosaur movies to the point of near extinction. Every once in a while, there's an attempt at it but its quickly compared to Jurassic Park and immediately dismissed.<br/><br/>A good dinosaur movie has a very limited range where it can work for all audiences, and Jurassic Park encompassed nearly all points of interest. This is why the Jurassic Park franchise has steadily gone downhill. It's own sequels don't even live up to the original movie because the original took so much away. Whatever Jurassic Park left in the pot, Lost World slurped up and still came out campy as ever. All Jurassic Park 3 had to work with is the scraps its predecessors left behind; very embarrassing.<br/><br/>The only answer to Jurassic Park I can think of is perhaps a remake that is more faithful to the book and of course this would lead to an entire reboot of the franchise which is a huge gamble. A remake would be awkward though when the original movie from more than 20 years ago is still putting similar movies to shame in special effects. So what's Hollywood to do? If there was anything I'd want to see in 3D, of course it would be films from the past given a proper 3D update (no red/blue glasses). It was only in this re-mastered 3D version that I began to finally see age in the CGI. While it gave scale and depth to my favorite scenes, like when a raptor face pushes through the brush over the shoulder of a distracted Muldoon to which he states ""Clever girl..."" and being mauled to death by a man in a raptor suit, in other scenes with extensive CGI I saw some rather dull textures. Still though, this was the next logical step for the Jurassic Park franchise. It wasn't given a huge push or anything, a modest release is all it needed.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is a legendary film that left very little to the imagination. 3D is the perfect way to revisit it. It's a must have in any fan's Blue-Ray collection and a refreshing rerelease. Jurassic Park... tyrant movie king!"
"byson5186","9","2","2","7 October 2014"," Great Movie That Never Gets Old
","It's interesting to think how this movie is from 1993. You can watch it years later, and it most likely will not feel old to you. The technology in the movie doesn't even seem that old along with the idea of cloning dinosaurs, bringing them back to life. This is also a great movie to watch if you have friends over. I'm sure they've seen it and would love to see it again. It's just a fun, adventure, scary, and happy movie to watch. It's not like a cheesy movie of dinosaurs coexisting with people, but more a movie showing how people figured out how to bring dinosaurs back to life and tried to have an attraction for people at an amusement park known as Jurassic Park. I'll tell you that if there was such a place as Jurassic Park, I'd go if I could as I would think it would be worth it to see dinosaurs in person if the park was secure as it was supposed to be in the movie. The effects they did for the dinosaurs are also really great effects, even in today's standards. The action in this movie will also keep your eyes glued to the screen. So, while this is a great movie it still has its flaws. For one, basically all the areas you see in the movie, except maybe where Dennis Nedry had a brief scene are uncivilized areas, areas most of us probably aren't familiar with. The park was supposed to be on it's own island called, Isla Nublar I forget exactly where it was supposed to be, but obviously it was a park far from civilization as even the people who would want to go to the island would have to do a lot to travel there and as Alan and the others were supposed to be spending a weekend at the park, they don't show things like beds or rooms they could be sleeping in, and it's interesting how the park seemed fully staffed, but almost everyone besides the main characters seem to leave by the time the action starts. Other flaws, well I think the movie had great acting but the actors don't seem like your everyday people. I mean they seem to wear clothes that aren't your everyday clothes, but clothes that work in a dinosaur world. They also don't seem too traumatized after going through some of the most scary experiences you can go through. I mean let's talk about the kids Tim and Lex for example. I feel like none of the kids they've shown in any of the Jurassic Park films seem realistic. But, looking at Tim and Lex, I mean how cool would it be for them to be like the first kids in the world having experiences with dinosaurs being able to see them in person. That doesn't seem like a really big deal for them, they seem mostly there for the tour and we see how Tim mostly seems interested in books especially about dinosaurs, and Lex is interested in computers. But, we don't really hear much about their lives outside of Jurassic Park, I mean obviously they'd have school and stuff which they don't talk about. Also, those two have lots of injuries and go through horrifying experiences and again not really showing signs of trauma or pain and in the next scene they are like telling jokes. The ending scene at Jurassic Park which I won't spoil also seems unrealistic. So, despite these flaws the movie is by all means a great movie, one you can watch over and over again and that never gets old. You could even consider some of the flaws I mentioned, and not that it makes it a bad movie, but questions people like me will have left unanswered. Overall, I give this movie a 9/10. It's a great movie, but some of its flaws keep it from being a 10."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","2","2","28 June 2014"," Classic dinosaur storytelling that is scary as you can get!
","Dinosaurs were some of the most magnificent creatures to roam the Earth, and lived during the Mesozoic era about 65-230 million years ago. With the power of cinema these magnificent beasts can still live on and please audiences for centuries. Jurassic Park is the story of three doctors who study at a theme park that is home to cloned dinosaurs. Technically not every species is from the Jurassic era. You have some Cretaceous and Triassic cold-blooded buddies running around as well. When the doctors continue their study on the life of the creatures, a strong power-outage is caused due to weather, and this causes many creatures to roam free outside of their controlled boundaries. And yes this means Tyrannosaurus Rex and Velociraptors too, which causes intense horror scenes involving being eye to eye, hiding, and chased for food. The film has very realistic dinosaurs, and for 1993, the effects are miraculous. It would be very difficult for a special effects team to create visually re-mastered dinosaurs that match the iconic physiology of the ones Steven Spielberg and his team have created. Every dinosaur is focused on in different ways. Some show the beauty these creatures have, others show the power and terror they are capable of causing. The horror isn't overdone or disturbing at all, which is why the scenes are scary! The shock value and mystery Spielberg adds is similar to how he did the shark in 'Jaws.' He makes the creatures suspicious and elusive before popping out and scaring the heck out of us. The classic scenes in which the T-Rex chases the car before stopping his way in causing the glass of water to shake and attacking the car like it was a raw piece of meat are cinematic beauty. Spielberg has created a film full of science, wonder, visual beauty, and terror that is made in wondrous ways technically, and will provide pure entertainment for centuries."

","(Jurassic Theme playing) Awesome, awesome, this film is just so awesome! It's got the best CGI affects and Spielberg! What more could you ask from a dino flick? And now I'll just say why I like it so much.....<br/><br/>Since ET and Jaws, Stephen Spielberg has been my favorite director, because he knew how to make a good story and keep people on the edge of their seats and sometimes biting their nails and this film was no exception!<br/><br/>As a little girl I was afraid of seeing it because the thought of dinosaurs scared me - or at least the T-rex and I was sure that they would make the T-rex the most thrilling and suspenseful part of the movie. When I finally saw it I was just blown away, especially when we get a look at the first set of dinosaurs when the tourists arrive. They looked realistic (most of them) and I loved how creative the writers were with these creatures like how one of them is like a frilled lizard and has venomous saliva, and the raptors are super intelligent (wonder if they could do my math homework). I don't know what it is about the T-rex that is the best out of them all, but I just love her anyways! It is hard to decide which part with her is the best, the break out or the epic ending. In fact at the end when she knocks over the dino bones and stands there roaring I just want to caption underneath: ""Get outta here, dead bones; I'M THE REAL THING!"" <br/><br/>I was always looking forward to seeing the dinosaurs more than the humans, and overall, they're worth it! The effects, especially at that time were just unbelievable. I don't hate the human casting, I love them - especially Richard Attenborough (John Hammond), though we've seen human casting lots of times; seeing the dinosaurs are way cooler! I often don't notice most of them being robotic or puppets, I really believe them to be dinosaurs! That's a pretty strong thing compared to the Jaws shark, which was easily identified as a robot. I could suspend my disbelief about these stars! I just only wish I had seen it in 3D when I had the chance."

Imagine how scary it was back then, when we hadn't all been so desensitized to blood and violence.

The story, based on the acclaimed novel by Micheal Crichton is fantastic and comes down to the moral question of science versus nature. The acting is great as is the pacing of the film. I hardly ever mention box office success in my reviews as I feel how much money a film makes has no forbearance on the quality of the film, but it must be mentioned that not only is one of the most successful movies of its time, but one that to this day remains one of the all time cinematic adventures of film.

"joetufano719","10","2","2","1 October 2013"," One of Spielberg's best and one of the greatest ever
","Jurassic Park was one of the most riveting theater experiences for movie goers back in 1993 at the time of its release. I myself was a toddler so I grew up watching it on VHS, DVD and so on. As a kid I pretty much watched it for the Dinosaurs. I mean come on who didn't like dinosaurs when they were kids? But now as I've gotten older, I've watched it a few more times and have a newfound appreciation for it, and largely thanks to YouTube movie reviewers Chris Stuckmann, Jeremy Jahns and ThatMovieNerd. <br/><br/>Based on the original novel of the same name by Michael Chricton, rich billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) hires a group of paleontologists Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Ellie Satler (Laura Dern) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to take part in a test run for his new dinosaur theme park. Hammond's corporation, InGen used dinosaur DNA they extracted from mosquitoes buried underground and blended it with frog DNA in order to clone the Dinosaurs and bring them to life. Usually before the film's release in '93, dinosaurs were used in adventure B- movies but what makes Jurassic Park so unique is that both the novel and film give scientific explanations for how they were able to create the Dinosaurs. Now these reasons wouldn't happen in real life but here it's presented in a way where it makes you go, ""That could happen!"" Hammond is pretty confident and excited to show his visitors what the island has to offer, but Satler, Grant and especially Ian Malcolm (who thanks to Jeff Goldblum's performance steals every scene he's in) is against it. Malcolm flat out says to Hammond that this experiment is going to fail, and he later says to himself on the tour ""God creates dinosaurs, God destroys dinosaurs, God creates man, man destroys God, and man creates dinosaurs"". Everything is going well on the tour until the power goes out during a storm, thus resulting in the Dinosaurs breaking loose and the tourists including Hammond's grandchildren Lex and Tim try to survive the outbreak. Having read some of the novel itself, the movie doesn't accurately follow the book but it certainly captures the essence of it. <br/><br/>From a visual standpoint, this movie is just mind-blowing. More props were used for most of the close ups of the dinosaurs, particularly the scene where the T-Rex is ripping the SUV apart with Tim and Lex inside of the car scared out of their minds. You would assume that was a CGI shot but it was an actual animatronic. Not so much CGI is used here since Spielberg and the people he usually works on films with like to use practical effects, but while some of the CGI does look a bit dated in some shots, 95% of the rest of it is still ASTOUNDING! <br/><br/>Character/Acting wise, David Koepp's screenplay gives us some pretty solid character development. All the actors in the film deliver 100% and each character (except for maybe Wayne Knight aka Newman) is likable, have interesting backgrounds and they all play an important part in the story. Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) goes through his own arc where he starts out in the beginning of the film not really liking kids too much, but after bonding with Lex and Tim he learns the value of raising children. Ariana Richards (Lex) and Tim (Joseph Mazello) are surprisingly not annoying, they play an important part in the story and Spielberg is a master on working with children in his movies. As for the story structure, where some impatient people might criticize the story for dragging on the film takes it's time to tell its story, sucks you into its world and then about halfway through the film, it all hits the fan. Most films with action these days tend to throw everything at you right from the start, but Jurassic Park isn't one of them.<br/><br/>Spielberg being probably my favorite film director ever, like I said is a master. He adds something to each shot and creates a sustained wonderment mostly with the first time we see the Brachiosaurus. Half of that is thanks to John Williams' brilliant score, which adds to the awe and wonder. Spielberg also knows how to create tension here in the movie. Two scenes in particular being: one scene where Ellie Satler finally gets the power back on and a Velociraptor's head pops out through the wall right behind her. As YouTube movie reviewer Chris Stuckmann described it in his review, ""One of the best jump-scares ever put into a film"". And the other scene where Lex and Tim are in the kitchen trying to evade the raptors, and we as the audience are able to see the fear in the kids' eyes. <br/><br/>Overall, Spielberg and his crew successfully inject quite a bit of heart into the story, and create a nice mix of comedy, adventure and thriller elements that build up to in my opinion one of the best movies ever made, and one of Spielberg's best."

","There are a few truly awe-inspiring moments in movie history. One of the most memorable occurs when Dorothy steps out of her Black & White farm house and into the full color wonderland of Oz. Not far behind is our first glimpse of the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. Director Steven Spielberg brilliantly focused on the stunned reactions of Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr. Ellie Attler (Laura Dern). We smiled because we knew their reactions mirrored ours! Now, twenty years later, the film has been re-released with a very effective 3D re-mastering.<br/><br/>The movie has its place in Hollywood history for its revolutionary use of George Lucas' ILM CGI and the animatronics and visual effects under the supervision of Ray Winston. This was no ordinary science fiction special-effects movie. It was a very interesting, entertaining, thrilling story that brought to life the plastic dinosaur toys of kids and dinosaur dreams of curious adults. This was light years from the Ray Harryhausen stop-action dinosaurs we had seen before. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park had back-stories, childhoods, ferocious roars and a realistic look that tied right into our childhood fantasies.<br/><br/>Never-before-seen special effects would be enough to set this one apart, but it's the story and characters that draw us in and elevate the movie to classic status. John Hammond is a very likable, little old rich man played by Sir Richard Attenborough. In fact, Attenborough is genuinely such a nice guy, he was cast as Kris Kringle in the 1994 re-make of Miracle on 34th Street. He is also an Oscar winning director for Gandhi (1982) and ironically beat out Spielberg (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial) that year. Attenborough also directed A Bridge Too Far (1973), A Chorus Line (1985) and Chaplin (1992); plus, one of my favorite hidden gems: Magic (1978). Unfortunately, Attenborough, now almost 90 years old, has recently been moved into hospice for health reasons.<br/><br/>John Hammond and his team of scientists have taken ""dino DNA"" and brought life to dinosaurs, previously 65 million years extinct. Hammonds' instincts as a showman lead him to develop a kind of amusement park where people can come and see his dinosaur creations in a natural habitat. Facing a lawsuit  what could go wrong??  his investors bring in a team of specialists to inspect the park. Dr. Grant, Dr. Attler and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) take the tour with Hammond's grandchildren (Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards) and a bean counter played by Martin Ferrero. Of course, things go terribly wrong thanks to a sub-plot involving the park's computer guru played by Wayne Knight (Newman from ""Seinfeld""). Don't miss the photo of J Robert Oppenheimer (the atomic bomb creator) on Nedry's computer monitor. Samuel L Jackson has a classic line of dialogue, but also seems to be prepping for his role in Deep Blue Sea (1999). The other key player is the park's game warden played terrifically by the late Bob Peck  he mutters the ""clever girl"" line.<br/><br/>Real life Paleontoligist Jack Horner worked as an adviser on the film and was the inspiration for the Dr. Grant character. It's also interesting to note that there was quite a bidding war for the rights  even before writer Michael Crichton had finished the manuscript. When Spielberg won the rights, he hired Crichton to write the screenplay, and David Koepp was brought in for the final version. Crichton is also known for Westworld (1973), Twister (1996) and The Andromeda Strain (1971). Mr. Koepp is known for his screenplays that include Mission Impossible (1996), Panic Room (2002) and Spider-Man (2002). And of course, the majestic score was composed by the great John Williams, a frequent Spielberg collaborator. <br/><br/>Jurassic Park was nominated for and won three Oscars: Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound. Many believe Jurassic Park should have nominated for the Best Picture, but I doubt Mr. Spielberg much cares. See, he released another movie that same year  Schindler's List did win the Best Picture Oscar. Many ask about the child actors from Jurassic Park. Tim was played by Joseph Mazzello, who was most recently seen in TV's ""Justified"", as the snake-charming traveling preacher. Mr. Mazzello has also appeared in The Social Network, and the mini-series ""The Pacific"". Lexi was played by Ariana Richards and she won the role based on her amazing ability to show and express fear  and her believability as a teenage hacker. Ms. Richards has focused more on her work as an artist, but does act periodically.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is definitely one to experience on the biggest screen possible with the clearest sound possible. This 3D re-mastering is worth the price of admission and I enjoyed seeing the look of awe in the eyes of a few youngsters in the theatre.

","Jurassic Park is a brilliant movie with a great storyline,characters,cast,thrills and suspense.The film was directed by Steven Spielberg,I,like many movie buffs,am a huge fan of him.No movie this man has directed,wrote or produced has disappointed me (some exceptions but,whatever).This movie is brilliant and there where two other installments,The Lost World:Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 3,they where nowhere as good as the original,but,Steven Spielberg is currently in talks for a fourth Jurassic Park,and it seems very likely that there will be one by 2014.I will definitely go see one,I don't wanna give my hopes up but I for some reason feel it will be better than the second and third,lets hope so.<br/><br/>A man takes a preview of a new theme park with his family that he is positive to sponsor.The theme park involves real cloned dinosaurs,trapped in cages.But after a power breakdown,the dinosaurs escape,and no one is safe."

I read Michael Crichton's book about five years ago and it has had the same effect on me as the movie has.<br/><br/>People have often complained the movie has no character development and relies on the amazing visuals but I say that aside from the visuals there are some very intense moments of terror and awe that most science fiction movies today lack.<br/><br/>And I agree that the character development from the book didn't translate to the film but I will point out that Michael Crichton himself took part in writing the screenplay and supervised it and he himself loved the film so you can't really say it's insulting to the novel.<br/><br/>But I will encourage people to read the book before they watch the film or if you've already seen the movie, read the book because it is more in depth and very exciting to read.<br/><br/>Both the movie and book are very highly recommended."

","Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite films. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if it was in every single human being on the face of the earth's top 10 of all time. Jurassic Park was way ahead of its time, and is exactly how a blockbuster is made. I was lucky enough to see the re- release of Jurassic Park for its 20th anniversary. To my supprisement, they were not re-releasing it in 3D, which was also pretty good. <br/><br/>The reason why I love Jurassic Park so much is because its completely perfect in every sense of the word. Steven Spielberg's classic will always be amongst the greatest Sci Fi, adventure films of all time. Brilliant structured story, great character development, amazing special effects and sound mixing, very interesting characters and brilliant filmaking.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend Jurassic Park to anyone who is a fan of Spielberg and Sci fi films. 10/10"
"nathanhmcdonald","10","2","2","4 September 2011"," The ''Jaws'' of my generation.
","Not many movies earn a 10/10 score for me. But Jurassic Park gets it...For me this movie nails everything. Based on the book written by Michael Crichton. Jurassic Park is about a man named John Hammond who does the impossible, he genetically engineers dinosaurs to serve as attractions in his upcoming amusement park Jurassic Park. But before Jurassic Park can open to the public it must be proved to be safe for visitors. John willingly invites the top minds of their respective fields of Paleontology, Mathematics Theory and Paleobotanist. But little known to John Hammond there is trouble brewing right under his very nose...And troubles name is Dennis Nedry the parks underpaid and disgruntled computer programmer who attempts to commit industrial espionage which sets off the chain of events that take place at Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park scores so high for me because it is a truly high quality movie, from the wonderful script to the wonder actors that portrayed their characters as any fan of the book would expect. And the music...This musical score on this movie is worth its weight in gold. This movie also features some very early use of CGI and its actually done quite well, Even watching it today the CGI stands up good to the test of time.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park also features what I consider to be THE best animal attack scene ever filmed in the history of movies. ''Spoiler Ahead'' And that scene is when the Tyrannosaurus Rex breaks out of its containment paddock and attacks the visitors Safari Explores which are parked right next to the disable electric fence that once contained the T-Rex. There is no music in this scene, its filmed to portray the attack as if it were happening to you...And believe me it does well with that.<br/><br/>Many people die in Jurassic Park...Yet it remains relatively gore less. Which might not be a bad thing...Over goreing a movie just looks like you're trying to cover up bad scrip writing and acting. When people get killed in Jurassic Park the camera does not show you exactly what is going on, but lets you see just enough for you mind to make up its own picture of whats unfolding. A nice touch considering many movies today don't let you're mind work for itself. The Book however is quite gruesome in its death descriptions.<br/><br/>I honestly can't think of anything really wrong with this movie...If anything some of the dialog might come off a bit slow. The movie discusses some of the scientific aspects of how the dinosaurs were created and what have you...If you're not interested in this kind of thing, this might seem like a slow part in the movie for you. But overall this a movie I recommend to anyone and everyone. This is a must see for all movie buffs."
"bjvick","10","2","2","16 June 2011"," The theme of Jurassic Park is just because you can do something, doesn't mean that you should.
","Jurassic Park is an action-packed science fiction film based on a Michael Crichton novel. In this film John Hammond played by Richard Attenborough created and owns a ""theme-park"" he has named Jurassic Park. This park is different than most in that it is inhabited by cloned dinosaurs. Dr. Ian Malcolm played by Jeff Goldblum, Dr. Alan Grant played by Sam Neill and Dr. Ellie Sattler played by Laura Dern are all asked to come analyze the safety factor of the park after someone is attacked. At the same time Hammonds two grandchildren Lex and Tim, played by Ariana Richards and Tim Murphy, are also visiting the park. While all of these people are observing the park things go haywire due to a power outage and the dinosaurs start attacking the people.<br/><br/>The theme of Jurassic Park is just because you can do something, doesn't mean that you should. John Hammond was so wrapped up in being able to use his money and technology to do something that no one else has or could do, that he didn't take the time to think about the consequences. Sure, it's great to be cutting edge and create something great for people to enjoy. However, before doing something like this it would be best to stop and rationalize what you are really doing. This movie is a great example of how things can get out of hand really fast. Hammond had great intentions going into this ""project"" of his but he also put a lot of people in danger including Lex and Tim, his grandchildren. They were there to visit with him and see the park and ended up fighting for their lives. Thankfully, Dr. Malcolm and Dr. Sattler were there protecting them as best they could.<br/><br/>It is imperative that people take the time to analyze things before taking action, especially when dealing with something as sensitive as cloning an endangered species. Dealing with something so volatile, you would never know what to expect. Hammond was so caught up with being able to do something because no one else could and with greed of how much money he could make that he didn't test the parks safety until it was too late. It would have been wise to request the Dr.'s visit before actually cloning these animals and starting a park. It would have been wise to think about those animals as well. The whole idea of creating these animals that have been extinct for millions of years and placing them on ""display"" seems a bit over the edge. While Dr. Malcolm and Dr. Sattler are amazed at the genius at the park and the beauty of the animals, they also realize from the get-go that things must be thought through scientifically and logically.<br/><br/>One motif that is repeated throughout the film is the way the film encourages anticipation through movement. There are the scenes where you see water movement making you anticipate what is coming, how big it is and what is it going to do when it gets here? The ground may start to vibrate and this alerts the Dr.'s, the children, Hammond, etc. that something is coming. The movement of the trees and bushes in the scene where the cow is being fed to the raptor is unforgettable; you can tell by the movements what is happening. Leaving it up to the viewer's imagination was classic. This coincides with the theme nicely. Not knowing what to expect is clearly displayed throughout the film. This film thrives on the unexpected. Could Hammond really not foresee something like this happening? This film used sounds effectively. The sound worked with the movements to build to the excitement and fear for the characters, as well as, for the audience. The sound of the dinosaurs roaring make you feel like you are there and actually sends fear through the viewers. The stomping sounds of the dinosaurs approaching the characters send chills down your back. Again, the scene where the raptor is given the cow is a prime example. You can hear the cow's cries, the dinosaur attacking, the movement in the trees and the crunching sound of that poor cow being made into dinner. These sounds actually make you sit back and say, ""he really should of thought this thing through"" or ""is revenue really worth risking all of this for?"" The film Splice compares with Jurassic Park. It's another case of hindsight being 20/20. The scientist in this film also don't stop to think things through because they are so wrapped up in creating something because they can. They ""splice"" DNA of different organisms together to create other species. One of them takes it too far and add's in her own DNA creating this creature that ends up destroying them all.<br/><br/>In the end, technology is great; making money is great. However, when faced with a challenge or an opportunity, we must step back and decide if we should do something just because we can. It's important to remember that technology is not fool proof and the movie is a prime example of that. Take into account that things can go wrong and that negative consequences can outweigh benefits in situations. Using rationale, logic and moral code is important in any venture."

It's a joyride, that keeps you gripped till the end. It's fantastically shot & executed.<br/><br/>'Jurassic Park' takes place on the fictional Isla Nublar near Costa Rica in the Central American Pacific Coast, where a billionaire philanthropist and a team of genetic scientists have created an amusement park of cloned dinosaurs. While During a preview tour, the theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.<br/><br/>Based on the novel of the same name by Michael Crichton, this Sci-Fi Thriller offers interesting & engrossing moments all through. Spielberg directs each sequence beautifully. Cinematography & Editing are perfect. Visual Effects are stunning. While in the acting department, Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Richard Attenborough & Jeff Goldblum pitch in superb performances.<br/><br/>On the whole, A Joyride, that deserves a watch for various reasons. Two Thumbs Up!"
"slothropgr","6","19","40","10 July 2009"," Great Dinos, and that's all
","Sloppy story-telling from start to finish. It's pretty obvious Spielberg didn't give a damn about anything but the dinosaurs, especially not about tight, coherent plotting or believable characters. When I taught screenplay writing in Santa Fe NM I used ""JP"" as a perfect example of how even established directors who should know better can forget what's important. But Saint Steven's always cared more for effects than logic. And the dinos are impressive, even now. They almost distract one from the illogic of that first Grand Revelation with the brachiosaurs, as definitive a moment for fantasy as the star destroyer's overhead entrance in ""Star Wars."" But Sam Neill & Co approach these walking skyscrapers over a mile or so of gently rolling terrain, and they don't notice them until they're almost under hoof. Like I said, effect over logic. Too many of the characters are superfluous or just plain unbelievable. Jeff Goldblum doesn't add a thing to the plot, he just cracks wise and makes pretentious pronouncements (a faculty he perfected in the sequel). In the book his broken leg gave them a time limit to get off the island before the break went septic, but nothing like that here. Once his leg is broken he's basically forgotten. And Richard Attenborough's John Hammond is a kindly old Scots Santa Claus here, but sends his beloved grandkids out into a park that's chock full of dangerous predators--and even more dangerous computer bugs. In the book at least he was a nasty old SOB, though it was still a thin device. Bad plotting: Wayne Knight has lived on the island for months yet can't find his way to the dock because of a rain storm and a fallen sign?? And why bother with the ""life will out"" theme when it makes no difference? The creatures don't get off the island as they do in the book, so who cares if they can reproduce? If you want to leave room for a sequel, simply dump that and the ""lysine contingency"" and save some time. And finally we come to the biggest fraud of all: the ending, a classic dino ex machina. They're saved from raptors in the nickest of nicks by the T Rex! Who's announced his approach hitherto by making like Godzilla, but here apparently walks on tippy-toes. This was Steverino's inspiration, which shows he knew which side of the movie his box office was buttered on. To paraphrase Eric Clapton about a new rock group he'd just formed called Cream: ""Forget the plot! Forget the characters! Just dinos!"" My solution: after the Rex saves our hapless crew, he chases 'em all the way to the chopper, maybe even grabs a strut in his jaws as the whirlybird is lifting off, and Neill has to hang out and kick them free. Oh well, Spielberg proved with ""Crystal Skulls"" he doesn't know when to quit, so it may happen yet."
"RiffRaffMcKinley","9","6","10","31 December 2006"," Belongs in the Top 250
","In the tradition of Spielberg's ""Jaws,"" ""Jurassic Park"" pits prehistoric creatures (in this case, extinct-- dinosaurs) against a random collection of human beings. While ""Jaws"" was a better film, and even this one was outdone by its sequel (the first sequel, anyway), it's still fun to watch the lizards munch on a few morons for fun who--let's face it-- are only put into the story in the first place as snacks. Every horror film has them. ""JP"" has its share of bad acting, bad scripting, and even less-than-competent directing, but the truth is this. People love the book as a classic. In reality, the book was about the most boring Crichton's ever come up with, and this movie was about as clever as Spielberg ever did."
"zarrod","10","5","8","13 June 2009"," Spared no expense!
","The release of Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster about a theme park overrun by dinosaurs, Jurassic Park, was surrounded by momentous amounts of hype. Previews and posters were everywhere. Parents were warned that the horror and carnage of the film might be too intense for young children. What most made an impression on me at the time, as a kid in kindergarten, was all the dinosaur merchandise. There were velociraptor sneakers, dilophosaurus backpacks, and triceratops t-shirts; even I had a lunch box featuring a tyrannosaur leering at a car a quarter of its size. As the ill-fated lawyer predicts in the film, Jurassic Park's merchandising alone was worth a fortune. It was a marketing phenomenon even before it was released. All of this buildup created high expectations. Audiences were promised creatures more stunning and realistic than anything they had ever seen before. Jurassic Park delivered, but not only in the special effects department. The film is an artistic and economic accomplishment. Most see the movie's special effects as its greatest legacy and indeed they had no equal at the time. The CGI still holds up well today against some of the more cartoonish creations in films as recent as Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) and the Star Wars prequels (1999-2005). The first dinosaur seen in all its glory on screen is the massive brachiosaur, standing over 40 feet tall. It is one of the most memorable scenes in film history for its visual impact. From the towering sauropods to the agile raptors, the dinosaurs behave so naturally that they are more like animals than movie monsters (not that liberties weren't taken with science for dramatic purposes). Though none of it would have been accepted without the realistic reactions from the actors. Other than the screaming, the acting in Jurassic Park can best be summed up as subtle. Sam Neill turns in a soft-spoken performance as paleontologist Alan Grant. He has a down-to-earth quality that fits perfectly for a man who spends his life digging in the dirt, who is then thrust into an inconceivable situation and does what he must to get out of it. Laura Dern portrays Grant's girlfriend, Ellie Satler. The romance between them is not forced or overplayed. Both of them particularly stand out in the scenes of openmouthed awe when they encounter the creatures firsthand that they have spent years studying. When confronted with the brachiosaur, Grant just manages to stammer, ""It's it's a dinosaur,"" before collapsing to his knees in wonder. These reactions feel authentic and are quite impressive considering that the actors were reacting to CG dinosaurs that were not on set. They are the anchors that make the effects believable. Spielberg knows how to please an audience by making the compelling, but overly technical novel into a coherent adventure film that hits all the right dramatic notes, accompanied by a beautiful and majestic musical score. Audiences responded, making Jurassic Park the highest grossing film ever until the release of Titanic (1997). Of course, fiscal success does not make a film good art. These days, a filmmaker with plenty of money can just throw CG effects on the screen and the masses will still pay to see it for the spectacle. This attempt at imitation is one of the reasons blockbusters often lack the personal touch. Movies like Armageddon (1998), Underworld (2003), and Van Helsing (2004) can get away with having absolutely no substance beneath pretty pictures produced in postproduction. It seems to be an unfortunate side effect of Jurassic Park's digital innovation and subsequent success. I'm convinced that perfection is unattainable within film-making and Jurassic Park is certainly not flawless. For one, velociraptor was actually much smaller; the creature in the film more closely resembles a deinonychus. Also, I've been to San Jose and it is certainly not next to a beach and coastline as it is labeled in the movie. There are also a few sequences that seem formulaic by monster movie standards; however, time is taken to develop the characters so that the audience will actually care if a dinosaur eats them, unlike those nameless souls who are crushed in Godzilla (1954). Logical quibbles can be made over any movie, though, and if you're looking for realism, you can find it outside the realm of cinema. There is no reason I cannot recommend Jurassic Park unless the potential viewer really does not enjoy suspenseful, humorous, and fun adventure-thrillers with a hefty dose of dinosaurs."
"tml_pohlak_13","10","5","8","12 March 2009"," Masterpiece hardly describes it
","Story time! I remember that, as a little kid, at a friend's house one day, everyone started watching a Jurassic Park movie (I now know it was the second one). Anyhow, I managed to get scared out of my wits within the first 10 minutes. Long story short, Jurassic Park was one of the movies my mom would never let me watch as a kid. So it kind of sucked, me ""playing the home game"" while the other kids talked about how amazing Jurassic Park was (ah! I miss the grade school days). I miraculously managed to not have the movie spoiled (or not to remember having it spoiled). So when my film teacher announced ""we're going to watch a movie that, like Terminator 2, really developed special effects: Jurassic Park"", I was really pleased that I would finally get to see just how good the film all the kids way back when loved was. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Have I mentioned how much I love Steven Spielberg? Well, I will now. Spielberg is an amazing director, without a doubt my favourite. He has yet to let me down. First of all, the graphics in Jurassic Park are amazingly believable, even though it's obviously fake watching it today. Second, Spielberg's direction style is just amazing. Many shots were reinforced and made really powerful thanks to his handling of the camera (combined with a heavenly score from the great John Williams).<br/><br/>Prior to Jurassic Park, I couldn't remember many thrillers where I was genuinely thrilled. Things don't explode to provide a moment's excitement in Jurassic Park, it is a pure roller-coaster of thrills from beginning to end. I also genuinely cared for what happened to the characters. Terrific acting took care of that. How good was it? Let's put it this way: I have a terrible habit of biting my nails. I never once did this while watching Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>The movie's main villain, Dennis Nedry, is one of the most interesting villains I've ever seen. Spielberg purposely makes his intentions unclear. Was he planning to return and put the park back to normal? Or was he going to leave with the boat, and abandon everyone? Either way, as much as I hated the idiot for shutting down the electrical fences, I didn't hate him enough to want him to die. I was genuinely frightened for the guy when he confronted the dinosaur.<br/><br/>""The human characters are a ragtag bunch of half-realized, sketched-in personalities, who exist primarily to scream, utter dire warnings, and outwit the monsters"", Mr. Ebert? I think not! I don't know just what it was: John Williams' music, Spielberg's direction, or fantastic acting, but every character, from Richard Attenborough's to the two kids, was fully developed in the movie. This is a thriller that genuinely thrills (I'm happy to say I've been desensitized as to the disturbing bits).<br/><br/>Apparently, when Jurassic Park came out, my uncle bought tickets and saw it thirteen times. Before I saw it, I thought to myself, ""How could you see a movie so many times?"" Now that I've seen it, I see why. Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, and a groundbreaking achievement in technology as well. Thank you, Steven Spielberg! The least I can do is give this movie a very enthusiastic 10/10."

","JURASSIC PARK was released with a massive publicity campaign and went on to make a massive profit at the box office and unlike the majority of over hyped blockbusters ( Hello Harry Potter ) this movie deserved every cent it made from cinema goers . There`s only two things I can criticise<br/><br/>
1 ) I have no idea where John Hammond comes from but it`s not Scotland . Strangely enough Richard Attenborough has a holiday cottage on the Isle Of Bute . If he needed a voice coach to master a Scottish accent all he had to do was ask me <br/><br/>2 ) A big game hunter . Forgive me for asking but hasn`t it been illegal to go around shooting elephants and lions and tigers for many , many years ? Shouldn`t this great white hunter be aged about 80 years old<br/><br/>
I* can forgive the above because this is top notch entertainment with absolutely flawless technical aspects and most of it was achieved via CGI . Strange that the computer generated images of this 1993 movie are far better than the effects of latter movies , compare it with all these Stephen Sommer movies to see what I mean . Perhaps it`s also a good idea to compare them with all those old movies whose dinosaur effects are done by sticking a fin on a lizard <br/><br/>There is a very one very thoughtful scene amongst all the lizard excitement and that`s the scene where Henry Wu explains the process of how scientists have resurrected dinosuars . It`s a beautifully written , beautifully acted scene that in the context of the story is the greatest success in the history of human science , greater than even going to the moon and back again . It would be very easy - And very careless - for the movie makers to forget what the scientific endeavour involves but here Spielberg reminds both the characters and the audience that even the most blase scientist should feel pride in bringing back a species of animal extinct for many millions of years . It`s this scene that stops JURASSIC PARK being just another FX laden Summer blockbuster and lends credibility to an already exciting story"

I was too young to see this movie as I was only 10 years old and dad was undecided on if I'd like it or not due to the pg-13 rating. I grew up being fascinated with dinosaurs after seeing exhibits about them and seeing them in cartoons and playing with them as toys as in Dino Riders. When i finally saw the movie on vhs more than a year after it was in theaters (dad saw it in Wayne Preakness, one of the few theaters that showed it in DTS 5.1, with my stepmom kathy two years before they got married), i loved it!! I saw it a few more times then bought the movie on tape at now gone Suncoast and I still have that tape somewhere lol. The CGI still stands the test of time nearly 25 years after it came out and the action is nonstop yet it drags a bit.

I got surprised because i thought that how Steven Spielberg got that idea that in this modern world , how can we again recreate dinosaurs which are extinct long back many thousands of years ago. coming to the movie, when i had seen this movie on screen, really i was felt very happy to see those many special effects in this film. really , it was a great job done by director and all technicians who worked for this film. And this movie had also broken many box office records upon release and soon it became the highest grossing film in history at that time."

Even today nothing and nobody has done to dinosaurs what this film has done a film that unlike Jaws were not necessarily terrified to go into the water or in this case a zoo. With this we feel awed like we are looking over the Grand Canyon when we first see Jurassic Park. When I go to watch I don't just watch it for the casual sake of doing so because when I watch this it is an unbelievable and exhilarating experience that can appeal to the likes of anybody with a pulse. Another stand out is John Williams outstanding score that will be listened to for years to come even after 20 years it still holds up and that is the magic of Steven Spielberg as only he can bring us such a one of a kind experience and a film that gives a reason why we love films in the first place. The only negative I would have to say is the performance by Ariana Richards as Lex and Bob Peck performance is a bit overdone. Other then that this is a near perfect film. Now to grade.

It was a flea circus...Petticoat Lane. It was quite spectacular. Spared no expense. There was a miniature merry-go-round and a wee trapeze and a car-carousel... and a see-saw. They all moved, motorised of course, but people would say they could see the fleas. ""Oh, I can see the fleas, mummy, can't you see the fleas?"" Clown fleas and high-wire fleas and fleas on parade.

","""Jurassic Park""<br/><br/>There's not a whole lot to say about the acting. By no means is it bad, it's just obvious that the actors are not the stars of the film, but the dinosaurs themselves. If there were any actors that stood out, though, it would be Sam Neil, Jeff Goldblum, and the late Richard Attenborough. I always liked Atteborough the most, as he is the man with a vision so great, that it blinds him to the obvious flaws with his park. My favorite scene with him is when he's talking to Sattler about his humble beginnings, and how he wanted to give the people an attraction that was not an illusion, but something that was real and awe inspiring.<br/><br/>The dinosaurs look amazing, and are a perfect example of combining both practical effects and CGI. All of them look amazing. From the Brachiosaurus, the raptors, and of course, the T-Rex. The buildup to the T-Rex's appearance is superb, with the setting being in the middle of a rainstorm, and the small sound of footsteps approaching the car with Hammond's grandchildren in it.<br/><br/>To this day, the T-Rex is still the biggest puppet created by Stan Winston's studio. There's not a whole lot of criticisms I have with the film, other than a few nitpicks revolving around common sense.<br/><br/>That's really nitpicking though, as this is still best described as a popcorn film, which I'm saying as a positive thing. Are my nostalgia goggles shielding me from any other problems with the film? Probably. But, the film still succeeds in presenting likable characters, an entertaining story, and effects that will forever stand the test of time.<br/><br/>If you have not seen ""Jurassic Park"", spare not expense and buy it now!"
"magical-kingdom","7","3","4","5 July 2015"," Welcome to Juriassic Park...Still the Best
","Jurassic Park is an unforgettable cinematic experience that has no equal anywhere. Step back into an age where dinosaurs walked the earth. <br/><br/>A truly great film with clever conversation,important themes alongside edge-of-your seat action and a gripping tale. This is the real deal.<br/><br/>The classic is always the best....irrespective of how much better the graphics get in newer movies in the series. Spielberg's direction makes all the difference. <br/><br/>A phenomenally successful sci-fi adventure thriller is graced by state-of-the-art special effects. The film follows two dinosaur experts -- Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) -- as they are invited by eccentric millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to preview his new amusement park on an island off Costa Rica. FYI, after 25 months,filming was re-located to the Hawaiian island of Kauai and began on August 24,1992 due to Spielberg's concerns on infrastructure and accessibility.<br/><br/>By cloning DNA harvested from pre-historic insects, Hammond has been able to create living dinosaurs for his new Jurassic Park, an immense animal preserve housing real brachiosaurs, dilophosaurs, triceratops, velociraptors, and a Tyrannosaur Rex. Accompanied by cynical scientist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), who is obsessed with chaos theory, and Hammond's two grandchildren, they are sent on a tour through Hammond's new resort in computer controlled touring cars. But as a tropical storm hits the island, knocking out the power supply, and an unscrupulous employee sabotages the system so that he can smuggle dinosaur embryos out of the park, the dinosaurs start to rage out of control. Grant then has to bring Hammond's grandchildren back to safety as the group is pursued by the gigantic man-eating beasts. <br/><br/>Even though it was adapted from a book, this unique story was destined to become an incredible film. Great casting, excellent acting, awesome special effects,superior directing. Steven Spielberg made this story a landmark standard for thriller films to be compared to. The instant classic scenes, such as the first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the unforgettable scene when the T-Rex chases the jeep."
"orourkec-292-269155","8","3","4","29 June 2015"," Jurassic Park is director Steven Spielberg at his best, but sadly, it doesn't come out as a polished picture
","Before starting, let me ask you: doesn't a premise about a park attraction of genetically recreated dinosaurs on an island which is about to turn deadly sound exciting? For me it surely does and it should for you too. Now let's talk about my opinion on Jurassic Park. To start off with, I find Jurassic Park to be a hearty, thrilling (and compelling), thought-provocative and creative motion picture. Not only that, but I also find that Jurassic Park has a powerful attention for details because the way all the dinosaurs from the movie look, move, behave, react and sound is absolutely credible, life-like and realistic to how the dinosaurs might have been or probably were like in real life. There is no doubt about it. Furthermore, we are being happily given enough scenes featuring the fiercest dinosaurs ever to have ruled the earth: the smart Velociraptors and the mighty and powerful T- Rex. The leading characters from the movie deliver fine acting. The by- polar personalities of paleontologist Alan Grant and botanist Ellie Sattler are interesting, including those of the two kids characters. Moreover, Spielberg delivers an irresistible and strong sense of terror, beautifully sustained awe and a beautiful sense of grace. The movie did not entirely satisfy me however and I hate to say such a thing because of what Jurassic Park is specifically about and by whom it is specifically directed by (but of course I must be an honest critic). The movie's big problem is that it somewhat lacks a dramatic structure and deviates from what happens in the novel the movie is based on. What's more, the T-Rex-chasing-jeep scene had no visceral feel for me whatsoever. I have to say that I'm extremely disappointed about all of this. Now let's conclude my review. Mr. Spielberg, one word for you: thank you very much for the wonderful, if not entirely well handled, ride. My rating for Jurassic Park is 8.1/10"

","Jurassic Park (1993): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Cast: Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Wayne Knight: Breakthrough film for director Steven Spielberg who brings prehistoric creatures to life in what can only be described as a brilliant technical advancement. The title represents the old and the new where Richard Attenborough establishes a theme park where dinosaurs roam wild thanks to cloning prehistoric D.N.A. He brings in a research team, most of whom will become lunch to creatures unimagined. Inappropriate marketing to families featuring frightening and graphic scenes. Great concept with heart pounding suspense and a triumphant climax. The cast mainly play out characters whom are nothing more than what's on the menu. Sam Neill is strong in his position of protecting two children as well as present narrative insight. Laura Dern plays the second smartest character in her search and rescue attempts as well as struggle with the power. Jeff Goldblum as a mathematician is given funny lines but illogical decisions that land him an injury. Attenborough's theme park owner is a joke and really needs heavy medicine and psychiatry. Wayne Knight plays a villain who makes a failed attempt to steal the DNA. Spielberg created broader characters in Jaws, however this still remains a landmark film that excels in brilliant technical advancement. Score: 8 ½ / 10"

","I watched this movie for the hundredth time the other day because of course it was on TV. With Jurassic World now out and having a massive box office success, I thought I would review this movie next. It of course is about some dino experts, programmers, financial men, and Jeff Goldblum (he is hysterical in this movie) that come to the island and review it to make sure it is safe and correct for the rest of the world if they were to open it up as a park. Of course the dinosaurs get loose and run a muck, forcing the characters to survive with deadly dinosaurs. <br/><br/>Jurassic Park, after all these years, is still as big and as epic as the first day it came out in June of 1993. The wonder an amazement still works fabulously and all the dinosaur moments are gripping and intense. The characters are still interesting and like-able. There isn't really much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said. The effects are great and the direction is spot on by Spielberg. <br/><br/>If you are looking for a fun action packed movie then be sure to check out this colossal film!"

","The prolific writer Michael Crichton was famous for writing stories about science gone awry. Naturally, he'd probably get around to genetic experimenting. Hence, JURASSIC PARK came into being. The novel was monumental for capturing the imaginations of readers. Honestly, who wouldn't want to see dinosaurs again? When the book made a splash, it was almost inevitable that a movie would be made at some point. Directed by none other than Steven Spielberg, the film is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Imagine being a little kid, sitting in the darkened theater, as the credits roll on a black screen underscored by eerie vocals. The screen fades into an as-yet-unknown location. It's pitch black, harsh spotlights illuminating the area. A group of heavily-armed men stand around a fenced-in compound. A cage is slowly lowered in. The men jump back as whatever's inside screeches at them. Despite being hissed at, the group push the cage into place. But that ""something inside"" goes on a rampage, knocking the cage and the men out of the way. In the process, one of the workers gets grabbed. Screams and growls reverberate off the theater walls as whatever's inside slowly eats the man alive. Despite the other workers' best efforts to stop the creature. Scary? Oh yeah! And we haven't even seen the first dinosaur yet! Following the accident, the story really takes off: In order to quell the safety concerns from the park's investors, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) invites a small team of experts and his grandchildren to take a trial vacation at his island resort. What they discover is a magnificent theme park populated by genetically-engineered dinosaurs. But their amazement quickly melts into fear when the power goes out, and the fences start coming down. Now, on the run from the dangerous prehistoric carnivores, they must find a way to survive and escape Jurassic Park. Still twenty-some years later, the special effects and CGI are astounding. Never before (or since, in most cases) have dinosaurs looked so alive on-screen. All the actors give their roles 110%. For you, the viewer, you'll be thrilled, chilled, and amazed at everything happening in this movie. Come on, it's a Spielberg movie! Followed by two ""less-than-classic"" sequels. With JURASSIC WORLD out now in theaters, why not go back and re-live it all over again?!"

","Part of me wonders if this movie would've had such an impact on me were I just a bit older back in 1993. At its heart, ""Jurassic Park"" is really just a monster movie, but it rides high on Spielberg as the master showman; it plays like an amusement park full of impressive effects and plenty of scares. In one scene, he takes the vibe from wonder to dead to horror, and I still appreciate that as a much older adult; same for the CGI, which is used perfectly as a tool (and still holds up for that reason). <br/><br/>I can't say whether the science is accurate (though I still think it's cool), but the thrills deliver and the cast is good (letting the smartass Goldblum steal every scene). There's a reason why ""Jurassic Park"" owned the Summer of '93 and it's right there on the screen. <br/><br/>8/10"

","Genetics can unlock the secrets of creating and growing biological life; we've already used these secrets to clone a sheep, to alter our crops, and it may allow us to repopulate endangered species. In his novel, Michael Crichton explored the unique and harrowing possibility that genetics could bring the dinosaurs back. When entrepreneurs try to turn the miracle of dinosaur cloning into a theme park attraction, chaos theory kicks in, proving that nature can't be tamed that easily.<br/><br/>Stephen Spielberg's adaptation of Crichton's novel takes the original premise, complete with its cautionary warnings, and delivers it as a fast-moving adventure film full of color, wit, and thrills. There are moments where the film emphasizes the whimsy and wonder of creation, but when the deadliest of predators are unleashed, there are a fair amount of harrowing, suspenseful chases that follow. One of the most chilling scenes shows the dreaded Tyrannosaurus Rex breaking loose from its paddock and laying waste to a pair of jeeps, threatening to crush and eat everybody trapped inside. Velociraptors rush through the jungles and buildings, threatening to devour human prey. What starts off as a wondrous ""what if"" scenario eventually devolves into a struggle for survival and escape; occasional bursts of comedy keeps the film lightweight, but with groundbreaking special effects, carefully-staged action, and characters worth caring about, the film offers a grand spectacle and a perfectly-entertaining blockbuster experience.<br/><br/>Much of the story is altered from the original book, but it's hardly an issue. On its own merits, the film tells the story it wants to and it does it well. It flips a few of the characters around so that there's a family dynamic at work. Most of the characters are likable, and the film sets them up so that we can understand and care for them when they're in danger. Some of them make very bad decisions, but even the dumbest characters are endearing, because the film shows them as being very human and prone to mistakes; these faults ultimately contribute to the plot's progression. The plot unfolds spectacularly, continuously building in tension and action. Throughout the picture, the characters speculate and dig up fascinating themes about playing God with genetics; the film's events prove that all human attempts to control nature and force a structure will never work, and life will always find a way to break free and thrive on its own. These themes carry both wonder and terror, and the film emphasizes both aspects aptly.<br/><br/>This film is made with really good photography. Editing can be a little weak at times, but it is often punchy and good. Acting is pretty over-the-top, but it produces expressions and emotions that fit in perfectly with the film's tone. Sam Neill and Laura Dern are perfectly likable in their roles. Jeff Goldblum steals the show repeatedly with his character's wit and wisdom. Richard Attenborough has a great presence and personality as John Hammond. The kid characters put their best into it, and they do have some endearing moments that gives the film a more emotional punch. Bob Peck is cool, Martin Ferraro is a dude we love to hate, Wayne Knight is an even bigger dude we love to hate, Samuel L Jackson keeps it real, and everybody else is decent. This script is full of great lines, but some dialogue can be rather random, and it's all really low-key. Despite one or two shortcuts, this production uses good-looking sets, props, costumes, and creature effects. Special effects were fantastic for its time, and most of them still hold up to this day. John Williams' music score is catchy and emotional.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is easily one of the best blockbusters, not only because of all its visual effects and thrills, but also because it has heart, and it has themes worth thinking about. It's a must-see.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Good)"

","""Jurassic Park"" has been around for twenty two years, and it has been one of those movies that has always been part of my childhood and it is definitely one of my all time favorite movies. This is the best of best, because none of the sequels lived up to the original. So the story is about an old man name John Hammond, who invites three doctors alongside with a lawyer to show them that dinosaurs are alive and real, and shows them how they were actually created after they were extinct sixty five million years ago (If anyone knows math on what I just typed). So he sets up a tour for them, but things go haywire as dinosaurs start to break loose when the power goes out during the storm, and it is a chance for our main characters to survive and to get off an island that is filled with dinosaurs. I did not see on the big screen back in 1993, but only saw it on home video. However, I was able to have the opportunity to see it on the big screen, but only this time in 3D as it came out back in 2013 for honoring the film's twentieth anniversary and I really had a blast to see it like I never had before. I love this movie, and it just never ages for me. To me, it feels timeless as if this movie was made today or any other time that was made. Of course, this movie was famous for its use of groundbreaking digital technology, and I know many filmmakers when nuts about this and it does upset many people that they choose to use CGI over practical effects. Although not many filmmakers overuse CGI as they decide to remain old school, but still use CGI if its done right. With that said, I thought it had a very good story from beginning to end as you first introduce the characters, then you show the island and how it went wrong, and you see how these characters are able to survive. The characters are very good, and likable at the same time. Sam Neill; Jeff Goldblum; Laura Dern and Richard Attenborough all gave out such terrific performances on their own; they may not be three dimensional, but there is still enough characterization in the movie and still to care about. The two child actors all did great too. The movie is filled with wonders, excitements and having some pretty good actions. Steven Spielberg has made such beautiful looking movie, and knows how to make a movie about how much we like about dinosaurs. John Williams' music is so darn memorable, and it is completely unforgettable. The special effects done by Stan Winston Studios and Industrial Light & Magic are top notch perfect for the use of practical and CGI effects. They continue to look impressive as I watch it, and it never feels dated for my own personal taste. If I had to pick what is my favorite dinosaur, I would say the T-Rex which it is obvious that everyone loves the T- Rex. I do love the scene where we first meet T-Rex as it has perfect build up that is perfectly suspense, and it is perfectly well edited together. Heck, the movie doesn't bored me and it was always keeps my interest. The ending that everyone remembers when the T- Rex saves Dr. Grant and the others by Raptors was awesome. I do love how the movie ends, where they finally go home in a helicopter and it gives you that good feeling as Williams' music plays along as the movie ends. I love ""Jurassic Park"" so much, and this classic twenty two year old movie is still awesome! I give it a perfect 10 out of 10."

","Jurassic Park takes place during a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok. A film unlike no other that was brought to us by the mastermind himself, Steven Spielberg was truly a grand experience to truly be reckon with. We are brought into a world of adventure and enlightenment where people are so highly intelligent to think up a possibly solution to bring back highbred dinosaurs for people's amusement. What Spielberg gives us is a plot so original and unique that's it's so ruff to see what's coming next in the scene ahead, we get so much awe-inspiring trills and spills with such distinctive looking dinosaurs that are just the use of animatronics. The vision of a island full of prehistoric creatures is such a imaginative place we have all sensed as a kid, oh come on, just admit it, we've all wanted such a crimson venue with full functioned dinosaurs! Richard Attenborough who gives the genius who created such a location, gives such a performance of man you just can't help but care for and just come to love because he brings such fascinating characteristics to brings you to want to know more about is pure brilliance. Coming from a original plot, it's just so fun to see what to expect from a film with so much excitement and joyous scenery and cringeworthy moments that we want to see our worthy characters see get through. With Dinosaur's all over the place, we as a audience get a sense of accomplishment when our lungful characters surface danger in such indiscriminate situations when being fluctuated in hazardous predicaments and soft and soothing moments when they enjoy the scenery of the island and be glad they're doing well for now. This film wouldn't be itself without such a memorable and remarkable score be the musical genius himself, John Williams, John gave us one of the most memorable and promising scores of a lifetime that's not to hard to forgot in such a rush of a film. We when come to watch such a film now In the 21st century, we never get the urge or realization that not nothing has been modified from the last time we have watched it, everything just looks concrete and different that it just peeks our interest with a certain spark of adventure!"

","Jurassic Park starts off with a glimpse of the danger the dinosaur represents then introduces the characters and the park. The park is first showcased as potential visitors would discover it, they see the dinosaurs, then learn how they're made, before everything start to go awry.<br/><br/>The film plays with our fears of the unseen because in a good portion of it we don't actually see the scary dinosaurs being scary. We hear them, we know they are lurking off camera but we don't actually see them. It's such a good build up that when we see ""the monsters"" it's scary. My heart was racing like the little child I was when I first saw it. The suspense is one of the things that get you, even more than the few jump scares the movie has.<br/><br/>Watching Jurassic Park now made me realize how smart the plot is. lt plays on concerns people would have if this park was really about to open. Some characters only have dollar signs in their eyes and others see it as something incredible that can turn deadly, which it does but it doesn't take away from the fact that it could be wonderful.<br/><br/>The special effects in this film look as good now as they were when the movie first came out. My guess is that they used a lot of practical effects, animatronics and great camera shots to make us believe that these dinosaurs are real. It thought me that even the most incredible things can be dangerous.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is such a good movie, it was for a long time the closest thing to an horror movie that I could watch.

While the park's mastermind, billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), assures everyone including his grandchildren that the facility is safe, they find out otherwise when various ferocious predators break free and go on the hunt.<br/><br/>I have loved this film ever since I was a kid. Each time I watch it, I'm always amazed at how they managed to pull this off without any problems during production. This is a fascinating story about how we shouldn't tamper with nature of any kind of species. Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough all give terrific performances, fully realizing their character's motivations and not trying to make them blatant stereotypes like some movies would do. Even the kids , Joseph Mazzello and Arianna Richards are not annoying little brats that never shut up and whine, they are very likable and very charming. The special effects are top notch and are one of a kind. They changed the way special effects would be along with Terminator 2. Stan Winston and his team did an amazing job combing animatronics and CGI beautifully making the dinosaurs realistic.<br/><br/>While there are minor differences from the Michael Crichton book, Spielberg stays true to the themes and ideas that Crichton had in his book, hell Crichton even co-wrote the screenplay to help keep the movie as fairly accurate to his book.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is my favorite Spielberg film, with great performances, fantastic special effects, a terrific story, and my all time favorite John Williams score from any film that he's done, Jurassic Park is and will always be in my opinion, Steven Spielberg's Masterpiece."
"cosmicfish14","8","3","4","3 March 2015"," The Ultimate Technical Achievement
","One thing about this movie that is obviously a very important part is, like I said, the effects. The effects started the craze of CGI in films for effects that would be impossible to do with practical effects (and fast forward to today where CGI is now been run into the ground and a movie that has an extended use of practical effects seems like a godsend, but I digress.) The thing that this movie also did well was mix a use of both CGI and practical effects. When there was something they could do with practical effects, they used practical effects. But when there was a scene where they couldn't, then they used CGI. The CGI also holds up pretty well today, except for one dinosaur that was really obvious that it was CGI.<br/><br/>When talking about Jurassic Park, when people stop talking about the effects and go on to the story, this is where some people find the movie ""meh"". And, while its not terrible there some aspects of the story nowadays that kinda seem ridiculous. Like the whole mosquito blood DNA thing was introduced, it was pretty ridiculous. But I do like the movie is kind of a battle between nature and the advance of science. But the story does have a few flaws.<br/><br/>The acting was also pretty good. Sam Neill was good as the main character, so was Laura Dern. Jeff Goldblum was good, but there were some points where he was really corny. Everyone else was good in the movie to. I feel as if the movie isn't really praised for its story or characters. Its praised for technical achievement in film history. And I really enjoyed it, but some aspects of the story lowered the score down for me personally.<br/><br/>Final Score: 8/10"

","The movie that made Palaeontology cool. Jurassic Park written by Crichton is brought to life with Spielberg's animatronic Dinosaur models and thrilling chase scenes. This movie is exhilarating, fun and terrifying.<br/><br/>The story is basically about monster lizards breaking out of their restraints after a disgruntled employer plans to steal Dinosaur genetic code having shut off the islands power on which they were residing on.<br/><br/>The more detailed story is one of Dr Hammond a wealthy eccentric philanthropist setting up an amusement park off the Costa Rica coast and cloning the fossils of extinct Dinosaurs to fill the island with Terror Lizards like Velociraptor & T Rex. This crazy idea needs the backing of experts like Alan Grant, Ellie Sattle & Ian Malcolm to sign up on this but when the park is exposed to a combination of bad weather bad employees and bad engineering the entire system collapses and so the remaining people on the Island must traverse the Park dodging the Dinosaurs and escape to safety.<br/><br/>All in all a great movie of the 90's."
"Leofwine_draca","10","3","4","25 April 2012"," Classic for a reason
","I'm no great fan of Steven Spielberg. He makes films that should interest me, but all too often ruins the experience by being overly sentimental. Take his WAR OF THE WORLDS remake as a case in point: it had the potential to be a fantastic movie, but thanks to the ridiculous plot twists I can't ever bring myself to watch it again. However, JURASSIC PARK, despite containing an overload of sentimentality, manages to be a simply great movie, a classic in fact, thanks to an overwhelming amount of elements that work.<br/><br/>Michael Crichton's story is fresh (if you overlook the fact that it's Westworld with dinosaurs) and inventive. Okay, I wish Spielberg had made this film for adults rather than kids – complete with the graphic bloodshed of the original novel – but then I guess I wouldn't have seen it in the cinema at the age of 12 and been hugely influenced by it. The cast is splendid, particularly Sam Neill, one of those rarely-seen character actors who really deserved the big time success he enjoyed with his role here. Goldblum is even better, although much underutilised in favour of the redundant Laura Dern character. Watch out for Wayne Knight and Sam Jackson in memorable bit parts and try to avoid the annoyingly precocious brats played by Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards. Bob Peck's big game hunter, straight out of the pages of a H. Rider Haggard novel, is a complete scene stealer.<br/><br/>Of course, this is one of those rare movies where the actors come second to the special effects, and the mixture of CGI and animatronic models is still breathtaking to this day. The scene where the T-Rex escapes is hands down one of the most suspenseful moments in cinema, ever. Okay, what follows is occasionally ridiculous (the car dropping down the tree scene) and involves kids running around too much, but it's still the kind of breathlessly exciting movie that there aren't all that many of.<br/><br/>I still remember feeling a little bit jealous of how this movie popularised dinosaurs in the mainstream. As a kid, I'd always loved the creatures and owned loads of books about them, but after JURASSIC PARK every kid in the world fell in love with them and it was never the same. I ended up a little jaded, as I'd wanted to stay in that little niche on my own. Anyway, I digress: this is an outrageously good family movie, one of those films with a little bit of everything in it for everyone, and one I can wholeheartedly recommend and enjoy over and over again."
"greene_2006","9","3","4","19 June 2011"," Jurassic park
","This action packed film was one of the first of its kind that showed great detail and the look of what the ""future"" could hold. The location of where this film was to take place is off a secluded island in Costa Rica. This isolated island (Jurassic Park) was the home of prehistoric dinosaurs that were brought back into present time by ""dino blood"" that was preserved from insects that existed in that time period. The main characters that were visitors of Jurassic Park are the following: Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil), Tim Murphy (Joseph Mazzello), Lex Murphy (Ariana Richards), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck). These seven characters listed above endure many obstacles and not all of them make it off the island alive. The founder of Jurassic Park is John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) and he explains the process of how these extinct animals are brought back into the ""modern world"". The theme for this film in my opinion is that technological advances may unlock many unanswered questions about our past; however some answers should be left unknown. <br/><br/>One of the most powerful and memorable scenes is when Tim and Lex Murphy are sitting in the Jurassic Park jeep when the cup of water starts to shake. The look in these children's eye says it all. When they are left behind by Robert Muldoon, it was clear to the audience that these characters were left in the wilderness with the largest predators known by man-kind. The lighting in this scene was perfect. The dark and wet night really set off the emotional foundation and had the viewer's feeling the fear of the characters. <br/><br/>Although there are many scenes in this film that show great use of angles, one of those scenes really jump out at me when watching the film. The scene when Dr. Grant and Tim are stuck in a tree well inside the forest of Jurassic Park. They must abandon the Jeep because it was not going to stay in the tree much longer. The angles in this scene are phenomenal, especially when they find themselves racing to the base of the tree before the Jeep crushes both of them. The angle that is underneath the characters as well as the falling vehicle really grabs the viewers' attention and puts the real life fear right into ones living room. <br/><br/>Jurassic Park and Multiplicity are two films that express technological advances that show us future advancements are not always positive. Even though Multiplicity is not full of danger and action, it does show us technological advances in cloning can cause many issues in the near future. <br/><br/>This film is based off of the ""unknown"" factor of what the world was like in the prehistoric age. Technological advances made some individuals feel they were capable of producing prehistoric elements and re-create them. Although they succeeded at producing the extinct animals, technological advances could not account for the dangers that lied ahead."
"leplatypus","10","3","4","19 May 2011"," Worthy of the 65 millions years of production (DVD)
","This is the great joke of Spielberg seeing the famous stick of Hammond and its mosquito trapped in the sap! Beyond the special effects, this movie remains for me a essential milestone: it speaks about the power of nature, the childish ingenuity of man, human relationships. I forget that it is also funny with the boy character and lines. John William's score is another masterpiece from him because it rejoices ancestral, primitive melody with powerful and peaceful theme.<br/><br/>There are also a lot of remarkable ideas: dealing with dinosaurs today is fascinating but mixing them with the theme park and locating all this on a remote island is a great chain of genius. And the best thing is the parallelism between the technology resurrecting extinct animals and the same technology making extinct the traditional craft of special effects. In this field, there is a before and after JP and the first attack of the T-Rex will be on pantheon of filmmaking! However, the extras of the DVD offer a glimpse of puppets velociraptors (made by Tipett) and they are surprisingly cool as well.<br/><br/>Having finishing reading the book, I can say that novel and movie are very close: it's like the same story told by two witnesses even if there are some changes. Having the author writing the script seems to be the golden rule of a decent adaptation. But you can understand also the strength of each medium: ""T-Rex roars and attacks the jeep"" is better seen than read. On the opposite, all the remarkable speeches of Malcom about chaos and science are better read than heard!"

","Jurassic Park is my favourite movie of all time. Quite a statement that is to say, but with engaging characters and a supremely intelligent storyline, plus, of course, special dinosaur effects, there is not one single flaw with this movie. One of the cleverest things about Jurassic Park is that as the Tyrannosaurus Rex is the biggest carnivorous dinosaur, it would be considered in most dinosaur movies as the main villain. However it's the Velociraptor who comes across us viewers as the more intimidating, particularly in the kitchen scene with Lex and Tim, which is the most scariest scene I've seen from any movie. Steven Spielberg uses his fantastic camera direction, showing he's one of the greatest movie directors of all time, and he comes up with a prehistoric masterpiece 65 million years in the making!"

Steven Spielberg did an excellent job at adapting the hit book to this movie masterpiece. Yes, there were a few things that were left out. Things that were key to the story in the book and things that would have been amazing to see.

"Stampsfightclub","9","3","4","8 January 2010"," Action adventure that shows true directional mastery
","Two archaeologists are whisked away to a private island to get an exclusive glimpse of an amusement park that brings dinosaurs to life.<br/><br/>Based on Michael Crichton's novel, Jurassic Park is a dramatic reconstruction of a scientific cloning experiment that brought the term Blockbuster to Hollywood and thanks to some masterstrokes from one of the world's best directors have created a timeless masterpiece.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg had already mastered the science fiction genre with Close encounters of the third kind and created a whole new concept in adventure with the Indiana Jones series and here, combining the two genres demonstrates an even higher expectancy as we see ancient creatures materialize to cause chaos in one of the best adventures ever made.<br/><br/>The opening scenes set the tone for the upcoming problems as park rangers attempt to contain an unidentifiable animal in a cage which ultimately ends in a sharp cut away and we see Sam Neill and Laura Dern uncovering a velociraptor skeleton. Some beautiful comedy from The Piano actor sets the tone for his character and his wonderful rendition of a raptor's movements is eagerly anticipated and a good sign of what is to come.<br/><br/>After Richard Attenborough invites himself into their home the adventure is underway. Spielberg in typical fashion creates a dynamic feeling of sudden excitement. The combination of the music, the helicopter and some wonderful picturesque panning elaborate the adventure which lies ahead for the audience and the characters.<br/><br/>The first scene in which we first encounter the dinosaurs is cleverly shot, depicting the spellbound expressions with simplistic animal behaviour from the apparent extinct creatures.<br/><br/>There are certain films which are remembered for certain big moments. The day after tomorrow is recalled for the sharp boat sequence, alien has the John Hurt moment where this 1993 release has a lot of little moments that ultimately make it bigger and bolder. The simplicity of seeing the dinosaurs for the first time, the build up to seeing the T-Rex and the manipulation of Dennis all add up to a truly spectacular film.<br/><br/>In a world ruled now by CGI it's worth mentioning the highly impressive effects on show here. The animatronics used along with other methods capture the movement of the dinosaurs spectacularly. The T-Rex stands above all others, especially when seeing it in the rear view mirror of the car. And who can forget the water in the cup moment, perhaps the greatest build up to an action sequence ever? My personal favourite moment was the T-Rex introduction with the disappearance of the goat. The raptors are another stand out with their claw tapping predatory instincts.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this already this will make you sit on the edge of your seat and be drawn into a spellbinding array of action and adventure."

","Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>I still remember the first time I saw this movie. It was in the cinema in the first week that it was released. Me and my friends were psyched to see it and we also left the theatre, psyched.<br/><br/>From start to finish, this movie delivers an incredible feat.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has once again created a world you'll really grow into. With it's characters, the music, atmosphere, humor, scares and of course the biggest stars: the dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Let's start with the acting. What can I say? It's just excellent! There isn't a single character in this movie that I really hate. Okay, except for that one guy; but he gets eaten anyway! Jeff Goldblum steals the show (for me) as the skeptic chaologist??, while Sam Neil, Laura Dern and the two kids give the best portion of the film when it comes to adventure and humor. The rather small role for Samuel Jackson must be noted as well. There are a lot of familiar faces in this movie, if you pay attention.<br/><br/>The music... It's just... time-less. If you close your eyes while listening to the score, you can almost touch the dinosaurs as they march across the vast plains of the Jurassic era. Large and majestic. Almost like an untouchable deity.<br/><br/>You want humor? You'll get it in this movie too! There's tons of it, and no character can escape it, not even the dinosaurs themselves! And then there are scary moments. Oh yes there are... I remember my younger self shivering in the cinema at some scenes. Definitely not a movie for a young kid, despite what people might say. There are some really frightening moments. But if you are at the age of 12 or above, you will enjoy this movie a lot.<br/><br/>My last stop is the dinosaurs. They are brought to the screen with the utmost detail. The way they move, roar, jump, run, climb, bash, slash and bite all feels real.<br/><br/>Two sequels were made for this movie. But this classic tale will forever be locked in my heart. I treasure it deeply.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park receives from me a solid 9 out of 10 stars."

"Robert_duder","10","3","4","20 August 2008"," The quintessential Dinosaur movie will likely never be topped
","It's true that few people can create a visual story and spectacle like Stephen Spielberg. I can almost remember seeing Jurassic Park as a kid in the movie theatre for the first time and if you asked me then if I liked it I probably would have told you that it was the greatest movie I had ever seen and meant it. Years later, seeing it again, it has perhaps some of that youthful exuberance I once felt for it but that doesn't make it any less powerful and brilliant and wonderfully created. I think just seeing the film outside of a movie theatre takes away some of the magic because the dinosaurs just aren't as enormous and terrifying and jaw dropping as they are on a 200 foot movie screen. Still I did pick Jurassic Park to be the first movie I watched on my beloved new 42 Inch Plasma which helped a great deal. The characters are intricately created and you become enthralled in their adventure. Spielberg has always had a way of making characters come to life and you become completely attached to them which makes the story even better. On top of that Jurassic Park coins the thrill a minute phrase giving you a non stop jaw dropping riveting story about action and danger and of course dinosaurs of all kinds. The film is just quite simply a modern day classic. One of my favourite scenes in movie history is the scene with the Tyrannasaurus Rex attacking the jeep for the first time with Tim trapped inside. That scene has stayed with me for years along with the Raptors in the kitchen later on in the film. The movie is not soft enough for really little kids but it's not too edgy for the pre-teen/teen crowd but definitely edgy and intelligent enough for any adult or movie lover to watch again and again.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park started me on a brief love affair with Sam Neill. His dry and often snarly performance as Dino genius Dr. Allan Grant was perfect. I think his performances in other films as well as this one could be interpreted as an acquired taste but there is something just perfect about the way he interacts with the cast and the script for the movie. Laura Dern is also good as Ellie Sattler. Although she wasn't my favourite character she added a tone of emotion and a strong female lead and had good chemistry with Neill. Jeff Goldblum was just terrific, possibly one of his best roles as he too tends to be an acquired taste, as Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician who warns right from the beginning of playing God. Goldblum is level headed and definitely delivers some of the best lines in the film as the comic relief in a serious deadpan kind of way. Legendary actor Richard Attenborough returned to acting after fifteen years away to portray Billionaire John Hammond, the creator and mastermind of Jurassic Park. He is terrific in many ways and just really captures the character and his conflict with what he's created. Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards play Tim and Lexi Murphy, Hammond's grandkids. Both are terrific and really capture the teen audience very well and have some really hair raising scenes. Neither of them unfortunately went on to much else but they were terrific in this film. One of the most under used characters that I really thought could have also been a leading role was Bob Peck who played Robert Muldoon. He had a mysterious hero quality about him and I really wanted to see more of him as he ended up facing his greatest fears in the raptors when they escape. He was terrific in the small role he was given. The top notch supporting cast is also amazing including the legendary Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight, B.D. Wong, and Martin Ferrero as the ""blood sucking lawyer"" as Hammond refers to him.<br/><br/>This is just one of those films, especially by Spielberg that was destined to be a classic and it is one you can watch over and over again which I have done frequently. The movie has an amazing story, riveting action and everything that makes an epic film amazing. Perhaps they dropped the ball by serializing the films (although the second book by Creighton was amazing) and I will get to reviewing the sequels too but no matter how you look at it, the first Jurassic Park is a movie that every single person must see period. 10 out of 10<br/><br/>***Update*** Had the amazing opportunity to see Jurassic Park in its (unfortunately 3D) Re-release. While the 3D changed nothing and wasn't even that impressive, seeing the movie on the big screen was amazing...again. I even got a little bit emotional seeing a few of the scenes again that shaped my movie going as a youngster. This movie is still a modern day epic classic."

","Steven Spielberg's cinematic masterpiece, where ""two species, separated by 60 million years"" face off for a survival showdown. Dinosaurs return from primordial forests to reclaim their place as the dominant species on Earth, and the result is one great movie feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>The premise is made plausible by an amusement park tour ride that explains the genetic process used in ""making a baby dinosaur"" (it makes you wonder if some day they will actually attempt this). Park controls over the dinosaurs go haywire, and nature's classic battle for survival is on.<br/><br/>Several species of dinosaurs are, of course, the stars of the show. Unlike previous dinosaur movies, JP took the time to analyze their instinctual intents: survival, reproduction, hunting food, etc., rather than depict them as rampaging beasts that kill for no reason. The film even explored the intriguing possibility that certain dinos (raptors) had some measure of deductive reasoning powers.<br/><br/>Almost every action and line of dialog has its place in relating the story and its moral. The movie knows when to go extreme with action, and when to pause and allow characters to evaluate the situation. The human actors, although somewhat regulated to supporting roles, are effective and have their importance too. The cautionary scientists, the greedy ""bloodsucking"" lawyer, the game hunter with a respect and awe for nature, the carnival showman, the techs who eat and smoke too much, even the imperiled kids (Spielberg's trademark) all represent aspects of science and the human condition. Characters are developed, some change, and some die; and in all cases, it fits the story's message.<br/><br/>The production quality was superior: the use of computer technology was fresh then, and was used to emphasize the story rather than the habit nowadays to make the CGI itself the focus. The music score was inspired, capturing the majesty these immense creatures evoke. Clever humor bits are inserted at key points all throughout the movie, to balance with the gory scenes. The ""objects are closer than they appear"" sight gag is classic. <br/><br/>A must-see for anyone. This is unique storytelling at its best."

The cast was good as well. A good mix for a movie like this. The movie was quite entertaining, and when I first saw, it scary at moments. Those dinosaurs were very well made, pretty nice special effects for sure. The whole Spielberg style was really shown all over. I think the idea of a park with dinosaurs would be brilliant though.

","When I first watched this movie years ago, I didn't like it. I thought the movie was one big special-effects extravaganza with theatrical and uninspiring acting (except, of course, in the scene with the lawyer sitting on the toilet who's gobbled up by an out-of-control and hungry Tyrannosaurus Rex. I don't know if that scene was meant to be funny, but I recall that it provoked a certain amount of laughter.) Subsequently, I didn't give this movie a second thought. Then recently I happened to be watching television and lo-and-behold I switched to a channel that just happened to be showing Jurassic Park. So I watched the movie and this time I liked it. Indeed I thought this movie was great, and I'll tell you why. Despite the overblown special effects and contrived script and the almost laughable acting, especially by ""Newman"" from Jerry Seinfeld in one of the worst cases of miscasting in the history of movie making, this movie successfully and effectively deals with a serious theme - what happens when highly sensitive, highly experimental and potentially lethal scientific knowledge and technology gets into the hands of people who want to exploit this knowledge and technology for profit. This movie shows how the technology of cloning, when used irresponsibly and with little of any thought for possible consequences, can produce disastrous results, in this case, dinosaurs running amok with no way to control them. It seems far-fetched, but really no more so than the possibility of people being able to fly or communicate electronically over huge distances. It only seems far-fetched until it becomes a reality and then it's like it was always meant to be. But getting back to this movie, now that the dinosaurs are unleashed, the question is: how can they be controlled? They were supposed to be placed on display in a park, but it doesn't quite work out the way it was intended. Instead of the dinosaurs being confined, they literally go on a rampage, completely trash the park and in the process reveal a level of intelligence and cunning that is entirely unexpected, with dire consequences. The raptors, for instance, are not mere reptilian brutes but rather are cunning and highly intelligent creatures which makes them even more dangerous. And the humans who unleashed these creatures are simply no match for the ferociousness and strength of creatures that are now beyond all control. Compared to the dinosaurs the humans puny and helpless bystanders who are literally running for their lives when not caught and devoured. The humans' weapons are absolutely no match for the ferociousness of these creatures, who easily overpower and out-think the humans. The movie ends with the surviving humans getting out while they can, leaving the dinosaurs in charge of the park. Now, what happens if the dinosaurs escape from the park? Could the human species survive?<br/><br/>In a way, this movie is akin to the stories ""Frankenstein"", ""The Invisible Man"" and ""Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" which also deal with issues relating to consequences of irresponsible scientific research."

It was not only a gripping film, but filled you with a sense of child-like wonder and awe.<br/><br/>Based on the excellent novel by Michael Crichton, the story begins on the island of Isla Nublar. A group of workers are heaving a crate into an animal pen. Whatever's in the crate suddenly turns violent, and attacks them.<br/><br/>At this point, we have little idea what kind of an island this is. Meanwhile, in the Montana Badlands, paleontologists Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) are digging up a new dinosaur skeleton. This is interrupted by a visit from billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough).<br/><br/>He tells them he owns Isla Nublar, and is turning it into a park that's ""right up their alley"". Hammond's investors are concerned about the accident on the island, and insist on some outside opinions before it's opened to the public. He invites Alan and Ellie over for a weekend.<br/><br/>Accompanied by eccentric mathematician (or chaotician) Dr Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), when they arrive on the island, they're astounded to see a real, live dinosaur. This is Jurassic Park, a place where dinosaurs have been brought back to life.<br/><br/>Hammond's scientists discovered a prehistoric mosquito preserved in amber, that had fed off the blood of dinosaurs. They extracted the preserved blood, and through cloning techniques, were able to create a baby dinosaur.<br/><br/>Although overwhelmed, Alan, Ellie and Ian are sceptical about reintroducing dinosaurs into the modern world. Alan gives a good speech about the dangers involved:<br/><br/>""Dinosaurs and man. Two species separated by 65 million years of evolution have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together. How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect?""<br/><br/>After being joined by Hammond's grandchildren Lex and Tim, they all set off into the park. But one of Hammond's workers has accepted a bribe from a rival company to steal dinosaur embryos. He puts in a computer virus that interrupts power, allowing the dinosaurs to escape their pens. With Alan, Lex and Tim lost in the park, it now becomes a desperate struggle for survival for all involved.<br/><br/>What can I say about the effects? Stunning. There are times when you actually forget the dinosaurs aren't real. From vicious Velociraptors to the terrifying Tyrannosaurus Rex, they are the real stars. It still has a great cast though.<br/><br/>Sam Neill is likable as Grant. A decent man who is not comfortable around children. This is one of Steven Spielberg's trademarks, where Grant will grow to like children, after taking care of Lex and Tim.<br/><br/>Laura Dern is good as Ellie, as she's not out to be the typical damsel in distress. She's a resourceful woman, and she makes a believable couple with Neill.<br/><br/>Jeff Goldblum is typically eccentric, always coming out with chaos theories, and how the park is doomed to fail because of Hammond's tampering with nature. In retrospect, Goldblum doesn't really get a lot to do, which is probably why he was allowed to take centre stage in the first sequel.<br/><br/>Richard Attenborough is on good form as the kindly but slightly crazy John Hammond. His obsession with opening his park to the public clouds his judgement throughout the film, even when people are dying left, right and centre.<br/><br/>Lex and Tim are very annoying. Lex is just the typical screamer, and Tim is a precocious brat. I know this sounds horrible, but there are times when I wished they would get eaten by the dinosaurs.<br/><br/>It takes a while for the action to start up, but once it does the film takes off like a rocket. The T-Rex only appears four times, but each time it does it's memorable. Destroying the car with the kids in it, killing the lawyer on the toilet (brilliant!), chasing after the jeep. All great scenes.<br/><br/>The Raptors are an impressive creation, as their sheer intelligence is matched only by their cold-blooded brutality. Fast as a cheetah, incredible jumpers, devious and highly intelligent, they're a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>The tension level jumps immediately when the Raptors are around. Intriguingly, they seem more interested in killing the humans instead of other dinosaurs. Personal vendetta perhaps, for keeping them locked up? They do set up Muldoon the warden in a particularly nasty ambush. The scene where they're hunting Lex and Tim in the kitchen is a real nailbiter.<br/><br/>The Raptors only come into the film near the end, but they are mentioned several times beforehand. Spielberg takes a tactic from Jaws. Where you didn't see the shark until halfway, it is the same with the Raptors. At first we learn how dangerous they are from various people, and when we finally see them in action, we're blown away.<br/><br/>The climax is very exciting, as you're not really sure what's going to happen. It does seem a bit convenient for the T-Rex to appear, but Spielberg is forever the crowd-pleaser. <br/><br/>The film has many awe-inspiring moments. The gentle Brachiosaurs are a wonder to watch, and provide a marvellous introductory scene for the dinosaurs. The camera focuses on Alan, Ellie and Ian gazing in wonder, and we want to know at what. And then we see a fully realised dinosaur. And than the awe sets in. Which is further expanded upon elsewhere with the sick Triceratops. And the Gallimimus herd. There is a little something for everyone.<br/><br/>Although the plot is wafer-thin, you'll be in for a fun time. It even manages to be thought-provoking, as the discussion about the dangers in playing God are interesting. By far the best of the trilogy, and I believe they're making a fourth one too. Do you think that's necessary at this point? Milking it a bit aren't they?"

","Only Spielberg could pull this off. He took a technology being at its infant stages and he applied it to a story that could bring out only the best of its qualities. Because let's face it, creating dinosaurs is much easier than creating other living creatures, because of the skin texture. Computers can do it relatively easy and with the contribution of the most determined director in history, the results are breath-taking.<br/><br/>And it's the presence of Spielberg that makes this movie so believable. He put all this monumental effort into making a movie that looks better than most of today's visual effects movies ('Mummy Returns', 'Dungeons and Dragons', etc). In fact the effects on this movie are even better than the effects of 'Jurassic Park 3'. Now, JP 3 includes effects that are more advanced than those of the first movie, but they are less effective.<br/><br/>My point is that the 'Spielberg' factor is an important element for a movie. He has this enormous power both as an artist and as a producer, to collect and effectively employ the best of this world in his movies.<br/><br/>No one else could make this movie any better, even today.<br/><br/>10/10"

For the first time, I felt like I was ""at the movies"".  The scenes with T-rex and other dinos were incredible.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 10 for creating a truly immersive experience of living with dinosaurs.  As I watched, I started picking up on various continuity errors and mistakes.  However, I reminded myself of what Speilberg was trying to achieve.  He is willing to accept some of these ""technical glitches"", for the purpose of moving the plot or creating a scene.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie wins because you get dragged into the experience. It isn't anything good for mankind, it's mostly just fun.  However, what helps push this movie to the top is the sub-plot warning man to be careful when playing with genetics.  I think the message should be well taken in light of the latest accomplishments in genetics (e.g. cloning).  Who are we to play god and what are the unexpected consequences.  Most compelling and true are the words of Jeff Goldblum's character, Malcolm:  ""...life finds a way"".<br/><br/>DVD extra note:  I believe this DVD has replaced ""The Matrix"" as my demo disc to show off my home theater."

And in the Tyrannosaur paddock the group was stopped. Never before had a film ever been so great in the ealry 90's.

","Interesting story, breathtaking special effects, great sound & sound effects, believable actors, super brain director, very good score from John Williams, atmosphere, locations and all this did something special for me. They gave me a ride in the dark theater i will never forget. The score should have been Oscarnominated but John Williams got one the same year for schindlers List. This was maybe the first time, one director release two films in the same year and both of them getting oscarnominations and even win. Schindler´s List & Jurassic Park got 10 Oscars in 1994. Spielberg did the same thing in 1997. To release two big films in the same year: Amistad & The Lost World. And this year the same thing: A.I & Jurassic Park 3(only producer). Steven Spielberg IS THE BEST DIRECTOR of all time, and there is no doubt about that. He is one of my biggest inspirations to know that: dream works. Dream and fight for your dream, then it´s a matter of time before you can get it. The greatest story teller of them all and Jurassic Park is his best art work yet.

"Angry_Arguer","9","3","4","24 April 2003"," Spielberg is an entertainer (spoiler)
","Let's face it, no matter how hard he tries, Spielberg cannot help but become the sentimental showman that Kubrick wasn't.  That nuance aside, hold onto your lug nuts because thrill rides don't get much bigger or exciting than this!  To make my job easier, I'll just run the pros and cons.<br/><br/>Cons: Lack of character development- In Jaws, Spielberg had to rely on technique over style.  Thus he was able to flesh out the characters and make a much more thrilling movie than otherwise planned.  Here we get characters with about 2 sentences worth of exposition and science babbling then another half-hour of screaming and yelling.<br/><br/>The Gallimimus herd- I'm sorry but the visual effects in that scene just don't hold up as well as the others.  Also, they could have disposed of it and no one would've noticed any difference.<br/><br/>""Over-reliance on technology"" motif- I'm talking about the script, not the production. Michael Crichton has never been an effective author and his preachiness in the novel translates into here pretty bad.  Fortunately they were able to get most of his boring moments from the book eliminated.  I still didn't like the annoying part about a 12-year-old being able to hack through a mulit-million dollar computer system to restart the power.<br/><br/>Pros: John Williams- Someone give the guy an Oscar! Please!  His music here ranges from intense to breathtaking.  I especially love his main theme and the approach to the island segments, but his finale has to be right up there with 'Cadillac of the Skies' in emotion.<br/><br/>The T-Rex attack- Well edited with decent dark humor incorporated and the oft-lauded lawyer chomping. No music though, just like the battles in Private Ryan.<br/><br/>The End- Not that I was happy to finally be done watching it, but I just loved how Spielberg ended the movie with William's score and no dialogue. Here's the only time in the movie when he lets the actor's expressions speak for themselves and it works beautifully.<br/><br/>Overall, a good movie, though lacking in the brains department,"

"jhclues","10","3","4","2 January 2001"," The Genius And Vision Of Spielberg
","It's indeed rare when a movie comes along that is so special, and has such a tremendous impact on audiences of all ages, that when it happens, it's an occasion for celebration; which is exactly what Steven Spielberg gave the world with `Jurassic Park,' a film that made the impossible possible:  It enabled dinosaurs to walk among us.  He put these monsters from a bygone era on the screen for all to see, and the unique thing about it was that they were real; so real you could reach out and touch them it seemed.  And in doing so he touched the imaginations of every child who sat there in the dark of a theater and watched his creations come to life, and he touched the child that still resides within every adult who came to see his show as well.  Jaded moviegoers and those who affect cynicism as a mission statement of life may scoff, especially now, after some time has passed and the magic has worn off somewhat, but it doesn't alter the fact that with this movie, Spielberg surpassed any and all standards of the cinematic world and set the precedent for all that would follow.  To borrow a line from one of his own characters, he `Spared no expense,' and simply made one of the most exciting and memorable films in the history of the Silver Screen. 	Spielberg pulled out all the stops to make this remarkable film, and it goes without saying that the special F/X are incredible; what's easy to overlook amid all the spectacle of it, however, are the performances turned in by one and all, and most notably by Jeff Goldblum, who brings such nuance and style to the role of Dr. Ian Malcolm.  It's a supporting role into which he immersed himself to create one of the more memorable characters in the film, and his performance-- with the countenance and attitude he lends to Malcolm, even the commanding, mesmerizing way he speaks-- has never received the attention it so richly deserved.  Nor has the performance of Richard Attenborough, as John Hammond, the entrepreneur who makes Jurassic Park a reality.  He's such a gifted performer that he makes you forget he's acting; Hammond becomes real, which makes what he's doing real, and it's just another example of the many things that add up to make this such an incredible movie.  Spielberg and his cast and crew have given such care to detail that it, in effect, releases the viewer from the baggage of even having to suspend disbelief because they're given a world that is `real' from the ground up.  The result of using all of the magic available, and using it wisely. 	Also turning in outstanding-- and entirely believable performances-- are Sam Neill, as Dr. Alan Grant, and Laura Dern, as Dr. Ellie Sattler, each creating figures central to the plot and around whom much of the action revolves.  And there are a number of performances in supporting roles that are just too good to go unmentioned as well,  including Bob Peck, as Muldoon, the park's head gamekeeper; Martin Ferrero, as the `blood-sucking' lawyer, Donald Gennaro; Wayne Knight, as computer hacker Dennis Nedry; Samuel L. Jackson, as computer programmer Ray Arnold; and last, but not least, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards as Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex, through whose eyes the child in all of us vicariously experiences the wonders of Jurassic Park. 	The wonderful thing about a movie like `Jurassic Park' is that, not only will it forever remain as a testimonial to a filmmaker of genius and vision, but that it will be there for all the generations that follow to discover anew.  The world may change drastically around us, even from one day to the next, but as long as even a single spark of imagination survives, one thing will always remain constant:  The fascination by children of all ages for these legendary beasts that once ruled the earth.  And that is why, when all is said and done and the skeptics have become no more than shadows and dust, this film-- as well as Steven Spielberg-- will remain a cause for celebration.  This is the legacy, and the true magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10."

","When man messes with the secrets of nature, they are going to live to regret it, that is if they live to see it. ""Think of it as a big cow"", scientist Sam Neill tells the kids he's trapped in the jungle when a herbivore visits the tree they are sleeping in a tree that the friendly dinosaur grabs a ton of leaves from to make a huge salad. But even big herbivores can crush a small human with their gigantic feet, and then there are the carnivores which come in all sizes, and even a small one can devour a full grown man in a matter of minutes, bones and all.<br/><br/>If the shark of ""Jaws"" was frightening, the T-Rex and other species recreated at Richard Attenborough's mysterious island compound that he has set up as a possible amusement park. But there is no amusement when every species of meat eaters go after human prey.<br/><br/>Impressive and cinematic, this was a huge blockbuster that came the same year as the film that won Steven Spielberg his very first Oscar, ""Schindler's List"", and it is a total contrast from that now classic drama about surviving the worst real event in modern history. ""Jurassic Park"" is about survival, too, and one that we pray never comes true with human involvement.<br/><br/>Between Neill and Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Attenborough, this is pretty star-studded. The kids get grating at times, but the mixture of tense action and humor makes for a thrilling film. Once again, composer John Williams creates a classic score, adding to the many he's already done for a Spielberg film.<br/><br/>For me, this is a reminder why science needs to keep its corrupt fingers off of the mysteries of nature. Dinosaurs are fascinating, but there is a reason why civilization has thrived while they became extinct. I look at this as just one possibility of how they lived, how they looked, and possibly how they interacted with whatever human beings looked like when these not always friendly giants roamed the earth."

"roystephen-81252","10","4","6","18 February 2016"," Raptors in the kitchen
","To me, a really great movie is one that is both consistently entertaining and has something profound to say. One that has vivid imagination and gorgeous visuals, offering a spectacle you have never seen before. (Of course, it has to have at least some internal logic that does not insult your intelligence, as well.) One that has you glued to the screen from start to finish. One that has iconic moments you'll never forget.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park ticks all these boxes. It is endlessly rewatchable, great entertainment, with a meaningful message about Man playing God. When I first saw it at the theatre, for a dinosaur fan like me, it was pure heaven, a dream come true. It is not a children's movie, however (I was about twenty at the time). It is violent, sometimes gory, very suspenseful and has some genuinely scary moments involving child characters. (I seriously thought at the time that at least one of them would not survive the T. Rex attack, for example. Of course I knew it would not happen – after all, it's a Spielberg flick – but up to that point I had never seen children thrown into such deadly perils scene after scene in any movie.)<br/><br/>Highlights (those 'iconic moments'): the water in the plastic cup, the goat, the T. Rex attack, Tim in the mud under the belly of the car, the T.Rex in the rear-view mirror, Arnold's arm, the green jelly, the raptors in the kitchen (my favourite shot is that of the raptor's claw knocking on the floor) and many many more.<br/><br/>PS. I saw the 3D version, as well, and it works surprisingly well in several scenes. I still find post-conversion totally pointless (even movies originally shot in 3D rarely exploit the true potential of 3D technology), but for a post-converted movie, Jurassic Park 3D is pretty good."

It's second to none, rivaled only by Back To The Future.<br/><br/>It might have been another of my favorites, Terminator 2, that paved the way for CGI, but I'll still attribute the CGI movie-revolution to Jurassic Park. <br/><br/>In my opinion Jurassic Park contains just the right amount of the right stuff: The cast (right amount of primary actors and sidekicks), directing (Spielberg at his best) and the score (most of the soundtrack CD can be enjoyed without being accompanied by the movie, even if you don't like classical music!)<br/><br/>Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Wayne Knight and Bob Peck all deliver outstanding performances and Samuel L. Jackson, Martin Ferrero, Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello ""hold their own"". It's hard to select a favorite scene, but if I must, it'd have to be the scene where Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) and Lewis Dodgson (Cameron Thor) meet and Lewis says: ""You shouldn't use my name"" to which Dennis responds: ""Dodgson! Dodgson! We got Dodgson here!! See, nobody cares..."" :)<br/><br/>All in all, this movie just keeps you spellbound from start to finish!"

John Williams's score is absolutely terrific, definitely one of the more memorable scores in a Steven Spielberg movie, the score for Jaws like Psycho is one of the main reason why I am so scared to go into the sea now. The acting is really not bad at all, Sam Neill and Laura Dern have given better performances but they were good. Jeff Goldblum is terrific, and as Dennis Nedry Wayne Knight is suitably more subdued. Richard Attenborough, a talented actor and a even more talented director also is good as John Hammond, while child star Joseph Mazello, who surprised me in Shadowlands is appealing as Tim. However, the real stars are the dinosaurs, especially the T-Rex, the mix of computer animation and models is inspiring. The cinematography is astounding, the script is good and the direction is lively. I haven't read Michael Crichton's book, but regardless this is a hugely enjoyable film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

","This is definitely one of my all time favorite movies. My kids were 9 and 7 years old when the movie came out and begged to see it. We saw it in the movies and I could not wait till it came out on video. When it did, my kids would watch it over and over (and so did I). I remember cooking dinner in the kitchen and hearing them start the movie. Once I heard the ""thumping"" of the escaping T-Rex, dinner was always put on hold. I was drawn into the living room and just couldn't stop watching from that point. When Jeff Goldblum says, ""Must go faster!"" and then follows shortly with, ""You think they'll have THAT on the tour?"" I just can't stop laughing. I want to be entertained when watching a movie and this movie did just that!"

Prior to JP, there were no Hindi dubbed movies. All you had Hollywood movies on VHS. Even movie theaters never dared to play an English movie, especially in smaller cities. JP was the 1st 1 that was watched by almost half of the Indian population. They had never seen such a thing. the cinematography, special effects, sound effects, etc. Last but not the least, no one had even seen a picture of how a dinosaur looks. People rushed in with there kids to see this movie. House full everywhere. Then there were the merchandise: t-shirts, stickers, water bottles, tiffin boxes, school bags etc. It was a phenomenon in India. Never ever saw such a thing again. JP can be considered as the best thing to happen to the world of cinema. Also, i agree to the previous comment, the movie should be listed in top 5 in the IMDb's list of best movies."

","For me this is a movie that never gets old. I saw it first when I was two (and proceeded to want to watch 'the monster movie' 24/7...but once I called it monster movie my mom didn't want me to watch it too much). I'm sixteen - almost seventeen - now and still enjoy watching it. In fact, this movie was so good it's helped me finally choose a career path. I just had to read the book after seeing the movie. And thankfully for that I'm now going to be a paleontologist.<br/><br/>And I'm not the only one. This movie (and the book) was so explosive that the year it came out the number of paleontologists exploded, and has been at an all time high ever since.<br/><br/>But back to the movie. The actors play their characters extremely convincingly, and you really begin to believe that you could look out your window and see a Velociraptor stalking you outside. And it's not just the actors. The CGI is amazing and the Dinosaurs are extremely believable - though some of the Dinosaurs are not completely realistic according to their bones. And the pacing of the movie is amazing. It's not all non-stop action, or all blood and gore. It takes the time to give you breathers, develop characters, and actually has a plot besides 'OMG-Dinosaurs-r-goin-2-eat-us,' like it might had it been handled by different people.<br/><br/>This movie is true movie magic. Every single time I watch it - which is a lot."

","In this classic action-packed movie, brilliant scientists have created genetically engineered dinosaurs on a remote island in the pacific. Unfortunately, at the very beginning of the film, one of the raptors breaks free, and kills some of the scientists. This is a big problem for the main creator of the dinosaurs, for he wanted to open up the park so the public could see the wondrous, and also vicious monsters they've created. Its bad for him because the president of the U.S won't let him open the park until he's had at least three experts (Portrayed to perfection by Sam Niel, Jeff Goldblume, and Laura Dern.) inspect the island and see if it's all right. Of course, the dinosaurs later break free from their cages when a man shuts down the power to the park trying to pull of a heist, and all hell breaks loose. The dinosaurs, are amazingly realistic looking, especially for 1993, and you never can tell if it's CG, or real dinosaurs! A true classic from the amazing Steven Spielberg."

"dkncd","10","4","6","11 October 2007"," An adventure sixty-five million years in the making
","""Jurassic Park"" is Steven Spielberg's immensely popular movie about a theme park with live dinosaurs made possible by replicating preserved dinosaur DNA. Through a calamity the dinosaurs escape their fenced confinements and run amok in the park. The park was created with impressive sets and scenes. John Williams' score is of the highest quality and greatly adds to the majesty and intensity of the film.<br/><br/>On paper it sounds as though ""Jurassic Park"" could be just another ""monsters attack"" movie, but there are several factors that make this film far better than just another monster movie. There is some character development and importantly each part is perfectly cast, which means that each character makes a distinct impression and has memorable lines. Richard Attenborough is the perfect man to play the genial park owner John Hammond. The way Hammond mused about his dream of creating Jurassic Park even when the park was in shambles was great. Sam Neill and Laura Dern were apt choices to play the respectable paleontologists Drs. Grant and Sattler. Jeff Goldblum creates a memorable character in the eccentric Dr. Malcolm. I enjoyed seeing all of the characters in this film.<br/><br/>Of course there are the film's famous dinosaurs, which are amazingly realistic. There is enough variation in the types of dinosaur encounters and the context in which they are encountered such that they don't become boring. The situations with the dinosaurs are created such that tension is created. ""Jurassic Park"" manages to rise far above being simply another monster movie."
"jakedog-1","10","4","6","21 August 2007"," One of the greatest adventure movies ever made.
","Steven Spielberg sure does know how to make a good film. And Jurrasic Park is no exception. I may only be 14, but this film is still my favourite movie of all time and righteously deserves the title of one the greatest adventure flicks ever made. I first saw this movie at a friends house, as it was released in cinemas when i was just only 1 year old. I was in awe when i saw it then, and still 8 years later i can watch this movie over and it will never lose any of it's charm, thrills or pace. It is a pity, that there has been no film, i believe, released since Jurassic Park that was truly able to capture the excitement and wonder that is a proper adventure flick. The special effects, while amazing (and still stand up proudly over 14 years later), are blended very smoothly with animatronic puppets so as to give an extra sense of realism to the beasties, and the whole thing is strung together with a fantastic sense of pacing, so you are never bored. One thing that has always bugged me, is that this film is never truly recognised as it should be. You wouldn't have to look very far to find a scene that blatantly rips off the classic kitchen scene, and yet Jurassic Park is never recognised as it really should be. I implore you, if anyone is looking to make a fun, energetic, thrilling and charming film then they need look no further for inspiration that the one, the only, the classic JURRASIC PARK."
"king_kong_is","9","4","6","27 February 2007"," My First True Movie Experience.
","A few minutes ago, I had been writing an elaborate review of the original King Kong, when i had to quit for personal reasons. Extremely Angry and annoyed, I decided instead to attempt a review of Jurassic Park, which very well could be the first movie that had an actual impact on me.<br/><br/>Here's a very short synopsis (I'm not a big fan of giving away elaborate plots for movies). The film is about a theme park called Jurassic Park, which is like a zoo with genetically engineered dinosaurs. A group of experts are invited to the island that the park is on, to give it a test tour and give the place their stamp of approval. But when a spy from a rival company shuts down the park in an attempt to steal dinosaur embryos, the creatures break out, and plenty of awesome Spielbergian-Action and Effects ensue.<br/><br/>I have read the book by Michael Crichton (one of my favorite authors) which is better than this film, slightly, but the movie will always personify this incredible story. Steven Spielberg is my favorite director along with Peter Jackson, and this is truly one of his best films. In fact, this was the movie which introduced me to both Spielberg and the concept of the ""blockbuster."" What a defining moment!!! The effects are extremely, incredibly, monstrously, astonishingly...my god, I cannot think of the right word. This film was THE movie which forever implanted the memory of Computer Generated Images into the public's head, and I still am in absolute awe of the creatures in the films. Seriously, Spielberg deserves a million extremely hot woman for what he has done with this picture. An absolute piece of art.<br/><br/>The actors are very good as well. Sam Neill brings a likability and intelligent nature to Dr. Alan Grant, and, being a big fan of character arcs, I really liked how his character changes throughout the movie. Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler is lovely and smart, and she deserves to become a star in her own right. The children who play Tim and Alexis Murphy fit their part nicely, never becoming too annoying or cute.<br/><br/>As for the other actors, they are fine, but not truly great. But i really don't want to make this a negative review, so I'm just going to skip the bad stuff, of which there is extremely little.<br/><br/>In the end, Jurassic Park and it's incredibly entertaining sequels (I can't wait for the fourth film) are truly great works of cinema from the greatest entertainer alive, Spielberg, and if you haven't seen it, I advise that you get your lazy rear over to a rental store, and soak in every beautiful aspect of this special effects masterpiece.<br/><br/>9/10. See it now if you haven't (which I doubt)."

I was only 3 when I saw it for the first time...and I remember watching it in our living room, dancing along to the music; hiding under a blanket whenever the dinosaurs appeared on screen...And now whenever I watch it I am blown away by the visual effects this film contains, and I still am in love with the original score. I think the actors do an amazing job, and the screenplay is really awesome. Sam Neill is one of my favorite actors and in this film no one could ever do as good a job as he did. I still get goosebumps every now and then while watching this film, even though I've seen it hundreds of times...it still remains my favorite movie."

","What is it about Jurassic Park that makes me, and MANY others, love it? The special effects? The thrill? The fact that it's possible to watch this movie 800 times and it never gets old? I'd say all of the above, but also keep in mind: Humans NEVER saw dinosaurs, and along with fossils, this is about as close as we can get.<br/><br/>This remains one of the most successful movies in WORLD-WIDE box office history, and it's not hard to see why. The acting is great, full of humor, the story is well-paced, and the Oscar-winning special effects and sound speak for themselves.<br/><br/>1993 was clearly the year of Spielberg. He struck both box office and critical gold with Jurassic Park and Schindler's List. Both movies are amazing, and both won Oscars. However, the fact that only Schindler's List is on the IMDb top 250 boggles the mind. It deserves its spot on there, no doubt, but so does Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>So this is, and will always be, on my top 10."

"FootballGuy101","10","4","6","11 August 2004"," Wow, just wow
","Jurassic Park is one of the best films of all time. Spielberg's adaptation of the best selling book by Michael Crichton is only beaten by the Godfather and Harry Potter series adaptations. Granted, there are some parts Spielberg chose to leave out, but if he didn't the movie would have been over four hours long. Aside from the stupendous state of the art special effects that make the movie what it is, the story line is also one of great interest. The idea of man and dinosaurs walking the Earth at the same time intrigues the child within all of us. The cast plays their parts beautifully, sticking to how Crichton made them in his book. As good as this movie is though, it is still not one of the top 250 movies of this site. That's a shame as I give it 10 out of 10."

I do think some more thought could have been put into the script (although it has a great plot), but even with its flaws it puts other films in its genre to shame with reasonably good acting, direction, etc.  The special effects were amazing."

Spielburg did a wonderful job with this and kept to novel written by Michaele Crichton. I rate this 10/10.

It is a classic amongst classics.<br/><br/>This movie had something for everyone.  The dinosaurs of course were the real stars of the show and how could they not be?  They were so realistic, so scary and menacing...even the nice gentle ones were awesome!  They played their roles perfectly!<br/><br/>There are so many things in this movie that I liked, too many to mention here but I have to say that one of my favorite sequences was  Tim and Lex being stuck in the kitchen with the Velaceraptors.  Talk about scary!  I don't know what I would've done!!  The chills, the intensity, the fear, those Raptor noises, those Raptor eyes...brrr...gives me chills just thinking about it.<br/><br/>I have to say that the whole premise to Jurassic Park was brilliant.  A ""Dinosaur Disneyland"" for everyone.  Of course, I never got chased by a Raptor at Disneyland and hopefully they never introduce that attraction there either but the story itself was great.  It's a wonderful fantasy, the stuff scientists dream of.<br/><br/>I loved Sam Neill from his role in ""Hunt For Red October"" and can't imagine anyone else playing Dr. Alan Grant.  Laura Dern was great as Ellie and how could you just not love Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm?  Bob Peck was very likeable as the Park's Warden and Wayne Knight as the very detestable Dennis.  The actors had great chemistry and stronger hearts to survive all those dino chases!<br/><br/>All in all ""Jurassic Park"" ranks up there with such sci-fi's as ""Star Wars"" and ""Jaws""  Those are films that will last forever in the annals of film making.  Add ""Jurassic Park"" to that list.  It'll be spoken off when we're all old and gray and we can say, ""Hey, I was there!"""

Character development is so basic, that, except for their ages, you'd have a hard time telling the kids from the adults. Everyone, except the dinosaurs are void of personality.  When the creatures aren't on the screen, you're subjected to a screenplay that features dull, one-dimensional characters spouting boring dialog.  Steven Spielberg seems to have lost his ability to direct a film, that grips an audience with its storytelling (Duel, Jaws, Close Encounters).

The primary visual element here is 'the hand' -- Spielberg's mainstay.<br/><br/>Everything is told through borrowings from other movies, mainly ""King Kong"" (from the first remake in '76), ""Jaws"" (the raptor pen), ""Aliens""(the kitchen evasion and the dropped ceiling escape). Heck, even ""Crocodile Dundee"" makes an appearance.<br/><br/>So back to the intellect - Spielberg's in way over his head when he attempts to explicate chaos theory; Crichton's parallel novel is better for this, if that interests you. <br/><br/>Essentially, all complex systems must eventually behave unpredictably. The thing is, Spielberg never attempts anything complex, and never lets anything out of the control of the guiding hand...he just tries to purport the illusion of complexity: the flea circus writ large.<br/><br/>The entire movie is mirrored by the tour's animated DNA cartoon -- all of the content is meant for the consumption of mental ten year olds.<br/><br/>Malcolm is presented with the proper cerebral depth in the novel; Goldblum knows this is a joke, so he plays this as the comic relief.

","Titanic, shmitanic, Jurassic Park is definitely atop my long list of favorite movies.  Not very often is a movie made that has such an impact on the people that are lucky enough to see it.  Jurassic Park leaves such an impression on the viewer, that when I watched it on opening day, after standing in line for a (still current) record of 3 1/2 hours, I stepped out of the theater, turned around, bought another ticket, and watched it again. Jurassic Park transports the viewer to the ancient world of dinosaurs. While watching this film, I couldn't help but wonder where they got all the dinosaurs to make it.  Well, of course there are no dinosaurs today, it was just the master work of good pal George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic team. While the special effects were cutting edge, the story was even more revolutionary, a completely original idea of bringing dinosaurs into todays world. Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) is called upon by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to analyze his new ""amusement park"".  Joined by Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), Grant tours the park meeting all type of dino's along the way. As the trip's energy begins to die down, so did the electrical fencing holding the dinosaurs in their bins.  The greatest scene in the movie has a T-Rex eating a lawyer, and then tearing apart a sport utility vehicle. The realism is indescribable, which is precisely why I advise everyone to go and rent this movie.<br/><br/>Special Note:  The DVD release of Jurassic Park/Lost World is due to hit the streets later this year.  This will be a great, refreshing addition, at least until the 10th anniversary re-release of the original in theaters."

Now, i haven't read the novel but my dad (who took me to see the film) had, and when i watched this film again some years later, I was rather disappointed with the banal characters and asked my dad how 'true' to the book the film had actually been. Obviously, Spielberg had adapted the book to fit the big screen and to ensure its box office success, at I think, the expense of the integrity of Chricton's original vision. Upon second viewing i was immediately struck by the lack of enthusiasm shown by the main leads, with the exception of Malcolm, although his characters incessant 'moral complex' was continually annoying, he at least played the part convincingly. Unfortunately, as the movie progresses, one can't help thinking that what started as a promising film, quickly descends into Hollywood 'action' territory, with all notion of plot, suspense, and character development thrown aside in favour of big, brash, in your face style cinema that while entertaining first time round, leaves those who demand a little more from their movies, rather underwhelmed. Its great as a kids/young teens movie, it has action, big dinosaurs, and a nice uncomplicated plot that you already know the ending too (to all intense and purposed). To the critical viewer, the poor, lacklustre acting, (as exhibited throughout by Sam Neil and Laura Dern) makes you wonder why they bothered signing up since their characters aren't forced to challenge any major, significant social issues about cloning and its repurcussion's, just how they are going to survive until the next dinosaur pops up. The plot barely holds up under scrutiny in the film, the 'believability' of the scenario, or the seriousness of the overall implications for cloning, are either undermined or just plain forgotten in favour of allowing our 'heroes' to be exposed to danger as quickly as possible. And last, but not least, the most scathing attack must be levelled at Spielberg's pre-occupation with entertaining, as opposed to challenging, his viewers. He takes a novel (that my father assures me raises relevant and thought provoking debate on a controversial subject, but also displays an understanding of human terror and helplessness in the face of mother nature gone wild)and reduces it to little more than a 'theme park' of a movie with sugary characters who have little or nothing of relevance to say, a plot situated squarely in 'safe', Hollywood, boundaries and (apart from a solid soundtrack) a thoroughly underwhelming cinema experience which, unfortunately, is all too common with directors whose success has gone to their heads. Its a shame that such promising source material has, once again, been pillaged by Hollywood to make big bucks. Watch it once for the effects, but i doubt you'll want to experience it again lest you want to be periodically awoken by loud dinosaur screams as the actors cower away in their shadows."

","I saw this film twice, once at general release and later on video to appease a small child.  The first time I thought it was okay, but after the second view, I realized...NOT!  Spielberg and the rest of the production team have taken an interesting Crichton novel and made a terrible film with many changes, not all for the best.  The special effects and the ""island"" are great, as is Laura Dern's bottom (to summarize an earlier review), but the rest was just...there.  Too bad, too, because they waste some great actors, notably Sam Neill (who does deliver one of the most convincing lines I've ever seen, as ""Karen Davis"" notes).  Like ""Independence Day"", this could have been a great film, but falls far short of expectations, and could have used a better continuity editor.  The sequel is TERRIBLE.  ""The Lost World"" is a more enjoyable alternative."
"crash21","6","8","17","7 June 2009"," Just another Spielberg failure
","I will admit, when this movie came out when I was little, I was obsessed with Jurassic Park, but when I watch this today, I roll my eyes at Spielberg's many screw-ups in this movie. The movie is reasonably good up through the parts with the Triceratops, but after that, it gets rather ridiculous.<br/><br/>For instance, when the T-Rex gets through the fence hunting down the kids, somehow once the dinosaur gets through the fence, the path back through there is suddenly a 200 ft. drop into the trees below. Then, when the (supposedly electric) SUV falls into the tree below and Dr. Grant comes to rescue Tim. He gets Tim out of the SUV safely, and right there, both Dr. Grant and Tim are safe out of the way of the SUV . Why do they have to get back in front of the SUV? Just so there can be a dramatic scene with the falling SUV chasing them? Plus, that SUV most likely wouldn't just fall like that, the SUV would most likely just tumble out of the tree.<br/><br/>The movie does get a little better with when they power the stuff back up and when you get to see technical things again, plus scenes like Dr. Grant faking getting fried on the fence, that was entertaining. But, then it just goes right back to plain drama when Tim gets fried for real (while he's simply six feet from climbing down and off of the fence). Another one in this was where the raptor suddenly bursts through the circuit breaker panel in the utility room.<br/><br/>As you can see, the majority of this movie was devoted to Spielberg's ridiculous need for drama, not making the story believable. I just don't understand how Spielberg can work so hard to make the dinosaurs look believable and then screw up so much else in this story.<br/><br/>The story the book told was so much better than this."
"tieman64","Null","6","12","24 July 2008"," Wild things
","""There is no unauthorised breeding in Jurassic Park."" - Dr. Woo <br/><br/>""Jurassic Park"" has been compared to ""Jaws"" (""Jaws"" was actually a rip-off of ""Creature From The Black Lagoon"", down to the stealing of the ""duh duh duh"" soundtrack and several scenes, shot for shot) but thematically it's actually the opposite. <br/><br/>Michael Crichton's ""Jurassic Park"" is based upon an earlier film which he wrote called ""Westworld"", in which an amusement park's stable of robots escaped their planned systems of control and murdered all the park's visitors.<br/><br/>While ""Westworld"" dealt with cybernetics, ""Jurassic Park"" takes genetic engineering and develops it within the context of 2 contrasting world views. Crichton takes the classical scientific notion of a mechanistic universe, in which everything is predictable and subject to physical laws, and plays it off against the newly emerging dynamical systems theory, also known as Chaos theory.<br/><br/>In Crichton's book, the mechanistic view comes off as an inadequate strategy of approaching the living world, which is constantly moving, in flux and widely unpredictable. According to Chaos theory, the world is a shifting pattern of processes and vibrations, all interlaced to form a complex mosaic of nature in which figures can't be isolated or removed. <br/><br/>The dinosaurs of ""Jurassic Park"" are genetic reconstructions of species which have already been removed from the global environment. Crichton's book contrasts the mechanistic world of the scientists - their technology, computers, predictions and simulations - with the raw force of nature, wild and ever adapting. His characters keep trying to predict and cater for the beasts, but their computers simply don't have the brainpower to foresee what will happen next. The plot's essentially an update of Shelley's ""Frankenstein""; Nature and Science too complex for the arrogant hands of man.<br/><br/>Spielberg's film is mostly devoid of all this stuff, and instead plays like a straightforward adventure movie. It's a cross between ""Frankenstein"" and ""King Kong"", with several iconic action set pieces and some memorable CGI work sprinkled about.<br/><br/>Note that Spielberg ends the film just as Melville ends ""Moby Dick"", the crash of the T-Rex's tail echoing the crash of the whale as it destroys Ahab's ship. Both the Melville and Crichton stories are a direct contrast to ""Jaws"", which was a classical dragon slayer story in which our hero slays the monster and emerges triumphant. In ""Jurassic Park"" it is nature who wins, and the humans are forced to flee the island. In ""Jaws"", the humans conquer nature, tame it, and claim the beaches for themselves.<br/><br/>The dragon slayer myth (""Jaws"") is the underlying myth of the mechanistic view of the universe. It spans across folk like Descartes and Francis Bacon, who saw ""science"" and ""man"" as ""masculinizing"" forces who tame a feminized nature with the awesome ""laws"" of man. ""Jurrasic Park"", however, is the opposite, and shows what happens when such a mechanistic view of nature serves as the basis for removing a particular species from their environment as though they were mere atoms.<br/><br/>Less talked about are the film's weird gender games and visual gags. Perhaps the best (you have to read the books to get this joke) is a moment of foreshadowing which occurs early on, when a nervous Dr. Grant struggles to connect two female seat belt couplings. The park's dinosaurs have similarly been neutered, yet, as Grant later shows by tying two identical seat-belt parts together, nature always finds a way. Significantly, while men wreak and receive havoc, no females are killed in the film. Ellie, the film's female human hero, even jokes about God making man, man making dinosaurs, dinosaurs eating man and women inheriting the earth. While a joke, it signals to the viewer just who actually controls creation in the film. Men and science may have co-opted the process, but women/Nature still remain the ultimate power in creative process. Like ""Aliens"", you then have an alignment of the beasts, the dinosaurs, with an unhinged Femininity, and a wild, feminine Nature. In this way the film goes on to perpetuate a very 17th century form of sexism and gender bias: Man is lord of the realm of order, control and science, while woman - in her strangeness, her mystery - is mistress of calamity, destruction and the wilderness, the jungle and womb conflated. Unlike ""Aliens"", though, Spielberg has his Queens survive with roars of triumph. The men leave with their tails between their legs<br/><br/>8/10 - Spielberg essentially reduced a complex and interesting techno-thriller into another Indiana Jones movie (Sam Niel even resembles Dr Jones). It's very lightweight, and Spielberg's dinosaur attacks are crass, but the film's also slick and exciting at times.<br/><br/>After ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters"", Spielberg's ""popcorn"" films got increasingly cartoonish. The fully fleshed characters of his earlier thrillers (Martin Brody, Roy Neary etc) are replaced with cardboard heroes. Spielberg's justification, I suspect, is that he now began making ""serious"" pictures which he feels better warrant depth and characterisation. Worth multiple viewings."
"Dutch90","9","6","12","4 January 2005"," A dinosaur lover's dream
","This is still one of the best dinosaur movies to date. It portrays the dinosaurs realistically; they are not movie villains, but simply animals looking for something to eat. Spielberg takes some liberty regarding the looks of the dinosaurs (Raptors were only half the size of the ones in this movie), but overall delivers a masterpiece. The relatively simple plot is overshadowed by a great script, ground-breaking effects and a good cinematography.<br/><br/>Adding up to this is a great cast of likable actors. I really felt sorry for Hammond in the end. The children are nice, too, and well-acted.<br/><br/>However, every movie has its flaws. Jurassic Park's flaws come in the form of some grotesque goofs. Goofs are usually fun to search for, but some of the errors in JP are gut-wreching and impossible to overlook (such as a cliff suddenly appearing where several minutes ago there was a 5-tonne T-rex walking).<br/><br/>A real gem, it deserves a higher rating than a 7.4."

"zwrite2","7","4","7","28 July 2008"," More science, less adventure needed
","The very concept of dinosaurs coming back to life is so fascinating that ""Jurassic Park"" had the potential to be one of the best movies ever. At minimum, it should have earned a 10 rating.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, director Steven Spielberg and the writers did not spend enough time teaching us  perhaps, via the film's children  about dinosaurs. Instead, there are too many dumbing-down scenes with dinosaurs relentlessly hunting people and humans doing all sorts of incredible gymnastics to stay alive.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the movie has several ""wow"" moments involving gentle dinosaurs. The special effects are tremendous. When the characters first saw dinosaurs on the island near Costa Rica, I felt as awestruck as they did. Later, we see a dinosaur born in a lab, Laura Dern's character helping a sick dinosaur, a dinosaur eating plants a few feet away from Sam Neill's character and the two children, and dozens of gazelle-like dinosaurs sprinting away from a massive meat-eating predator. These scenes were spectacular.<br/><br/>There are also a couple of interesting scenes focusing on the mean carnivorous dinosaurs. But, the meat eaters just don't stop chasing the humans. The action goes on and on and on. The longer these scenes go on, the more ""Jurassic"" evolves from a fascinating science fiction story into a trite action-adventure.<br/><br/>I'm for action-adventure, and liked that the plot included a greedy computer expert played by Newman of ""Seinfeld"" conspiring to steal dinosaur DNA. Newman's comeuppance was enjoyable, and ""Jurassic"" was better because his behavior caused the dinosaurs to escape from their habitats and go after innocent people.<br/><br/>But, there were many times that I wanted the pace to slow down and listen to the dinosaur experts played by Dern and Neill discuss the various species of dinosaurs. I also wanted to see more scenes with different species interacting with each other, more everyday scenes of dinosaurs doing whatever dinosaurs do, and even more scenes of the people interacting with the gentle dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Spielberg, I think, missed a wonderful opportunity to educate the public in an entertaining way. An excellent movie would have balanced education and entertainment, but ""Jurassic"" took a mid-story turn toward entertainment, and I wasn't particularly entertained.<br/><br/>The dinosaurs the movie focused on were more like people obsessed with winning. As far as I know, animals chase their prey, succeed or fail, and then look for other prey. They don't fail, but then spend hours looking for the prey that escaped from them instead of looking for other prey. If dinosaurs are that smart, I would have liked to hear the dinosaur experts discuss what else they could do.<br/><br/>Spielberg deserves credit for inserting personal touches in the middle of his action-adventure and developing the Neill character from a child-hater into a child-lover although his quick transformation was a bit implausible. I also liked the comic relief of Jeff Goldblum's character, but the writers needed to explain better why a statistical theorist/philosopher was in the movie in the first place.<br/><br/>I also think that the Richard Attenborough character was too much like the Dr. Frankenstein character. Here, was a brilliant entrepreneur who spent years pursuing his dream of re-creating life. Then, as soon as his experiment goes awry, he  like Frankenstein  wants to abandon his dream. The ending would have been better if viewers were left thinking about whether dinosaurs coming back to life was a good or bad thing instead of watching a black-and-white anti-dinosaur position.<br/><br/>I cast an 8 for ""Jurassic Park"" when I initially voted on it, but the more I think and write about it, the more I conclude it deserves a 7 instead because it really missed an opportunity to be great.<br/><br/>ZWrite"
"emperor_bender","10","4","7","23 May 2008"," ""Spared no expense""
","This is the first movie I saw that I still remember. I specifically remember watching at my cousin's house when I was about 4, but I did not get one thing that happened.<br/><br/>As the years went by, I saw Jurassic Park sporadically, but never got the storyline completely. Each time I watched, I would get a little more of it, but never the full thing. It was only recently I bought the movie for DVD finally and watched it, and fully got every detail.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is a great Sci-Fi thriller with great special effects and a great cast. Sam Neill stars as Dr. Alan Grant, the not-technologically savvy, old fashioned archaeologist who does not take long to show that he is the protagonist. Laura Dern plays Dr. Ellie Sattler, the archaeologist who has an obvious crush on Grant. Jeff Goldblum portrays Dr. Ian Malcolm, the smart, witty, sly, laid back ""Chaotician"". Richard Attenborough plays John Hammond, the imaginative, happy, determined owner of Jurassic Park. Bob Peck plays Robert Muldoon, the cautious, trained, quick-thinking hunter/raptor-cage operator. Martin Ferrero plays Donald Gennaro, the wimpy, hesitant, greedy lawyer who seeks to close down Jurassic Park if not to make a fortune off it. Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards play Tim and Lex Murphy, John Hammond's grandchildren who's thirst for adventure gets them into this whole mess. Samuel L. Jackson makes an early appearance as Ray Arnold, the commanding computer tech who is caught in the middle of Jurassic Park's security problems and problems caused by Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), who seeks to steal embryos from Jurassic Park's lab to sell to a rival corporation.<br/><br/>Aside from a great cast, they special effects were first rate. Especially for 1993. They were better than a lot of movies we see nowadays. And they were not overused or anything.<br/><br/>The mix of an adventurous, eerie, inspiring sound mix along with scene lighting and weather make Jurassic Park an unforgettable film. Definitely worthy of the Top 250, although it does not seem to get that recognition.<br/><br/>This is a movie you just HAVE to see at least once. Like Jaws.<br/><br/>10/10.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this movie...you must be a zombie considering no one can go without seeing this once in their life."

Superb effects for there time. <br/><br/>I saw this movie again the other day and my little cousin asked me if the dinosaurs were real.This is how good the effects are. Spielberg always makes great films but this is his best one ever. He makes his movies in a way where you feel like your in it. When I watch this I feel like I'm part of the Jurassic Park ride.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me of King Kong. There are group of people on an Island who are trying to survive. They all try to survive against these horrible creatures that aren't even supposed to exist. What I liked about this movie is that all of the action stays on the island. If it would have moved to another location like a city it would have taken you out of the mood. The best action seen is the first encounter with the T-Rex. I like the way the kids acted so realistically when the T-Rex crashed through the window. My second favorite seen is the raptors in the kitchen part. I have no idea how the Lex and Tim made it out alive. It was just so scary. I suggest you watch this movie again if you want to relive all the memories and thrills!"
"Tyferra","10","4","7","15 January 2007"," Living with Dinosaurs
","I don't know whether I should be writing this seeing Jurassic Park is my favourite film so I may tend to be biased. I first saw Jurassic Park soon after my sixth birthday in 1993. I was, as most six-year-olds are, interested in Dinosaurs, but Jurassic Park sparked me off on a whole new level of Dinosaur enthusiasm. Another thing I should add was that I played piano back then and instantly wanted to be able to play John Williams' fantastic theme. Now fourteen years later, it remains the one piece of music I remember. The music is the first thing I'd like to touch on, in short, it is epic and incredibly fitting. Even back then it had the qualities of timelessness which even a six-year-old could understand.<br/><br/>The film stands up today so well, which is incredible seeing the leaps and bounds which we have achieved in the field on special effects in the fourteen years since it was made. I still find the T-Rex the most realistic movie creature ever. In comparing it to Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" I still find the Rex more realistic then the incredibly detailed Kong - which instead of looking real, looks like what it is - an incredibly believable CG model. The mixture of the then new computer generated animation and the animatronic Dinosaurs gives the Dinosaurs more realism then modern CG creatures have now. Where places like Jackson's Weta Workshop replicate interaction between actors and CG characters, in Jurassic Park, actors WERE interacting with the Dinosaurs.<br/><br/>The other characters in the film are superb, although differing quite a lot from the book. I like Alan Grant's dislike of children which he didn't have in the book. It adds more to the character's development. No-one other then Sam Neill could have been Alan Grant, even though he differs from the description of Grant in the book. Malcolm was portrayed by Jeff Goldblum incredibly well, and it was a show of the films good writing that he didn't turn into the whiny know-it-all as Malcolm was in the book. He of course was still the critic but Goldblum delivered this with more class then the ""I told you so"" Malcolm of the book. Gennero and Hammond were the two major differing-from-the-book characters and I'm not sure which I liked better. I know I did not want Attenborough's Hammond to be killed as he was too different from the ambitious capitalist Hammond of the book - he was too likable. Ferrero created a perfect blend of Ed Regis and the capitalistic Hammond, but his character from the book was all but gone, which was unfortunate because I thought that Generro was one of the more realistic characters in the book. Regardless, Ferrero's Generro was still a great character. Lastly on the characters/actors front I would just like to add that Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello were brilliantly realistic as Tim and Lex Murphy which is rare in young actors, especially now.<br/><br/>I know I've written too much so I'll close now;<br/><br/>The film is timeless and stands up incredibly well today, even with someone like me who has seen it countless times, as well as seeing the making of features and reading the book. It is still so realistic, even me with my now critical eye can easily look past the slight shaky-ness of the Rex at times, (brought on by the water which the skin soaked in,) and other such minor issues which people seem to always insist on pointing out to be always captivated by the film."

","Jurassic Park is my absolute favorite movie of all time, no kidding. I've seen this movie millions of times, & I've never been bored once. The reasons for this is because even though this movie was released in 1993, when I was almost two years old (I was born in 8/91, you see), the effects are still quite convincing (in most cases better than the bad CG effects in modern movies), the script is very nicely done, has extremely good music, & the best dinosaur-related scenes ever, including the famous T-rex attack in the thunderstorm. I also like how they not only have the T-rex, but also other dinos too like the spitting dino (forgot its name), triceratops, duckbills, & aptosaurus. I guess you can say this is the movie that fueled my fascination with dinosaurs. Overall:If you have not seen it, rent it now, & don't forget to read the two books by Micheal Crichton too!

","Jurassic Park, as we all know, was the biggest hit of 1993, grossing more than $910 million worldwide and extended the possibilities of CGI Animation. Steven Spielberg came back strong after a series of failures at the end of the 1980's and returned to the genre of movies he embraced in the beginning of his career. Jurassic Park tells the story of a billionaire/scientist named John Hammond, who manages to re-create dinosaurs and plans to open an attraction park, but when an employee of the park gets attacked by a raptor, the insurance company wants John to invite a group of scientists, including a lawyer to the park for a weekend. The people invited along with John Hammond are Dr.Alan Grant, an archaeologist, Elie Sadler, a paleontologist, Dr.Ian Malcolm, a mathematician and a lawyer. They are joined by Hammond's grandchildren named Lex and Tim at the park. After an employee of the park named Dennis Nedry shuts down the park's main circuits during a rainstorm, the visitors are trapped inside the park as the dinosaurs soon escape their paddocks. From then on, they will all have to fight for their survival and try to get Jurassic Park back on track."
"Spleen","7","4","7","28 November 1999"," I want to see Tertiary Park
","I'm amazed how badly this film has aged - it's only been six years.  I enjoyed it back in 1993, but on seeing it again last night all manner of uncharitable thoughts kept popping into my head, chief among them the impression that Spielberg, who had lavished so much effort on `Jaws', just wasn't trying.<br/><br/>The dinosaur mystique is hard for me to understand.  Sure, they're fantastic beasties, but so are many other extinct animals; and if I had a choice I'd rather pay to see a mammoth, or a giant wombat, or a tiny Eocene horse.  But PART of the dinosaur mystique is bound up with the idea of a lost world. That's what really thrills people about `King Kong'.  The island Spielberg's dinosaurs occupy, by contrast, is prosaic and modern.  No doubt it was a deliberate artistic decision to combine dinosaurs with cars, electric fences, cafés and air vents, but it's hard to find two consecutive shots that don't remind us of the modern world in some way, most of the charm of the creatures is thereby lost.  This is the more inexcusable in a film that throws everything else to the winds - story, character, wit, plausibility - to concentrate on the strangely attractive flavour of dinosaurs.<br/><br/>As for the dinosaurs ... Some time before `Jurassic Park' there was the Cambrian explosion, when all manner of special effects techniques proliferated; after `Jurassic Park' all, with the exception of computer animation, became extinct, or virtually extinct.  It's not the film's fault. Most of the dinosaurs on display did NOT originate in the belly of a computer; those that did look neither better nor worse than those that did not.  The computer animation is more than adequate but charmless, with something subtly but deeply wrong - exactly like all subsequent computer animation.  The art hasn't progressed.  `Jurassic Park' is still as good as it gets.<br/><br/>So far, so bland: what's intolerable is the preaching.  This was the only thing that irritated me in 1993 and it irritates me more now.  The moral of the story, with which we are repeatedly bludgeoned, is twofold: (a) people who think they don't like children are either mistaken or villains, in either case in need of therapy; and (b) man should not play God - any attempt to develop some biological science will strike us down, because of chaos theory, or quantum mechanics, or some such.  This is all piffle.  But it's not the ridiculous messages that annoys me: it's the fact that I'm being preached to AT ALL, and so clumsily.  (Did you, too, develop a desire to throttle Jeff Goldblum in mid-speech?  I hope so.)  `Jaws' didn't pretend that it was a statement about how we will be struck down by divine anger if we arrogantly disregard nature and go swimming at the beach."

","Ironically the people who made this film assumed the revolutionary CGI would serve as an attraction in and of itself (much like the dinosaurs exhibited in the park), and that the audience wouldn't care about the moronic plot, horribly bad dialogue, or total lack of logic.<br/><br/>I somewhat enjoyed this film as a child, but I saw it again yesterday, and frankly I stopped watching at about half the film's length. It was insufferable.<br/><br/>Apparently the moral of the story is that you can't control a zoo filled with dinosaurs. You can control a regular zoo filed with dangerous animals, but for some reason dinosaurs are tricky. What?! And just think about the premise of the film for a second: the man discovers a way to recreate DINOSAURS and his master plan is to charge tickets to a zoo where a handful of tourists can ride on a couple of jeeps around the island? That's the plan? How long would that park last? Within 24 hours the USA or some other government would invade the island, close it down, and hijack the entire staff along with the animals.<br/><br/>And what's with the security measures? An electric fence a dinosaur could tear apart in a second? Well, what if power goes down? You geniuses can clone a dinosaur, but you've never heard of power shortages? Of course, then come the moronic characters and those obnoxious children. Can anyone even stand children in movies any more? I can't.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, it's a fairly entertaining film - during the action bits, but the characters, the dialogue, and the plot are just terrible."

","Of course they were going to make a movie based one this book, and of course Steven Spielberg, the king of the box office, was going to direct it. It did happen and the result is a spectacular vision of what dinosaurs really might have looked like when they lived on Earth. Of course, with Spielberg at the helm and ILM doing the special effects, everything here looks stunning, even by today's standards. The action sequences are very well-shot and the suspense hangs over us for the better part of the second half of the movie. The biggest flaw here is the human characters. They aren't developed nearly as much as they should be and only the Jeff Goldblum character is interesting at all. Still, we really aren't supposed to get close to these characters, just sit back and watch dinosaurs try to kill them. For film nerds, there is plenty to dissect and critique. For the average movie lover, this is simply a well-made thrill ride.. with dinosaurs."

","I was 9 years old when Jurassic Park came out in theaters and I looked forward to seeing it for months. I read the novel, I bought the toys and trading cards, and asked my parents every single day what day we were going to see it. Sunday of opening weekend, we drove to our nearest theater to see it. Sold out, we drove up Wisconsin Ave. in Washington, DC until we reached a multiplex in Bethesda, Maryland that was showing it on half of its 10 screens. My dad parked on the side of the road and ran into the theater, came back out with tickets that were starting in five minutes. We parked in the garage and I ran into that theater just as the previews were starting in a dark, packed theater. <br/><br/>For the next two hours I was transfixed, terrified, and entertained. As soon as it was over, I wanted to see it again. At nine years old, it's hard to make your parents take you to see a movie for a second time, but somehow I did talk them into it, and then late in the summer I was able to see it a third time for a friend's birthday. <br/><br/>As soon as it came out on VHS, I bought it and watched it every single day for a good year. <br/><br/>Flash forward twenty years later during the 3d re-release and I had a day off in the middle of the week. My wonderful wife talked me into going to see it in IMAX 3-D by myself in the middle of the day and as the movie started I was so thankful to have agreed. I was nine years old again in that dark theater all by myself on a tuesday at 12:00. The opening credits shook the theater just like the THX sound did back in '93. The T-Rex was awe-inspiring and terrifying, the Raptors had me jumping in my seat. <br/><br/>This is what the magic of movies is all about and why going into a dark room to watch a story that could never actually happen on a big screen is my favorite thing to do."

"DesertDogMedia","8","3","5","2 August 2014"," Jurassic Park
","Title: Jurassic Park<br/><br/>Condensed Storyline: A man has found a way to bring back dinosaurs, and puts them in a park. But things go wrong and our group of scientists have to escape the island filled with dinosaurs <br/><br/>Notable Acting: I wasn't sold on the actors, I found most of them boring or unbearable. The child actors annoyed me and made me want the raptors to find them in the kitchen scene. Ellie felt like the typical ""hot nerd"" character, useless to all extents but smart and attractive to watch. I did like the chemistry between Sam Neill's and Jeff Goldlbum's characters how they were both trying to show themselves as the bigger man and impress Ellie. I liked Samuel L. Jackson's and BD Wong's secondary characters, shame we didn't get to see much more of them. Chances are Bob Peck will only be remember for the ""Clever Girl"" meme. <br/><br/>Noticeable Camera work: Birds eye shot of the group of paleontologists trying to unearth a fossil. Worms eye shot climbing the electric fence. This movie is lacking of creative shots <br/><br/>Graphics: The CGI in this movie was breath taking for the time when the movie came out 90s, they were able to blend it with the animatronics amazingly well. <br/><br/>Incorrect Science: The names on the embryo freezing chamber are wrong in two sections, Tyrannosaurus Rex and Stegosaurus are misspelled. Raptors did not use their claws to eviscerate, their claws were not strong enough for that, this is why they would go for the throat. There have be experiments about this. Most of the characters address the dinosaurs as ""he"" when it was clearly stated that they were all female. Timmy shouldn't have gotten hurt by the electric fence as he isn't grounded, so he is basically a bird on a power line at this point. DNA degrades after 521 years un-persevered and 1000 years if frozen, so this whole movie just went down the plot hole. Dr Grant throws a branch at the fence to test if it is live or not, wood is an insulator and throwing it would make it not grounded. None of the heavy hitting dinosaurs in this movie are from the Jurassic era, they are from the Cretaceous era, so the movie shouldn't be called 'Jurassic Park', it should be called 'Cretaceous Park' but there are Brachiosaurus and Dilophosaurus which are both from the Jurassic era. The velociraptors in this movie are incorrect as velociraptors are only knee hight on a 6 foot person, the raptors in this movie are Deinonychus raptors which are generally 5 foot or so in hight. They may have gotten the dinosaur DNA from the blood in the amber, but that doesn't explain how they were able to bring back extinct plants that Dr Sattler was holding. Remember the first time the T-rex was on screen? It made the water shake with it's footsteps, you never see any of that in the final scene where is saves the group from the raptors. It would also make T-rex a failed predator if its prey could hear it miles away. Brachiosaurs are too heavy to stand on one set of legs. Gum Tree leaves are also known as eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to almost every animal. Reptiles do not and cannot sneeze, that is purely a mammal action. DNA mixing does not work like it did in the movie, frog DNA is a bad choice, so would any amphibian DNA. Why not use avian DNA? Seeing as dinosaurs evolved into birds, it would make sense.<br/><br/>Overall Feel: This movie ""apparently"" inspired a generation of paleontologists. I can see how this would work and any movie which inspires a generation of people to take up a field of science is OK in my book. I have already mentioned how this movie doesn't know all that much about DNA, dinosaurs or paleontology in general, but I must admit that their effects are so good that you forget about all of its faults for the time being. The acting was meh and the camera work was mediocre."

","The visualization is practically perfect, even 20 years later. It's because the CGI here is used in a discreet, moderate fashion and to give credibility to a fantasy, not to show you bullettime shots of the dinosaurs pores. Beyond doubt, it's visually fascinating, but Mr. Spielberg wisely remembers to use characters and performances to get you trough the plot, one that is based on ideas, research and fantasy. Thank you too Mr. Criton. Also perfection and imagination in detail seems natural for the director. A merely flawless piece.<br/><br/>But Jurassic Park is not just good because the applied technology was revolutionary at the time, it's good because it serves an otherwise superbly crafted movie full of technical finesse. Spileberg shows, how to be not just ahead, but beyond your time. Not that technology did not advanced in the last two decades, but it's users generally degenerated and stupefy technological advancement to circus level and regarding the correct use of cgi in cinema Jurassic Park has yet to be matched."

","Grade: A I don't know how people can possibly review this movie negatively. It's a ground breaking experience for its time, a time when most films were still struggling to break the limitations set by technology. And yet in 1993 (1992 in places like Japan) comes this marvel, and surely anyone would be stunned.<br/><br/>I saw it around seven or eight and every kid that age is fascinated by dinosaurs. Aren't we all? To see them brought to life so realistically was astounding. My favorite scene in the film, if not film history is the T-Rex's emergence. Spielberg directs as he always does, making it seem so real. This was due to the aid of Michael Crichton, the original author. Now I've read the book and trust me the actual novel is a bit more graphic. The characters are not as plain as some have claimed. I believe more than good enough.<br/><br/>Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are excellent, and who doesn't love Laura Dern in some booty shorts (lolz)? Hammond is played by Richard Attenborough, a good choice. The drama is riveting and there is definitely a theme at work: it is not the role of man to play God, because when they do, ""nature finds an away."" The action is fueled by pure adrenaline and beauty at times, but most common is sheer terror, as in the famous kitchen scene. It has an edge that will have you biting your nails every time. Gotta love the Velociraptor screech; it's just so alien, you know? And during all of this is John Williams, including that unforgettable theme. Unless you are a loser and don't remember it<br/><br/>And so, haters back off and regard this film as the classic it is. Give the cast credit, even though none can deny the real stars were never really there (or from time to time represented by animatronics robots). They created all the wonder and fascination for the big screen and I state that this is one of Spielberg's greatness."

","Steven Spielberg is a director that tends to do films that have something groundbreaking. For instance, Jaws became the scariest film of all time. Not only cause the film is realistic and horrifying as it is, but because people still think about it when they go in the water today. Hell, I do. <br/><br/>Jurassic Park was a groundbreaking film do to it's spectacular special effects. At the time, they were like nothing anyone had ever seen before. And it won the best visual effects award. It deserved it. Now days, Spielberg could remake Jurassic park and use the same special effects, but make them better. But Spielberg knows that what he did was art, and he wouldn't bother with it again.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is based on the Michael Crichton novel about a group of explorers who go to a new theme park for a preview and everything goes wrong when it breaks down and all of the cloned dinosaurs run free around the island.<br/><br/>In both Jurassic Park films that Spielberg did, he has one scene in both that I find disturbing. In the first one, it's Wayne Knight's death scene. Every time I see it that part always creeps me out. Jurassic Park really works cause of it's spectacular special effects. Spielberg is a genius no matter what. It's a shame he doesn't do as much nowadays. He's done so many classics. I want to see more from him.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park: A"
"TheUnknown837-1","10","3","5","27 September 2009"," a spectacular combination of terror and majesty
","One of my favorite movies from the time I was growing up in the 90s was Steven Spielberg's 1993 box office hit ""Jurassic Park"", which to this present day, is still one of the most popular science-fiction movies of all time. When I was obsessed with the film as a child, I loved it mostly because of the dinosaurs. Looking back on the movie as an adult, I think I like it even more than I did before because now I see the realism that Spielberg was challenging his special effects wizards to create and I'm not talking strictly about how convincing the CGI and animatronic animals are.<br/><br/>""Jurassic Park"" is based on a Michael Crichton techno-thriller of the same name, one of my favorite books. As in the book, scientists are invited to inspect and become the first visitors to a wealthy entrepreneur's island resort, where he is exhibiting exotic animals. Upon arriving at the island, the scientists and skeptics soon discover that the park is populated with genetically engineered dinosaurs separated from the visitors by electric fences. When the park loses power and the dinosaurs break free, the scientists soon find themselves running from the creatures they've been studying, but all the while awing the majesty of these fabulous animals.<br/><br/>In my introduction, I said the primary reason why I admire ""Jurassic Park"" so much now is because of the way Spielberg portrayed the dinosaurs. And again, I'm not congratulating the team just because the dinosaurs look realistic. Realistic special effects are a package order in Hollywood. The team was challenged at the time, but they were destined to succeed. No, what I am talking about is the way the dinosaurs are represented. In previous dinosaurs movies, dinosaurs were either scary or awesome, but never both. They were either objects of terror or monoliths of majesty. Here, Spielberg decided to work the same magic he had done with the aliens in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977) and make the dinosaurs behave not as characters in a monster picture, but as real animals. One of the opening shots displays the dinosaurs in full-view in broad daylight and the characters as well as the audience are overwhelmed by the sense of awe and majesty and wonder that would be so natural if dinosaurs really did walk the earth again. And even the carnivorous dinosaurs have their own sense of awe, finding ways to scare the audience as well as amaze them.<br/><br/>And that, I think, is the real power of the first ""Jurassic Park"" film. In the two sequels, the dinosaurs were degenerated down into playing the standard monsters on the loose and the sense of majesty was more or less swept away. But the first film stands out not only as a breakthrough in special effects, but because it shows Spielberg utilizing the two techniques on the audience that made him a revolutionary and significant filmmaker: thrills and awe. And ""Jurassic Park"" has a terrific blend of both."

","I've seen several depictions of dinosaurs since Jurassic Park. None of them come close.<br/><br/>There's a funny story that comes with JP's theater release. When was a kid, I was so freaked out and excited for this movie. I was supposed to fly out to Hawaii for a 2-week long vacation on the day of it's release. Well, to make long story short: I've yet to go to Hawaii.<br/><br/>I stayed and saw JP on opening day. It was worth it.<br/><br/>The animatronics coupled with the eye-popping CG is still a standard-setter, even compared to more recent movies.<br/><br/>The T-Rex is as big and scary as King Kong upon first glance. I had the opportunity to see some of the animatronics behind some of the dinosaurs when I visited Universal Studios. There was a lot of work that went into bringing these creatures to life, and I'm glad this movie still receives the recognition for it's technical brilliance.<br/><br/>That aside, The story and characters are great. Jeff Goldblum is a hoot. Sam Neil is one of the most underrated actors of all time. Laura Dern is appropriately casted.<br/><br/>There's a scene where the Raptor pen keeper (who has majesticly muscular legs might I add) tells her to 'run as fast as you can' on a hunch that raptors are nearby. Her sheer terror mixed with some fast string-age from John Williams... for some reason this always comes to mind when thinking about this movie. The intensity is enough to make your pulse quicken, especially if you are as sensitive to being as immersed in movies as I.<br/><br/>This is a movie for anybody. It's a good reminder that we're very fortunate that dinosaurs are gone - and we are here.<br/><br/>Yeah, I'd love to see JP4 be as quality as the first. I'd like to see some animatronic puppetry once-again in film.

I was 8 or 9 when i saw this movie."
"AdderCowley","9","3","5","4 July 2009"," A groundbreaking classic film adaptation
","Jurassic Park was a pioneering film in a number of ways. Firstly it showed that computer technology was the future of film making, secondly that dinosaurs were not the monsters we perceived them to be and finally that a film can be successfully adapted from a book. Jurassic Park accomplishes these things and more.<br/><br/>I was amazed when I first heard this film was originally adapted from a novel. Indeed Jurassic Park is a classic piece of sci-fi fiction, written by respected author Michael Crichton. The book documents man's relationship with nature and his struggle to control it for financial gain.<br/><br/>The film itself does follow along this route but deviates for the mainstream audience. Primarily this is a suspenseful thrill-ride rather than a philosophical piece about man's desire to harness the power of nature. There are some parts of the film that explore these ideas but nowhere near the intensity of the book.<br/><br/>The movie is quite dissimilar to the book. The characters for example are almost completely different. Alan Grant for example likes children in the book but hates them in the film. Hammond is far more egotistical and manic in the book while characters such as Arnold, Gennaro and Wu barely feature in the movie. Not really a criticism but if for some reason you've never seen the film but read the book then the film doesn't follow the plot to the letter.<br/><br/>What really stands out however in this film is not the people but the dinosaurs themselves. For the first time the dinosaurs are perceived as mere animals rather than monsters. Even the predators, the ""villains"" of the film, are forgiven for only ""doing what they got to do"". In that respect the dinosaurs do get a lot of notice in this film.<br/><br/>Furthermore Jurassic Park introduces two of the biggest characters in ""monster-movie"" history. The T-Rex and the Velociraptor. Through the great power and size of the T-Rex and the evil, calculating persona of the raptors we find some of the most memorable characters from the ""monster"" genre and also some of my earliest memories of fear.<br/><br/>Certainly the kitchen scene and to a lesser extent the T-Rex attack scene are two of the most atmospheric and suspenseful scenes from that time. The kitchen scene in particular is a classic.<br/><br/>However Jurassic Park is not just a film that re-introduced the public to dinosaurs, it is also is one of the first movies that pioneered CGI on the screen. For the first time a film was shot with CGI being a major part in the make up rather than just being a shiny extra. This means that Jurassic Park was an pivotal moment in film history and one of the most important film from the 90s. Certainly from a technological point of view.<br/><br/>However this is not just a film that relies on technology to pass it by. It does have heart. Spielberg does put emotion into the movie. The scene with the Brachiosaur and the landscape with the herbivores is a beautiful piece of cinema. So to is the music which helps ratchet up the tension but appropriately creates a sense of melancholy and reflection when needed. Combined with the CGI this gives the film excellent production values and really hammers the idea home that these are sentient creatures not Godzilla like monsters.<br/><br/>So in conclusion Jurassic Park, while being a simple monster film on the surface, is so much more at heart. It is a film that helped pave the way for CGI, gave audiences some of the most memorable pieces of cinema in history, while making the excellent novel palatable on the big screen. A groundbreaking classic."

The movie teems with magical movie moments that just dazzle the screen, such as the magical scene with the brachiasaurus, the first dinosaur ""seen"" in the movie. The effects are amazing as stated earlier, so great, that Jack Horner tells people to see Jurassic Park to see real dinosaurs, not museums. That explains that even scientists are astounded.

"J5iftY5iveXtreme","9","3","5","7 June 2009"," Revolutionary. Still one my favorites.
","Imagine witnessing one of humanity's biggest dreams -- seeing creatures long gone walk this earth again. Imagine dinosaurs and man side-by-side. And all this is made possible through the miracles of science. That's what happened in Michael Crichton's ""Jurassic Park,"" where dinosaurs are genetically recreated from ancient DNA, to be put on display in a theme park, and people are invited to be the first visitors -- all for a terrible price.<br/><br/>In this 1993 adaptation of the bestselling novel, the terrible lizards are indeed brought to life -- using the latest state-of-the-art movie-making magic. This is the film that really revolutionized the use of the special effects we use today, most notably, CGI. Before 1993, CGI made been put to use in a few films, but it is this film that made it the norm for special effects. Computer generated figures when far away, and animatronics when close-by, dinosaurs once again roam the earth, looking as real as ever. This is a special effects technique that has been used, and abused, ever since. But the dinosaurs in this film, even today, still look fabulously -- and scarily -- real.<br/><br/>This film was fortunate that have ILM working on it -- the very team that made a name making the ground-breaking effects for ""Star Wars,"" and ""Jurassic Park"" is another on of their triumphs. Helming this film is none other Steven Spielberg, who already had several big films -- ""Close Encounters,"" ""Jaws,"" ""ET"" -- on his resume, and this film was destined to ranked among his most famous films. Adding to this is the wonderful score by John Williams, no stranger to Spielberg films.<br/><br/>This movie has many things moviegoers crave for. It's got intense, pulse-pounding action. It's a got a great adventure. It's got entertaining one-liners, and likable characters. To top it all are the innovative special effects. And there is the ""Frankenstein"" message of the power to create life, and the misuse of it. This movie is the ideal adventure flick, a real blockbuster.<br/><br/>""An adventure 65 million years in the making."" Indeed!"
"jerekra","10","3","5","9 April 2009"," Greatest Dinosaur Film Ever.
","Jurassic Park is the greatest dinosaur film I have ever seen. Its great effects, acting, and plot all lead to it being so awesome.<br/><br/>Using dna and genetics, dinosaurs are brought back to life. They are put into a giant park called Jurassic Park. The creator of this place calls in several people whom he hopes to convince that this is a good idea for a tour of the Park. However soon problems start to take place and dinosaurs start to make the people on the tour go extinct.<br/><br/>The story is awesome in this film. Using dna and old amber, I could really see this happening. I know that it really could not but it really does seem to make sense in a way. In the past dinosaurs in films always seemed to be hiding in a place far away from humans only to be discovered. But I like that this film has a new unique idea on how to bring dinosaurs back. Of all the ways to bring dinosaurs into a film I think this works good.<br/><br/>The characters and acting in this film are great as well. Sam Neil is great as the paleontologist Grant, one of the best performances by an actor that I have seen and also one of the most under rated performances of all time. Laura Dern is really good as Dr. Sattler. Also I loved Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm, another great character and performance. Goldblum is hilarious in this film. I will say that I think the two little kids in this film are really annoying, but then again I do not think I have ever seen a film where I liked every character.<br/><br/>As good as the people in this film are, the dinosaurs are just as good. They look great, as good as it gets. The Tyrannosaurus is great, has a loud echoing roar and walks without his tail dragging and rather using it for balance. The scene where it breaks out of the electric fence is legendary and really exciting. Easily the best dinosaur in movie history in my opinion.<br/><br/>The star dinosaur in this film though is the Velociraptor. For a long time in films the predatory dinosaur was always either the Tyrannosaurus or the Allosaurus, large predatory dinosaurs with power. But Velociraptor in this film instead depends on speed and intelligence as well as sharp teeth, claws, and working in groups. SO this film does great at giving a new predatory dinosaur to the viewing audience. Kind of cool how the smaller Velociraptor can be just as scary as the larger Tyrannosaurus.<br/><br/>Another thing I thought was cool was the Dilophosaurus. A really not well known dinosaur, but this film helps people to see it. Pretty interesting how it has a frill pop up from its neck and can spit venom.<br/><br/>There are tons of great scenes in this film. You will have to see most of them to understand how great they are. I do not want to spoil it for anyone.<br/><br/>The music is awesome as well.<br/><br/>SO this film has it all, great acting, plot, action, and most importantly Dinosaurs. There are no films I can recommend more to see than this film."

It is hard not to be thrilled by Jurassic Park's many death defying set pieces, but the film truly shines thanks to its characters and its director.<br/><br/>What makes Jurassic Park more than your average amusement park ride, is that the director, Steven Spielberg, knew that the film would need great characters in order for the audience to feel any sort of attachment to the film's story. This was a ploy in which he utilized so well in the past in Jaws, and he does here once again with Jurassic Park. The story of Alan Grant leading Tim and Lex through the dinosaur filled Jurassic Park would have not been as thrilling, or even as heartwarming, if Alan Grant was a fan of children. Still the characters on the page were not enough, they needed great actors to bring them to life, which Jurassic Park had; ranging from Sam Neil to Richard Attenborough. I mean could you imagine watching Jurassic Park without Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm. It's almost impossible isn't it.<br/><br/>Overall I think Jurassic Park is one of the most underrated films in movie history. The classic Spielberg magic is there, and in my opinion even more so than Jaws. What Spielberg did with Jurassic Park was give it an awe inspiring scale, but also he gave this film true heart. As a kid I thought this was one of the greatest films of all-time, and I still think the same today.<br/><br/>I give Jurassic Park a perfect 10 out of 10!"
"hansololover","10","3","5","8 December 2007"," Visual masterpiece, exciting adventure and pure brilliance!
","I first saw this movie when I was only five years old, and it awed me in ways that no film ever had before. Thirteen years later, I remain just as impressed and the film continues to be one of my favorites. What could have been just another cheesy dangerous-animals-run-amok flick was instead a suspense filled, exciting, scary movie that also carried the important theme of showing humility before nature and having a respect for living things, as well as what the consequences can be when you don't.<br/><br/>I won't go on and on about the brilliance of the special effects or how amazing the dinosaurs were, because there's not much disagreement about that. The T-Rex is one of the coolest things you will ever see, and the raptors are absolutely chilling in their intelligence and agility. Your heart will definitely pound if you've never seen it before. It'll probably pound if you have too.<br/><br/>I have seen some complaints about the script/characters/acting however, and disagree with them for the most part. There's a truly interesting array of characters in this film. Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler, a paleontologist and paleobotanist bring so much heart to this movie. The scene where they see the real live brachiasaurus for the first time after dedicating their lives to digging up fossils and making interpretations about their behavior blows me away every time. Their awe and academic excitement is very touching, and combined with John Williams' perfect score, this scene truly is my favorite.<br/><br/>The way Grant is unable to even stand up because of the shock is very endearing. And later on in the movie, after witnessing deaths due to these creatures, the change seen in Grant as he throws away the raptor claw he always kept with him is powerful. His relationship with the two children visiting the park develops in a sweet way as well as he goes from being highly annoyed by their presence to risking his life to protect them when no one else can.<br/><br/>In contrast to the paleontologists, Jeff Goldblum gives a great performance as Dr. Ian Malcolm, an arrogant, sarcastic and very amusing mathematician who studies Chaos Theory, and believes from the start that Jurassic Park is doomed to fail. He's highly opinionated, a little on the rude side and a blatant flirt but he brings a lot of life to the film and despite his quirks is the voice of reason.<br/><br/>John Hammond, the millionaire responsible for creating Jurassic Park also gives a fascinating performance. For those of you who've read the novel, he is a somewhat more sympathetic character than the money hungry Hammond of the book. He is definitely stubborn and infuriating as he refuses to see the horrible danger of what he's doing, but he is doing it with a kindness and desire to bring joy to people's lives, and displays an eventual humility that makes him likable.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is one of the most fun rides I've ever had with cinema, and even though I've probably seen it over 50 times, it never gets old. There are some truly hilarious lines and truly terrifying thrills and it's the kind of movie that anyone can enjoy, regardless of their age or interests. 10/10"
"grzak","10","3","5","25 November 2007"," Opinion
","Greatest Movie ever made!! Based off the book by Michael Crichton, and although a lot of the book was different then the movie, they we're equally as good! How Jurassic Park didn't make it in the top TEN best movies of all time just drives me crazy! The ride is also great, let me tell ya'! A must see for everyone, and a great read too! My Favorite scene is when Jeff goldblume gets out of his car with the flame to move the t~Rex away from the kids is my favorite. ""Ian Freeze!"" What a classic line. The cover alone for the movie is great, the cg is the best, and the music is so epic! The second movie wasn't bad either to be honest, although it wasn't anything like the book. The third one sucked, but the first one, was the best, i really hope they continue to make a fourth, it's rumored their bringing back the original cast, and Vince Vaughn, which would be awesome. I spend hours in Orlando in Jurassic Park, they should build a theme park, bigger then Disney world, Dino's behind cages, electronic of course, and like tons of rides, it would be awesome, if you've never seen this movie, put this computer down right now, and watch it!"

","Jurassic Park (based on novel by Michael Crichton) is a mind-blowing, fast-paced, thriller. You will scream when you see the dinosaurs that would have you for a meal, but then you will still be enlightened by seeing these beings. This movie makes you wonder wonder what would really happen if we could clone dinosaurs today. For a movie coming from 1993, the dinosaurs look amazing. The story starts with Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler at a dig site. They are soon visited by an older man named John Hammond who tells them he has something amazing to show them. The two paleontologists accompanied by Dr. Ian Malcolm, a lawyer, Mr. Hammonds grandchildren (Lex and Tim) travel throw the marvels within Jurassic Park. Soon disaster strikes and has them struggling for their lives. It might be different from the book, but it still is must see film."

","The summer of 1993 was a summer of change for me, there was a lot going on in my life. Yet, amongst the hubbub of moving house and country, starting a new school and moving house again, I began to see more and more ads for a film called Jurassic Park. I slowly built up a picture of what it was about and, by May 1993, was convinced that I had to see it. The whole premise of the film and the pictures from the production of it captured my 13 year old imagination hook, line and sinker.<br/><br/>It wasn't until a good 3 weeks after it first showed in UK cinemas that I got to see it. <br/><br/>And, it was worth the wait. The effects were mind blowing. The Dinos were so realistic it was hard to tell the difference between real and computer generated. Even today, the same still holds true.<br/><br/>The musical score is one of the best I have ever heard. Even today, a full 14 years after I first heard it, the music still inspires me to watch the movie, each time I hear it. <br/><br/>OK, so the acting can be questioned. But the actors and their performance are, in my opinion, secondary in this movie. The real stars are the Dinos and boy... they gave a perfect performance.<br/><br/>This is a movie I am glad to have been around for to see on the big screen because (as with just about every film) the film looses a little of its presence and magic on the TV at home.<br/><br/>A highly recommended movie for anyone who has not seen it yet. And, in my opinion, one of those movies you just have to see before you die."
"vip_ebriega","10","3","5","24 May 2007"," 'Indiana Jones' and 'Jaws' in one exciting, dino-sized bundle of fun.
","Review summary: An instant contemporary thrill classic. <br/><br/>I have seen many Dinosaur movies in my life, mostly in my childhood. Okay, so I'm pretty much a suck-up for Dino films when I was younger, but none of these and more can diminish the charm of ""Jurassic Park"". Despite the many films of this kind that I've seen, I couldn't stand to look away from this film. Why? Simple, it's my favorite. Sure, it's not the very best film of all time, mainly because it's one of the films that ushered the age of the famous (or to most, infamous) CGI. The very term ""visual marvel"" is defined when I first saw a Brachiosaurus grazing while its puny human watchers are befuddled with wonder. What follows still remains one of the most thrilling, most exciting adventures ever put on screen, perhaps Spielberg's own best adventure since RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. <br/><br/>But I don't just like this movie for the certain charm, or for the boasting CGI dinosaur effects that surpassed anything of its era, but it was really well-one movie in more ways the one. It has a talented direction by Spielberg that made him one of the best filmmakers of Hollywood. It was also unique and very interesting. Another thing would be John Williams superb score and fine performances from the cast. Come to think of it, the CGI and other gimmicks are just peppered to make the film even better (I have seen some screen test featuring the dinosaurs being in stop-motion, not in CGI). This is just some of the reasons why this stands out different from other Dino flicks (""Godzilla"" (1998) anyone?).<br/><br/>This is definitely not Spielberg's very best movie (for his dreams have come true with ""Schindler's List"" the following year, which swept the Oscars including ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Director""). But this is no doubt, one of the films he will be best remembered for. It may just be one of my favorite films of all time. Forget the fact that this isn't a movie about human characters or deeper plotting. See it for the still-stunning dinosaur effects and heart-pounding thrill-a-minute situations and find your satisfaction to see a monster movie of A-list caliber. It's the best dinosaur flick ever (like there are any other films that fit the category). <br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."
"dcldan","10","3","5","7 April 2007"," A masterpiece
","In 1993, a film shocked everyone, it was Jurassic Park, with an unseen Special Effects and a catching adventures history, it surprised everyone. John Hammond is a rich man that has fulfilled his dream: to clone dinosaurs and make a tourist Park for them. In order to prove that it is safe, he invites a bunch of scientific: Drs Malcolm, Grant, Elle. But as they are in the middle of the visit, nature finds its way and the dinosaurs will escape and for humans a race for live will start. The movie is quite enjoyable, the characters are very charismatic and they catch you from the beginning. As usual in Spielberg's movie, action does not come early, but it is perfectly filmed and it keeps you thrilling about when things are going to happen. Special effects are superb, too. years have passed since the film was made and they are still impressive. They seem totally realistic and they are perfect for the movie. This is one of these films that proves why Spielberg is one of the greatest, as this is perhaps his best movie. To sum up, this is a movie that everyone should watch. A wonderful masterpiece for whom time does not pass."

","this movie is so incredible. it is one of the best out there. for sure in my top 5. the effects were astounding even to todays standards. some of the effects and graphics are better then a lot of movies out there today. Steven Spielberg made magic while directing this. anything less than stupendous is an understatement of the dinosaurs that Stan Winston and his crew made.if you have any interest in awesome effects, dinosaurs, awesome acting, and an astounding soundtrack you have to see this. The only thing that disappointed me was that it was not completely like the book. If I ever become a director(which would be sweet)i might remake this and make it exactly like the book. not sure if i could though. this movie is just so awesome. it might even be wrong to do a remake of this movie. its just so much of a classic. but then again, look at King Kong, also a great movie, the remake is better than the original. So to conclude if you have any taste in movies you will watch this. i bet you you will even watch this many times over like i have. and if you have not seen this movie yet, it has been out for 14 years. no offense but get with the times and watch this great groundbreaking movie. my only regret is that i didn't get to see this in the movie theaters."

","How can't people love this movie? I saw it when it came to the theater in 1994, begging my mom to please take me to the theater to see the movie and she did. And during the movie I was just staring at the screen in amazement. So many dinosaurs and believed they were real, cause I didn't know much about computers too:)<br/><br/>After seeing the movie I was falling in love with dinosaurs. I bought a Jurassic Park movie gallery book, cards, and even a bed sheet. I just thought the movie was so real and believed that the dinosaurs were alive.<br/><br/>Even though I don't think that anymore, Jurassic Park is still my fave movie of all time. Idon't understand why people doesn't appreciate it so much as they did at that time, maybe 'cause the audience just has grown up and just think it's childish.<br/><br/>I don't know. I'm 23 years old now and I love the movie just as much now cause the plot is great and the actors are funny and coming so well together and there's something always happening.<br/><br/>What I love about the movie is all the sarcasm I didn't get when I saw it for the first time and my fave scene in the movie is the two kids in the kitchen getting chased by the two dinosaurs. (don't remember what kind of dinosaurs). <br/><br/>No movie can compare to this one by its original plot and magical effects. Who doesn't think the dinosaurs are real when they see the movie, no matter what age?"

","When Jurassic Park came out in 1993, I think I was about 9 or 10 and I had seen a few mildly intense films and since I was such a dino nut as a kid I thought it would be. Good Lord was I wrong I don't think it was visual aspect of the film that scared me, I had seen dinosaur bones and paintings of them all the time, it was the incredible sound of the film, the screams were loud, the animal noises were vicious, feral and sometimes gentle, you could hear flesh being and glass and it made you feel like you were there, thus was at my mother's side the whole time sweating and whimper a little in her arms, not one of my proudest moments but hey I was a kid :) As I got older and watched a few more times I realized just how wonderful this film really is, a visual masterpiece with superb acting, Jurassic Park will remain one of those films that continue scaring and amazing audiences for years to come"

","I can't think of any dinosaur movie that can compare. Growing up with this movie, I can definitely remember the reaction to this movie made by the students of my school. Jurassic Park sprouted a deeper fascination of dinosaurs and prehistoric animals in general, which continues to this day. The only way that a dinosaur movie could compare with Jurassic Park is with our evolving modern technology of special effects. The Lost World was a good enough sequel to Jurassic Park and I imagine would have been hard to maintain the standards of Jurassic Park. However, Jurassic park 3 which was not directed by Steven Spielberg was a complete 'flop'. I hope that Jurassic Park 4 which I am hearing rumours about will redeem the Jurassic Park concept and creators.Other than that, bringing the concept of such a theme park to the big screen is super-sensational, and should be enough to deem Jurassic Park a modern-day classic."
"Hitchcoc","9","3","5","24 February 2006"," One of Those Moments
","There are a handful of movies that absolutely grab a person. The case I had on jury duty had been settled out of court and so I had an afternoon to see a movie. This is the one. I had anticipated it for so long and was ready for the disappointment that usually follows. It didn't happen. From the moment that Richard Attenborough says, ""Welcome to Jurassic Park,"" I was hooked. And when the Brachiosaurs come lumbering across the grassy park, I was stunned. I know that since that time, computer generated special effects have become regular fair, but this was amazing. The other part of it, however, is that this a masterful story with a great deal of complexity (chaos theory, etc.). The people are interesting; the villain foolish and in over his head. Then there is wonderful set up of a park that is foolproof, suddenly losing its security. I don't normally like child actors, but the two in this express the terror that they indeed should. Some films hammer one with so many images; this one still relies on the greatest method of scaring people. It's not what you see; it's what you don't see. It's what's lurking in the bushes. The other thing is that the characters are on the playing field of their adversaries. Kowledgeable as they are, they are not in their own world. Those veloceraptors are a nice touch. As I was growing up, enamored with dinosaurs like most kids, I had never even heard of these creatures. Granted some of the threat is orchestrated, the scene in the kitchen is as frightening as anything I've ever seen"
"psu_guy521","10","3","5","7 August 2005"," Spielberg and the Film That Changed Cinema Forever
","Twelve years ago at the age of four, my uncle offered to take me to see Jurassic Park in theaters. My mom thought I'd be too scared, so I didn't go. Today though I own the film and have watched it multiple times not only for its gritty action and great suspense, but to analyze a film that successfully broke the rules and paved the way for all later cinematic big budget box office movies to follow.<br/><br/>The opening scene in the movie is very well done, foreshadowing the horror that would later be the plot of the film. However the movie truly doesn't start until after the main characters arrive to the island in a helicopter, while trumpets blast part of John Williams theme from the movie. The filming is simple, but the effect is great in preparing people for a heart pounding thrill ride through human imagination.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie there is great action. The suspense is gripping. In the movie, the dinosaurs are intelligent antagonists (or protagonists depending on the character's point of view) that can be gentle and yet many times deadly and terrifying. Spielberg created so many memorable scenes in the movie using different settings, dinosaurs, and action.<br/><br/>Should this movie have had any Oscar nominations for best acting? No, the acting in this movie was good, but not anything revolutionary. However, everyone stayed in character well. Sam Neill was good as the serious Dr. Grant, and was pretty serious the entire movie. Laura Dern's acting as Dr. Sattler was probably one of the weaker performances. Richard Attenborough as John Hammond shined in some areas and in other areas was stale. The best performance had to go to Jeff Goldblum for playing Dr. Ian Malcolm. He is very energetic and humorous, thanks to the many one-liners and unique situations his character was given.<br/><br/>Captivating is the only way to describe the scenery and sets in the movie. Everything is done in a large scale manner and is just so believable. Also, the music in the movie is a triumph. The score was one of John Williams best.<br/><br/>What made this movie a ground breaking achievement however? Originally the movie was suppose to use all mechanical dinosaurs and miniatures.. However, that changed one day when Spielberg made a visit to ILM, which showed him a computer generated dinosaur. All the miniatures were replaced. The result was something people had never seen before. ILM put on the big screen images that were made by computers. Not all of the scenes using computer were great and sometimes they looked fake, but yet other times it was impossible to judge what was computer and what was real. The CGI in the movie, twelve years later, is still considered some of the best in any movie. With a blend of mechanical dinosaurs and CGI, the visual effects were something that took the world by surprise and blew audiences out of the water.<br/><br/>All in all, Jurassic Park is a working piece of art and a cinematic achievement. It is also one of Spielberg's many all time great movies. The CGI craze started with Jurassic Park and has now taken big budgeted movies by storm. In decades to come, Jurassic Park, unlike dinosaurs, will not die out as just another film.<br/><br/>Oh and to sum this all up, this movie deserves much more than a 7.4 here."
"acevang40us","10","3","5","3 August 2005"," Bestest Dinosaur movie film ever watch!!!
","This movie was the best dinosaur movie I watched. All dinosaur was good looking and most of all the Tyannosaurus Rex. Tyrannosaurus Rex eat the lawyer who job is to do about this park, it all started, when John Hamond creating dinosaur, I never read the book, it goes the same way. Dennis Nerdy set the dinosaur free, one part I like is when the Tyrannosaurus Rex give chase to Ian Malcom, Elite Slater and that one guy, who is doing the driving, it shows the Tyrannosaurus Rex's speed, one thing for sure, the Tyrannosaurus Rex could catch up and eat the one closed to him. There is a mistake in this screen, if the Tyrannosaurus Rex has catch-up to the Jeep, instead of roaring to the mirror, it should snatch Iam Malcom off the Jeep, but at the end, the Tyrannosaurus Rex stop, I think the Tyrannosaurus Rex never gives up, unless he was very tired of chasing them. The end part of the movie, I like it too, the Tyrannosaurus Rex stop the Raptor, but this is the mistake, instead of smell or smoothing or trying to strip some flesh of the Raptor would it just chew a little while swallowing the whole body. Anyway this movie is fun and educational, but mostly educational."

Now, I was only seven when I saw it for the first time, on opening night, in 1992. Imagine yourself as a seven year old boy, not quite yet able to distinguish fantasy from reality, and suddenly you're thrust into a world like this, one where DINOSAURS are walking, moving, living all around you. It's about as fantasy-making a film as they come. I honestly feel bad for anyone who couldn't just totally lose themselves to this experience (ie, anyone older than 13 when they first saw it).

People say that Lord of the Rings is the defining movie of our generation, (and which it is), but I would say that the ultimate film would have to be Jurrasic Park. Uptill 1993 and the creation of this movie, they were still using puppets and clay models instead of high-tech CGI. Imagine if JP was created with clay models!

"malkane316","10","3","5","14 February 2005"," Quick Reviews!!
","Breathtaking effects which brought tears to my eyes (and to the eyes of many palaeontologists too), excellent set pieces, action and stunts, non-stop fun in the typical Spielberg fashion, a brilliant score, good acting all round, many iconic images, and a good story make Jurassic Park one of the most exciting films of all time. Revolutionary because of the effects, many of which look light years better than those of today, the film is not just a typical summer blockbuster with effects overload, but a good story for all the family.<br/><br/>For years Dr Hammond has been trying to make his dream come true- to bring back the most awesome creatures that have ever walked the earth- dinosaurs. Extinct for millions of years until now, when science has enabled us to bring back that which was once thought to be lost forever. The creatures of course cannot be trained and are extremely dangerous, but they are kept in check by the fact that only females are bred. Hammond is successful, and his idea to create a zoo for the animals needs recommendations. He invites Dr Alan and Dr Ellie, 2 dinosaur experts, and Jeff Goldblum part philosopher part scientist part comedian. His young nephew and niece also come along, as well as the man who will be financing the park. Hammond shows them how he created them, leading to debates on morality etc but what everyone really wants is a trip around the park. So they go. Of course, things soon go wrong when Dennis, a man working for Hammond decides to turn off the security. He is attempting to steal samples for the black market. Soon the dinosaurs are loose, and the group is fighting for their lives.<br/><br/>Each character is brilliantly drawn, and well acted. As many have said, the effects are awesome, and look completely real. Only a few parts look dated now. CGI looks like the future here, along with T2, but has since went downhill. As a child i always had a fascination with dinosaurs, still do, and it has always been a dream to see them in the flesh. As that is unlikely, this is the closest any of us will get. The variety of creatures is good, and they all seem like they did in our imaginations. The action flows fluidly once it starts, and there are many jumpy moments. The first T-Rex attack has become part of our culture, but the tree descent, Raptor kitchen and chase are all equally spectacular and get your heart racing. Spielberg gets the charm going by splitting the central group, meaning we get to see the relationships between Sam Neill and the kids growing, as well as the banter between Goldblum and Dern. The deaths, naturally are pretty gruesome, but hardly over the top, but some parents may find them too scary for kids. Not even Samuel L. Jackson is spared. Most of the smaller characters are killed as the dinosaurs rampage, but we can be certain our group will be OK. It's that they are so nail-bitingly close to having their nails, heads, legs etc bitten that make it exciting. This is what Spielberg is best at.<br/><br/>There is much depth in the film, many issues raised about cloning, right and wrong, nature etc, but these would bog down the film if they kept raising their heads. They are mentioned so they will be in our minds long after the excitement has finished, and when we are ready to talk about them. But i'll leave that to the smart people. What matters is that Spielberg has created another masterpiece, the monster movie he wanted to make years before with Jaws, but didn't have the budget or technology to do so. Make another one like this Spielberg, come one, we know you can.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."
"sketch_09","9","3","5","6 February 2005"," One of the most well crafted sci fi flicks in the history of cinema, and not just because of the special effects.
","A lot of people degrade this film my saying it has bad acting and a bad screenplay. I tell you what, it's far better than a lot of action adventures before and after it.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting and character development is good here, and is just about all we need from this kind of movie and should have been nothing more in my opinion. The kids aren't annoying, they actually play there parts very well, especially in the kitchen scene, and they don't overact, seeing as they just escaped death by been eaten alive more than a few times. Wouldn't you scream at least a bit if a giant 35 foot carnivorous reptile proceeded to eat it's way through your jeep, knowing your probably gonna die if someone doesn't do something about it from the outside, or if you had your foot a hair's width from the clapping jaws of an unrelentless man sized expert in ripping you limb from limb? I know i would. Plus a lot of people say that all the actors do is basically just scream and run all the time, which is so far from the truth it's docking with the Hubble telescope. Besides the kids, who are allowed to scream, there are only a couple or three at max screams from the title roles. And who wouldn't be running for there lives any way considering the circumstances. These actors portray their characters in a life like and honest manner. Alan Grant is quite conservative socially, hates kids but cares about them none the less. Ellie Satler is Grant's opposite, but shares the same love for kids more openly, and cares about the safety of everyone. Both her and Alan care a lot about their work and this park seemed to be a childhood dream come true, at first. Ian Malcolm is a sceptic, a lady's man, a little eccentric philosophically and loves kids, shown in quite a foolish stunt (the whole idea) in the T-Rex attack. Donald the lawyer is all about the money, a coward, likes to take the easy way out and not very good with kids at all. Finally John Hammond has a good heart, but is too obsessed with his own visions to let them go easily without jeopardising the former. These are characters! And i liked them and wasn't bored by the bits in between the dinosaur scenes because of it. Sure the dialogue is a bit simple at times, but it doesn't hurt the film or it's characters. In fact, it's all very authentic and down to earth, as apparent in the scenes inside the jeeps during the tour.<br/><br/>The story is also underrated. For one, do we really need anything over indulgent here. Jaws didn't. Alien sure as hell didn't. Both films rely on the bizarre circumstances that the characters are in to provide the interest. For Jaws, a rampaging shark that's on a killing spree, with a bunch of sailors out to sire it's death bed. For Alien, a cargo ship crew that docks with a lethal extra terrestrial that needs to be destroyed. There. Not so brain numbing is it. The same with JP. VIP entries to a one of a kind theme park strive for survival as dinosaurs try to rip them apart. I don't see what the huge deal is with dumping this film on it's story, when the others are sired as complete masterpieces not based on that same issue (they are masterpieces). It's all about how well the films are able to render their ""monsters"" in a believable fashion, and have them also scare the s*** out of ya at the same time. All the films deal with something that is unknown to a lot of people, but conveys them to the audience in a form that you could see them resembling if you imagined them yourselves.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park does this to great effect, and was the first dinosaur film to actually portray it's creatures as animals. This gives you a higher degree of respect for them, something that you'd give a bear or a lion. The film fully realises how dangerous these things are and presents them as a living breathing threat that demands respect. In the T-Rex scene when Sam Neil lights up a flare to distract the beast from the jeep is a tremendous example of how these's creatures are animals, not monsters, reacting only on basic survival instincts, in this case sight. This makes the intelligence of the raptors, therefore, far more intimidating and really sets in the feeling of terror when they're at work, knowing what they're capable of. But unlike the third JP film, this intelligence doesn't border on ridiculous. It's there as a survival and hunting tool, which keeps them believable as animals, no more than that as the third would have you believe. This nurtures that primal fear we all have of things that are out there that can kill you if they had the chance, only dinosaurs aren't out there, but that's what makes this film so masterful.<br/><br/>One of the main flaws with the two sequels was the fact that the dinosaurs were now becoming more like monsters than animals, and so the campy, silly factor drew in to make itself fully realised in the third film, which, while been a solid action film, is a joke compared to the original, having these majestic creatures made a mockery of.<br/><br/>This is my all time favourite film, and the first that got me into a cinema. Its still got the stuff today and no matter what people think, still has one of the best screenplays for a sci-fi movie."

","Jurassic park is one of those films that happens once a decade. It captures the imagination of the entire movie watching population. Even those uninterested in the subject matter will admit that this film ranks as one of, if not,THE greatest fantasy adventure films of all time. But what else would you expect from good old Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>John Hammond, an extravagant, wealthy dinosaur lover has discovered a way to clone Dinosaurs from small yields of DNA found in amber. He secretly breeds these dinosaurs on his privately owned island named Isla Nublar off the coast of Costa Rica. Hammond plans to open a theme park style tourist attraction to the world, but with investors showing concern at the parks progress, Hammond first invites a team of experts to the unfinished island in hope that they will give it there 'seal of approval'... Of course, when the guests arrive, all does not go to plan.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is incredible. The kind that gives you goosebumps every time you hear the theme tune. Characters are portrayed fantastically, and the action scenes, are of course, stunning. Having read the Michael Chriton novel, i was surprised how well Spielberg and his team, stayed true to the novel, whilst splicing it down to a mere two hours, and taking the gore level down to accommodate a younger audience as well.<br/><br/>The action sequences have to be seen to be believed. Everyones heard the talk of JURASSIC PARK opening a new door for CG but if you watch the film, you cannot help but agree. The famous T-Rex scene could not be done better today and that is the truth. Perfectly filmed and edited without a background score, the REX scene is one of the most tense, atmospheric and thrilling sequences in film history. <br/><br/>The score is superbly done by the mighty John Williams and Stan Winstons 'animatronics' are as good here, as in any film following. As i have mentioned the film has (which if honest, maybe its sequels lack) a superbly tense ora. Muldoons death by the stalking Raptor, where it hisses at him before striking gives a perfect indication of how vicious and frightening these animals must have been, and without using buckets of the red stuff. The same stands for Nedry's death, where the Dilophosaurus finishes him off behind the steamed windscreen. You don't need blood and gore to know that there's a violent and horrific death happening inside that jerking car.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is one of Spielbergs finest achievement and shouldn't be judged by its lesser sequels. If you haven't seen it, i couldn't recommend a better way to pass 2 hours, because if were honest, everyone loves Dinosaurs!<br/><br/>Its probably obvious that I'm a JP fan and it only follows suit that naturally i might be a bit biast, but, as a true film lover i've tried to be as objective and neutral as i can. This film IS special, and it always will be! (cue Rex roar)"
"je707","10","3","5","23 August 2004"," One of the Best movies of all time!
","Jurassic Park brought us back to the days, where it was fun to go to the movies. Seeing this movie for the first time really opened my eyes for what they could do with film. Jurassic Park, will never be out dated, and if you never saw it, see it!. Steven gives us another thrill, like that of Jaws. It has a great story, and it might have some mistakes in it. It showed us what we can do with CGI and it is one of the highest grossing movies of all time. So if you have not seen it, don't walk run to the store and buy it! Over all though I think Jurassic Park is a movie you will want to see again and again. I gave Jurassic Park a 10/10, it is a classic. The sequels might of not been that strong, but the first one is a must see!"
"dcobbimdb","10","3","5","25 August 2004"," Still beats every CGI movie out there today...
","I just watched this again in what seems like years  Honestly I have to say it's still great!  It has aged very well considering the dinosaurs still look very real and outdo today's CGI, which is extremely surprising given it's more than 10 years old.  When I did see it in the theaters, it blew me away and scared the poop out of me, and I was 19 years old.  The big question I have is how is it that the CGI was such a success in this film, especially being that it pioneered the CGI world???  It's almost as if they had the secret recipe and didn't give it out while other films since then have tried to duplicate the `real' effects using CGI, only to deliver something resembling an arcade game.  It's truly a shame we haven't advanced much beyond this level of `realness' with CGI.  You would think after 10 years of fine tuning it that we'd be seeing CGI actors in place of the real McCoy's and not be able to tell.  But yet we can't even get something like a guy in a spider suit or the Hulk to look real.  EITHER GET IT RIGHT, OR GIVE IT UP!!!<br/><br/>This was an incredible movie, a 10 out of 10, why it only got 7.5, I'll never understand.  However there's beauty and tragedy that came out of this movie.  The beauty is that it gave birth to a new era of movie making with CGI, and did it well I might add.  The tragedy is that since then every action director has thought that CGI is the only way to go.  And tragically, here we are today with huge budget movies like Spiderman, which look incredibly fake.  I guess directors figure it's better to give you the wide angle fake looking CGI action sequences rather than the close up puppet / animatronics shots (which looks real).  So after watching Jurassic park again years later, I was astonished by how well it looks today and just had to spill my guts about it.  Hat's off to Spielberg again!"

","""Jurassic Park"" was great. I watch it over and over. I believe it intensifies our imaginations. What if we could bring back something that's been gone for centuries? What if dinosaurs were alive today? The graphics were great. Everything was shown so vivid and yet left so much to the imagination. The actors did a wonderful job portraying their characters. Their emotions were very emotional and on cue. If I wasn't seeing it on the screen than I wouldn't know they were just acting. ""Jurassic Park"" sent all sorts of emotions my way. Scary, thrilling, awed, funny, and all around amazed. I give all involved with this movie a standing ovation. Everyone did their part and in doing so created a movie I could sit and watch everyday."
"ichabod81","10","3","5","2 June 2004"," An undeniable classic.
","I grew up watching Jurassic Park. But that's not the only reason I love this masterpiece. Like Star Wars and ID4, Jurassic Park was one of those films people went to see with their jaws dropped. They had really made these ancient creatures to come alive. Along with the likes of Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park is in every way one of the best adventure movies ever made.<br/><br/>And if the effects alone aren't enough to blow you away, Jurassic Park is also masterfully directed and acted. The script is funny, but at the same time filled with nail biting suspense. John Williams' score is so brilliant and beautiful that it at times almost brings tears to your eyes. There are just almost no words! The sequels to date also work to some extent (The Lost World clearly better than JP3), but in the end they're just simply inferior to the original.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is movie magic in it's purest form.<br/><br/>***** / *****"
"sebvalmont1983","10","3","5","25 November 2003"," an excellent movie
","When I went to see I was 10 and a mad dinosaur fan.  My mum came to see it with me and I have never seen anyone so scared in my life.  It was fascinating, breath-taking and awe-inspiring.  It has never-done-before effects which are now boring (like as if the scene in Matrix reloaded where Neo fights 100's of Agent Smith was actually life-like!).  Nowadays movies just don't have the same appeal.  Even JP3 is too perfect visually.<br/><br/>Amen to JP, Sam Neill and Steven Spielberg."
"PhilipJames1980","10","3","5","11 June 2003"," A great adaptation of the book, and a landmark film of the '90s.
","I watched Jurassic Park again recently (June 7, 2003) to reacquaint myself with it before writing a comment; and what I noticed especially upon my latest viewing of it, and what many people may often overlook, is how quickly (compared to the novel) the movie sets up its story and characters.<br/><br/>
The movie begins with a day on the job in Jurassic Park that goes very wrong, and the sequence is so gripping that I can't imagine anybody who after seeing it wouldn't want to keep watching to see what happens in the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>And the scenes that follow, introducing the Nedry and Hammond characters, are just perfect.  When Nedry says, ""Don't get cheap on me, Dodgson.  That was Hammond's mistake,"" we understand his motivation with that single line, while the Jurassic Park novel spends several pages explaining character motivations.<br/><br/>And Hammond's assurance throughout the movie that he ""spared no expense"" reveals all that the audience needs to know about his character. Obviously he thinks (as a rich man) that enough money can solve any problem; thanks to Attenborough's sly performance, Hammond's offer to fund Grant's dig reveals a man who uses his charm as a weapon and coldly calculates his words to get what he wants.<br/><br/>In brief, I think David Koepp's script for this movie is superb, considering the limitations of the source material.  No offense intended for Crichton fans (since I like him myself), but while his grasp of contemporary science and scientists is as good as any writer since Verne, his skill as a writer ranks somewhere between Reader's Digest and a cookbook.<br/><br/>The Crichton novel Jurassic Park is very entertaining, but it suffers from uneven pacing and long setup scenes; it also goes on too long and degenerates into sheer silliness by the end, with Muldoon blowing up a velociraptor with a rocket launcher (!), Grant killing velociraptors with poison eggs (!), and so on.<br/><br/>Mercifully, Koepp's script remains simple and low-key from start to finish, preserving the thrills and chills of the novel while eliminating its excessive (and excessively long and detailed) subplots.<br/><br/>Of course Spielberg was the ideal director for this movie: once the tyrannosaur breaks loose the movie never stops and becomes a true roller coaster in its final hour or so.  With John Williams' moving musical score backing him up, Spielberg also creates a genuine sense of wonder in this movie that few subsequent special-effects movies have been able to duplicate.  There is real magic in the scenes in which the park visitors encounter a brachiosaur, watch a velociraptor hatch and touch a triceratops. But with the promise of genetic engineering come the risks.<br/><br/>Again, Koepp's script deserves credit for subtly reflecting the problems with technology which ensure that something as complex as Jurassic Park could never really work.  Grant cannot touch a computer screen without causing a glitch in it; nor can he even buckle his seat-belt aboard the helicopter ride to the park, because the two halves of the buckle are mismatched.  If something as simple as a seat-belt can go wrong, what could go wrong in Jurassic Park?<br/><br/>The performances are almost uniformly good: I have already mentioned Attenborough, but the real standout is the late Bob Peck as an old-fashioned big-game hunter.  One of the movie's best moments occurs when Peck realizes that the velociraptors have escaped, and after removing his hat he looks off into the distance with a crazy expression on his face that is just priceless.  And his final line of dialogue is one of the movie's best.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson is worth mentioning because his role in this movie is his last significant pre-Pulp Fiction role, and also because his trademark line ""Hold on to your butts!"" is another of the movie's most memorable quotes.<br/><br/>
Oddly enough, the only weak member of the cast is the beautiful Laura Dern: one problem is that the script gives her little to do in the movie's second half besides scream and run from the dinosaurs; yet even in the scenes that give her something to say, her acting seems awkward and unconvincing. Since Spielberg managed to elicit decent acting from everyone else in the cast (even the kids!), I have to conclude that Dern was either miscast in the role or somehow failed to connect with her character.<br/><br/>Even the silliest sequence in the movie, the tour-ride film featuring ""Mr. DNA,"" works because it explains in a minute or two how the park was achieved, whereas the book required pages and pages to explain the technology.  I also believe that if Jurassic Park did exist, the commercial nature of the project would inspire a cheesy Disney World-type orientation for the tourists.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park was the big summer movie of 1993 (I went to see it three times), and was briefly history's top-grossing movie; and while the incredible special effects drew the crowds, I think the movie was popular because it also taps one of our fundamental fears.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is not merely a thriller about people running from dinosaurs: it reflects our fear that our technology will fail and leave us vulnerable to deadly and unforeseen natural forces, a fear that will remain with us for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>Consider the SARS epidemic and scare (I hope no one considers this comparison too inappropriate): SARS is a deadly force of nature which we hope and pray our modern technology will be able to contain, but we don't know for sure that it will.  I make this connection only to emphasize why I think Jurassic Park is so effective, because beneath its slick surface of fiction we sense the same anxiety that we feel for real dangers.<br/><br/>Anyway, Jurassic Park is one of my favorite movies, and despite its flaws I think it's one of the best pop entertainments of the past ten years.<br/><br/>Rating: 10 (Because it's just as good the tenth time you watch it as it was the first time.)"
"coolmule","7","3","5","16 April 2003"," Theme park ride of a movie
","*****Warning, Spoilers*****<br/><br/>Jurassic Park, a movie about a theme park, really is a theme park ride in itself. There's no doubt the stars of the film are the dinosaurs, rather than the actors (indeed, by saving Sam Neil and co from the Raptors at the end of the film, the T-Rex is revealed to be the hero of the story), and Steven Spielberg uses all his expertise to showcase the remarkable creations of Stan Winston and ILM. 10 years on, the CG still looks great - obviously a quantum leap over earlier efforts from the likes of the Abyss and Terminator 2, but what's remarkable is how good it looks compared to more recent efforts. The Dinosaurs look completely realistic, lacking the cartoonish quality alot of recent CG has. Clearly a huge amount of care went into making the creatures seem like living, thinking animals. Credit must also go to Stan Winston for his fantastic animatronics - the sick Triceratops in particular is brilliant.<br/><br/>While this film lacks the heart of some of his other work, it's clear that few directors can do an action-adventure movie as well as  Spielberg. I wasn't born when Jaws came out, but I can clearly remember my reaction in the cinema when I saw Jurassic Park 10 years ago, and I imagine that audiences in 1975 would have reacted in the same way - pressed back into the seat, heart pounding as, in this case the T-Rex pounds relentlessly after the heroes. Spielberg builds up the tension in these scenes masterfully, with the vibrations on the surface of the glass of water performing the same role as John Williams score in Jaws - letting the audience that something huge and extremely nasty will be appearing imminently. Speaking of John Williams, he of course turns in yet another instantly catchy score, even if its not quite on the same level as Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br/><br/>In terms of performances, there's nothing particularly wrong with the film - Sam Neil, Laura Dern and the rest give perfectly creditable performances, but only Jeff Goldblum really rises above the ordinary, in part due to his character having all the best lines (""that is one big pile of Sh*t""). Where the film does fall down is in the inclusion of the awful annoying kids. Timmy in particular is like a prototype for Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace, although admittedly Joseph Mazzello is a way better actor than Jake Lloyd. There was a time when Spielberg, and George Lucas for that matter, made blockbusters that didn't pull their punches, and appealed to millions of kids in doing so. Now it seems family entertainment means cute 8 year old heroes and FBI agents carrying walkie talkies instead of guns. Oh, well.<br/><br/>In summary Jurassic Park lacks the soul to be considered an all time great, but is still fantastic popcorn entertainment with some brilliant special effects.<br/><br/>Rating - 7/10"

This movie returned me to my youth by reminding me of the sheer awesome splendor of these extinct beasts. Joseph Mazzello plays what could me me as a child while Jeff Goldblum could be me as an adult, wise-cracking and one-lining myself in the face of danger. Sam Neil and Laura Dern are a wonderful couple, but the real stars of course are the dinosaurs. The explanation of their cloning is told very convincingly, albeit not without some infallibles. Am I to believe that the DNAs from the fifty odd dinosaurs that appear in the whole trilogy all came from one drop of blood in one mosquito ? That was one very busy little bug to hit that many creatures in one day. Maybe it had a preminition that the dinosaurs were about to die and that someday they would be cloned.

","For me this was like ET. You watch the film and try to forget your expectations, and they your jaw just ends up dropping on how bad it really was.<br/><br/>For ET, I was hoping for a bit of the alien wonder one experienced in ""Close Encounters"", and got a foolish, beer drinking dumb looking alien who can make the stupid kids' bikes fly. YECH. For this film, I was expecting a great science fiction film, especially with the talent involved...and got an unbelievable exercise in bad film-making.<br/><br/>Yes, the dinosaurs look good...they're made in a computer, and so what? I enjoyed them, but it wasn't like OMG how did they do that? It was CGI. I guess for 99% of the people out there, at least back then, that was good enough.<br/><br/>Much has already been written about the terrible pacing, the bad acting, and the non existent plot, all points which are valid, so I will stick with some plot points/idiotic things--and some items that are unanswered for me...maybe someone out there can share an explanation.<br/><br/>1) Why would they test this zoo and all its security on the day that a bunch of the engineers are leaving? Especially with kids there? <br/><br/>2) So there are electric fences to keep the dinosaurs in, but no backup systems in case the electricity fails. Hello, engineering? <br/><br/>3) Time after time characters go past gun cases. Only a few shots of a gun are made, all off screen. Any sane person would have raided those cases and those dinosaurs would be off playing their Jurassic Harps somewhere. But no, no one grabs a gun, no one shoots. The most skilled hunter gets himself killed.<br/><br/>4) No one likes a lawyer, but what was with the HILARIOUS scene of the poor guy getting eaten when on the toilet? It was supposed to be funny, and I will admit, I think everyone in the theater howled but me. So maybe that was successful.<br/><br/>5) Whole scenes go nowhere. When Ms. Dern finds a big dino defecation, she is examining it and seems to come up with some puzzling findings. I was expecting...I don't know, some deadly virus, something that was killing the dinos, etc. No, we never find out, as the movie has no answers.<br/><br/>6) Doesn't every kid know UNIX? The 12 and 10 year olds save the day, because, dontcha know, all kids are computer experts! Ain't that cute.<br/><br/>7) Ms. Dern turns in a really bad performance. Note her waxing dreamily with old Dr. Greyhead over melting ice cream (yeah, perfect time to stop and share some nice conversation over a snack, in between dinosaur maulings). Also note: Ms. Derns frozen expression of wonderment when she first sees the dinosaurs (You can almost hear Spielberg off camera...""Big expression Laura, BIG""). Note her next frozen expression, staring like a mannequin at Sam Neill at the end of the movie in the helicopter. Her dopey expression makes one think she might have gas.<br/><br/>8) Let's make the bad guy the fat white guy. That way, we can't be labeled racist, misogynist, etc. I swear that when I saw this in the movies and the fat guy was slipping in the mud and generally fumbling about, that they were playing tuba music during. When I saw this scene again the music seemed different. Maybe I just imagined the tuba music because everything else in that scene was insulting to the intelligence.<br/><br/>I could go on, but it's late. Suffice it to say, this is a rated 0 movie save for some special effects, which for me barely gets the movie to a three."

","This time Steven Spielberg makes a movie about dinosaurs. He made some films about aliens, about sharks, and about action heroes before, and now he's made a film about dinosaurs. If you can't tell, I'm pretty apprehensive about this movie. I didn't like this movie. No, actually, it was okay. It was just too mawkishly sentimental for my tastes. Spielberg has obviously become the master at manipulating emotions as scene after scene barrages the viewer with images that breathe too sickly sweet in my face. Behind the excitement of a movie about nature running wild lies the heavy-handed morals of the film: stealing and double crossing is punishable by the innocent and unguided forces of nature, money is a corruptible power, sometimes nature might be better left untouched, and keeping the family unit intact is priority number one, as is always the case in all of Spielberg's movies. But in the foreground of all of that morality is this awesome visual roller coaster ride filled with some of the most breathtaking computer video images and hand crafted puppetry I have ever seen. It's a toss up. I can take those images of the ""Jurassic Park"" banner falling around the tyrannosaurus rex being attacked by raptors on one side and compare that to the image of a tyrannosaurus rex chasing one of the jeeps in the rear view mirror with the words ""object in mirror may be closer than it appears"" on the other. Those are some cool images, but one smacks of contrived metaphor and the other screams with raw power juxtaposed with situational irony. I'll always respect Spielberg as one of cinema's powerhouse figures, but there will always be something to disagree about. On the disc with the movie were a number of behind the scenes featurettes including Spielberg with his creative team planning out images from the movie in pre-production, as well as a perfectly matched stop motion animation mock up of the raptor hunt scene in the kitchen. I would personally love to see someone take the whole movie and turn it into this kind of film-making. Picked this up at the University library."

","Back when Jurassic Park was released, I was obsessed with dinosaurs and was very eager to see it. I went in and as soon as it started, I was in tears when a character gets eaten by a velociraptor. When I finally calmed down, I was enthralled by every aspect of this movie.<br/><br/>If nothing else, the special effects are the reason to see this movie. This movie has, without a question, the best CGI effects I've ever seen in a movie. The Tyrannosaurus Rex is so realistic that up until two years ago, I had thought that the whole thing was done with robotics. To see this dinosaur move, it jumps out at you like nothing I've ever seen before. The raptors, which were my personal favorite, are absolutely awesome. I'm glad these things are extinct.<br/><br/>The actors are superb, most notably Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum, who steal the show. Sam Neill is one of my favorite actors, and he does a fine job here as the sensible Alan Grant. Goldblum is great, as usual, with comic relief as Ian Malcolm. I also loved the game warden, Robery Muldoon played wonderfully by Bob Peck. The real stars here are the dinosaurs, and everyone seems to realize that.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is scary. Spielberg manages, as he usually does, to amp up the suspense to 11. He uses the setting of Isla Nublar, with its dark jungle and pounding rain to keep everyone on their toes. He uses a normal object to signify the arrival of the T-Rex: rippling water. When the water cups start to ripple, you something bad is going to happen. The inability to see the dinosaurs or know where they are is very scary.<br/><br/>The score by John Williams is magnificent, while not overpowering the film itself. I always end up humming it to myself.<br/><br/>The Bottom Line:<br/><br/>A genuinely scary movie with action, laughs, and still awe-inspiring special effects throughout."

","Historically this movie will always be remembered as the first big production using believable SFX and revolutionary CGI. For that alone this movie can already be regarded a classic. But the movie has more to offer. It's typical Spielberg entertainment, meaning that it is good!<br/><br/>The story isn't really important, it actually is kind of weak. The movie is all about the dinosaurs and everything around it is of minor importance, at least for me it is. The movie also has a fairly small cast and the dinosaurs the biggest stars of the movie, especially the raptors and the wonderfully looking T-Rex.<br/><br/>Let's be fair, the main cast isn't very impressive. Although Sam Neill still pulls of alright, Laura Dern isn't the world greatest actress and Bob Peck seems like a big B actor. The supporting cast is more impressive: Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight and B.D. Wong all form a wonderful supporting cast.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of the visual style of the movie. For my taste it is just too bright and colorful at times and some of the sets look like they are made out of plastic, as a matter of fact, I think that they were really made out of plastic! And some of the sets are obviously filmed in a studio. Thank goodness that the dinosaurs don't look like plastic!<br/><br/>The movie is tense and exciting but above all entertaining, completely with some typical Spielberg comedy and a John Williams soundtrack.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br/><br/>""Jurassic Park"" has gone down in history as one of the highest grossing films of all time, and another milestone in the career of Steven Spielberg. Some critics have bashed the film, saying that it is nothing more than a special effects orgy riddled with cheesy scenes and cliches.  Although the film is crafted in the fashion of the summer blockbuster, it is impossible to deny that it was an important gain in the field of cinema as a whole. It is an enjoyable film with many suspenseful moments and helped pave the way for the further development of CGI in order to dazzle film audiences.<br/><br/>I read the book after seeing the movie (I was about 10 years old at the time), and I couldn't help but feeling how the movie would have been so much cooler if they'd included some other scenes.  These include the aviary scene with the pterodactyls, the whole rafting journey, the raptor nest, and the eventual destruction of the island.  However, it is understandable that many of these scenes were cut out due to time and money constraints.  In most cases, the books hold more gold than the movie versions anyway and edited scenes are sometimes better left to the imagination.  Thus, the lack of consistency with the book has certainly not detracted from my view of this movie as a whole.<br/><br/>The obvious strong point of the film is the groundbreaking work in computer effects.  This was the first time that computers were able to realistically portray animals in full sunlight and weather effects in a film.  The most striking aspect of this milestone is that the animals created are enormous.  Dinosaurs have always permeated the imaginations of countless people because of their gargantuan size and the mystery surrounding them.  We have all been reduced to seeing pictures of the dinosaurs as they might have looked millions of years ago, or seeing their fossilized remains in museums.  ""Jurassic Park"" was able to bring the huge beasts to life, created a strata of terror, gentleness, and above all: sheer size.  The earth shakes under the weight of a 100 ton Brachiasaur coming down on all fours after feeding on a tree and as the Tyrannosaur chases down a jeep.<br/><br/>The dinosaurs as character elements are equally amazing.  The Tyrannosaurus Rex is one polarity of terror, melding enormous size with speed and a deafening roar that makes a lion sound like a kitten.  On the other pole are the absolutely terrifying velociraptors.  They are small, but their high intelligence and ability to hunt with precision in a pack make them creatures of nightmares.  The hunting scene in which Lex and Tim are trapped in a kitchen with two raptors is very effective.  Perhaps equally as scary are the dilophasaurs: small dinosaurs that appear playful at first, but become almost demonic, blinding prey with a paralyzing secretion that they spit.  The creators took a few liberties with the dinosaurs (velociraptors are actually smaller and dilophasaurs are 10 feet tall), but these are mere details that won't harm the experience of even a dinosaur nerd like myself.<br/><br/>The emphasis stays with the dinosaurs and their ability to awe the audience, as it rightfully should.  There are some very good actors in this movie, which is interesting for a summer blockbuster.  Also, critics should be able to acknowledge that the acting is above average in this film.  To back this up, I point to the sequel ""The Lost World"".  That movie had talented actors as well such as Julianne Moore, but the writing and acting was very sub par.  Sam Neill plays his part well, portraying a paleontologist who is both excited beyond his wildest imagination, and saddened by the fact that his profession will soon become obsolete.  Laura Dern plays a good counterpart to him, and Jeff Goldblum shines as the eccentric mathematician Ian Malcolm.<br/><br/>""Jurassic Park"" does contain many cliches.  The whole journey of Sam Neill towards becoming a father figure for the two children is somewhat heavy towards the end for example.  Also, the whole scene with the lawyer ""getting what he deserves"" by being bitten in half after cowering on a toilet is rather ridiculous.  However, the movie is filled with very memorable gags that remind the viewer that this movie was made to entertain. The T Rex nearly bites off the rearview mirror which reads ""objects in the mirror are closer than they appear"" and at the conclusion of the film, a banner that reads the ""when dinosaurs ruled the earth"" flutters down amidst his bellowing roar.  It is simple elements like that which provide an amusing feel to the film without having to rely heavily on spoken quips.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Jurassic Park"" taught us that things of our imagination could be realistically portrayed on the screen in a way that can both dazzle and scare.  This is a very entertaining movie, and is certainly the best film of what I believe to be a poorly executed and unnecessary series."

"MovieAddict2016","9","4","8","24 February 2003"," Entertainment just doesn't come any bigger than this. (SOME SPOILERS ENCLOSED!)
","`Jurassic Park' - 1993 - PG-13 -<br/><br/> `Jurassic Park' plays with a very interesting and compelling idea: what if dinosaurs could be genetically created? Brought back to life? Based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Michael Crichton comes a film starring Sam Neil as Dr. Alan Grant, a world-renowned paleontologist; Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler, his fellow paleontologist and girlfriend; and Richard Attenburough as John Hammond, a man with quite a proposition.<br/><br/> John Hammond flies to Dr. Grant's paleontology site and asks him to come out to his new theme park to test it out with some others, including Ellie Sattler. After much hesitation, Grant agrees to check out the park (after Hammond gives him some cash for his paleontology fund). So, Grant and Sattler fly out to `Jurassic Park,' not really sure of what it is or what is in it, per say (robots, puppets?). And then they find out the startling truth.<br/><br/> John Hammond has cloned dinosaurs. How? Well, think of it this way: `Millions' of years ago (supposedly), dinosaurs lived. I don't believe they lived millions or billions of years ago, but that's saved for different discussion. Anyway, back then, there were obviously mosquitoes around, right? They sucked dinosaur blood, right? Well, they also got stuck in tree sap and were preserved for all those years, right? You didn't know that? Well, I didn't know that, either, but the film sure is convincing. Anywho, Hammond and his team take some little gadgets and suck the dinosaur blood out of preserved mosquitoes. Then, using frog genes, they fill in any missing areas in the `dino DNA.'<br/><br/> Of course, this astounds Grant, who has studied dinosaurs his whole life, and will now be able to see them alive. However, he isn't the only one who gets to. Hammond has to get his theme park approved so he can open it to public. Therefore, he must bring in a few other higher-ups to approve the site, including Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), an eccentric theorist known for his famous `chaos theory'; his two grandchildren; and a lawyer, of course.<br/><br/> And then there are the guys who run the park, including Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson) and a disgustingly obese man named Nedry (Wayne Knight), whom would embarrass even Fat B$s&a%d; these two men are in the control center monitoring everything throughout the park.<br/><br/> But then something goes horribly wrong, and all the dinosaurs in the park are released, including the incredibly mighty and amazing tyrannosaurus rex.<br/><br/> First of all, `Jurassic Park' is an astounding film. I must make that point. I remember reading the book when it came out, and the film captures every piece of the book as I imagined it. Part of what makes the film so great is that they didn't skimp on the visual effects, and never let anything stupid slide through. Even the plot, though it may be full of holes, was presented excellently and thoroughly, showing us how the dinos are created.<br/><br/> Then, the actors: Sam Neil fit Alan Grant like a glove. Laura Dern, though she's nothing special, pulled off Ellie Sattler well; and then there's Jeff Goldblum, whom everyone hates. Well, I must say that people wouldn't hate him as much if they read the book, because he is just like the character he plays. I don't like Jeff Goldblum, but I'll give him his deserved credit for the role of Ian Malcolm, because he really pulled it off.<br/><br/> Director Steven Spielberg was the perfect choice for this movie. Many people said they were disappointed because they showed the tyrannosaurus in the beginning of the film, and shouldn't have shown it; they expected Spielberg's accidental technique that he used in `Jaws.' However, I don't consider the thirty-five minute point of the film the beginning.<br/><br/> When Spielberg made `Jaws,' the shark robot didn't work right, and that is why the film never showed it until the end. Otherwise, the film would have shown the shark in the beginning. Everyone gives Steven Spielberg credit for something he didn't intend, when I think `Jurassic Park' is just as good as `Jaws' (well, almost as good), and Spielberg is put down constantly just because he didn't wait until the end to show the t-rex. I, personally, am glad they showed it at the point they did. I DID want to see the tyrannosaurus.<br/><br/> The CGI effects in this film are completely ahead of their time. After viewing the latest installment in the series, I realized that the visual effects in it are barely any better than the first film; that's saying a lot. Basically, that means that in the ten years since its release, `Jurassic Park' is still a competitor for the latest advances in computer graphics.<br/><br/> And as for the other aspects of the movie.<br/><br/> The score by John Williams is nothing short of moving; he perfectly blends excitement and surprises into music.brilliant.<br/><br/> And Stan Winston's creature effects are nothing to laugh at - the guy seamlessly blends puppets to fit in with the CGI. In too many films, it is completely obvious when the creature of a movie is CGI versus a puppet. However, in `Jurassic Park,' Winston and the special effects people work together correctly for a change, making us say, `Is that a puppet or CGI?'<br/><br/> All in all, `Jurassic Park' is nowhere near as good as the novel, surprisingly, but it is one of the most well known films to come out of the nineties. It is constantly and utterly spoofed, has spawned two less successful sequels (though I did like the third), and is absolutely amazing, entertaining and mind-boggling. It is true to the novel, while entirely different in its own special way. I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed this film. I want to write more about the movie, but I have almost reached my one thousand words maximum.<br/><br/>  Bottom line: Entertainment just doesn't come any bigger than this.<br/><br/> 4/5 stars"
"gigabyte-me","6","5","11","3 May 2007"," Pales in comparison to the novel.
","Spielberg took a great novel and turned it into blockbuster cotton candy for children and young teenagers. <br/><br/>I couldn't believe what was unfolding before me when I watched this film. Crichton's book was so much richer in detail and much more edge of your seat suspenseful. <br/><br/>I hated the way it was rewritten for the screen and I didn't like how the characters in the film were pale shadows of their book selves. The characters in the book were easy to like. In the movie they were entirely peripheral to the CGI dinosaurs. The magic of the novel was that the characters were equally as important as the peril they faced. In the film it was all about the dinosaurs, the actors might as well have been cardboard cut-outs. <br/><br/>I know people who didn't read the book don't want to hear this kind of thing but trust me if you did read the book first you know what I'm talking about. <br/><br/>I can imagine if I didn't read the book first I would have maybe liked this film more. As it stands I didn't entirely despise it. The scene that properly introduced the first dinosaur for our pleasure was somewhat moving. Yet they didn't save the poor story telling and lousy translation from book to novel. Situations that made the book a great read were entirely omitted from the film in true Hollywood form. <br/><br/>I like Spielberg's work and he's proved his worth but this movie would have been better left to someone who wasn't so hell bent on getting the effects right, while almost completely ignoring the elements of the novel that made Jurassic Park great."

","Jurassic Park is set on an island just off the coast of Costa Rica which rich billionaire businessman John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) rents from the Government, within it's lush green jungles Hammond has created a new type of tourist attraction. The whole island has been converted into a giant theme park called Jurassic Park, a theme park where the paying public can take a tour & see real life Dinosaurs including Triceraptops, herds of Galamides, a Brontosaurs, Velociraptors & even a T-Rex that have been brought back from extinction by means of using Dinosaur DNA from blood found in fossilised Mosquitos. However, in an accident a worker has been killed & Hammond's investors get nervous about the safety issues that surround Jurassic Park so in an attempt to reassure them Hammond invites esteemed palaeontologist's Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) & Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) along with scientist Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) & lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) to tour the park & hopefully endorse it. Unfortunately things don't go the way Hammond was expecting as a ferocious thunder storm hits the island at the same time treacherous employee Dennis Nerdy (Wayne Knight) shuts down the security fences so he can make his escape after stealing Dinosaur embryos that he plans to sell to a rival company. With the security fences off line the Dinosaurs are free to go wherever they please & the human inhabitants on the island find themselves hunted by the Dinosaurs...<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg Jurassic Park was a monster-sized (sorry) smash hit at the box-office when it came out & held the record until Titanic (1997) came along, it still makes for great viewing even after all these years. The script by Michael Crichton & David Keopp was based on the novel by Crichton of the same name, in fact Jurassic Park the film went into production before the novel even came out. The film is great basically, there are lots of spectacular big budget set pieces that look good even now, there's some stunning special effects that still hold up really well & the Dinosaur human interaction is as good as anything else put on film with the likes of a huge T-Rex chasing a jeep through the jungle looking impressive. The story is reasonably plausible & it doesn't get too bogged down in scientific jargon, the various story threads all come together pretty well although I'd liked to have seen a few more people get eaten. Alive if possible. Most of the character's are likable & even the teenage kids weren't that annoying apart from a scene when Lex (Ariana Richards) can't seem to do something as simple as turn a flashlight off yet later on in the film she manages to operate one of the most sophisticated computers on the planet & use it to reboot the entire theme park electrical system! There is one exception though, I have to say that Laura Dern's scientist irritated me beyond belief, I don't know if it was Dern or the character but I really wish she'd got eaten. Slowly. My only real complaint with Jurassic Park is the pace, once it gets going around the 50 minute mark it's top entertainment all the way to the finish line but until that point I found it rather slow going with lots of very deliberate 'explanations' & exposition scenes that feel forced, it's the sort of dialogue that you know the filmmakers stick in there on purpose to get the audience up to speed like all the talk about how deadly the Velociraptors are & how they hunt. I'm all for build up & character development but I personally don't like long films, I just don't as I begin to loose interest & become bored so I'd have preferred Jurassic Park to have been at least 15 or 20 minutes shorter. This is a small complaint & Jurassic Park is still a thrilling action packed family horror film & I don't care what anyone says it's definitely a horror film & if it had been made by anyone other than family friendly Spielberg that's how everyone would describe it.<br/><br/>Director Spielberg films the special effect & action scenes with panache & there are some cool sequences like the T-Rex eating a Goat whole (excellent!, as Tim (Joseph Mazzello) exclaims), attacking the jeeps & the Velocirators at the climax hunting the kids in the kitchen. Everything looks, sounds & feels great with brilliant special effects & CGI. The film has some nice scary moments & a few instances of mild gore & violence so it may not be suitable for very young children.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $63,000,000 Jurassic Park is technically excellent & set the standard for just about every special effects film thereafter. Some of the Costa Rican locations look gorgeous although I believe most of it was shot in California. The acting was alright but the real stars here are the Dinosaurs so it doesn't matter that much. This was Richard Attenboroughs first film in 15 years, Samuel L. Jackson has a small role & he would obviously go on to mega stardom, Sam Neill is OK, as already mentioned I thought Dern was awful while Goldblum is as likable as ever & steals every scene he's in.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is a great film, it's as simple & straight forward as that. It has brilliant special effects, cool set pieces, great Dinosaur action & makes for terrific Saturday afternoon type entertainment. What more do you want? I would imagine there aren't to many people on planet Earth who hasn't seen it yet but if your one of the few then what are you waiting for? Two great sequels followed, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) & Jurassic Park III (2001) while Jurassic Park IV (2008) is currently in pre-production according to the IMDb."

"daryahorenko","9","2","3","4 June 2018"," Very well written and executed, yet underwhelming
","This was my first movie from the Jurassic Park/World franchise and after this experience I'm planning to see the sequel ""The Lost World"". This was quite a good movie, however it has some issues.<br/><br/>Now that the fifth movie of this franchise has just hit theaters it might not seem that way as much anymore and I wasn't alive in 1993, but this was a very original idea, mostly executed very well. The script had many strength, a few weeknesses and great dialog.<br/><br/>The first act of this movie sets up a great, interesting and intriguing world. The buildup to the first time we see a dinosaur is so well done using great cuts between the characters and good camera angles. Our two main protagonists are paleontologists and they sold their amazement of seeing real dinosaurs for the first time so well! There's a scene where what looks like a T-Rex hatches from its egg and it looks cute at first but they foreshadow the danger that is to come using really good dialog and character interactions.<br/><br/>The second act is underwhelming, it has two strengths however. We know that one of the employees of the Jurassic Park hacks the security systems, but the idea is executed much better than it looks on paper. We also get the first scene where a dinosaur is an immediate threat to our characters, which is one of my favorite scenes from the movie. Despite that, the fact that the dinosaurs weren't in the movie that much until the third act make them seem like a little bit less of a threat.<br/><br/>The third act on the other hand is great and it did most things right. It had great action, yet not too much of it, a great finale and my favorite scene. There were two scenes intercut , which meant that one group of characters was not aware of the consequences of their actions while the other one isn't aware of the danger they were in, those two scenes being intercut made for so much suspense.<br/><br/>The special effects are very very good and ILM did a great job with them, as always. The dinosaurs look so gorgeous, every part of them looks real. There wasn't a single poorly done piece of CGI, not one.<br/><br/>The main message of the movie is that humanity might be orchestrating their own extinction and that we should be careful with what we use science for, but there's also a message telling us that nature will have its revenge if we don't treat it with respect and it's very well-integrated, but they don't portray nature, especially the dinosaurs as purely evil, they show that nature can be both dangerous and peaceful.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are realistic people you care about and you want them to survive. It's not their profession that makes the two paleontologists so great, it's their concerns about the whole idea and their actions and the fact that they try to save everyone. Scenes like the kids being so interested in their work is what endears us to them and what makes us root for them. And I know that we're not supposed to like the park owner, but he's my biggest flaw with this movie. In the third act we see three of our characters working on their plan, so the movie should let us think that he's becoming reasonable which would be good character development, but he literally tells Ellie, one of the paleontologists, not to do something because she's a woman and that he should do it because he's a man. This was a very bad decision in the script, especially because we're that far into the movie. How are we supposed to at least support that character? This movie wasn't released in the 70s or 80s when moments like this were unfortunately accepted amongst the public.<br/><br/>All of the actresses and actors are giving really good performances, especially Samuel L. Jackson even though he wasn't in the movie that much. I always praise kids though when they are doing well in movies because giving great performances at a young age is a higher accomplishment than doing so as an adult. Ariana Richards is doing an amazing job, even when she doesn't speak, her face expresses so much of the fear that her character is experiencing and her screams of pain are even more convincing than those of Carrie Henn from ""Aliens""."

I mean its just a great movie that would not get bored watching it over a 100 times. I personally did. <br/><br/>I don't know how much CGI or green screen were involved. But the work they've put on this movie is just speechless. The animatronics they've used for the dinos were just beyond realistic. The set was simply superb. Personified so to say. You could almost feel like the dinos were really there and all these given it was just 1993. <br/><br/>All the actors did a great job of moving along with the Dinos. The only black spot was Laura Dern. I don't know who did the casting for her, that person should have been fired. She was just terrible throughout the whole movie. cheap dialogues, useless jokes, over dramatic screaming. She annoyed the crap out of me. Almost spoiled the damn thing. Thank God for Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill. They covered Laura's disaster. Seriously Lex and Tim did a way better job. <br/><br/>We still remember the tour they did going around the world setting up them dino-tronics inside a park which was incredible. I was a kid back then and I found it amusing to the core and I still do. I got to see them actual thing in front of my eyes. Not to mention the video game promos, toys and other stuff. It was just a great feeling overall. <br/><br/>I'm sure the whole team made some serious cash over the movie and the promos. All that and it was really sad to watch when they made fun of the movie with ""Jurassic World"" a few years ago. They should be sued really. <br/><br/>Anyway, nothing to comment about Sir Spielberg and John Williams. You already know who they are. This is a great movie, deserves a 10/10.

Scientists must figure out way to stop dinos. Oh, and there are kids running around the dino park with a guy who could care less about kids. But it worked. This is a very enjoyable film, even today.

And my response to that is quite simply, who cares? Like honestly, who cares? As a kid, this and 'Small Soldiers' were two films I watched over and over on repeat. Today, I don't know how well I could handle the latter, but I will never lose confidence in my love for Jurassic Park. In fact, I believe I have loved it more as the years have gone on and that there were things I appreciate about it now that I didn't pick up on as a kid (e.g. the moral debate about recreating dinosaurs etc).<br/><br/>This film engages from start to finish, bringing in a great range of characters and creatures that all tie in to a well directed plot. Even now, the raptor-kitchen scene gets me as tense as it did the first time I watched it. I could watch the first T-Rex scene over and over too.<br/><br/>My only regret is that I was born in 1992, meaning I was barely a year old when this film was released. Thus, I can never appreciate what it must have been like to go to Jurassic Park upon its original release which I'm sure must have been phenomenal for its day.

Now, here are my thoughts on this spectacular achievement.<br/><br/>1) The animatronics-Wow! The animatronics were mind blowing for their time! I actually thought a T-Rex was chasing doctor Alan Grant throughout the park. The dinosaurs seemed so real! <br/><br/>2) The themes-The main theme of this movie is of how genetic engineering can spread uncontrollably if not monitored with care. The dinosaurs were loose when the park went out of power due to Denis Nedry in a sub-plot. The theme of power over something people can't have power over. These two themes are what really drive the story. <br/><br/>3) The characters-I only want to talk about three characters; Mr. Arnold is played by Samuel ""Jules Winfield"" Jackson. Dr Grant is played by Sam Neill, and John Hammond is played the late Richard Attenborough. <br/><br/>All in All, this movie will forever be a classic movie I will watch over and over again. I highly recommend this movie."

","Overall: If you haven't seen this movie you must. Truly amazing and one of Spielberg's best movies.<br/><br/>Good: The concept is awesome, the effects would be groundbreaking at the time and still look pretty good though can be seen as a tad dated. The acting is great all around bar one exception. The music is phenomenal as is the cinematography. John Hammon's character just emits a level of charisma which is hard to ignore and makes you like him. Ian's sarcastic attitude make for some interesting dialogue and some interesting scenes. The two child actors do a great job even if there characters need some work. Great moral of ""Even if we can, should we?"".<br/><br/>Bad: The female scientist's acting didn't suffice and her character was just not that interesting either. The children's characters weren't interesting or anything special that you want to root for them. The effects could be seen as a tad bit dated despite looking great. Some subplots are left hanging and there are some stupid plot holes that are just threw in there hoping we wouldn't notice. <br/><br/>Best Part: When you first see the TREX MVP: Richard Attenborough as John Hammond<br/><br/>10/10"

","I recently finished reading the novel and I thought that I would watch and review the film to see how the two compared. I think that the film was paced a lot more evenly. It cut out a lot of the novel's clunky exposition and development. The supporting cast were also great from Wayne Knight as the corrupt Denis Nedry to Samuel L. Jackson as Ray Arnold. The film balanced the scientific and action segments. Never at any point did it feel like one dominated the other. I also much preferred the film's presentation of John Hammond.

"rasthompson","8","2","3","13 February 2016"," Jurassic Park directed by Steven Spielberg
","Jurassic Park is an adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Sam Neill, Richard Attenborough and Jeff Goldblum. I tried to watch this film not too long ago but I wanted to watch a film that had the big blockbuster thrills of Jurassic World (the only Jurassic Park film I had seen at the time) and didn't want to go through the slow-burn beginning. But when I became a little older and a little wiser I put in Jurassic Park once again and viewed it with a lot of pleasure. The slow-burn beginning I now appreciate for the scientific ideas it raises to how a dinosaur could be brought back to life-though I do understand that was from the book. The beginning also sets up the characters who are all well realised by actors subtle and realistic performances and the beginning also has moments that are awe-inspiring still today with the timeless music and blend of amazing practical dinosaurs and CG that still makes me believe that I am seeing a real-life dinosaur moving. But even though I do love the beginning I love the rest of the movie ten times more. Every scene after that is memorable scene whether it's a car falling through a tree or velociraptors trying to kill kids in a kitchen or even just innocent scenes with herbivore dinosaurs. Steven Spielberg's direction and unique camera techniques I could go on forever but you already know what he's like. His direction strongly elevates the film to such a higher level than if the film was directed stalely and stiltedly like a very intense kitchen scene that instead of just cutting to close- ups every ten seconds pans for long amounts of time. Now that might sound that it doesn't mean much but it really gets you more invested in the situation. Now I don't want to make too many comparisons between films but what elevates the dinosaur aspect of Jurassic Park from Jurassic World is that Jurassic Park uses practical aesthetics whenever it can which gets you much more into the scene than if it's complete CGI. But just for clarification I thoroughly enjoy Jurassic World as a blockbuster monster thriller but it's clear which film comes up on top. Now as for the cast they have to be well-acted and likable for you to root for them and hope that they don't die. The two children, the brother and sister aren't annoying and stupid but are genuine kids who are terrified but don't just stand there wide-eyed in front of the dinosaur waiting to be pushed out of the way by an adult. They're genuine kids who would certainly be terrified but they get on because just because they are kids in a movie doesn't mean they shouldn't have the basic human instinct of survival. Sam Neill plays a solid, grounded and kind character that tries to protect the kids and while doing that learns something about him, Jeff Goldblum could be deemed the funny guy but he really is just a good character with some very witty dialogue and Richard Attenborough is excellent as the excited Park manager. My only flaws with the film is that I would have liked a tiny bit more of T-Rex action and I could sort of tell a disposable character would die but the T-Rex action bit I think will be fulfilled in the sequel when I get around to watching it and the disposable character death's while predictable had a brutal pay-off. But apart from those nit-picks I was immersed into the situation and looking back on it I don't think that there was one disposable scene. I was in awe at Spielberg's direction, the practical aesthetics and ground-breaking CG that created the dinosaurs and impressed by the really good performances so for that I am going to give Jurassic Park an A"
"Red-Barracuda","7","2","3","13 December 2015"," The groundbreaking effects work is the king of this park
","With Jurassic Park, director Steven Spielberg made a film that became the new yardstick for cinematic special effects back in 1993. In fact, the ground-breaking CGI work used here to bring dinosaurs to life before our eyes is still very impressive over twenty years after its release, so you can only imagine the impact that they had back in the day. Truthfully, the effects work is by far the most impressive thing about this one, as it has a fairly by-the-numbers story-line populated with clichÃ©d characters. A select group of people are invited to an island retreat owned by a millionaire who has been able to recreate living dinosaurs from ancient DNA. It's here that he intends to give an early tour of his planned new resort, Jurassic Park; the trouble is that things go wrong and the dinosaurs go on the rampage.<br/><br/>This was adapted from a Michael Crichton novel of the same name. I've read the book and seem to think that the novel and film are at the very least broadly similar. It's the second film from the pen of Crichton based on the very specific sci-fi idea of a futuristic high-tech amusement park going fatally wrong, leaving the humans to battle the dangerous inhabitants of the park; the other film of course was Westworld (1973), where it was deadly androids who filled the same roles as the dinosaurs do here. Both films speculate on questions regarding the dangers of man tampering with science in careless ways. For me Westworld is the better film but I do still enjoy Spielberg's dinosaur blockbuster. The effects work are worth the price of admission alone of course but the story-line and characters, while being extremely standard, do still get us from A to B and allow us to seamlessly experience the deadly wonders on hand in the park. It's a pretty solidly entertaining piece on the whole and one of Spielberg's better out-and-out popcorn movies."
"bheadher","9","2","3","24 October 2015"," What can you say about one of the most brilliant films ever.
","When I sat down in the theater seat I had no idea what to expect. I hadn't seen a big screen movie in a long time, but I'm glad I saw this one the first time there. I'd have to say Jurassic Park was brilliantly executed from start to finish, with absolutely outstanding CGI blended in with some very stunning acting. I'm kind of a science follower anyway, so when they incorporated some sound scientific elements into the story, it sort of added to an almost perfect story. Don't believe you could ""genetically engineer some dinosaurs??? While there are two conflicted camps in the Genetics realm, there is generally agreement that it is possible. It would simply be very difficult to create the right genetic conditions, then you wouldn't quite know what you had until the animal hatched. So yes, the apparent ease of manipulation you see in Jurassic Park is a bit over the top, which is one of the reasons I only gave it a 9. The other reason is that about half the dinosaurs depicted in the movie were from totally different time periods. The Brachiosaurus is about the only truly large dinosaur that was firmly entrenched in the Jurassic period. There were a couple other plant eaters that were really huge also, but no large carnivores. The majority in the movie belonged in the Cretaceuos period.<br/><br/>Oh well, it was and still is the leader in movies that bring dinosaurs to life!"
"maximenigma","9","2","3","18 October 2015"," Just as magical now as when it was released
","I was too young to watch it in 1993 but I remember the huge hype and marketing that came along with this movie. We kids even had jurassic park backpacks without having seen the movie - they simply looked so cool. It puts a big smile on my face watching nowadays the scene where they show the merchandise. I bet all that stuff was actually put on the market when the film was first released. <br/><br/>I only saw the movie on TV a few years later, but the special effects were and still are absolutely amazing even on the small screen. The excellent casting, top acting and Spielberg's great directing make us experience the movie through the eyes of the cast. At first we're amazed by the gigantic and beautiful dinosaurs, later we fear with the cast for their lives. <br/><br/>The movie still looks and feels amazing more than 20 years after its release. Several things it does so much better than most other big action movies: The kids aren't annoying. Their acting - especially the girl's - is great. The dialogues are written with great care and the characters feel like real people. I can't pick a favourite character or actor in this movie, I liked them all. There is no needless display of violence. People die, but you never see it directly. The film knows that it works well as a thriller without descending to cheap gory effects. There is a reason though why this is rated PG-13 and I would not advise to show it to younger kids. <br/><br/>One of Spielberg's best, this is one all time classic and if you haven't seen it you definitely should."
"kennethtownsend-97230","9","2","3","13 October 2015"," Dinosaurs and Directors
","Jurassic Park (1993) Steven Spielberg<br/><br/>Movie ""Jurassic Park"" is considered by many a classic. This move made us jump out of our seats because of the dinosaurs. It also made us awe at the stunning visual effects that were way ahead of the time. The plot is that John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people to his new island on Isla Neblar to see his new attraction with living dinosaurs. The problem is that these dinosaurs are unpredictable and eventually break out. Steven Spielberg has done a great job at directing this movie and has given us a good look into the past, but is this movie actually good. Take away the nostalgic affect and critically compare this movie and its effect to others at the time. This movie blew our mind. Now 1993 was a great year for movie culture. There were many movies that came out such as ""The Sandlot"", ""The Nightmare before Christmas"" and even ""Mrs. Doubtfire"". Obviously there was some competition in that year but ""Jurassic Park"" blew these movies out of the water delving stunning cgi/animatronics. Although there was a lot of things done right with this movie it is not perfect. First of all this movie is not scientifically accurate. The Velociraptors as shown in the movie have a distinct lack in feathers and are estimated to be only about half a meter tall (1.7 inches). This movie may be inaccurate in some parts but it still blew our minds. I was only about a few years old when I first saw the movie and the thought of dinosaurs chasing people around just blew my mind. This movie may not be what the past was exactly but it delivers a good representation of what would happen if we tried to tame these beasts."
"filipemanuelneto","7","2","3","5 September 2015"," A good movie, with some suspense.
","This film tells the story of John Hammond, an eccentric millionaire, and his dream of creating a theme park with living dinosaurs, recreated from the remains of its former genetic material. But the park becomes out of control due to a sabotage act who will put everyone in danger.<br/><br/>This film is one of the most remarkable of Steven Spielberg, helping the director to consolidate his career and reputation in films outside of the sci-fi genre. And there is no doubt that this is an excellent film, with an innovative script which exploits a theme little-seen in the movies of that era: the dinosaurs. Also the pseudo-scientific theories used to give logic to the act of ""recreating"" these animals are interesting, almost making the audience believe that could be possible in real life. The subject of cloning was controversial at the time and was a bit fashionable because of some investigations that had been made recently in this field. In addition to the skill and talent of Spielberg as director and screenwriter, also have a good cast of actors, headed by Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum in the main roles, a group of paleontologists and scholars who visited the theme park before he is officially allowed to open to the public. Richard Attenborough, the extraordinary English actor, also comes in this film, playing the naive and dreamy Mr. Hammond.<br/><br/>This film was a huge success in the nineties. I was a child at the time but, like many others of my generation, I lived the magic of the dinosaurs, which became fashionable thanks to this film. Moreover, we still feel a special attraction for these animals, we have never seen or know exactly how they were, but we wanted to know better. For this, and for the suspense that the film provides, this is a movie that deserves to be in our living room."
"CMTiago","8","2","3","22 June 2015"," A special movie
","Jurassic Park is to many, a special movie, since it is in fact the pinnacle of the cinema going experience. Great action and sense of wonderment make this one of the most celebrated blockbusters of all time and with good reason. The effects were top of the art for their time and the movie proved to be a trailblazer for the CGI style of filmmaking. While it doesn't give us a completely groundbreaking story with a great deal of complex characters, it's still entertaining enough to make you root for the people in peril. Plus, charismatic actors like Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum offer a few laughs here and there to balance the mood. For me, Jurassic Park will always be a special movie, as it is to the majority who've watched it. The way everything comes together to give us a near perfect package is the reason I love movies and why names like Steven Spielberg and John Williams inspire me. Hopefully Jurassic World will give me back this happy, careless feeling that the the other sequels took away.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10"
"williambendavis-933-218958","9","2","3","17 June 2015"," The ultimate dinosaur movie
","This is movie is awesome in every sense of the word. It captured dinosaurs on film like no other. It didn't rely solely on special effects, thankfully. Spielberg made sure to throw in several incredibly tense and thrilling scenes to tie the whole thing together. I mean the climbing up the electric fence scene and the raptors in the kitchen scene are damn near perfect. If those scenes don't get your eyes glued to the screen, then I don't know what will. The music is great too. It's awe inspiring and it makes your hair stand on end. The characters in this movie feel suitably real as well. They all act like real people. Nobody felt like a fake movie character, which was rather nice. This movie also has possibly my favorite child performances of all time. Both of the kids are fantastic. When dinosaurs are coming for them, they look absolutely terrified. They made me believe there were actual dinosaurs chasing them. This film is a classic and I cannot recommend it enough."
"willcundallreview","9","2","3","17 June 2015"," Dinoriffic in many ways
","Rating-9/10<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is a blockbuster film, and blockbuster that is done very well indeed. It's the kind of movie where you might see the synopsis and think it looks like seen before film, but this is different in a few ways. The emotion that runs through is beautiful, not to mention the thrills the dinosaurs give you too, the characters first view of the dinosaurs is fantastic and well acted, the park so well designed. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is the mind behind the picture and he commands this in a way any big budget director can only dream of emulating. He seems to just know what to do, in every scene, and to be fair say what you say about the script in this one, Spielberg bashes out a film that probably doesn't even need a decent script. And on to that script, Spielberg gets everything he can out of it. He absolutely pulls it all out and even if fans of the original Michael Crichton novel dislike this, you can't deny Spielberg does well.<br/><br/>For me there are two stand out performances, Sam Neill and Richard Attenborough. First of all Neill as Palaeontologist Dr Alan Grant is good, he seems to make this film more personal and less big budget, he brings you closer to the characters and just does his job well. Attenborough is just fine in his role as John Hammond, owner of the Jurassic park. He knows what he is doing, a fine performance from a true great and he makes this movie even more memorable too.<br/><br/>I think this is just good fun, don't take the whole plot too seriously and you will massively enjoy this, this isn't a major award winner type movie but bits an pieces maybe do deserve great recognition. The effects used are just fantastic, and this is for 1993 as well, just top top work and really set a bar in my opinion. The animatronics of the dinosaurs are so well done, so well designed and so well, well moved in a sense. The animals are scary in this, not overly so don't fear for the kids being frightened, but it might just a little. <br/><br/>I think the reason this is such a classic is the way in which it can just be pretty slow and un-eventful then BOOM!, suddenly a huge T- Rex is running round or smashing the hell out of a car or something, it's actually good fun. It's characters like Jeff Goldblum's who make this funny and less serious, he cracks jokes at the scariest of times and some of his one two's with Sam Neill and Laura Dern(Ellie Sattler) are just brilliant. I think yet again Steven Spielberg directs the actors in a way that suits this movie brilliantly, they just blend well and Spielberg gets the absolute most out of them.<br/><br/>If you want a serious kind of drama movie(that somehow includes dinosaurs), then don't watch this, but If you want crazy all out thrills, with good acting, special effects and of course directing, this is all for you. I couldn't recommend this more to people, it is just such a good adventure, so well cast and the chemistry between everyone is just great, and again here comes that word, fun.<br/><br/>Overall an incredible movie, for me possibly one of the best of all time, definitely one of the best thrillers and the number one dinosaur based movie by miles. Give it a go and see if like me you find this amazing, and then you'll see just how much attention you'll give this film."
"j-penkair","9","2","3","17 June 2015"," A Classic Filmmaking
","Back in 1993, when I was a foreign student in Washington, DC and had lived in an area called Van Ness East, Steven Spielberg and Michael Chrichton were already household names. I watched and read their works well before my coming to America. Upon this film's release, one could see the familiar poster of a T-Rex caricature advertising the film at every Metro (subway) stop. Despite all that, I had no idea how this far-fetched film could find itself a film classic of the world, even more obvious in decades later. My first round at ""Jurassic Park"" occurred at a movie house in Woodley Park, where the National Zoo is. That edition of Time Magazine already had the film on its famous cover and entitled it as ""Jaws 2"". I was confused. How could Spielberg's dinosaur family movie be branded as a monster-horror movie like his own ""Jaws"" years ago? Then, it hit me in the forehead. The ride stoppage in a T-Rex area of the park not only built up fear and extreme excitement for me, but also brought about true shock and deep scar, which remains with me to this day. The devouring of the ""bad-guy"" lawyer made my hair rise up like I myself was eaten. There is no scene in ""Jurassic Park"" that I sensed the director's attempt to do more. It is a masterfully restrained act of the best kind. When the story is that good, someone much wiser told me, you don't have to shout to tell it. This is exactly what Spielberg had done with ""Jurassic Park"". He realized a good story, packaged it with the best ideas and people, then told it solidly and calmly. ""Jurassic Park"" becomes a classic because of such restraints, and not the over-dramatization tried and erred by several subsequent directors."

"anime68593","7","2","3","3 February 2015"," CGI is the star of this show
","The visual effects really are the star of the show here. The audiences continued fascination with dinosaurs has made this film a hit. Aside from the effects and CGI this film is pretty tired. There is no character development and the adults behave just like the children which seems a little strange. There isn't a lot of personality here and when the Dinosaurs are not on display it tends to be a bit boring with very one dimensional characters. I remember at the time expecting way more from Steven Spielberg and his amazing Directing abilities from his previous films, JAWS and close encounters to name a few. If CGI is your thing and animatronics are fascinating for you then this is your film. If you are looking for a tight little story with great characters, not so much. Overall it's a pretty inoffensive film so watch and enjoy."

"piratecannon","10","2","3","14 April 2013"," So, What About That 3D Treatment?
","I was 11 years old when Jurassic Park was released. I vividly remember going to see it at my local theater. The place was packed; there had been a lot of buzz about the movie, and—being a preteen dino enthusiast— I begged my parents to take me one Saturday afternoon so I could see what everyone was talking about. When it was over, something profound had occurred. It was the first time I recall feeling an overwhelming sense of wonder at what I'd witnessed. Sure, Star Wars had blown me away as a child, and I absorbed all things Indiana Jones; but there was something about Jurassic Park that completely enveloped me. Much of this, I think, has to do with seeing it on the big screen. It wasn't only that, though; it was the seamless effects, the just-plausible- enough-to-be-believable story, and the intense action (too intense, perhaps, for some kids my age, but I ate it up with a spoon) that made it absolutely unforgettable. Thus my love of cinema was cemented forevermore.<br/><br/>When I learned that the movie was getting the 3D treatment I groaned. The movie wasn't designed for three dimensions, and there was absolutely no way that it would make for a convincing transfer (especially when compared to films like Avatar, which were specifically tailored for the medium). I managed to resist making too much of a snap judgment and ventured out to my local theater to see the thing (with an IMAX treatment, no less) because, hey—it's Jurassic freakin' Park.<br/><br/>Imagine my surprise when that long-lost sense of wonderment was instantly rekindled from the very first frame. When John Williams' thundering score kicked in, the outside world melted away and I was, for all intents and purposes, a kid again. But not only that; the movie lends itself nicely to 3D, with wayward tree limbs and cascading rainstorms feeling as if they were strategically placed knowing that the movie would one day be reborn in an even more tangible manner.<br/><br/>If this wasn't confirmation enough that the movie had seen a successful transition, all I had to do was glance at the youngsters sitting a few seats down from me. I'm guessing they'd never seen the film in any iteration, as their reactions—""ooohs"" and ""aaahs"" in equal measure—were proof positive that this a picture perfect example of the magic of cinema. A side note: I could hardly restrain a snicker as they jolted (nearly) out of their seats when the stray velociraptor popped his head out from behind the control panel. I did the same thing when I was their age, and it's a virtual certainty that the experience—and the aforementioned sense of wonderment—will stick with them for a long, long time.<br/><br/>So, in case I haven't been clear, go see JP 3D. If you've never seen it, then well what are you waiting for? If you've seen it at least 500 times since its original release (like me), then trust me when I say that this new iteration is well worth the money. My hope is that the move will be re-released in another 20 years so the next generation of moviegoers can see what it's like to be transported to a world where the impossible really does exist."

","I just saw the amazing and entertaining ""Jurassic Park"" in 3D on the ""big"" screen. It was wonderful to see this Spielberg classic again. It was iconic in 1993 and the excellent plot is just as riveting and intense in 2013. This screening is quite an unusual opportunity. It is such a terrific movie that I immediately emailed all my movie-going friends and family to rush out and see it while it's available in theaters (SOOO much better than seeing it on your TV). Anyone would enjoy this story (unless they're really timid) - especially if you've never seen it before (maybe take your kids or grandkids)! <br/><br/>I didn't think 3D added much to the film - probably because it was so awesomely well done when it was originally released - and still is today. There is added depth, but I haven't seen a re-release of any film in 3D that was worth it to me, so I don't usually waste my money on them. ""Avatar"" set the bar for 3D so high (to me), that I've been spoiled, and don't even find new films living up to its standard. I did see a 3D trailer for ""Iron Man 3"" at this screening of ""Jurassic Park"" and it looked quite good, so I'll give it a try (fingers crossed). But the chance to see ""Jurassic Park"" in the movie theater venue is WELL worth it!<br/><br/>""Jurassic Park"" did revive my fear of Velociraptors! I hope they NEVER find a way to clone those dinosaurs."

Later, when the T Rex is pushing the Jeep with its nose there's suddenly a 200-foot drop in the same place. 2). When Goldblum and friends are fleeing the T Rex in a Jeep, the driver looks at the driver's side-view mirror and sees the words ""Objects in mirror are closer than they appear."" This is only seen on the passenger's side-view mirror, at least in any vehicle I've ever been in."

","Jurassic Park, as everyone knows, is nothing but a phenomenal and exciting movie and literally the first movie to really have dinosaurs in it, if you exclude the King Kong movie. It has always been a child hood favorite of mine and for a long time, however, I haven't seen the movie, to my uttermost shame. Finally, after years, I'm glad to get the chance to view it and all I can say is ""Holy sh*t!"" <br/><br/>Jurassic Park is just an action/adventure as I view it. The premise of the story is very simple. A park where dinosaurs have been brought back to life by the DNA strands of mosquitos who once sucked on the blood of dinosaurs. The park holds house to dinosaurs safely until one day a power failure causes dinosaurs to run crazy over Jurassic Park just as a group of tourists are trying to get out of there.<br/><br/>The movie, despite not truly beginning until an hour in, has such magic that cannot be expressed clearly enough. Everything about the movie is just phenomenal. It really is a cult classic. The environment of Jurassic Park, the CGI of the dinosaurs, everything in the movie really is a masterpiece! There is not much more to say about the movie. It has such magic that can rarely be seen in nowadays movies, and in fact, no movie these days contains the same magic that Jurassic Park did. Spielberg masterfully knew how to carefully use CGI and make the film so well.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is great. The little kids really were good to the movie. The writing is great as it is in all Spielberg movies and John Williams' famous score is nothing but brilliant. The film deserves nothing but the highest praise for its immense success, grand scope and its overall, large entertainment value! If you have not seen this movie until now....PLEASE DO SO...Its a masterpiece and my favorite Spielberg movie!"

","Jurassic Park is a movie that will make your jaw hit the floor with amazement. Everything about it is done right, and although it has scenes of dinosaurs eating people, it's a great movie for kids of all ages. I should know. I first watched this movie when I was 5 years old, and I loved it, but that doesn't mean every kid won't be scared. Consider that a fair warning.<br/><br/>The plot is simple. Scientist find a way to bring back the dinosaurs and build an entire theme park around it, but something goes wrong and the dinosaurs escape. Soon, the characters end up fighting for survival on an island full of dangerous predators.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, but it works much better than you can hope for. Many scenes are like an action movie in which you're on the edge of your seat the whole time wondering what will happen to the characters, and the actors do a well enough job to make you care for them. Sam Neil and Jeff Goldblum interact very well and Richard Attenborough does a great job as John Hammond. The rest of the cast are good as well.<br/><br/>However, the thing that stole the show were the dinosaurs and the special affects that brought them to life. They were so incredible that even today, you can watch it and believe that they used real dinosaurs. The scene where the T-Rex attacks the jeeps is a great example, and shows you just how great special affects can be. The dinosaurs are the key ingredients that make the movie so believable and intense.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is one heck of a roller coaster ride. It grabs you by the nostrils at the beginning and never lets go. Audiences of all ages can enjoy this, and it's best watching it with your family. It's a groundbreaking movie that will glue you to the screen, and the best adventure you can ask for."
"samuel-leslie66","7","2","3","29 February 2012"," Summer Blockbuster!!
","I won't go on and on about the brilliance of the special effects or how amazing the dinosaurs were, because there's not much disagreement about that. The T-Rex is one of the coolest things you will ever see, and the raptors are absolutely chilling in their intelligence and agility. Your heart will definitely pound if you've never seen it before. It'll probably pound if you have too.<br/><br/>I have seen some complaints about the script/characters/acting however, and disagree with them for the most part. There's a truly interesting array of characters in this film. Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler, a paleontologist and paleobotanist bring so much heart to this movie. The scene where they see the real live brachiasaurus for the first time after dedicating their lives to digging up fossils and making interpretations about their behavior blows me away every time. Their awe and academic excitement is very touching, and combined with John Williams' perfect score, this scene truly is my favorite.<br/><br/>The way Grant is unable to even stand up because of the shock is very endearing. And later on in the movie, after witnessing deaths due to these creatures, the change seen in Grant as he throws away the raptor claw he always kept with him is powerful. His relationship with the two children visiting the park develops in a sweet way as well as he goes from being highly annoyed by their presence to risking his life to protect them when no one else can.<br/><br/>In contrast to the paleontologists, Jeff Goldblum gives a great performance as Dr. Ian Malcolm, an arrogant, sarcastic and very amusing mathematician who studies Chaos Theory, and believes from the start that Jurassic Park is doomed to fail. He's highly opinionated, a little on the rude side and a blatant flirt but he brings a lot of life to the film and despite his quirks is the voice of reason.<br/><br/>John Hammond, the millionaire responsible for creating Jurassic Park also gives a fascinating performance. For those of you who've read the novel, he is a somewhat more sympathetic character than the money hungry Hammond of the book. He is definitely stubborn and infuriating as he refuses to see the horrible danger of what he's doing, but he is doing it with a kindness and desire to bring joy to people's lives, and displays an eventual humility that makes him likable."
"Filmjunkie-Idle","7","2","3","4 June 2011"," A classic tale that will be enjoyed by all.
","This was a great and classic film which the world will remember. This is truly some of Spielberg's greatest work and I couldn't love it more. Jurassic Park is one of the three movies in the Jurassic Park trilogy. Jurassic Park is about John Hammond a dinosaur enthusiast who constructs a dinosaur theme park with living biological attractions. These are no animatronic animals but dinosaurs that are created to live and breath the air of man. As usual their is a dark side to every fantasy and the dream is threatened when the park systems break down, all hell breaks loose leaving the tourists and workers left for survival. Their are some great scenes with great uses of CGI and animatronic dinosaurs along with some extraordinary performances, cinematography all in this compelling adventure film."

","Jurassic park is a miracle creation! the special effects are superb,the story is flawless,and the movie is overall a heart stopping thriller! when dinosaurs come back after 65 million years Stevens fans increase! Steven observed animals from all parts of the world and used the body's and the motions to help him create his dinosaurs.i will quickly give you a summary of the story without spoiling anything.scientists have discovered a way to bring back dinosaurs and a man decides he wants to open a theme were you can view them.the movie was made in 1991 and grossed like 650,000,000 bucks in total!the bottom line is if you are fond of dinosaurs you will definitely enjoy Jurassic park."

","Steven Spielberg has made numerous films that got critical praise such as Jaws, E.T., Indiana Jones series, Minority Report, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Hook was one of Spielberg's least favorite films, But Jurassic Park is an entertaining blockbuster of 1993.<br/><br/>It stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, etc.<br/><br/>John Hammond has developed a dinosaur park (in a very remote Island) using a DNA of a prehistoric dinosaur taken from an ancient insect. In a tour that Hammond makes to a selected audience which suppose to decide whether the park is safe or not safe for public, the security system collapsed, and the dinosaurs set themselves free. Now the selected audience, in the leadership of Doctor Grant (Sam Neill) and include Doctor Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), Doctor Sattler (Laura Dern), Hammond's grandchildren, and some more has to survive in the Island.<br/><br/>No Jurassic Park sequel can beat this original piece of art.<br/><br/>Overall, very cool, and very smart film.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park gets 10 stars."
"FightNightt","9","2","3","18 September 2010"," One of my favorite films from the 1990s that still holds up to this day.
","Jurassic Park, which was released back in 1993, once held the record of the biggest film in history, where the world embraced it's ideas and science of bringing dinosaurs back to life.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg, working from the novel by Michael Crichton, returns to the terror he brought on the big screen in Jaws, and the results were completely magnificent.<br/><br/>Two paleontologists, played by Sam Neill and Laura Dern, are paid to give an endorsement to an amusement park unlike one ever made in history thanks to billionaire industrialist, John Hammand.<br/><br/>Closing out the cast are Jeff Goldblum's Dr. Malcolm, who is easily the funniest member of the cast and the two children Tim and Lex played by Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards.<br/><br/>All have come to experiences the world's first dinosaur theme park where the extinct creatures have come back to life, and I do mean come back to life.<br/><br/>Audiences the world over saw this film multiple times over the summer of 1993, and this film's visual effects even hold up to this day, even compared with James Cameron's latest film, Avatar.<br/><br/>I say that Universal should re-release Jurassic Park in theaters for it's 20th Anniversary and this time in 3D.<br/><br/>Director Joe Johnson is already at work on a second Jurassic Park trilogy and it's great watching dinosaurs come to life like they did in this film. It's definitely a timeless classic, and one of the most enjoyable films ever made further proving Steven Spielberg as the most successful director in history."

","If you lived in the 90's you know this movie was big. However I was a child when I saw this I was freaked out just by the first two minutes. After a few years it resurfaced on a VHS tape. Again I was too freaked out but this time by the T-Rex. Finally the third time was the charm. Me and a friend sat down and watched it. I couldn't believe what I missed. After 12 years of watching ""Walking with Dionsaurs"" I finally got that ""Holy crap that was awesome"".<br/><br/>The movie itself has a good plot. After finding Dino D.N.A. scientists manage to clone Dinosaurs. After a fews they need an endorsement from someone. They find three people and of course at first everyone wants too. After a greedy Newman powers down the park and Dino's rule the land. The movie goes far to show these Dino's are beyond our imagination. The T-Rex is an all powerful creature, the velociraptors are smart and deadly.<br/><br/>The CGI in this film is really well done. I really can't tell the difference between robotic. The actors show the emotion that most people would show when seeing these creatures. Even the score was amazing which was done by John Williams.<br/><br/>Overall my favorite Dino movie."
"diegoavilarodriguez","10","2","3","16 June 2010"," My all time favorite film
","This film, to me, is the one I've enjoyed the most out of all the movie I've ever had the chance to watch.<br/><br/>Story/directing: Jurassic park is a 1993 adaption of a book written back in 1990 (I think that's the right date) and of course it has several differences from the book, the story revolves around Alan Grant (Sam Neil) a palaeontologist who next to his partner/lover Ellie Saddler (Laura Dern) are call upon by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to check out a park that he has began to build, a theme park, and he wants them to check it out before really opening the park. Once there Alan and Ellie find out it isn't any ordinary park, but a park filled with live dinosaurs. The storyline of the film is a nice sci-fi tale about cloning and being able to genetically manipulate the extinct species of the dinosaur race, though there are small curse words in the film and some obvious death scenes as well the film can still be enjoyed by children of course with a bit of parental discretion. Now from the beginning to end, the story begins to developed better and has you changing moods to the situations our protagonists find themselves in, one can feel the suspense during the kitchen scene with the raptors and the children, you also feel the delight that Alan and Ellie feel when they see a real dinosaur for the first time. As for the direction Steven Spielberg does a nice job in showing off some nicely executed scenes, giving us a full perspective on the entire island and of course some very original and classic shots such as the t-rex chasing the jeep scene, which is definitely one of the most influential scenes I've seen (aside from several others).<br/><br/>Acting/characters/interaction between them: Now Sam Neil is not a bad actor, not the best there is but he ain't a bad actor, he does a nice job of giving Alan Grant to life, he is able play very well during the scenes and has us believing he is really being attacked by dinosaurs, as for his character, Alan has some nice development through out the film as at first he does not really like children and is excited about the idea of the park being made but by the time the film is near an end Alan becomes more fond of children and obviously is no longer supporting Jurassic park at all. Now I could name another actor but they're not the main appeal of the film (not that they're not great) the ones that really have you at the edge of your seat are the dinosaurs, man, this film was made in 1993 and the visual effects are still awesome, the dinosaurs look so realistic, still these visuals are so much more breath-taking than films like district 9, star trek, avatar, terminator salvation, (all of which I really liked), etc. Now another aspect of the realism of the dinosaurs is how the actors interact with them, when Tim is on the tree and begins to pet the brachiosaurus did seem very natural, and also their struggle when running away from a t-rex or when they're fighting the velociraptors . And between the actors their interaction was pretty nice, you felt these characters were real people trapped in this situation.<br/><br/>Visual effects: Now man, the visuals are awesome, even today I'm amazed this film was done the way it was and the sound of the dinosaurs stomping through the park and pushing the vehicles against the wall, I mean man these visual effects and all of the sounds are just great you hear the roars and the falling cars so well I mean you feel you're there with them.<br/><br/>Overall this is a very exciting film with some great visuals and very incredible sounds as well as a nice scifi story with good acting, to me its the best film I've ever seen."
"nadetarget","10","2","3","16 March 2010"," My Favorite Movie Of All Time!!
","Jurassic Park is my definitive favorite film. No other film can compare to it! Ever since I was six or five I remember in the summer my grandmother bought the movie because I loved dinosaurs at the time. After seeing the movie it inspired me to be a filmmaker at a young age! I love everything about this movie from its effects to its characters and to its story! Jurassic Park is the best movie ever made in my honest opinion. First, the characters are all memorable as I remember each one distinctly when I grew up, Ian Malcolm the insane scientist who as well was a genius too when it came to life and philosophy, one of my favorite characters! Alan Grant, the dinosaur digger (Paleontologist) was also another character who grew very fond and happier through the course of the film as he did not like children but by the end admired and protected the children he was with. Ellie as the love interest and very smart scientist as she adores Alan more throughout the film <3. John Hammond the Walt Disney of Dinosaurs as he is a jolly old Santa like figure only to realize his downfall at the end still liking this character after sacrificing his park to the dinosaurs. The children are children memorable by Tim's spunk and ambition and Lex with her brains and protective views over everyone and everything (the goat). Ray Arnold.. I love Samuel L. Jackson's character he was the head of the tech department of Jurassic Park and had very mad skills with computers and always says a line I love to use, ""Hold on to your butts"". Ned is a very typical villain of the story as he is all about greed as he wants to make dinosaurs of his own but that is his own demise when he is attacked. The other characters as the Lawyer and Hunter are as well good but that's who I remember them as the cool Hunter and greedy Lawyer both desiring a similar trait, gaining much money and destroying these beasts. Second, the story is flat out original! A story about making dinosaurs turning into an adventure horror thriller with two or more subplots concerning the major characters and dinosaurs are shown with great distinction! Third, the CGI in this film I have to say besides ""Avatar"" is one of the best CGI created things on cinema. The dinosaurs look so real I can never tell them apart from the machines or even real life! Direction is beautiful as each shot is memorable and almost everything technical in this movie is so beautifully crafted! Finally, the ending. The end of the film was probably one of the best endings ever as it resolves everything and even has the iconic shot of the T-Rex defeating the Raptors as he stands and roars in victory. Every time I watch that shot I always feel great on how the T-Rex came to save the day much like a metaphor to Boo Radley from ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" very odd metaphor but Boo hides from the world as the T-Rex hides from the world as well. Boo shoots at the children while the T-Rex attacks the characters during the T-Rex break out of gate scene another awesome scene. Till finally the T-Rex comes to save the day from the Raptors attacking the major characters as Boo stops Bob Ewell from attacking the children. Odd metaphor but I can see it ha ha. Overall this film is a masterpiece and I respect it highly as a great film! 10 out 10 on everything. Great Great Great MOVIE!!"

","Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill). a paleontologist, and his assistant-girlfriend, Dr. Ellie (Laura Dern), a paleo-botanist, are digging for dinosaurs in Montana. Although they live quite rustically in a small trailer, they are avid for finding the remains of the large, long-lost reptiles and their food sources. Funded by a wealthy businessman, John Hammond (Sir Richard Attenborough), they are startled to find him at their doorstop one fine day. As Hammond tells it, he needs their help. He has opened a theme park, on an island off the coast of Costa Rica, one that is devoted to dinosaurs. Could these two top-notch scientists come and analyze the place? He, Hammond, would fund their work in America for three more years. They agree and off they go. Joining them as well is Mr. Hammond's lawyer and another scientist, chaos theory master, Dr. Ian (Jeff Goldblum). What the party does not realize is that, using dinosaur DNA found in amber-sap fossils, Hammond has actual dinosaurs grazing on the island! He has stegos, brachios, and, unbelievably, intensely guarded T-rexes and velociraptors! The scientists can't believe what they see. However, as Dr. Ian points out, powerful animals of this nature can not be controlled, for something will always go wrong. Indeed it does. Soon after arriving, the party, which includes Hammond's own two grandchildren, takes a trolley ride tour, one that future visitors will take. But, the scummy computer programmer (Wayne Knight), miffed at his paycheck, steals the dino DNA and runs away, putting the computers in the lurch. Naturally, they break down and the electric fences that guard the fierce creatures quit functioning! Left out in the forests with these monsters, who will stay alive? This is a monumentally great film, in all categories. It has a marvelous cast, a sensational story, intense action sequences, and dazzling philosophical propositions. The computer-generated dinosaurs are utterly amazing and very, very scary. Breathing naturally during a view will be impossible. One of the last scenes, where the T-Rex stands up in full glory while the park sign noting ""dinosaurs ruled the world"" falls to the ground is eye-popping. If you have never seen it, don't delay! Even if you are indifferent to science fiction, action films, or any other genres, this is one film NOT TO BE MISSED! So, grab the DVD and park yourself on the couch for the ride of your life, movie style."

In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is ""better"" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated.

"TheTitaniumDragon","10","2","3","27 November 2006"," One of the best movies ever
","Jurassic Park is an amazing movie. The plot is excellent and it is extremely well executed. Though made in 1993, the mixture of computer graphics and animatronics with the dinosaurs makes the dinosaurs all appear to be extremely lifelike; the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the Velociraptors are gorgeous and look like they're real. This feat has not really been equaled since, and only the Jurassic Park series manage to pull it off. In many years, this movie will be seen as the first movie to pull off its special effects so convincingly.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is quite solid. Children will love it, especially those with interest in science or dinosaurs. It might be frightening for some children, but in general the tension is not from actual violence so much as the threat of violence and what happens off-screen.<br/><br/>There is nothing offensive about this movie; everyone should see it and own it. It is with good reason this movie is one of the highest grossing of all time - it is a classic, and is one of the greatest movies of the 20th century."

Yes, it shows the classics like Tyrannosaurus Rex and Triceratops along a new breed of dinosaurs that were not seen in movies before, the Velioraptor and the Dilophasaurus ( even though how the movie shows maybe inaccurate.

"veemee78","10","2","3","8 July 2006"," CGI... the way it should be
","Jurassic Park is most memorable for its groundbreaking special effects. It was not the first film to use computer-generated imaging, not by a long shot, but it was the first to take the bold step of using CGI, not stop-motion, to create life-like animals. It was very successful in this area; the special effects still hold up (mostly) today. However, even with this powerful new toy, the masterminds of this movie were wise not to overdo the special effects. Instead, different scenes of robotics, CGI, and some clever techniques (the vibrating water in the cup, for example) combine to give the illusion that there really were dinosaurs on that island.<br/><br/>Plot? A movie this big doesn't need a very deep plot, but the one in Jurassic Park is decent enough to make for an engaging thriller. Using a new cloning technique and some shady business skills, the eccentric John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) plans to open a theme park in a Costa Rican tropical island, with live dinosaurs as the main attraction... a guaranteed cash cow. But there's one flaw in his plan: nothing works the way it should. This becomes shockingly evident when a mishap at one of the pens results in one of his workers being eaten alive. Hoping to assure his worried investors that nothing is ""really"" wrong, Hammond persuades several experts into visiting the island to inspect it and come up with their own conclusions. It is during this visit that the worst break-down occurs, and the survivors find that they must get things back online so they can contact the mainland for help.<br/><br/>The cast here is impeccable. Sam Neill is perfect as the soft-spoken paleontologist turned action hero, Laura Dern plays her action scenes with authentic desperation, and Jeff Goldblum will make you wonder if he really is reading off memorized lines. Even the kids (Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards) aren't as bad as they could be.<br/><br/>This all makes for a great film, both memorable in and of itself, and as a reminder of how well CGI can be used. It doesn't have to be present in every scene (e.g. Star Wars), and it doesn't have to be used to create unrealistic battlefields and unbelievable creatures (e.g. just about every science fiction and action film in the last decade). When used as seasoning to an already good movie, it can make for brilliant film-making."

","Well, maybe that's a statement too far, but the special effects, storyline and action hold up just as well today as they did 13 years ago when it was first released. How it is only rated 7.5 and not even in the top 25 or so, let alone outside the top 250, is totally beyond me. I loved this film when I was 6, I love it just as much today and I'll wager I'll love it when I'm 40.<br/><br/>Don't rate this on the quality of sequels as the Lost World was not brilliant and JPIII was dire overkill. The original has good acting, exciting plot line and some parts are even unpredictable (e.g. when Timmy gets fried on the fence!). Some characters (Nedry, Arnold, Muldoon, the Lawyer) get killed and although none of the major characters die you have to expect that.<br/><br/>One thing that really counts in favour of Jurassic Park is the brilliant music. Two main themes that go hand in hand, portraying the emotional parts and the pure action... I recently got the film out of the cupboard just to watch the credits, and with it the marvellous music! The ending scenes, where suddenly after the thrill of 1 T Rex destroying everything we get 5 or 6 Velociraptors hunting methodically, are chilling. The scene in the Kitchen especially gets nerves jangling, whilst the complex where Ellie finds Mr. Arnold's hand is brilliantly done as well.<br/><br/>My only criticism perhaps is that some parts were too predictable. It would have been interesting to see one of the kids being killed about an hour in, as that would set up a situation where major characters COULD die and make the ending scenes that much more tense - but then, that would have been playing with Crichton's storyline.<br/><br/>I'd like to see a version where some of the effects are done up and perhaps a director's cut. It's certainly been long enough and Lucasarts, who seem to have done many of the special effects, have progressed to another level since then."

","This was a great film. I give a two thumbs up to Steven Spielberg and his crew for turning the book written by Michael Crichton into to the big screen. This film is truly remarkable. This film gave all of us an idea of what dinosaurs were then back 65 million years ago and what would happen if Reptiles and Humans collide. the behind the scenes crew were great too! the dinosuars were very well detailed and looked absolutely real. Also Full credit to ILM for such an outsanding job with creating the dinosuars. The first time I saw the film and gazed the at the Beast's I was just dazzled. Five stars to Awrad-winning composer to John Williams. he is truly a very skilled man to composed and write such incredible scores and to have them in many other Big Hit Movies. Steven Spielberg really deserved the Best Director Award."

","Quite possibly one of the best films of all time, and one of the best directorial performances of all time, 'Jurassic Park', is a film that will go down in history as nothing short of a masterpiece. Stephen Spielburg captures; fear, terror, intensity, nervousness, human instinct, and intellect in this action-pact film, that changed the face of scary in 1993. If you haven't seen the film, you need to. It's interesting, logical, and unrealistic as hell, but makes you feel like it could actually happen. I think everyone that loves the movie has seen it at least ten times. It's the kind of movie, you can sit at home and watch on a Friday night on your big screen, and crank the volume up with. It's loud, intense and blows you away at times. Even for it being thirteen years old, already, the creation of the dinosaurs in the film, still seem so realistic to me. I've never watched a film and not been able to see the strings...in this film, you really can't. It's very believable the way that it is presented, and strikes fear into the hearts of even the most apathetic and uninterested people.<br/><br/>After leasing an island off Coasta Rica, Richard Attenborough's character sets up an amusement park of sorts, that's a little more detailed, and high class than what people are normally used to. He, along with three other doctors (A chaos expert, and two dinosaur bone diggers), and a lawyer, helicopter out to the island, to view the scientist's new theme park called, Jurrasic Park. The three doctors are there to determine whether or not, this park is safe and plausible for humans to enter. The two bone collectors are there merely to view it from an objective stand-point, but also to see for themselves what they've wanted to see since they were children. Along with the four adult audience goers, whom will be taking the tour of the park, are the scientist's two grandchildren. The five people, are now on their way for the greatest adventure of their lives. During the tour, the entire park system is shut down. There is a rain storm, it's at night, and the five passengers are all alone now in the Dinasours' wilderness. They have now become the prey. <br/><br/>The film is scary and intense, and will keep you on the edge of your seat, after the first thirty minutes until the very end of the film. It's not a film I would recommend to anyone under thirteen, since it is pretty graphic, and might be strong for anyone under that age. It's otherwise very clean, and a good movie to watch with anyone. It has great scenes, and actually gives a good message in between chase scenes, that life is meant for the Creator, and not for humans to decide. <br/><br/>I love the film, and it will remain a classic until the end of time."
"ebiros2","10","2","3","6 January 2006"," Landmark Movie of the 20th Century
","Once or twice in a life time an event happens which makes you feel you're glad you've lived long enough to see it. This movie is one of them. <br/><br/>I've been a staunch Dino fan since I was small. I used to visit museums on weekends to see the dinosaur fossils. I was awed by their size and beauty, but felt bit sad that I'll never be able to see the real thing. But because of advancement in computer technology, we can see the dinosaurs reanimated. <br/><br/>Even after all these years, CGI in this movie is still believable, and integration to their surroundings, seamless. It wasn't a prototype, but a very polished product, and it was the first of its kind. I have yet to see a CGI based movie that has out classed this movie.<br/><br/>This is a landmark in movie making, and is highly recommended for viewing."
"pyrocitor","10","2","3","5 January 2006"," Life has found a way
","I must confess to having always had a soft spot for dinosaurs. Ever since a very young age, dinosaurs have never failed to fascinate, interest, and more importantly, entertain me. I believe the same is also true for most of the general public - dinosaurs are just interesting creatures, no matter what way you look at them. It would therefore seem an excellent premise for a film, to have dinosaurs, which always serve to be entertaining, and show them in a modern context interacting with everyday humans we can relate to and sympathise for. And that, I believe, is the beauty of Jurassic Park - it's ability to blend the real with the fantastic, to make a film that is, in the end, fictional, and yet so grounded in reality. And director Steven Spielberg does so to the extent of his considerable ability here in Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>Spielberg has shown, throughout his extensive career, that he has an almost uncanny ability for entertaining his audiences. Whether it be clutching the sides of our seat white knuckled in fear and tension or evoking tears out of the most stubborn viewer, Spielberg has proved a master at manipulating the emotions of his audience, and more importantly, providing them with the entertainment they want to see. <br/><br/>And what better way to entertain an audience then an island full of dinosaurs, breaking loose and wreaking havoc? Indeed, Jurassic Park remains the best of the best of action thriller movies, still managing to evoke enormous tension and suspense even after multiple viewings. The infamous scene with the velociraptors in the kitchen still manages to scare the hell out of me, even after having seen it countless times. This is emotional storytelling at its very best.<br/><br/>It's admittably true that the special effects are very much the focus here, and they are indeed enough to hold up the movie by themselves alone. Almost 15 years on, the dinosaurs still look and act astonishingly real, and the animatronic effects prove so much more effective than today's CGI bloated blockbusters, since having real robotic dinosaurs make them seem so much more real - they actually interact with people and objects like real creatures. It still amazes me what we are capable of, technologically in film these days, and it's really only the Lord of the Rings movies, Peter Jackson's recent King Kong and the Jurassic Park movies than manage to impress me to such a degree.<br/><br/>But Spielberg isn't content to have a movie dominated by impressive technological effects - he still manages to bring excellent performances out of all his actors. All cast members are perfectly cast, and manage to come across as entirely real and in-depth people rather than shallow movie characters, especially Sam Niel's rough-around-the-edges palaeontologist Alan Grant, and Jeff Goldblum's eccentric chaoitician Ian Malcolm. But Laura Dern is also very engaging and affecting as spunky paleobotanist Ellie Sattler. Sir Richard Attenborough effortlessly steals the movie from all but the dinosaurs, as the visionary founder of the park, John Hammond. But performances are pitch perfect across the board, even from child actors Joseph Mazello and Ariana Richards. Watch also for supporting roles from a pre-stardom Samuel L. Jackson and comic Wayne Knight.<br/><br/>So all together, Jurassic Park is easily one of my very favourite movies of all time, and clearly deserves to be recognised as one of the most entertaining movies ever created. Just as John Hammond wished to create an entire new world for the pleasure of others, Steven Spielberg and his crew have done the same, working from the brilliant novel by Michael Crighton. If you are among the few who have yet to see Jurassic Park, I would strongly recommend do so. In terms of penultimate entertainment and stylish movie magic... life has found a way.<br/><br/>-10/10"

","So, i am strained to think of another film which; a) stretches the imagination of the viewers, young and old. b) uses cutting edge technology and designed new mechanics for the sole purpose of entertainment and c) has a great cast and crew. Everything about this film was magnificent; Neill, Goldblum, Attenbourgh, Peck are amazing actors and all made you believe what was happening was real. The direction was superb, Spielberg captivating the imagery of the dinosaurs and changing what they mean to us. Williams, what can i say, the man is a accomplished musician and this is amongst his best work. breathtaking. The set design (besides the Rex paddock) was immense; full of colour and detail. The script was good for a major blockbuster that sits amongst the top films of all time. The plot is so imaginative, never before has anything been thought of like it. Its does well to balance reality with fiction; genetics with fantasy; science with action. Jurassic Park is a great film. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you go out and rent it, no buy it, because its a film you don't want to miss and will enjoy watching for years to come! **********"

","While The Empire Strikes Back is the best film of all time for me, Jurassic Park is the film that got me into my current film-making career. More specifically, it was a combination of factors in one key scene - the helicopter sequence as the characters approach the island. The acting interaction in this scene between Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Richard Attenborough was very heartfelt (attributed to their acting skills and director Steven Spielberg), the cinematography was spectacular, and last but not least, the music of John Williams. I must make a special note here, John Williams' score for this film is legendary, having really gotten me first hooked to film music and then films in general in the first place. I really do look forward to each successive score that maestro Williams does (I just bought Memoirs of a Geisha - another great score). Although the story is a bit weak, otherwise Jurassic Park is above and beyond a typical action film. Well done Spielberg and Williams!"

John Hammond ( the billionaire ), builds a huge park with dinosaurs in it, then he invites the two paleontoligists, Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler, and the mathmatican, Ian Malcolm to the park. Malcolm seems to predict something bad is going to happen, while Hammond doesn't believe him. But then, on their first tour, everything goes wrong. The dinosaurs brake out, and everything is chaos. In the scene when the tyrannosaur breaks out, Malcolm brakes his leg, and the survivors have to find their way around the island, to escape.

","The first film to modernize and embellish digital fx, Jurassic Park was ahead of its time and is still a revered film.A Paleoentologist and a Paleobotanist are given the opportunity to embark with an eccentric visionary to a one of a kind island to give an endorsement. With the discovery of Mr. Hammond's fantastical new dream made a bold reality, things go awry when a sabotage occurs and the prehistoric beasts run amok restoring them to their primal state.The point being that nothing can contain that which is inherently wild, therefore teaching arrogant men not to tamper with nature's delicate balance. While it may be disguised as a 'summer blockbuster' what lies within Jurassic Park is a testament for those willing to look.It makes its point with plenty of action and terrific visuals to boast.Watch for Richard Attenborough's poetic speech about the illusion of creation and control.The juxtaposition of man and dinosaur being a scathing parable for all that would wish to create something as defiant and new as Hammond's genetic monstrosities.Both beautiful and frightful, the dinosaurs serve as a warning for mankind to know his balance.With a perfect cast and a truly original story, the film never feels tired or redundant.Spielberg has not made a film of this caliber since."

Back then my friends and I would walk home from school every day and watch Jurassic Park again and again and it never got old. A few years ago I decided to revisit it from a more knowledgeable and experienced point of view. I was again blown away. Mr. Spielberg managed to out do him self in the creature horror genre with a movie even better then Jaws. JP may have the best movie soundtrack in the history of cinema. The acting is amazing.

","OK, this movie, for a start, is not a good adaptation from the novel of Michael Cricthon. I read the novel, I like the novel a lot, but this movie is just the example of the best thing you can do with such complicated material. Dinosaurs back to life using DNA from fossilized mosquitoes. Why I didn't have that idea? It sounds logical, even with the fractal errors about clone extinct beings.<br/><br/>But let's stick to the movie, not to the science. Let's say Fiction, no Science Fiction. Jurassic Park is one of those movies that will pass to history, not only because the massive Box Office, but for it's amazing visual effects and animatronics, that nowadays are scarier than in the sequels. The rhythm and narrative pulse of Spielberg is in every frame, in every scene and every sequence of the movie, with a prologue of 45 where you see the exposition of the moral problem about cloning, then everything goes down the hill after that prologue. As it used to say, all the hell breaks lose, the fences stop working, the dinosaurs scape, we are lost. The attack of the T Rex to the jeep with the two children inside is breath-taking, makes you feel shivers down your spine and cold sweat. Just see how it crashed the vehicle with them trying to scape makes you see the scene almost from the spots between your fingers 8at least I was that way the first time I saw it, well, I was 8 years old :D) But hey, that action doesn't end there, it continues. The Dilophosaur eats Neddry after let him blind. The T Rex runs behind the jeep of Malcom and Ellie. The raptors scape! COOL!!! That kitchen scene, another creepy moment with the funny ""tac-tac"" of the raptor's toenail. And the big ending of epic proportions in the Visitor Center, makes you cheer for the T Rex. Yeah Rexie! Eat that raptor again! Crunch it's spine against that giant skeleton! A blockbuster that will not suffer the past of time, in fact, the most time since it release, the most value it takes, like good wine."

His main feature are dinosaurs. To get the lawyers of his back he invites a variety of people ranging from a representative from a law firm suing him (Donald Genarro-Martin Ferrero, a mathematician (Ian Malcolm-Jeff Goldblum), and Dr. Sattler(Laura Dern) and Dr. Alan Grant, who are paleontologist. but all goes wrong while on the tour when a computer nerd shuts down the island an the Tyrannosours Rex, Velociraptors, and 'Spitters' escape and attack the guests. The sole goal of the guests now is to get off the island with their lives.<br/><br/>The film was a major advancement in visual effects and animatronics. Film crews actually building a T-Rex and designers virtually building velociraptors. The scenes are beautifully shot and filled with action. The film is a little intense for children even though they may love dinosaurs. The book I am currently reading and is close to film.

And the special effects are amazing, I still haven't seen any better ones, as nowadays they look like they are computer generated.

","I am writing a new review because my previous one does not go as in depth as I'd have liked it to.<br/><br/>I love Jurassic Park, simply because of its sheer genius and creative storytelling.  Finally somebody has done it correctly.  I'm not just talking about the prehistoric animals that are shown here, I'm also talking about the excellent plot and character development.  And, of course, the music.<br/><br/>The plot is not quite as simple as you'd think.  It's not a story in which the animals simply get loose and go on a rampage.  No, Jurassic Park is much more than that, with several subplots that, rather than tying you into a web, simply keep you interested by holding everything together.<br/><br/>The CGI is simply amazing.  Tying it into real life must have been difficult, yet the animators did a superb job.  I was impressed at how smoothly these animals moved, how realistic they seemed although nobody living has seen one.  Seamless integration always catches my attention.<br/><br/>The actors are a major factor of this movie.  Jeff Goldblum is perfect as the twitty scientist who knows more than everybody thinks he does.  Sam Neill, too, is perfect for his role as Alan Grant.  The other actors, though not as amazing as these two, hold up their own characters excellently.<br/><br/>The music, composed by John Williams, has an excellent theme.  Probably one of the greatest in the century.  It could almost be a love theme, but strays from the sappy tunes and goes to a mysterious, joyful tune of admiration for these animals that will enthrall any listener.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is most definitely one of my most favorite movies of all time. It combines science and logic with nature and survival.  It isn't a brainless killing spree.  No, it's an intellectual dive into the modern nature of our own world.<br/><br/>My advice?  Watch it.  Buy it on DVD.  It's nearly perfect."

In fact, it's a classic sci-fi film. It's the classic big budget summer movie from Hollywood. It's the 50s monster movie that looks all the more convincing for better effects. The 'serious' overlay is no different than that of Them or The Thing, as the scientists or survivors discuss the 'bigger picture'. There's just a little too much, with not enough humor, of that, in this. Dern and Grandpa shout over the dinette table, but carry on too long, and cry about it all. Goldblum pounds the conference table in a 50s-looking soundstage with lots of projector screens oddly surrounding it. Serious issue, man made the atom bomb, or man created dinosaurs from the DNA of bullfrogs. Issue made. Now let Mothra rage - or whatever is let loose.<br/><br/>The special effects are an improvement over the pure model and stop motion of the past. Harryhausen's work is still watchable, and believable (his crab in Mysterious Island). But here, for the first time, you see dinosaurs done right. Maybe the full size models of T-Rex bobbing and weaving around the jeep, and poking its head into the glass, is a little stiff, and Harryhausen did better, or would have. But splice in the CGI T-Rex ripping off the tires, or chasing Goldblum, and its entirely different, and very believable. A shame they wind up with a smaller Rex in the indoor lobby. The Rex on the grassy field was more in keeping to scale with the one that injured Goldblum - and killed the annoying lawyer.<br/><br/>Won't mention all the plot holes and continuity errors, even just in that one scene in the jeep fleeing the T-Rex at night. And the kids and the electrified fence. Kids go through the holes - oh, wait - big noise in background, up you go, hurry! That bothered me even when I first saw it in the theatre. Dern and Neil holding the raptor at bay outside the control room - TIMMY! get the darned gun. The kid's just pounding the back of Lex's chair as she says - this is UNIX system. And then the gun jams when the raptor does break the glass. How convenient. Game hunter in the woods - run Laura, run, no, you can't, they're watching us, run, run now, wait, you'll never make it, go, GO! (reminded me, vaguely, of the Kirk/Spock comedy routine with Mrs. Camden in movie 4) But it's just a movie. It could have been much better. I don't remember those kind of holes in something like Them or even Mysterious Island (which really was a hodge-podge).<br/><br/>But it's a good film, still. The cliches and cliched camera movements work. The CGI were excellent, if inconsistent. It still holds up in 2002. If The Thing, by Hawkes, is a classic film, and with a far better script and dialog than JP, and obviously less graphic where the horror and gore are only related second person, then even so JP is still, without question, a classic along the same lines as those old sci-fi films."
"Shannon-32","9","2","3","30 June 2002"," Butt-kicking action and a cool musical score, too!
","Let's face it.  Out of all the three movies in the JP movie series, this one just kicks butt.  It stayed the truest to Michael Crition's bestseller, unlike ""Lost World,"" where it practically tore the story apart. <br/><br/>
The musical score in the movie is just absolutely breathtaking.  When I eventually get a DVD player, this film will definitely be in my collection!<br/><br/>Excellent direction by Steven Spielberg and acting by Sam Neil as Dr. Alan Grant."

","This movie is extremely creative at trying to make an adventurous theme park with mixing some dinosaurs in and soon enough letting hell break loose.  The acting is very cool in this especially from Sam Neill.  His character is very cool and he fits the part correctly.  Laura Dern is great and very hot and her character was good.  Jeff Goldblum was there and pretty funny, but his character was ruined in the sequel Lost World.  This movie is pretty violent at scenes but the rest of the parts are interesting.<br/><br/>Overall the whole movie, from acting to directing, was excellent.  Rating 10 out of 10."

"Rinho","10","2","3","18 December 1999"," My favourite film
","I´m sorry for my English, I think you will find a few mistakes in my comment. But now I start the comment: Jurasssic Park. That´s ( one of ) my favourite film(s) of all time. I loved it from beginning to the end, esspecially the scene which in the T-rex  comes out of his area and starts to hunt the people. The action is great, the music too, Steven Spielberg ( the best director ever )does ( again ) a great job,the special effects are well-made, of course, too and just everything is great. I´ve only seen one Steven Spielberg film which I didn´t like, and that´s Close Encounters of the third kind. But all the other films of him ( Indy 1 - 3, Jaws, Duel, Jurassic Park 1 & 2, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, SCHINDLER´S LIST ) impressed me a lot. I don´t understand why this film doesn´t get the Top250. I don´t understand why films like L.A.Confidential,Touch of Evil, The Godfather Part II, and get the Top250, but not this film. I´ve been interested in Dinosaurs my whole life and so this film is of course great. This isn´t anything like King Kong or Godzilla: The monster(s) must be killed, because we are human and we have the best technology of the world, we can win against the nature ( that´s no English I think ) and so on. This film shows that the dinosaurs are also animals like dogs, cats or fish ( but not sharks ). If you haven´t seen this film yet, GO AND SEE IT ! ! !"

","Jurassic Park is by far the best movie I have ever seen.  Even now, when the film itself is over 6 years old, it still captivates the mind with every viewing.  The special effects are still mesmerizing, the awe of the scientists as they see the living dinosaurs for the first time is still believable, the terror of the kids in the midst of premordial danger is still felt.  Three cheers and four stars for this timeless classic."

Particularly Jeff Goldblum, whom I have adored since television's ""Tenspeed & Brownshoe""--his sarcasm jumps out of the screen, memorably, ""are they going to have THAT on the tour?""  to which Richard Attenborough mumbles under his breath, ""I really DO hate that man!""<br/><br/>Is there anything Spielberg can't do?

I thought: 'what a lame idea, people trying to catch dinosaurs' but then I heard it was about a movie.<br/><br/>The movie is great. When I first saw it I was really convinced that the dinosaurs were for real. The movie made a big impression to me. After viewing to movie a couple of times, I noticed how John Williams soundtrack added so much to the movie. The  acting isn't as horrible as some say. Jeff Goldblum is great as Ian Malcolm, Laura Dern is as usual... good looking. The jokes are funny, I still laugh about them (not the Timmy jokes).<br/><br/>The movie is a definite must see. It meant a turning point in special fx, and it started the debate of cloning. But it's just a very entertaining movie. Nothing more, nothing less.

","Jurassic Park' is one of the greatest Spielberg Classics of all time.  It surpassed Spielberg's own `E.T.' at the Box Office and still remains one of the highest grossing films.  Jurassic Park' combines all of Spielberg's movie wizardry along with Chrichton's  excellent story about a theme park inhabited by genetically engineered theme-park dinosaurs, and good performances by Neill, Dern, Goldblum and of course the great Lord Richard Attenborough .  #1 on my list of Spielberg's greatest, followed by E.T., The Indiana Jones trilogy, Jaws, Saving Private Ryan, and A.I."
"sam_nas","10","2","3","3 March 2002"," Stop complaining :)
","A lot of people complain about some inaccuraties in JP movies.  For starters, they say that the velociraptors are too big, they find other mistakes, etc.  However, the movie is about CREATING dinosaurs.  The dinosaurs are not real, they are manufactured by humans through DNA.  They said in the movie that the DNA they find isn't complete and they fill in the blanks with frog dna, etc.  So to all the people & experts complaining about some inaccuraties, remember that those are not real dinosaurs but ones that were created by humans in some lab.  Therefore the dinosaurs are kind of ""monsters"" created through some real dinosaurs dna and of course you can't expect them to be exactly like the real thing.  That being said, the dinosaurs are VERY close to reality, and raptors that big DO exist (Utahraptor has been discovered and is even bigger then the ones in JP), it's just that their name is different.  Overall, the dinosaurs are very accurate and whenever there's inaccuraties, the explaination is that they were created in a lab by humans.  Even today a lot of unanswered questions remain, so nobody can say how dinosaurs were and behaved 100%, JP movies are the closest you'll ever come to dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Now when it comes to the movie, it's the most awesome experience you'd want to witness.  I love the movie and all its sequels.  I recommend it to everyone & I can't wait for JP4."
"cLoNe","10","2","3","22 July 2001"," A great thrill ride.
","The groundbreaking computer generated dinosaurs are only one aspect that makes this movie so cool. An engrossing bizarre plot about men playing God and fantastic action-adventure scenes make this movie really exciting and enjoyable.<br/><br/>   It is a mixture of many great ingredients: horror, action, comedy, thriller, suspense. And everything is directed with great efficiency by Spielberg. <br/><br/>   I read the book before I saw the movie and I was disappointed to see the horror and the violence toned down so much, as well as missing some of the dinosaurs that didn't make it through the adaptation (though the ""missing"" dinosaurs were finally introduced in JP3). But I wasn't THAT disappointed.<br/><br/>   It's simply enjoyable. It's like one big roller coaster ride. It is a bit formulaic, but also inventive and very well done."
"OllieSuave-007","9","2","3","4 May 2001"," One Thrilling Dino-Film!
","I first watched this movie in the theaters and it was one heck of a ride. Here, two doctors who studied prehistoric plants and dig dinosaur bones were invited by a billionaire to his theme park, inhabited by cloned dinosaurs brought back to life by preserved DNA. All goes well as the doctors, joined by an attorney, a mathematician and the billionaire's grandkids, tour the park. But, all is chaos when a greedy park technician, wanting to smuggle dinosaur embryos off the island in exchange for some big cash, shuts down the park so he alone can escape, which releases he dinosaurs from their confinement. Then, it is a fight for survival for those remaining on the island as the dinosaurs roam free. <br/><br/>The dinosaurs are very realistic and inspiring, very well-executed. The special and visual effects used to bring the creatures to life take the meaning of a dinosaur film to a whole new level. <br/><br/>Each of the actors gave a memorable and solid performance in their respectable roles. I especially enjoyed actor Martin Ferrero's role as Donald Gennaro; him hiding in a public restroom trying to escape from the just-escape T-Rex is one of the most memorable scenes in the movie. I also enjoyed Jeff Goldblum's role as Ian Malcolm, as he gave the movie needed humor with comedy relief. Sam Neill and Laura Dern delivered good drama and on-screen comprehension and Bob Peck did an excellent and daring job as ""game"" warden. <br/><br/>The music by John Williams is terrific and very haunting; his theme for the first appearance of the Brachosaurus will etch in the minds of many and will go on to become this movie's signature theme. Director Steven Spielberg gave some of his finest work, giving us a movie with a solid plot and a charming story that will delight an audience of all ages for years to come. And, all the running, screaming, and thrilling scenes of the dinosaurs and the human characters are edge-of-the-seat excitement.<br/><br/>Excellent dinosaur film and definitely one of the greatest movies of its time.<br/><br/>Grade A"
"Rinho18","10","2","3","18 February 2001"," My number 1 movie ( contains possible spoilers )
","Jurassic Park is my all time favorite movie. Great, sensationally, fascinating, astounding : This movie does not deserve those words, it is much better.<br/><br/>This movie has just the greatest special effects ever. What I love about this movie ( unlike to Godzilla, King Kong, Terminator 2 or something ), is that the story is more important than the special effects, and not the other way round. Another thing is, that the guys do not say : oh, we are human beings, so we have to kill every single animal danger that there is ( see : in the whole movie, you cannot see even one shot ). Comparison : In Godzilla there were about 1647. I wonder how anyone can not like this movie at all. I am almost embarrassed to say that I have seen this movie just 18 times, but in the end of the year 2001 I will have watched it at least 50 times. I started to watch this movie at least one time a week. I could quote every part of this film, but I still cannot have enough of it. I never get tired of seeing this movie.<br/><br/>Good points of Jurassic Park: Music, Steven Spielberg, character development, everything on the stylistic level, the camera work, audio/visual effects, the story and the way it is told, the T Rex, the velociraptor, every single scene with a dinosaur in it ( and the others, too ), actors  ((Alan Grant ( Sam Neill ), John Hammond ( Richard Attenborough ), Ellie Sattler ( Laura Dern ), Ray Arnold ( Samuel L. Jackson ), Tim Murphy ( Joseph Mazzelo ) , Lex Murphy ( Ariana Richards ), Dennis Nedry ( Wayne Knight ), Ian Malcolm ( Jeff Goldblum ), Robert Muldoon ( Bob Peck ), Lewis Dodgson ( Cameron Thor ) and Henry Wu ( B. D. Wong )), the first 60 minutes, and the last 60 minutes, the suspense, maybe even horror, if you are young, the action, the humor ( the bit that there is ), the way that the characters tell their arguments to do/do not approve the park, and every single shot that you can see.<br/><br/>Bad points : the dilophosaur, there was a bit too much of Dennis Nedry ( just a little bit ), a few goofs.<br/><br/>My favorite parts : the T Rex scenes, the kitchen scene, both scenes with the brachiosaur, the ending ( in the helicopter, with that GREAT music ). This movie maybe has my three all-time-favorite film parts : the Rex breaking out, the ending and the brachiosaur visiting Alan, Lex and Tim in the tree.<br/><br/>This is a definite milestone in cinema history, and I hope it will still be remembered in 50 years. I still have to live about 70 years, and I promise, that this will ever be my favorite movie. There has never been, there is no, and there will never be a better movie than Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg works his magic again, and he is by FAAAAR my favorite director, and this is one reason why I like him THAT much. OK, he made some bad films, but films like Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler´s List ( my Top 3 movies ) will stay masterpieces forever. I think that every other director would have made another King Kong or Godzilla from the script, but Steven knew what to do, and this is one reason why I love him. Don't listen to the negative reviews or claims that this movie was just a ""sell out""- because it's not. George Lucas has an army of advertising blitzes and action figures and countless other crap, for his overrated films, but he makes ""magic"".<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is the reason that I am a film fan. Since I watched this film in 1996 on TV, I watched about 700 films, but there is no movie that came up to it. Till 1998 this was not my all-time favorite, but one day I decided that this is just the greatest thing on earth. This is better than The Lost World ( which is my number 6 movie ), because it is not that much concentrated on action ( I like action, but Jurassic Park shows exactly the same length of action scenes, and The Lost World was a bit too much concentrated on the action ). I hope that I will be able to watch this movie with JP2 and JP3 in a feature in summer, when Jurassic Park 3 enters the screen. I´d love to watch this movie on the big screen and I can't wait for the sequel. If there had not been Schindler´s List"", this should have gotten the 7 awards that Schindler won.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is, on a scale from 1 to 10, a definite 1000. It could not have been better. For anyone who hasn't yet seen this classic film, what are you waiting for?<br/><br/>Thanks to everyone that gave us such a great film. We can only be thankful that this movie was made.<br/><br/>Can't wait for the sequel, although it is without the masters Steven Spielberg ( on the director's chair ) and John Williams. A definite 1000/10.<br/><br/>If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. Is there anyone out there who loves the film as much as I do ?<br/><br/>Cu; Rinho."

Many of today's special f\x in movies can't compare to those in Jurassic Park. Steven Speilberg outdid himself with this one.  Sure, some people say that the movie didn't have any depth and not really any development.  I say.... who cares!!!!  It was a great action ride that sparked the 'computer-generated' era in movies. I loved that they made a second one, which im sorry to say didn't live up to the first one, but which sequel does?  I can't wait until the third one comes out.... and i'll be first in line to see it.

","In general, I dislike everything Spielberg, but his vomitive capacity to make movies full on cheap and cheesy sentimentalism, went a bit absent in this massive movie about dinosaurs. As a kid in love of them I can't deny I thank him so much for bringing dinosaurs ""to life"" like never before and after in this film, without putting too much attention on the human part of the story, like Godzilla.<br/><br/>The ""family"" theme is there, but the rest is focus on the moral dilemma of humans ""playing God"", creating these creatures that we would never really see, but this film brought to us as close as possible.<br/><br/>Little to say. The story is very simple, the science quickly and fantastically explained (whether the science ""makes sense"" or not, I don't really know), the escalating tension is well done, the characters believable and, like I said, the balance between plot and spectacle, just perfect.
The acting was really consistent in somewhat easy roles (except for the surprise/admiration/fear of the first encounter with ""real"" dinosaurs). The score from Williams, superb. The CGI still holds up 25+ years later, and the practical effects amazing."

And basically nearly crapping my pants. I mean at 13 it scared the utter crap out of me. It was the first movie with digital surround sound and it was amazing. Steven Spielberg's popcorn masterpiece has a number of sequels at this point but nothing even comes close to the original. It's scary, funny, smart and action packed. It's nearly flawless in every way from the perfect performances pretty much all around except for some questionable moments from Dern. The movie's spectacular effects also hold up surprisingly well. It's still the best blending of practical and CGI to date. The characters are developed enough to care about and the movies pacing is perfect from the awe inspiring thrills of the first third to the primal terror in its final half.

","I've not visited this film for nigh on twenty years (is it that long) and what I came across was a film that took me back to the day I watched it on the cinema screen.<br/><br/>The story based on Michael Crichton's novel is directed by great film director Steven Spielberg.

"melissamckoy","10","1","1","4 November 2019"," Pretty Much Perfect, Classic
","This movie seems like a prime example of how film critics' opinions often radically diverge from those of the masses. This movie was thrilling when I first saw it (upon its release) and remains a treat to this day. I enjoy it every time I watch it. Storytelling, score, casting--this movie got pretty much everything right. In my opinion, it's near perfect, and no dinosaur movie (or TV show) that has followed it has come even close to touching it, not even the series this movie spawned. One of my favorite elements of Jurassic Park is that the dinosaurs--even the velociraptors--aren't the ""villain"" of the movie.<br/><br/>Human greed and hubris are the bad guys here, and the dinosaurs are the means by which humans are put in their place, humbled by the realization of the limits of their knowledge, understanding and power before nature. In the real world, people continue to display the same greed and arrogant pride this movie warns against. I keep thinking that all the smart idiots in the world need to watch this movie! Like the geniuses in Jurassic Park, without full understanding of what they're doing and what will result, they mess with nature and modify genes and whatnot and create problems they couldn't or don't care to foresee--or they do foresee the negative consequences and go forward anyway. But I digress.<br/><br/>In short, this movie is both awesome and smart, a true classic."

","Spielberg introduces us to a world where fiction becomes reality, where the dream of many is fulfilled: to see a living dinosaur. Dinosaurs are nothing more than animals that end up wrapping themselves in an unnatural environment that they will end up defending violently, all thanks to the hand of man and the desire for power and control in an attempt to become an indisputable god."
"TheMovieDoctorful","10","1","1","11 October 2019"," ""I wanted to give them something that wasn't an illusion.""
","Escapist cinema doesn't get any more magical than Jurassic Park. It's a film that enchanted me as a child and awakens my inner child as an adult like no other. Every second on Isla Nublar is a reminder of nature's majesty and mystery that got me labeled ""the animal fact kid"" as a grade schooler. Not even just the dinosaurs, the lush, tropical greenery set against that epic, rousing score gets my attention and awe the moment Hammond's helicopter arrives on Nublar. The beauty of what Hammond and InGen have created is so hypnotizing, it's incredibly easy to forget their failures. Even its scenes of gruesome violence and death have an odd primal allure to them, the spell remaining unbroken. Those failures aren't what cynics and detractors of the franchise as a whole will tell you; the sheer act of creating dinosaurs wasn't Hammond's mistake. It was treating nature as entertainment.<br/><br/>The sequels, contrary to what people will say, are not bad (Outside Jurassic Park III, at least), nor do they betray the original's themes. Both The Lost World and Fallen Kingdom do a perfect job showing the utter horrors of commercializing life itself as product. The original Jurassic Park, however, has a different goal. It's to suck the audience into the illusion that said commercialization is something positive and valid. Hammond didn't set up Jurassic Park as a nature preserve to study these animals for scientific purposes or to create a new ecosystem. There's a reason he describes Jurassic Park as a ""theme park"" first and foremost. There's a reason he puts a macho, toxically masculine Great White Hunter in charge of security instead of a biologist or paleontologist (who he only seeks out when faced with legal trouble) ""Everyone in the world has the right to enjoy these animals!"" he practically gloats. They're his personal toys, created for the purpose of amusement and blatant exploitation. They're denied even the basic right to breed outside a controlled environment, every baby's birth oversought by Hammond himself (who will certainly forget about each and every one) rather than a responsible and doting parent. While Hammond's characterization is certainly less malevolent than in Michael Crichton's rich source material, he's still very much unsympathetic and unsubstantial on multiple fronts. It's no accident that he began life as a professional charlatan working a flea circus.<br/><br/>It's curious how people always want to highlight Ian Malcolm as the voice of reason here. In this film, at least, he comes off more like a contrarian cynic than anything (He's wiser and more idealistic in The Lost World, but only after spending time in the company of death in the first film) If anyone provides sincere reason in this film, it's Dr. Ellie Sattler. From the very beginning, she's not just throwing cheap shots like Malcolm, she's making genuine observations of Hammond's failures. Picking poisonous plants for display in his visitor center for aesthetic reasons, bringing dinosaurs into an environment they don't fully recognize to interact regularly with a species it has never met, allowing poisonous berries in dinosaur enclosures purely because an accident hasn't happened yet, these are very specific problems that Ellie is quick to point out. One of my biggest (and only) problems with the sequels was that Ellie never really had a presence in any of them despite being the biggest role model and smartest characater in the original film by far. Malcolm has plenty of development in the first film, as does Grant, but Ellie feels like the most constructive and positive force against the carnage of Jurassic Park by far.<br/><br/>The flea circus scene between Ellie and Hammond is one of my favorites in film history. The battle between self righteous ego (""Creation is an act of pure will!"") and well rounded logic (""It's still the flea circus!"") is as brutal and staying as any dinosaur attack. It wonderfully highlights both Ellie's strength while bringing Hammond's pathos and narcissism to the forefront. It's not quippy or catchy and it's rarely quoted, but it's easily the best written and acted scene in the film as well as the most powerful.<br/><br/>Everyone's discussed it, but I would be remiss not to talk about the revolutionary special effects. The animatronics and CGI perfectly balance the weight of these prehistoric titans with their stunning speed. The biggest problem with modern CGI is its negligence to recognize the complexity and rawness of flesh, of muscle, of brawn. Jurassic Park's achievement in capturing that rawness is something seen maybe 2 - 5 times a decade. At least one of those times per decade, it's by a film in this very franchise. It's a standard practically unreachable by an age that uses it as a crutch more than a tool.<br/><br/>The musical score has more than earned its place as a classic, but even that has a depth to it that goes unrecognized. Its frequent use of Congo drums after its initial use of a rousing, trumpeting anthem definitely fits with a story about capitalist exploitation of the unknown for its own petty entertainment. It really speaks to the level of detail put into the entire production that even the musical score brings weight to the themes.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese recently made the statement that superhero films were ""theme park cinema"", which has caused a fair amount of uproar, but films like this make me question whether that's a derogatory statement at all. Theme park films can be high brow. They can have character and themes and genuine weight, they can inspire and captivate and teach. Jurassic Park is a prime example of that and one of the most nuanced, critical and thematically rich blockbusters of all time that never loses its rewatchability."

","Welcome to Jurassic Park! I love Jurassic Park when I was a kid and to this day. When I watched the film, my eyes were wide opened. T-Rex is my favorite killing dinosaur. There were great thrills with the T-Rex and raptors. John Williams is a pure genius when he composed the soundtrack of the entire movie. Jeff Goldblum was hilarious as Ian Malcolm. Ariana Richards who played Lex got her screaming skill from the legendary Fay Wray. I saw that from behind the scenes that Wray was on set.

"ElMaruecan82","9","1","1","7 March 2019"," 1993: The Year Spielberg was the King of the World...
","So many contrasts cohabite in ""Jurassic Park"", prehistoric relics and living dinosaurs, living dinosaurs and men's technology, men's technology and their total disregard for nature, the culminating point of the homo (not-so) sapiens and the downfall caused by his hubris. So in a man's creation that couldn't possibly go wrong, we have another man's creation bound to fail... with extreme prejudice.<br/><br/>Indeed, as the film's arc quote says ""life will find a way"", but once you give life that little impulse, it might come hand in hand with death, as part of its great cycle. And dinosaurs might simply remind men that they can be God, but they can be dinner as well. That's why 65 million years separate us from our reptilian ancestors. Men could deal with lions, tigers and bears, but dinosaurs, oh, my!<br/><br/>But that didn't affect the enthusiasm of John Hammond portrayed by the unforgettable Richard Attenborough. Hammond is an eccentric businessman with such dangerous ideas they fall into the mad scientist trope, a mix of Willy Wonka (for the cane and the dreamy location), Dr. Moreau (for the Island and the dangerous implications) and Colonel Sanders (for the white suit, the elderly gentleman manners and the cunning business sense). But don't get it wrong, Hammond is a small player compared to his real-life counterpart Spielberg who spared no expenses to make the title work better than the park itself, generating almost a billion dollar of profit out of 65 million dollars for marketing, starting with the number itself.<br/><br/>It's jut as if there was something coming full circle in the history of evolution, in the name of science and Spielberg's fascination for the little ideas that grow into visual wonders and challenges for Hollywood craftsmanship. ""Jurassic Park"" is in fact Spielberg coming full circle with his own career evolution, two decades after his groundbreaking ""Jaws"". There's no doubt that it was Spielberg and only Spielberg who was capable to make such a film, Michael Crichton wrote and conceived the idea but Spielberg made it a universally acclaimed family-friendly blockbuster and the landmark that redefined film-making and started the digital revolution.<br/><br/>With the same ""J"", ""Jurassic Park"" is the ""Jaws"" of the nineties ensuring a smooth transition from practical to computer-aided effects. In the make-it-or-break-it moment of the film, when Sam Neil and Laura Dern (playing a couple of paleontologists) discover the real attraction of the park, their dropped jaws echo our own wonder, Neil's tears looked like what could've been George Melies' reaction had he seen how far cinema went. And that these effects still hold up today is a tribute to the perfectionism of Spielberg.<br/><br/>Spielberg who, by the way, was still capable to direct ""Schindler's List"" while supervising this project from Poland. Maybe the former was too personal a movie it could only force him to take the latter as personally on a technical level... and with a more business-driven hindsight. After all, if it's any consolation for Spielberg's detractors, the film also betrays his own hubris: you can't help but spot the Spielberg's self-awareness in that shot of ""Jurassic Park"" merchandising shop.<br/><br/>But can we blame him? This is the man who made the ultimate thriller with ""Jaws"", the ultimate family film ""E.T."", both became the highest grossing movies of their time. Spielberg combined the two, he made a thriller that could attract children with a minimal parental guidance, ""Jurassic Park"" became the highest-grossing movie of all time before ""Titanic"". So this was his momentum, in 1993, Spielberg also director of the Best Picture winner, was the King of the World. And the king of action movies as well.<br/><br/>The action sequences utilize mechanisms inherited from Hitchcock like the race against the clock with a kid climbing down a temporarily deactivated electric fence and the gears being switched on, or taken from ""Jaws"", the suggestion of the T-rex' presence through the infamous shaking glass of water. For a film that prepares us so much to a monster movie, the writers' imagination created moments of pure ingenuousness and managed to turn the most mundane places such as cars or kitchens into deadly traps. But while ""Jaws"" had a no-holds-barred rule, Spielberg knew very well a 90s audience wasn't ready to see kids serving as appetizers (still, he didn't turn them into these 1970s know-it-all brats).<br/><br/>So the film also works in spite of its relative predictability. As groundbreaking and powerful as it is, it is also symptomatic of the trend of the 90s where we know the characters who are likely to survive and save the day thanks to aforementioned skills. Spielberg doesn't make his cast nonentities and allows them to share their views about recreating life but subtlety isn't his strongest suit. While Goldblum plays the most interesting character as the chaos theorist insisting that whatever can go wrong will go wrong, Sam Neil's disliking of kids (set in a distasteful opening scene) seemed far fetched and only there for a needless arc, the kids in the film were nice enough and and he had great chemistry with them.<br/><br/>But these considerations hardly matter when the real star are the special effects and the dinosaurs. Forget the blatant lack of security, the improbable survivals or the contrived ending, Spielberg knew people didn't watch a film like screenwriting students, his common denominator instinct paid off. He knew we would all be at the edge of our seat when the T-Rex pops up and we would all go ""aaaw"" with the brachiosaurus or the baby dinosaur. Spielberg was a visionary showman like Hammond, but HE left nothing to chance.<br/><br/>I remember I was eleven when I participated to a game show and one of the questions I got was ""which animals are featured in ""Jurassic Park""?"" (I hadn't seen the film yet but no one could miss the movie, its poster and the whole publicity around it) the film was undeniable in 1993 and is still today."

","Jurassic Park doesn't really need much reviewing by this point, but I saw it at the Royal Albert Hall in London recently with live orchestral accompaniment and fell in love with it all over again.<br/><br/>One of Spielberg's finest, Jurassic Park has all the hallmarks of the filmmaker who made Jaws and grew even more in their expertise by the time he retread ground with dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Spotlights are everywhere in this masterful film full of great camera techniques, memorable characters, great visual and aural storytelling, brilliant set design, and of course...those special effects. There's a reason why I make jokes at more modern movies' special effects saying ""X years after Jurassic Park"". This was 1993. And it made you believe in dinosaurs. I mean, they did exist, but whatever.<br/><br/>In regards to the orchestra that played, it does make one realise that goddamn, they play the main theme a lot.

It's not meant to be a horror movie. Or a slasher. It just happens to turn out that way. But that's not the focus.<br/><br/>It's not about that.

"jmmustchin","10","1","1","23 October 2018"," Epic adventure!
","I used to think that those who called Jurassic Park one of the greatest movies of all time were just being over the top. Now that I've actually seen it, I wholeheartedly agree with them! It's not ""the"" greatest film (well, I don't think so yet, anyway), but it's certainly ""one"" of them (alongside the likes of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"").<br/><br/>In the movie, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created a theme park of cloned dinosaurs on the island of Nublar. Hammond brings in paleontologist Dr Allan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr Sattler (a female), Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and a lawyer (first name Donald) to inspect it and approve it. After a tour (with very few dinosaurs showing up), they are very skeptical. (Except for Donald, of course, who's thinking about his check.) However, one of the island employees (first name Dennis) had been hired by a rival company to steal dino embryos. That night - as a hurricane's moving in - he shuts down the power and security systems (including the electric fences that kept the dinos in their enclosures), but notably leaves the extra security for the Raptors' pen on. The power was shut off just as the inspecting visitors were in front of the T-Rex pen in automated electric cars. The T-Rex and several other dinosaurs break loose, and the night (and next day) quickly turn into a fight for survival.<br/><br/>The movie is quite exciting and actually kinda fun to watch. I enjoyed both the plot and the anti-cloning themes. The action is awesome, as is the acting. But one of the movie's most prominent features is the special effects, which are frighteningly real-looking (literally). I didn't find the movie very scary (apart from the opening scene - and how real (and scary) the T-Rex looks).<br/><br/>Overall, a very good watch."

"dac-40056","10","1","1","27 August 2018"," My ALL-TIME favorite movie...
","...but, not without its flaws. Most of the flaws are from my own opinion and my perspective.<br/><br/>The Raptors, for instance. They are unfairly villainized for being the ""bad girls"" (all the dinosaurs are female...otherwise, I would have said ""bad guys"") in this film. This is, by far, my biggest flaw in ""Jurassic Park"".<br/><br/>See, the thing is (besides the fact that I love the Raptors WAY TOO MUCH) that the Raptors were PROVOKED into being aggressive. Right from where the movie starts off, we see a crate being hauled around with a Raptor inside. The transferring and motion must have been traumatizing for the animal inside that little crate and, was likely scared and confused. So, when Jophrey attempted to open the gate, the Raptor was trying to get free and grabbed the first thing in her way. She panicked when the men were trying to stop her.<br/><br/>The movie depicts a scene where the Raptors supposedly devour a black, sickly-looking bull when it's lowered down into their pen. NO ONE in their right mind would eat something that looks like that. Notice why there's no blood on the harness when it's brought back up? That's because the Raptors NEVER ate it at all. What they did was cut the animal loose from the harness and put on a show for the visitors, though where they hid the bull remains a mystery.<br/><br/>The reason why Mr. Arnold was killed by a Raptor is not known, but it's possible that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time and she probably killed him in self-defense. Same with Robert Muldoon, though I believe he was targeted after the incident in the beginning I mentioned above. He was the reason they became trapped in that holding pen to begin with, so they probably plotted revenge on him for his mistreatment of them.<br/><br/>The Raptors had NO intention of killing Lex or Tim. They were stalking them in the kitchen because they wanted to play with them. In fact, if they had stayed in the dining room when the shadow of one of the Raptors showed up, it's more than likely that it would have been curious and eaten the food on the table. When they hid in the kitchen, the Raptor was confused and didn't understand why they were hiding. So, she and a second Raptor decided to play this ""new"" game (new, to the Raptors).<br/><br/>When one Raptor rammed its head against the cabinet and the other one got locked in the freezer, she was dazed, confused, and probably angry. So, she followed them to the control room, hence the scene with Alan and Ellie trying to keep her out. But, it was when Alan kicked her in the face that really ticked her off, so now he was another target. In the chaos (yes, I'm doing an Ian Malcolm reference there) that ensued, the Raptor was determined to get back at Alan and ordered the other Raptor that showed up to carry it out first.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's when the Tyrannosaurus Rex showed up and finished both of them off. Despite what you see in the film, the Raptors had NO intention of killing Alan, Ellie, and the children. If the T-Rex hadn't have showed up and killed the Raptors, they probably would have pounced on them and attempted to ""talk"" to them in their own language. How well that would have worked is debatable, but the Raptors would have tried to communicate with them. And, the one that was kicked in the face probably would have whiplashed Alan with her tail, but would otherwise avoid an attack.<br/><br/>Then, there's the very end of the film. All FIVE (so far) movies in this franchise have disappointing endings. And, for the original film, a better ending would have been if a stowaway Raptor was on board the helicopter that no one notices until they're away from the island with Ellie and Alan looking at the flock of pelicans flying over the ocean.<br/><br/>Of course, there are other flaws as well, but the top three that stand out for me are:<br/><br/>1 - The cliff that magically appears out of nowhere during the T-Rex attack sequence. Seriously, the dinosaur comes out of her paddock on solid, stable ground to launch her attack and then, minutes later, Alan and Ellie have to use one of the downed wires to scale this massive cliff?<br/><br/>2 - Tim and Alan in the tree. Tim: ""I threw up."" Alan: ""Oh. Well, that's okay. Just give me your hand. Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up. Just give me your hand."" The reason this one bothers me is because I'm a very sensitive person and my stomach doesn't sit well with that. While I don't actually throw up with it, it does bother me.<br/><br/>3 - Ellie and John Hammond in the dining room. This scene is way too dramatic for me. I mentioned I'm a very sensitive person and I don't take well to dramatic scenes in movies. The second and third scenes mentioned here are ones I have to mute for my own personal reasons.<br/><br/>Despite all of these flaws, however, ""Jurassic Park"" remains my all-time favorite movie. I just wish it would have had a better ending."

","In the summer of 1993 when Jurassic Park came out, I was keen on seeing it due to the movie being about dinosaurs but due to my young age, I wasn't able to watch it until it came out on VHS a year later and when I first watched it, I was left mesmerized and terrified by what I had seen. As I grew older and rewatched it more often, I began to see the movie in a different light and having recently rewatched it in preparation for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the movie still holds after 25 years. From it's interesting premise and themes to its ground-breaking visual effects and incredible performances, Jurassic Park is a prime example of how to do a summer blockbuster right.<br/><br/>The film opens on the island of Isla Nublar where a team is overseeing the delivery of a Velociraptor to be included in the new dinosaur theme park called Jurassic Park. However, the raptor is highly aggressive and kills one of the park employees. Following the accident, the park's investors demand that expect to visit the park in order to certify it as safe. They invite a chaos theorist named Ian Malcolm while the park's founder, John Hammond invites paleontologist Alan Grant and paleobotanist Ellie Sattler to endorse the park. Upon arriving on the island, the group is mesmerized when they see a Brachiosaurus and a group of Parasaurolophus. They are then taken to the visitors' center where they are shown a brief video explaining the process of cloning the dinosaurs which were done using fossilized mosquitos preserved in tree sap with the DNA of frogs added in. Grant, Sattler, and Malcolm all have serious doubts about the safety of the park and the ethical problems of having dinosaurs thrown into the 20th century and discuss it with Hammond but their words fall on deaf ears. The group is then joined by Hammond's grandkids for an afternoon tour of the park, however, the tour doesn't go as intended as the dinosaurs fail to appear. The tour is then cut short by a tropical storm during which a computer programmer named Denis Nedry, who has been paid off by a business rival of Hammonds to pilfer dinosaur embryos, shuts down the park's security system and escapes. With the power out, the tour vehicles stall next to the now insecure T-Rex paddock.<br/><br/>Given Steven Spielberg's prowess in the film community and being the father of the summer blockbuster, It's not surprising that Jurassic Park is a cinematic sightpost for him as the audience is given a sense of wonder and dread few modern summer blockbusters can provide us with nowadays, so much so that the franchise has been be going strong for the last 25 years and shows no sigh of slowing down. On the outside, Jurassic Park may seem like a cross between Westworld and Frankenstein but if one looks under the outer layers they'll find a cautioning tale of the dangers of trying to control nature and the consequences of doing so. It's a modern reciting of Frankenstein's monster but rather than focusing on a misjudged individual, the characters are confronted by a zoo of prehistoric monsters. The themes of mankind's overreliance on technology and trying to control nature are nothing new in the world of entertainment as they're been used countless times but the way the movie handles these themes is so well done and never once do the morals of the film feel forced nor does the movie feel the need to beat the viewer over the head with it's message every 5 minutes unlike some other films. A prime example of this is how Michael Crichton always seems to take delight in certain themes in his novels and that is clearly visible in Jurassic Park as he and David Koepp reveal the movie as a captivating, frantically wide-ranging narrative on the capabilities as well as the follies of technology as well as mankind's attempts to control nature as perfectly shown by Dr. Ian Malcolm, who besides being the best character in the movie, he is not fooled by Hammond's park and remains suspicious of the lawless environment of this industrialized El Dorado when he goes on the tour and again comments on functional mathematics as an aid for demonstrating how flawless images have a way of falling once they deal with reality which sums up the themes of the movie so wonderfully without the need to hit the audience over the head and actually serves the plot of the movie well.<br/><br/>In a sense, the plot of the film seems made-to-order for the genius of a director who can own most other directors in the world of filmmaking and storytelling by blending the suspense of Jaws with the newfangled morals of ET and Close Encounters of the Third Kind as well as the idea of coning the dinosaurs and you have a recipe for a fantastic movie. While a few crucial scenes in the film certainly equal the terror factor that Jaws had, the major contrast with Jurassic Park is that the dinosaurs walk all over the human characters both directly and allegorically while the characters are also believably sympathetic as well as charmingly unique as they all have a part to play in the movie to the point that they never feel like the typical cardboard cut-outs you see in so many modern blockbusters, but nevertheless the dinosaurs still rule Jurassic Park in every possible way. One of the issues with Crichton's novel is a failure to create engaging characters that the reader can identify with as the book is populated by an identical assortment of contemptuous, cold lingo-uttering nobodies and mustache-curling villains, it's near impossible to give a care about which characters live or die. Such is not the case in the movie as Spielberg and writer David Koepp have given each character enough development for the viewer to be invested in them and along they may not be the deepest or complex of movie characters, the characters of Jurassic Park are likeable, funny, and approachable unlike a film like Jurassic Park 3 or Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom where the characters are paper thin and feel more like cardboard cut-outs. Directing the dinosaur's rampages is one of Spielberg's specialties and a film viewer's dream come true. As the film progresses, it becomes more and more clear that Spielberg is a master of using terror and dread to the movie's advantage with every roar and shiver that hints at what is coming. A perfect example of this method is where Malcolm looks down at a T-Rex footprint and sees the water ripple and tremble to make for a truly bone-chilling scene. Steven also relishes the usage of creating iconic moments in the film such as an astounding scene where a pair of merciless velociraptors hunts Hammond's two grandkids through the visitor center's kitchen. Sure, any director can shoot an action scene or show us an epic battle between two armies but it takes a special kind of director like Spielberg to show us just how a few pots and pans can go flying at the thud of a velociraptor's tailor how the kids deceive their devious attackers simply by using an elusion to their advantage. In watching such a masterly done scene, it also helps to see the bigger picture and put things into the proper context. No other director could have been able to convince an audience that there are marauding dinosaurs in a kitchen the way Spielberg can, making the scene a high watermark for his career as a director and storyteller. But if the movie has a standout scene that demonstrates all of Steven's talents in front of and behind the camera, it would be the scene where the T-Rex investigates and pulverizes a Jeep with Hammond's two grandkids inside. It's easily one of the most intoxicating scenes ever put on film and is bleakly insightful along with being justly frightening regardless if you're 5 or 25. When it comes to the more violent and gory aspects of the movie, Spielberg tends to leave out a lot and allows the viewer to come up with their own conclusions. When it's time to actually show a death or blood in the movie, Steven cleverly bypasses the glaring carnage by getting a better shiver out of the audience by showing a goat or a cow being left near one of these hungry prehistoric beasts and quickly disappear. In order to make the velociraptors a more menacing introduction in the movie's opening scene, he begins the scene with a character whose upper body remains in focus while the rest of his torso is being dragged away off-screen much like what happened in Jaws. Such uneasy and horrendous achievements are linked by a simple story of survival as our heroes try to stay alive while avoiding the dinosaurs. In the hands of another director or writer, this would come across as cheap sentiment or forced emotional melodrama but with Spielberg, it never feels dumbed down anything for this movie and always aims for the highest standards of horror and thrills.<br/><br/>Given Jurassic Park's impact on the filmmaking world in terms of pioneering computerized visual effects, it's not surprising that the movie blew audiences away the first time they saw the movie and the industry was changed forever as GCI was now a tool to be used and to be exploited. While CGI had been used before in The Abyss and Terminator 2, it had only in small doses and had never been used to show photorealistic visual effects, Jurassic Park changed all that. By using different kinds of effects for each dinosaur or scene to produce the best effect possible. Along with Denis Murren and his team at ILM and Phil Tippet's amazing stop-motion effects, the effects team were able to create dinosaurs that looked realistic rather than cartoonish or fake. The animatronics for the T-Rex, Brachiosaurus, and Triceratops look so life-like when they appear on-screen thanks to Stan Winston and his team who proved far more helpful to the finished movie than the CGI as their animatronics give the dinosaurs a level of believability that the CGI could never have done. Seeing the Triceratops on screen for the first time feels like a living, breathing animal while the raptor surprising Ellie makes them feel that much more threating and compe"

","The original Jurassic park is a great example of Steven Spielberg in his prime. His talent as a filmmaker shines through in almost every aspect of this movie. Now, this film was definitely designed to be easily accessible to anyone, I mean it's a family movie and it does kind of play it safe in certain aspects, but luckily this film was made during a time where ""playing it safe"" didn't necessarily mean pandering. Where this film really shines though, is in it's writing, it's riddled with memorable quotes and very well developed characters. John Hammond is an arsehole but he remains a very sympathetic and interesting character because the film takes the time to show who he is as a person and why he's so dedicated to making this theme park. In fact, all the characters are well written and thoroughly engaging, even the kid actors. The film even takes the time to have characters ask the questions that the audience would be questioning and states the same concerns any normal person would, but rather than using that to try and excuse any flaws the film has, it uses it to develop the characters personalities. The pseudo scientific explanation for how the dinosaurs are made is obviously inaccurate, but it's still believable enough that when the film takes the time to explain it in detail, it still isn't annoying nor is it boring. Along with that the film very interestingly explores the idea of man playing god, and while it might not feel particularly subtle, it never feels overbearing. I love that the story feels like it has some real stakes to it and the dinosaurs actually feel scary. I can always appreciate a good family movie that isn't afraid to traumatize kids. I've heard people say that this film contains one of John Williams weaker pieces, but I must disagree, I think this is one of his strongest. It's simple, effective and deadly catchy. I can't begin to count the amount of times I've had the jurassic park theme stuck in my head. Most people already know that this film is known for its revolutionary special effects, and even now they are incredible, not just for the time period, even if the practical and CG effects are far from being indistinguishable from one another. Some bits do feel a bit dated and sometimes the dinosaurs and people don't look like they're in the same setting. As well as that, at some points it's clear that the questionable camerawork is only done so that it's easier to add dinosaurs to the scene. All and all, it's a very lovable film, and I can attest to the fact that it's a great film to watch with friends"
"Min111","Null","1","1","23 May 2018"," It's a dangerous park for adventures
","This was such a fantastic movie back then and still is. It was one of the best movies out there during the nineties. This is something that can't be said of the other Jurassic Park movies. It was pretty adventurous, and the action was immense when the Dinosaurs started to unleash and wreck havoc. It was a good thriller if you ask me. Jurassic Park is very popular, but though it was a good movie, it's still very overrated if you ask me. I didn't see anything in this movie that suggests this is breathtaking. The setting of this movie was great. Like the theme park where the action and adventure takes place. The story, however, is nothing extraordinary - anyone could've come up with that. It was predictable. The story is nothing glamorous, and that's one of the reasons why I think Jurassic Park is overrated. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good movie, except overrated. There's a difference between a good and an overrated movie. A movie can both be good, yet overrated, and that's one of many out there. If there is one movie people can remember from the top of their heads during the nineties, I'm sure many would choose Jurassic Park. The name or title of this movie is great, however. I really like that logo. One of the best movie logos out there. It's very recognisable too."
"wm-007","9","1","1","17 March 2017"," This is a review I wrote for film studies-note it is badly written
","Jurassic Park is one of those films, the ones that never get old no matter how many times<br/><br/>you watch it. It's great and here's why, the characters in this film are very disguisable, you<br/><br/>have Dr. Alan Grant he's a palaeontologist and a famous one too. He's down to earth,<br/><br/>athletic and despite what he may lead you to believe he likes children. Then you have John<br/><br/>Hammond The owner of InGen and Jurassic Park, he himself is a dinosaur fanatic and spent<br/><br/>a decade furiously trying to clone dinosaurs. He did this for his love of the dinosaur but also<br/><br/>really wants to turn his idea into a profit; the more people tell him to shut down the park<br/><br/>the angrier he gets. Along with Hammond there are his two grandkids Tim and Lex, Tim<br/><br/>being more able to deal with the situations that arise in the film then Lex. There is also Dr.<br/><br/>Ian Malcolm; he's a mathematician who specialises in the emerging field of chaos theory. He<br/><br/>is constantly sceptical that Jurassic park could work; his predictions of the parks fate<br/><br/>become more and truer as the film unfolds. Another notable character is Dennis Nedry he is<br/><br/>the computer technician and is hired to steal embryos from the park.<br/><br/>The setting for this masterpiece is in the 1990s in Costa Rica and Isla Nublar, a small island of<br/><br/>the coast of Costa Rica, although some scenes take place in various places across the US.<br/><br/>With the convincing acting portrayed by the cast you will feel like you're in Costa Rica with<br/><br/>them, this just adds to the immersion of an already immersive film. The main theme of<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is the potential dangers of technology which is evident as the majority of the<br/><br/>cast are almost killed at some point in the film due to the technology used to bring back<br/><br/>dinosaurs. A basic outline of the plot is, Hammond asks two palaeontologists to come and<br/><br/>look at his project, project being dinosaurs. Grant who is one of the palaeontologists is<br/><br/>amazed. They look at the facilities used to clone the dinosaurs then move on to do a tour of<br/><br/>the park (essentially a dinosaur zoo)Â… it starts off well but when they reach the T-Rex<br/><br/>enclosure Dennis Nedry who is back at the main facilities tries to escape and basically locks<br/><br/>everyone out from using the technology and in result a T-Rex (and more) gets loose and<br/><br/>everyone runs away from man eating dinosaurs, Grant runs around the jungle with<br/><br/>Hammonds grandkids while Hammond and some others try and get the power working and<br/><br/>eventually everyone who isn't dead meets up at the main hall and fly's away on a helicopter<br/><br/>after a climactic battle between the T-Rex and some Velociraptors. This concludes the<br/><br/>movie. In the opening scene of the movie there is a lot of foreshadowing, something goes<br/><br/>wrong while there trying to move a Velociraptor and a man dies. This is essentially the main<br/><br/>theme of the movie, man tries to play with dinosaurs and people die.<br/><br/>As far as effects go Jurassic Park was one of the first films to use a mixture of both computer<br/><br/>generated images and animatronics, this created an amazing look that captured the viewer's<br/><br/>imagination and made the movie jut seem more real every time you watched it, the editing<br/><br/>was also very good, at times it was used to make the viewer feel the same as the characters,<br/><br/>for example awkwardly angled shots when people were trying to hide etc.<br/><br/>The soundtrack for Jurassic Park is a classic and when composed by John Williams it's hard<br/><br/>not to be, the sound track is composed of sixteen tracks which vary from thirty three<br/><br/>seconds to almost ten minutes long. John Williams is one of my favourite composers and<br/><br/>really helps to bring the film to life via music, the atmosphere created through sound just<br/><br/>adds to the immersion of the film. The sound effects used in this film are also amazing; they<br/><br/>really help to bring the dinosaurs alive. From realistic roars to the thudding of feet, all sound<br/><br/>effects used contribute to the films overall feel.<br/><br/>The moral of Jurassic Park is but a modern retelling of Classical myths concerning hubris, an<br/><br/>excessive pride that eventually results in the hero's fall. In this case the thing Hammond<br/><br/>spent so long trying to create blinded him of the risks and eventually is his downfall. I<br/><br/>personally really like Jurassic Park as it creates an amazing atmosphere and tells a great<br/><br/>story it is also re watchable time and time again. Also it captured my eye at a very young<br/><br/>and impressionable age and because of this it is my favourite film and probably always will<br/><br/>be."

","Far too many times, movies that tackle very complicated, edgy topics end up taking too much of a ""black and white"" approach and not showing the shades of grey that exist in all areas of life. Fortunately, director Steven Spielberg doesn't let this happen, and instead lets the plot play out to its fullest.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Jurassic Park"" sees billionaire mogul John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) build an amusement park housing eight species of dinosaurs. However, in order to get the corporate ""O.K"" on the whole project, Hammond calls in two scientists Alan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) to put the place through a fine-tooth comb from a biological perspective. However, largely due to some corporate intrigue, the park is completely shut down during the tour, leaving all the electric fences unwired and setting up a struggle between species that were never meant to interact.<br/><br/>First and foremost, this is an action/adventure flick filled with impressive images, and in that role it succeeds admirably. The 1993 graphics still measure up to anything that has been produced today, and almost all of the action sequences are breathtaking and will have you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>What really gives ""Jurassic Park"" a solid four stars, though, is that Spielberg doesn't ""take sides"". Equally screen time is given to both perspectives: educational and biological. The viewer is allowed to see the pros and cons of both, and weigh them themselves in advance of the sequel.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a solid film that delivers in all important departments: effects, action, plot, and characters. Plus, thanks to the Spielberg direction, it holds up very well almost 20 years later."

"sol-","Null","1","1","24 January 2016"," Not just another Jaws
","It might sound like little more than 'Jaws' with dinosaurs as this Steven Spielberg thriller focuses on mayhem at an amusement park where dinosaurs have been brought back to life, but 'Jurassic Park' a unique and exciting thriller in its own right and one that stands up to multiple viewings. The dinosaurs are quite breathtaking CGI creations, and more than that, they are menacing at all the right times. The dinosaur attacks are very well done with Spielberg not relying on music (sort of the opposite of 'Jaws') and instead dead silence to render the attacks frightening. Spielberg throws a lot of neat directing tricks in the mix too, such as extreme close-ups on Samuel L. Jackson's technician and decent doses of humour, like an 'objects in mirror are closer than they appear' warning visible as a dinosaur roars into an automobile side mirror. Not so successful are the film's attempts to drill home messages such as the risks of tampering with nature, all spelled out through character dialogue. The way the child-hating Sam Neill eventually learns to bond with kids is also so forced and obvious from early on that it never really works despite a credible turn from Ariana Richards as a surrogate daughter of sorts. In fact, the film is very well acted overall, give or take Wayne Knight's inappropriately comical performance as the closest the film has a human antagonist. The strongest of the cast is Jeff Goldblum as a mathematician who finds himself often talking to himself, but Jackson, Neill and Richard Attenborough as the amusement park owner have their strong moments too."

","In light of the fourth installment being released in 2015, let's take a look back at the original 1993 film, Jurassic Park. I still cannot believe it has been more than 20 years! <br/><br/>It was a great triumph of movie-making magic, when in 1993, Steven Spielberg brought dinosaurs back to life. Okay, so he didn't really bring them back, but he made us believe he did. It was an awesome film for the time it came out, very ahead of its time in fact. The technological aspects of the film like the animatronics were state of the art and computer animation in film was still young and controversial.<br/><br/>Laura Dern and Sam Neill were a great addition to the film along with Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough. A well rounded cast along with a superb director made the film a hit in the summer of '93. I only wish that the sequels could have lived up to the expectations of the first installment. Maybe Jurassic World can revive the series! See you at the movies."

","At the release of this movie I still was a child. And still now +/-20 years later, I still love this movie. Reason for this is Jurassic Park creates a world for these ancient animals, where we as audience can imagine how this world was millions of years ago and also made us realize the question 'What if this was possible'. Is it really a human thing to do, where we give the dinosaurs back a place to be what they are? Or is this risk too big? As viewer, you will be amazed, shocked, become emotional, but also realistic.<br/><br/>This movie was the cause of my dinosaur hype at the age of 10.

"williampsamuel","10","1","1","7 December 2014"," A breathtaking summer blockbuster, and the ultimate creature feature
","Wonder and terror. These are the words to describe Steven Spielberg's masterpiece Jurassic Park. Wonder at the size, beauty, and majesty the creatures on the screen, and the idea that men have created this. And terror upon seeing just what these creatures are capable of, and how badly the dream has gone awry.<br/><br/>The creatures I'm talking about are of course dinosaurs, and the dream is that they can be brought back to life and everyone can see them. If you didn't know this coming in, you've obviously spent the last 17 years living as a hermit in the wilderness. How else could you not be familiar with the movie that spawned two sequels, an entire section of a major theme park, and countless toys? So I'm trusting that if you can work this computer you already know the story of how John Hammond brings experts from multiple fields, plus his grandchildren, to get a sneak peek at his new dinosaur park, and how everything goes wrong and people get eaten.<br/><br/>Good. Now that we have that out of the way, let's get down to why Jurassic Park has done so well and become so well known. Basically, it's just awesome in every sense of the word. This is one of those movies that frightens, excites, amazes, and even delivers a clear, meaningful message. It works on every level, which is a testament to writer Michal Crichton, director Steven Spielberg, and the army of technicians and animators who worked to bring this story to life.<br/><br/>The whole selling point of this enterprise is the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs have captured the public's imagination since their discovery, and drawn countless visitors to museums worldwide. Seriously, who doesn't like, or at least have some interest in these long dead beasts? That's why there have been so many previous films about dinosaurs, starting with Thomas Edison's The Lost World in 1925. Some of these movies, like King Kong, have been quite good. Others, like King Dinosaur, not so much. But all these movies have suffered from a serious problem: the dinosaurs just don't look real. Whether they be stop-motion puppets made of clay, men in rubber suits, or lizards with fins strapped to their backs, it's difficult to make yourself believe they're actual living dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park changed this completely. The filmmakers understand that we've come to see dinosaurs, and they've spared no expense in showing them to us. The animatronics and CGI used to create these dinosaurs is so convincing that the difficulty here lies in reminding yourself that they're only an effect. The scene in which we first catch sight of the brachiosaurs is one of the most awe-inspiring ever put on film. The characters in the movie are left speechless by what they see, and so were the audiences in the theater. And when the T.rex pursues the jeep in the famous ""Objects in mirror"" sequence, it's an absolutely heart pounding adrenaline rush.<br/><br/>But at the same time, the movie understands the power of the unseen. Probably the scariest part of Jurassic Park is right at the beginning, when the raptor nearly gets lose as its being moved into the holding pen. We get no more than a few fleeting, poorly lit glimpses of the beast, but that's all we need. Between the hair-raising noises coming from inside the crate, the terror on the actor's faces, and the fact that this thing is still fighting despite repeated shocks from a dozen tazers, we can tell that whatever's in there is something extremely powerful and incredibly deadly.<br/><br/>Jurassic park has a major asset in its excellent screenplay. Screen adaptations of major novels can be a dicey propositions, as Sphere and Congo have shown, but here the novel has been adapted wonderfully. In fact, I would go as far as to say that this screenplay is in some ways an improvement on the original. Extraneous characters and a rather unnecessary subplot have been removed, and I for one find Hammond far more interesting as a kindly old man who slowly realizes what a terrible mistake he's made than as a ruthless venture capitalist who dies blaming everyone else for the park's failure.<br/><br/>Important as what the screenplay has removed is what it's left intact. Nearly all of the book's most exciting parts have been included, and the characters are still well drawn, especially Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) the outspoken, womanizing, rock star mathematician who serves to convey the film's message.<br/><br/>Although many have taken this to be a warning against cloning, its message lies deeper than that. It's about the difference between what science can do and what it should do, and the need for advancement and innovation, but also caution. And, as Malcolm says more than once, nature will find a way. This means that not only will nature find a way around all of man's attempts to control it, but that it will make a comeback from even the greatest devastation. The latter point is made clear in the book, when Malcolm calls the idea that man could ever destroy the earth ""unbelievably arrogant."" This is one thing that I wish could have been expounded on further, but overall Crichton's ideas are conveyed very well. And it's not every day that you see a movie explain chaos theory in a way that's both understandable and scientifically correct.<br/><br/>The little touches are also done well, like the ripples in the water that announce rex's approach, or the delightfully cheesy intro video at the welcome center. And the musical score is one of John William's best. My favorite line in the movie is when Grant tells Hammond ""After careful consideration, I have decided not to endorse your park"", and Hammond replies ""So have I.""While I would highly discourage travel to this fictional park, I have no reservations in endorsing this movie."

","It took me almost fifteen years to properly enjoy this movie. The first time I witnessed it, I was twelve and I had just finished reading the book. I was devastated. They cut out so much and my poor little twelve year old brain couldn't understand why they couldn't fit EVERYTHING in the movie. Later I understood the need to cut stuff out but I was still angry over the fact that Hammond was supposed to die at the end of the story. It was the best death scene and they nixed it.<br/><br/>Then a few years ago, I caught the movie while channel surfing. Since I had no desire to watch any of my other options, I put the movie on and sat down with my laptop to work on a school paper. But something funny happened. I got pulled in.<br/><br/>The storyline was still the same but I had a better appreciation for it. I could see the commentary on scientific advances (something the author of the book was famous for) but I could look past them and just enjoy the movie. I didn't think about how they cut out this one really cool scene or the fact that Lex was supposed to be younger than Tim. I just watched. Sam Neill is wonderful as is Jeff Goldblum. The dinosaurs looked good and I'm not just talking about for that time. It was before the serious CG move and they were robots but somehow that just made them work better. I mean, dinosaurs aren't really known for their vast variety of facial expressions.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is perfect and created a new theme for my generation. My parents had Indiana Jones and Star Wars. We had Jurassic Park. I won't go on about the social and scientific commentaries in the movie because it could ruin it for you if you haven't considered them. It also helps that it boosted Spielberg's career. He wasn't exactly unknown at the time but it was definitely a step in the right direction for him and helped set him up to take on new projects (Schindler's List among them).<br/><br/>All in all, it's not called a classic because everything is perfect. It's called a classic because it created something new."
"Samtheshrikker","9","1","1","2 August 2014"," What hasn't already been said?
","Jurassic Park is a stone cold classic. Few films to this day remain as visceral and as engaging to people of all ages, as Spielberg cleverly draws upon Crichton's original novel to create a masterpiece of the imagination that hints to what a modern world with dinosaurs may look like. <br/><br/>The main cast is small but intensely likable, with stand-out performances (despite what some may claim) from Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough. They each fall seamlessly into the unique personalities of their characters, and as a result, close viewers are easily able to see how events change them by the film's end. Also not to be missed are the strong performances by Ariana Richards and Joeseph Mazello as Hammond's grand-children; they diversify the cast through their childish elements, making Jurassic Park more accessible to young viewers. The film-making itself seems characterised by the terrific screenplay employed, as a number of subtle camera techniques and frame shifts enable one to see the film more three dimensionally the more times they watch it. But it's the sheer quality of the CGI and animatronics that steal the show here. Spielberg employed a department on the cutting edge of the field at the time, bringing the film's creatures to life in a poignant, but not too hard-hitting way for young viewers. As ever in a Spielberg classic, the plot is solid, well written and smoothly flowing, with events transitioning so gently that even the most astute viewers will find themselves wondering where the picture's perfect running time of 127 minutes went. Often unmentioned is the film's strong musical score, which draws entirely upon a traditional orchestra to bring an impressive third dimension to the viewing experience. <br/><br/>By all accounts, Jurassic Park is a beautiful family film that has it all and can be watched again and again. Whether you've got friends and family over and you want an anchor, or even if you've got the night to yourself and want to fill it, Jurassic Park will deliver every time."

Jurassic Park holds on its own against the book, which is amazing as well. I am glad that Jurassic park was made in the 90's because if it were made today it may not have been as big of a wow factor, and the CGI wouldn't have as much nostalgia to it, as well as the puppetry.

","Before the highways and freeways, triceratops and velociraptors roamed the open land. Jurassic Park will open your imagination and bring it all the way back to the late cretaceous period. The dinosaurs portrayed perfectly and you can almost feel the T-Rex breathe down your neck. Jurassic Park is filled with a story that is packed with twists and turns that can keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Anyone who has ever imagined what it would be like to live amongst the dinosaurs will realize what a different world the earth was once before.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park bring the inner-most child out of us. Most people have played with dinosaur toys at one point in their life so, why not re-live the experience on screen? Jurassic Park is a wonderful movie full of adventure and excitement."

","This film focuses on the dream turned reality of John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to bring dinosaurs to life and introduce them to the world through a fully functional theme park. The only obstacle standing in his way is getting the proper legal approval to open his park to the public. A team of scientists consisting of Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) are brought in to assess the surprise attractions and give the final stamp of approval. They are quickly joined by Hammond's grandkids Lex Murphy (Ariana Richards) and Tim Murphy (Joseph Mazzello). The beautiful setting quickly turns into one of a nightmare as a tropical storm hits at the same time a Jurassic Park computer programmer Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) shuts down the system keeping the park running, and the dinosaurs caged, in an effort to steal the secrets behind Jurassic Park and sell them to another company. Now the dinosaurs are running wild, there is no immediate source of power, the group is split up, and it is only a matter of time before people start dying.<br/><br/>To me, the theme of Jurassic Park revolves around man's capability for scientific discovery, and the potential Pandora's Box scenario that can result when science of this nature is exploited. I found that a motif existed in the film by means of giving the viewer a sense of awe at the amazing creation born of science, and then quickly replacing that feeling with a sense of panic and terror as these beautiful monsters demonstrate their deadly nature. One thing that stood out to me was the scene where they are all around the table that first night at the park discussing the dinosaurs. You will notice the lighting and angles during Dr. Malcolm's expression of disapproval serve to make his words more meaningful and more powerful, leaving the viewer with a sense of certainty that bad things were coming. You will also notice this theme could be comparable to a movie such as Planet of the Apes, which also looks at scientific innovation gone terribly wrong."

","Steven Spielberg's movie Jurassic Park based off the novel by Michael Crichton is a spectacular adaptation. Steven Spielberg truly captures the essence and imagination behind the world of Jurassic Park. The theme of the movie for human's to understand that they are at the mercy of their technology and unpredictable chaos.<br/><br/>John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) creates a Jurassic era Park with cloned living dinosaurs. He invites four professionals to inspect the park before opening. Amongst the guests are Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), and Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero). Hammond's guests are to inspect the park before opening and to give their professional opinion of the park before the grand opening. Things are going according to plan until a greedy employee tries to flee the park with a dinosaur embryo. During this time the computer systems are put offline and a storm wipes out the power putting all the guests at risk. The guests must ensure their survival and escape the park before the dinosaurs get them.<br/><br/>Once the gates open be prepared for the ride of a lifetime as this movie uses some of the best state of the art computer animation even to modern day standards. In combination with state of the art animatronics, Spielberg is able to reproduce the true nature of Jurassic Park. It will make you feel as if the dinosaurs are truly real. Ride with the group as you the camera follows them throughout the park and throughout their adventure. The overall feel of the movie will have you in awe one moment and then clenching to your seat the next! Spielberg brings much of his movie magic to this film like many of his other films of the time such as the awe of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, the fear of Poltergeist, and the adventure of The Goonies. With the feel of top camera angles and tracking camera angles you can certainly feel the adventure. Later with the combination of computer graphic animation and state of the art animatronics, you can feel the fear rushing toward you. The sound also makes you feel as if you are right there in the action and will have your heart beating in fear. Be prepared when watching Jurassic Park to experience the wonderful mind of Michael Chrichton's creation with the awesome interpretation of Steven Spielberg. Jurassic Park is an instant classic and has been proved over and over to be a worthy view. With how disastrous things go at the park; it will certainly make you reconsider relying on your smart phone."

","OK, is the plot that good? No. At least the set up isn't, it's cheesy monster movie stuff. Absolutely every bad decision that could be made generally is. Let's automate an entire park full of giant man eating dinosaurs in 1993. Then let's low ball the entire operation out to one guy. Then let's let the automation with thousands of bugs run the whole park before its ready. Then let's evacuate everyone because of a hurricane ensuring now one is there in case anything goes wrong, except about 10 people including the people inspecting the damned safety of the park for no reason. Then let's have the low balled guy screw everything up in the worst corporate robbery attempt ever by turning off every security system, stealing valuable goods, and just making a run for it onto the boat despite not being told to evacuate and him being the ONLY PERSON on the entire island that could've stolen the goods.<br/><br/>And to top it off lets bash science in general as a main theme just because, despite science bringing the dinosaurs which is the entire thing that makes the plot cool to begin with. I know it's a movie, but at some point you begin to question the entire thing.<br/><br/>But none of that makes more than a one star dent. Because you know what? The cast is just about absolutely perfect. Jeff Goldblum is so awesome in this movie it's ridiculous, same with Richard Attenborough. The rest of the cast is damned good, John Williams score soars as high as it ever has, and Spielberg is as on point in every shot and step of the way as he was with Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The dialog has a weirdly memorable snap and flow to it that makes it as easily followable and memorable as movie like Star Wars: A New Hope and Pulp Fiction. And best of all, dinosaurs are awesome! No matter much progress was derided, no matter many people got eaten, you finish the movie thinking the same thing every time ""Damn, seeing a real life dinosaur would be like the coolest most awesome thing EVER!"" And that's why it's a must watch. It's just plain entertaining. It's fantastic, it's awesome. When you hear the word's ""Welcome, to Jurassic Park"" you'll feel like you're watching a real life dinosaur not ten feet in front of you, and that is one the most magical things you'll ever experience."

","In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.<br/><br/>The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn't seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn't the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.<br/><br/>This is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn't even in the top 250. Today, people don't appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90's, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn't understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.<br/><br/>This spawned two sequels. The second one wasn't bad, but the third wasn't very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.<br/><br/>The story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone's life is at stake.<br/><br/>The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.<br/><br/>Younger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren't scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.<br/><br/>Watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993."

","Jurassic Park taught us many things. It taught us that there is nothing scarier than being hunted by a giant wingless bird. It taught us that the T-Rex is a creature of such stealth that it can sneak into a building unnoticed to save the day. But most important of all, we learned from J-Park that the most formidable species to ever exist in this world was the ever adaptive egosaurus. And I'm not talking about prehistoric creatures, I'm talking about modern humanoids. There are three main subspecies that stand out in Jurassic Park. We have Hammond, the Deiasourus who thinks he's a God. There is Malcolm, aka Dr. Chaos, aka the Prophesaurus, who thinks he's the voice of truth and is so full of $#i+, he could probably benefit from an existential enema. And then there's Grant, the Academisaurus who thinks he's the voice of reason and logic. Unfortunately – SPOILERS - all three of these sores survive the carnage and show up for various sequels as well. I guess we're supposed to get some satisfaction out of watching a blood-sucking lawyer get turned into a dino's dinner while he sits on the crapper. Sam Jackson is here too. But unfortunately, you won't hear him say, ""I've had it with these futha muckin' dinosaurs in this futha muckin' park!"" No, the man plays it cool here. The plot is as follows: Hammond can't wait to show his dino pets to the world. He seems so giddy at the prospect that you sense he's gonna wet himself if he has to wait a day longer. But before he can have his grand opening, he must endure a lawyerly island evaluation and the unwanted knee grabs of a leathery mathematician. Hammond is a Scot intent on showing his guests a bloody good time. But for all the expense that he hasn't spared, it turns out that JP has a few glitches. But when things go wrong and Hammond's grandkids are almost eaten by a Tee'd off T-Rex, Hammond is careful not to overreact. ""It's just a delay,"" he says. What follows is a tyrannical trip through the dino dome as Samuel L. Jackson chain smokes, the sole Jurassic park ranger mopes around like he was rejected for the role of Crocodile Dundee and Laura Dern slaps the $#!t out of a log. And just when you thought the meals on heals were free and clear, it turns out there's no manual override for computer controlled door locks. Don't adjust your rear view mirrors, that object is as awesome as it appears!"
"raphaklopper","10","1","1","8 May 2013"," It took people being eaten and shattered along with the direction of Spielberg that made me remember why I always liked Dinosaurs.
","Another great classic that the master Spielberg gave to the world. Do you ever wonder why dinosaurs are very famous? Thanks to ""Jurassic Park"" the ""Discovery Channel"" almost was not necessary.<br/><br/>Well, first let's talk about the story. The film is based on the book by Michael Crichton (who also wrote the movie's screenplay along with David Koepp). The film (which is quite different from the book) tells the story of a theme park where the main attraction is.... dinosaurs. The park, which has not yet opened to the public, is directed by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) wanting to do a demonstration of the park, he invites the world's best paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and his wife Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and the scientist Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), which looks more like a rock star. The three characters and the two grandchildren of John, Tim (Joseph Mazzello) and Lex Murphy (Ariana Richards) begin the tour through the magical park, until the power source has problem taking all security systems to failure. And with that, the huge and small carnivorous creatures are released and begin the small massacre.<br/><br/>The movie looks cute at the beginning, a little adventure on a magical island. Soon after the heroes arrive they primarily discover how the creatures that disappeared over 1 billion years ago are alive and in perfect condition. Then, moments of scientific dialogs start to explain everything. And if you think about it, it is all possible, that is where the writing of Michael stands out perfectly.<br/><br/>Soon after the dinosaurs get loose, starts a pursuit of pure suspense that only ends way latter. When a poor character is eaten by a T-Rex, the movie give's the climax that any of the characters can be eaten at any time and torn.<br/><br/>Writing, story, characters, all superb. But the technical aspects are totally stunning. The dinosaurs are very realistic, and their loud roars even seem real.<br/><br/>Another memorable classic. Characters, story, and even the dinosaurs are really unforgettable, a true masterpiece to be remembered forever."

","Co-scripted by Michael Crichton from his own best-seller, ""Jurassic Park"" is a great deal of fun, offering action, suspense, scares, amusing performances, and some of the most utterly convincing special effects that you'll see in a film of this type.<br/><br/>Billionaire John Hammond (a delightful Richard Attenborough) has created an island theme park populated with living dinosaurs that he's had cloned from ancient dinosaur DNA. When issues as to the safety of the park arise, he hires renowned paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to inspect the place and hopefully give it their seal of approval. He's so confident of his security measures that he even lets his target audience, in the form of his grandchildren Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzello), come along. Of course, one can guess that things are going to go horribly wrong...<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg once again proves himself one of the masters of such entertainment, giving it a true sense of grandeur, with excellent location shooting in Hawaii and the Dominician Republic, impressive production design by Rick Carter, and effective cinematography by old pro Dean Cundey. John Williams gives the production another of his anthemic and rousing scores. Admittedly the story takes its time to really get going, but it emerges a grabber, with the tyrannosaurus rex and the velociraptors becoming true forces to be reckoned with. The dinosaurs are brought to convincing life using a variety of practical and digital effects, utilizing the talents of such gentlemen as Dennis Muren, Stan Winston, Phil Tippett, and Michael Lantieri.<br/><br/>The actors display just the right amount of awe & wonder and subsequently apprehension and real fear, and the spectacle thankfully never overwhelms their efforts; Goldbum is priceless in his typical fashion as a charismatic eccentric; also among the well chosen supporting cast are Bob Peck as game warden Muldoon, Martin Ferrero as the lawyer Gennero, B.D. Wong as a scientist, and Samuel L. Jackson and the scene stealing Wayne Knight as other park personnel. And just as the actors show that awe & wonder, so too will the audience feel those emotions; there is real movie making magic on display here.<br/><br/>Any kid *or* adult who's ever felt a fascination for the extinct animals of Earths' past will be pleased with the results. And the message about the nature and folly of man trying to ""play God"", as it were, often a recurring theme in fantastic cinema, comes across here in high style. Very well done overall.<br/><br/>Nine out of 10."

","SEEING this movie again, 19 years after it hit the big screens, makes me appreciate Spielberg's talent even more. 'Jurassic' was the 'King Kong' of our time, and a character in the movie even makes a reference to the great ape. <br/><br/>Spielberg should convert this into a 3D movie, instead of letting his buddy, George Lucas, put us through the torture of watching the first Star Wars prequel in 3D. <br/><br/>Spielberg's examination of humans wanting to control nature through science is exhilarating, as is its consequences. <br/><br/>In fact, the theme is similar to James Cameron's 'The Terminator' (1984), which is about human's lust for development and dependence on machines. <br/><br/>Goldblum's chaos theorist character is rakish and fun, and the dinosaur scenes still keep me tingling. <br/><br/>The tycoon's 'spared no expense' line is an indictment of rich people thinking they can solve or do anything if they had tonnes of money."

","I saw this film in the cinema when it came out, and it was the definition of ""Blockbuster"" - people were lined up around the block to get into the cinema. That is how popular, successful and downright groundbreaking this film was and still is. <br/><br/>""Groundbreaking"" is a tossed-around term these days, but Jurassic Park is definitely worth the accolade. The dinosaurs (whilst maybe a bit outdated now) are frighteningly real. How they look, how they sound and how they move is as life-like as anyone can imagine. Apart from the dinosaurs, the cast is pretty impressive. Sam Neill is as good as ever and Jeff Goldblum brings a good element of humour to scenes of great tension.Even the kids do a great job during the nail-biting kitchen scene. <br/><br/>The master of summer blockbusters, Spielberg, does not disappoint his audience with this. No messing about - you want entertainment, you got it! Action, comedy, adventure, scares, Samuel L Jackson - it's all there. The scriptwriters do a pretty good job of staying faithful to Crichton's vision in the novel too.<br/><br/>Apart from a few problems with the story (an electric fence designed to put off giant dinosaurs does minimal damage to a 12 year old boy), and a bit of artistic licence with dinosaur facts, this movie is and will remain a firm favourite with many, many people.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and check out the DVD extras too - it is truly amazing how they designed and created the dinosaurs."

","I just created my IMDb account and this is my very first movie review. Why choose Jurassic Park? From the very first time I watched it in theatres (when I was 3 and apparently sitting on my dad's lap, facing the other way when the T-Rex came on screen) I have always LOVED this movie. I always get a nostalgic feeling when I watch this movie as this spawned my love for dinosaurs. Now that I am grown up *somewhat* this movie is still one of my all time favs. I always find something new when watching it and always look forward to the scenes I remember. Spielberg has subtle changes from the original novel (omitting certain parts, changing the personality of characters, especially Dr. Grant) but is still true to the meat of the plot. From ""blood sucking lawyers,"" ""rock-star"" mathematicians, and stereotypical paleontologists, Spielberg created a movie that, to this day, still is one of the greatest of all time. John Williams, who scored the film created one of the most recognizable theme songs in all films and I still listen to it. ""Clever Girl."""

","""Jurassic Park"" came out in the Summer of 1993, and just destroyed the competition! Only Steven Spielberg could pull this off. He took a technology being at its infant stages and he applied it to a story that could bring out only the best of its qualities. Because let's face it, creating dinosaurs is much easier than creating other living creatures, because of the skin texture. Computers can do it relatively easy and with the contribution of the most determined director in history, the results are breath-taking.<br/><br/>And it's the presence of Spielberg that makes this movie so believable. He put all this monumental effort into making a movie that looks better than most of today's visual effects movies ('Mummy Returns', 'Dungeons and Dragons', etc). In fact the effects on this movie are even better than the effects of 'Jurassic Park 3'. Now, JP 3 includes effects that are more advanced than those of the first movie, but they are less effective.<br/><br/>My point is that the 'Spielberg' factor is an important element for a movie. He has this enormous power both as an artist and as a producer, to collect and effectively employ the best of this world in his movies.<br/><br/>No one else could make this movie any better, even today.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I remember when this one came out in Summer of 93. What a great time to watch movies.<br/><br/>No mistake, JP is a GREAT movie. In fact, it's a classic sci-fi film. It's the classic big budget summer movie from Hollywood. It's the 50s monster movie that looks all the more convincing for better effects. The 'serious' overlay is no different than that of Them or The Thing, as the scientists or survivors discuss the 'bigger picture'. There's just a little too much, with not enough humor, of that, in this. Dern and Grandpa shout over the dinette table, but carry on too long, and cry about it all. Goldblum pounds the conference table in a 50s-looking soundstage with lots of projector screens oddly surrounding it. Serious issue, man made the atom bomb, or man created dinosaurs from the DNA of bullfrogs. Issue made. Now let Mothra rage - or whatever is let loose.<br/><br/>The special effects are an improvement over the pure model and stop motion of the past. Harryhausen's work is still watchable, and believable (his crab in Mysterious Island). But here, for the first time, you see dinosaurs done right. Maybe the full size models of T-Rex bobbing and weaving around the jeep, and poking its head into the glass, is a little stiff, and Harryhausen did better, or would have. But splice in the CGI T-Rex ripping off the tires, or chasing Goldblum, and its entirely different, and very believable. A shame they wind up with a smaller Rex in the indoor lobby. The Rex on the grassy field was more in keeping to scale with the one that injured Goldblum - and killed the annoying lawyer.<br/><br/>Won't mention all the plot holes and continuity errors, even just in that one scene in the jeep fleeing the T-Rex at night. And the kids and the electrified fence. Kids go through the holes - oh, wait - big noise in background, up you go, hurry! That bothered me even when I first saw it in the theatre. Dern and Neil holding the raptor at bay outside the control room - TIMMY! get the darned gun. The kid's just pounding the back of Lex's chair as she says - this is UNIX system. And then the gun jams when the raptor does break the glass. How convenient. Game hunter in the woods - run Laura, run, no, you can't, they're watching us, run, run now, wait, you'll never make it, go, GO! (reminded me, vaguely, of the Kirk/Spock comedy routine with Mrs. Camden in movie 4) But it's just a movie. I don't remember those kind of holes in something like Them or even Mysterious Island (which really was a hodge-podge).<br/><br/>But I digress. For pure Summer entertainment, I give this a 10."

This movie revolutionized special effects with its flawless CGI and it is proof of the wondrous cinematic powers of Stephen Spielberg. The great vision of Spielberg is combined with the story and imagination of Michael Crichton, author of the book of the same name, to create the golden masterpiece that is Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>The story is truly timeless. Billionaire John Hammond, a man with great vision, brings together scientists, theorists, and businessmen alike to a tour unlike any other: a park inhabited by living, breathing dinosaurs brought back to life through cloning. When a spy messes with the security systems to steal Jurassic Park property, everyone's lives are at stake as the carnivores of the prehistoric era seek them out as prey.<br/><br/>This movie has it all: great action, intriguing sci-fi, wonderful music, memorable characters, amazing (and revolutionary) special effects, funny thought-provoking dialog, and a terrific cast of creatures. So many scenes are a splendor to watch from the Brachiosaur sighting to the T-Rex rampage. The dinosaurs are treated as they should be, not as monsters but as animals merely following their instincts.

Even for it's time the special effects are amazing (even there time) that this movie seems less outdated then it would be.<br/><br/>Having read the Michael Crichton book (and it's sequel) I can say as an adaption, it did take certain liberties with the book (Hammond being more of a grandfather than a coward, or Donald Gennero being a coward), but letting all that aside it's a very entertaining movie.<br/><br/>The plot follows two paleontologists (Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler played by Sam Neill and Laura Dern) who are summoned by Billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to visit his new amusement park that's he planing to open. Joining them are a Mathematician named Ian Malcolm (who's character just for the record disappears near the end of the book and doesn't appear again), and a lawyer named Donald Gennero (played by Martin Ferrero, don't we all just hate that blasted lawyer). John Hammond wants them to try out his park so they can examine it, and give there own opinions.<br/><br/>Much to their surprise (and a big surprise) the park is full of dinosaurs (made using mosquito blood which is spliced together with other animals such as fill in order to fill the gaps of the genetic strains). The Dinosaurs are kept near steel bars so as to not escape and wreck havoc.<br/><br/>That being said Hammond wants them to take a tour of his park along with his grand-kids Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzello, who is obsessed Grant, which delights and annoys him at the same time).<br/><br/>While this is going one of the people working at InGen (the company responsible for making the dinosaurs) a computer program named Dennis Nerdly is attempting to shut down the park so he can steal Dinosaur embroys to give to a rival company.<br/><br/>Nerdly is successful in shutting down the park, but eventually meets his death in a gruesome way (won't spoil it for anyone who's seen the film), and the Dinosaur are released, leading to several scenes involving characters meeting their deaths. It especially becomes a problem as it means that the T-Rex is free. The rest of the story is about how the people staying at Jurassic Park attempt to survive getting eaten by dinosaur.<br/><br/>This film is one of my favorites, and while the story is fairly light, the special effects are a must, even for their time the special effects are astounding (and seeing it on the big screen, didn't change my opinion at all, just look at the dinosaurs amazing). The direction is well done (Spielberg is truly one of the greatest modern day directors working right now), and I admit the acting is a little lame (save for a few performances), but hey why do you expect good acting from a film, when all your actors are running around screaming all the time. The script works, making sense of the plot and not creating too many plot-holes. As a whole this film has really stood up, quite well, and seeing it on the big screen was a treat."

","When 'Jurassic Park' was released around the mid-90s it changed movie history forever. It terrified a whole host of young school children, who couldn't keep themselves from watching it. It thrilled all those teenagers who had never seen anything like this before. And it even entertained all the adults too. And yet, here we are in the 21st century, almost 20 years later, and this movie is still wildly popular. Almost everyone has seen it and most people love it. Why? I'll offer a few reasons.<br/><br/>Firstly, the characters. The characters are all interesting and most are unpredictable (except the lawyer). What is so intriguing about them all is that they are depicted as fairly normal people. And yet, O what awaits them! Richard Attenborough is excellent as John Hammond and Sam Neill is the perfect choice for Alan Grant. Jeff Goldblum was also a great choice as the total opposite to Grant and Laura Dern is the attractive - but not provocative - Ellie Sattler. So the cast and characters are perfect. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with such a well selected group of actors for their roles. They clash because they're all so strong; and yet they are forced to unite to save each other from the dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Secondly, the plot. The plot is really imaginative (even if it's seriously fictional). The story line is presented in such a way that you are almost led to believe that this is possible. And depending on who you are, the film seems to meet your desires. The kids watch it for the dinosaurs; the adults want a bit of terrifying action. Well, you get what it says on the tin.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the music. What memorable music! John Williams wrote the theme tune and it is certainly one of the best theme tunes he's ever done. It's the iconic 90s soundtrack. 'Titanic' cannot hold a candle to it.<br/><br/>And finally (for now): the special effects. This film is spell-binding in it's movie effects. Every proper film-lover takes the work of the special effects in 'Jurassic Park' very seriously. They were ground- breaking effects. Certainly when the T-Rex comes onto the scene, you are absolutely blown away with the realism!<br/><br/>Overall, it is right up there with the top 10 best films of the 90s. It's certainly one of my favourites. I've seen it about 6 or 7 times and it's always enjoyable. I would go so far as to say that if ever there was a movie made especially for the cinema, this is it. Hence why now in 2011, they want to re-release it in cinemas in the UK for a limited time only. Can't wait. It's going to blow us all away once again."

","Now that i've seen a few bits and bobs (both good and bad) i'm determined to learn more about what makes this film more popular, So sad to see that nice old man Michael Crichton (1942-2008) to pass out like that...if only other good palaeontologists would get the guts to realise how decent a good novelist would be. If i we're a novelist i would virtually write a story very very much like this one. Witnessing Goldblum's humour that had it all, it's a good thing that Spielberg directed it. There is so much effort on how these films should exist, especially 1988's Land before time. I'm hoping there'll be a 4th one soonish...and i truly wish Michael Crichton were alive to see it all, Shame James Cameron eclipsed the lot ^^;"
"nohr01","10","1","1","20 June 2011"," Timeless Movie
","The film Jurassic Park is about a theme park that Dr. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) and his team created. The theme park, called Jurassic Park, is like a zoo of dinosaurs which were created through genetic engineering. Before the park is able to be opened to the public, Dr. Hammond must get approval from an array of people, including scientists Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), stating that the park is safe for the public. The dinosaurs end up breaking out of their electric cages due to a power outage and wreak havoc on the entire island and the people on the island. I believe the important lesson to learn from this movie is that technology is great to a point, but technology cannot be completely relied on; the human mind and variables are crucial in many applications. In the film Jurassic Park, Dr. Hammond and his team used technology to create an island full of deadly genetically engineered dinosaurs. Technology was also used to contain these animals; the entire island relied on a computer system. As we all know, most computer systems fail at one point or another, which is what caused the destruction of the island in this film. The writer of the novel and the screenplay Jurassic Park, Michael Crichton, also directed a film with a similar theme. The film Runaway (1984) focuses on what happens when a machine goes bad; again, technology can be helpful, but it can also be hurtful if not used in the correct way. The special effects used in this film were amazing, especially for their time. The dinosaurs in the film seemed like they were actually real thanks to special effects. This goes to show that technology can be extremely useful; but when taken too far, it can also be devastating. There is a fine line between the helpful use of technology and the destructive use of technology. Also, the sound effects were excellent. The sounds of the dinosaurs made you feel like you were actually a part of the film. When a dinosaur would roar, it made me feel scared for the characters of the movie; especially when you could not see where the dinosaur was, you could only hear it. The sound effects used added to the film to make it seem more realistic. The sound effects also instilled emotions, such as fear and anxiety, in me as I was watching the film. I thought that they were implemented very well into the plot and the theme of the movie. All-in-all I thought this was a great film. The theme is timeless because we will always be dealing with the ups and downs of technology; especially nowadays when everything seems to be turning to technology because of the preciseness and the cost-savings. I saw the film when I was a young kid, and to this day, I still love to watch it over and over again."
"mnpollio","10","1","1","8 June 2011"," Superlative Sci-fi thrill ride
","While I am not a gigantic fan of Michael Crichton as a writer, I must admit that he does come up with tremendous concepts. Jurassic Park, while little more than a thinly disguised upgrade on Westworld, was a concept that just begged to be filmed. And let's face it, dinosaurs on the rampage are a lot more spectacular than haywire robot gunslingers. The fact that it found its perfect partner in director Steven Spielberg is just icing on the proverbial cake.<br/><br/>Billionaire philanthropist Richard Attenborough gathers a cadre of guests to a private tropical island to view his latest enterprise, a theme park populated by genetically recreated dinosaurs. Paleontologists Sam Neill and Laura Dern are in awe, chaos theoritician Jeff Goldblum predicts doom from frame one, and grandchildren Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards are having the time of their lives. Naturally, it does not take long for something to go haywire - in this case industrial espionage that cripples the security systems of the park stranding some of the guests and allowing the dinosaurs to escape their habitats and start a rampage.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that could have detrimentally impacted the film and Spielberg and company navigate them astutely to make the film far much more than just a summertime box office thrill ride. First are the visual effects. From the first moment that we get a good look at the dinosaurs, we never doubt their existence within the confines of the film. They appear to be genuinely living and breathing creatures that behave in perfectly convincing ways. With the minor exception of a close up shot of a brachiosaur that seems slightly underwhelming, the effects are flawless.<br/><br/>While it is the popular stance to proclaim that Crichton's novel is better, I disagree. While there are certain scenes from Crichton's novel that I had wished made it into the film, the majority of the changes are improvements. The screenplay grabs enough of Crichton's long-winded scientific gobbledy-gook to make the concept plausible, but cuts it off before it bogs down into one of Crichton's eye-glazing rants. Additionally, Crichton's novel contained a case of such jaw-dropping, collective stupidity regarding two plot points that have wisely been abandoned for the film. One of Crichton's weaknesses is an inability to craft appealing characters and the novel of Jurassic Park is no exception. Populated by an interchangeable melange of glacial, aloof jargon-spouting ciphers and mustache-twirling villains, it is difficult to give a damn about who lives or dies in the novel, including his two appallingly charmless children characters. By contrast, the characters of the film may not be deep, but they are appealing, humorous and accessible.<br/><br/>The acting is solid all around. Neill makes a stalwart hero, both intelligent and active. Goldblum manages a number of humorous moments as the naysayer in the group. Both Mazzello and Richards are appealing, a marked change from the novel where Richards character especially is headache-inducing. Dern does not have a lot to do, but does it well. The biggest character change from the novel is morphing Attenborough's billionaire from a cardboard villain into a warm grandfatherly figure, whose dreams of providing the world with some splendor take a tragic turn. His tete-a-tete with Dern lamenting his intentions gone awry is a touching moment.<br/><br/>Spielberg is also at the top of his game here. Tonally the film captures the awe-inspiring wonder of E.T. with the gut-wrenching thrills of Jaws, a combination that only Spielberg can do so well. His pacing is pitch-perfect. He allows just enough time to introduce the characters, get the background of the science and the lay-out of the island, before moving full blast into excitement. The first attack by the tyrannosaurus rex is a career highlight, but the film also has a great deal of tension in a more low-key sequence when an industrial saboteur is confronted with an initially docile seeming critter that turns nasty. The concluding moments detailing the pursuit of the main characters outside of and through the main headquarters by a pack of voracious velociraptors is the stuff of white knuckles.<br/><br/>A really amazing and worthwhile film experience that now - even after two sequels and imitators - has yet to be equaled. A rare film that functions as both popcorn entertainment, but also allows you to walk away feeling that you saw something you had never seen before. Avoid the next sequel - The Lost World - which is a dud retread directed by Spielberg on a bad day, with Goldblum's supporting character mind-numbingly bumped to the lead, and concluding with a ludicrous underwhelming rampage through...San Diego."

","In honor of the late,great Michael Crichton I watched Jurassic Park for the first time in a year or so. Now with that being said this movie can only be summed up in one word. Masterful, this film is so great that you are just awe inspired and scared through out. The T-Rex scene and the raptors' scenes were just phenomenal and extremely intense. The story line was amazingly written (by Michael Crichton) and directed by master of the film Steven Spielberg.

","When the first Jurassic Park movie came out I fell in love with the brachiosaur ""Welcome to Jurassic Park"" scene and have been hooked ever since. To have the three movies in a set and the additional footage is just a pleasure. True the plot of the second movie (The Lost World) is not in the same league with that first vision, but the dinosaurs are so great that it is still fun. The third movie, however, is much closer to the first in quality and almost equally entertaining, thanks in part to the acting skills of William H. Macy. It is the dinosaurs, however, that star in this trilogy. It is amazing to me how the well the special efffects have held up! Definitely worth the cost of the DVDs. Dinosaur lovers unite and ENJOY!"

It doesn't run towards the ending and allows you to understand what is happening. Also atmosphere is absolutely perfect, beyond even. The way it remains constant throughout the film is brilliant.<br/><br/>The next thing is the soundtrack. The Jurasic Park main theme is one of the Beiutiful, Iconic and Masterful in the history of cinema. It is strong and powerful yet not overpowering.<br/><br/>I found the acting perfect. Each character was represented well. On the other hand is that this area has the main flaws.

"Amblin","9","1","1","29 April 1999"," Epitomises the title 'A STEVEN SPIELBERG FILM'.
","What can one say after witnessing one of the greatest motion pictures of all time? The creative genius has done it again, by simply returning to the thriller genre that shot him to fame with Jaws.....with the same intensity and thrills. But this time around, Spielberg has the aid of CGI...which made JP such a landmark film. Using the visual effects, Steven has captured the imagination of the entire planet, making JP the most successful film of all time (until 1998). He has tapped into the audience's greatest fears, and used them against us to a horrifying degree. Who can forget the terrifying T-Rex first lumbering out of her enclosure, and don't forget her chasing the tour jeep! This is the ultimate Steven Spielberg film......if ever there was one......an adventure/thriller surpassed by no other. Seeing this for the first time in 1993 when I was only 11 years old....it scared the crap out of me. I couldn't sleep for a week....let alone eat properly. I am proud to be part of the JP phenomenon....as it certainly defined a Steven Spielberg film. As always, his direction of the characters is unique, and will never be rivalled.....never. Just take a look at character reactions to the dinosaurs, and especially the apparent misunderstandings between Alan and Tim. John Williams' score is awesome.....once again defining a Spielberg film. Williams' originality in the thriller genre has also been revisited 18 years after Jaws. Michael Kahn's film editing in the continuity aspect of things is the only flaw, where one can immeadiately pick up on his mistakes.....although, there are not many, the mistakes sure do stand out like a sore thumb. In spite of this, the continuity doesn't let the film down.....as the common movie-goer rarely picks up on editing mistakes (thank God!) especially in a movie like this when you're more concerned about crapping your pants  for 120 mins straight. Overall, JP is a gem when it comes to thriller film-making.....it epitomises the genre and the credit 'A Steven Spielberg Film'. It's not hard to understand why this monster movie made $913 million at the box office."

It's visual effects still work, but the important thing is that the suspense still works.<br/><br/>Spielberg's movies are always done by the book, and the fact that in this one he doesn't takes advantage of sentimentalism as shamelessly as usual improves the result. <br/><br/>The only flaw (or the most significant) is the hilarious ending with the ""heroic"" T-Rex's appearance as a deus est machina and the falling flag.<br/><br/>The best thing is the treatment of the ""villain(s)"", also by the book: we are told about the velociraptor since the beginning of the movie and it becomes a threatening presence that doesn't reveal itself until the second half of the movie.

","Like most kids back in 1993, I couldn't wait to see Jurassic Park. The fact that I was already interested in Dinosaurs made the film even more of a holy grail. Jurassic Park was the film that dreams were made of for yours truly, and despite my massively over-inflated expectations - the film really DID deliver. I saw it in cinema several times, and, at the time, couldn't ever see anything topping Jurassic Park. Of course, this was just the simple view of a child and, having seen many other films by now, as well as several subsequent viewings of this one; it's clear that this isn't the film that I once thought it was. But don't get me wrong - the fact that I now understand that films do indeed get better than this don't mean that Jurassic Park isn't a brilliantly well sculpted piece of entertainment. The plot is taken from the Michael Crichton book of the same title, and follows a new theme park, where the attractions are Dinosaurs. We follow a group made up of palaeontologists, other experts and the owner's children as they visit the park. Naturally, everything goes wrong and the lot of them are thrust into the world of the dinosaurs! <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg can win a million Oscars for Schindler's List, but it doesn't change the fact that entertainment is his forte when it comes to film-making. The debate as to whether or not he's a great director can rage, but he definitely does know how to entertain if nothing else - and he shows that brilliantly with this film. The build up to the main action can be a little dull at times, but you're always on the edge of your seat due to the fact that you know it's not going to be all rosy. The film really comes together in the scene that sees the 'king' of the dinosaurs - the Tyrannosaurus Rex break free from it's cage. This scene is incredibly well directed - so much so that the rest of the movie never comes close to outdoing it. Spielberg tends to cast his movies with likable actors, and he's done that here. This does make the movie easy to like, but the resoundingly 'good' characters are often as flat as something that the T-Rex has stood on, and that doesn't do the movie any favours. I'm a big hater of CGI - except when it's done well, and I've got to say that it largely is here. Some scenes look very fake indeed, but the monster effects give it an old-school monster flick feel, and to be honest I'm glad that not all the dinosaurs look absolutely great. On the whole - this wont impress the people looking for great acting and the like; but Jurassic Park really is a first rate thriller, and if you like your films to be fun - you'll like Jurassic Park."

","When one looks back at the evolution of movies, Jurassic Park has to be on the list. It is not the greatest movie ever made, but it was THE groundbreaking movie on the 1990s on the special effects front. This was the first mass-marketed, studio produced movie to use computer generated creatures, creatures who were seamlessly inserted into a live action movie. Special effects we take for granted now were pioneered by Steven Spielberg and his crew of special effect artists in Jurassic Park. The movie requires fantastic special effects, the story based on the Michael Crichton book by the same name about genetic engineers bringing dinosaurs back to life 65 million years after they died out. The story is pretty much the standard scary creature movie, as the dinosaurs chase people, eat people, scare people, but is still entertaining through the effort of Spielberg. The tension created through the various scenes in the movie and the real-life quality of the dinosaurs. Herky-jerky, fake dinosaurs would not be real-enough for the audiences, diminishing the tension that is created by dinosaurs chasing the characters in the movie. A fun science fiction story is turned into an almost life-like dinosaur chaser movie because of the revolutionary special effects seen in Jurassic Park."

The more I really listened to it, the more I really understood it. Now, I can't get enough of it. I confiscated it from the family movie case and now it lives safely in my room next to my TV. <br/><br/>I find it an oddly satisfying movie to watch on a windy, cold night with a few gal pals. We all love Goldblums sense of humor in odd situations, and we ALL love the character Ellie. <br/><br/>Alright, alright, enough about OUR opinions, right?<br/><br/>I'd recommend this for a ten year-old, sure. They might not get the full effect of it, but hey, kids these days are getting' smart! It has a intriguing story line and it kept me itching to find out what happened next. I don't think that there were ANY boring parts, except for in the very beginning when we first see that Dennis guy (The dude with 'butterfingers'). But as I was about to change the channel, he put the shaving cream on the pie. That would bite to take a taste of that! Yuck!<br/><br/>All and all, I really enjoyed watching the actors well, act.

Now, almost every film is using computer effects.  Even in shots that look natural.  You can't tell that they're there.  Steven Spielberg's direction is Disney-esque, like his work on 'E.T.'

The perfect use of animatronics and CGI (it revolutionized the CGI industry in hollywood) is unsurpassed these 10 years later.  It sparked a million knockoffs, whether in genre (dino-movies) or special effects (every God-awful pixel of CGI puked out by the hollywood braintrust)-- for further info on bad CGI, be sure to catch the upcoming HULK movie). They remain some of the greatest (if not THE greatest) special effects in cinematic history.  The story, however, is pitifully inferior to the book.  The characters are unimportant in the movie, taking backseat to Steven Speilberg's Dino-F/X.  Jeff Goldblum's character, who was pivotal to the book (as he spoke for us, the reader), served no greater purpose than comedic value in this movie.

""Jurassic Park"" is about a theme park on an island in the Pacific Ocean that features much different attractions than your usual amusement park. Genetically created dinosaurs are the main attraction here, and a group of scientists, a lawyer, and two kids are invited to view the park. The park is owned by Dr. John Hammond, portrayed by Oscar-winning ""Gandhi"" director Sir Richard Attenborough. He invites paleontologists Sam Neill and Laura Dern; mathematician Jeff Goldblum; lawyer Martin Ferrero; and grandchildren Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards to Jurassic Park and they go on the ride of their lives! If only they can survive after things start breaking down over the park and the dinosaurs begin to run amok. This movie features probably the best special effects ever created for a feature film. The dinosaurs look incredibly real, and they're awesome to watch. The sound effects are scary, especially if you saw this in a theater. The visual effects, sound, and sound effects editing won well-deserved Oscars. Some people said that the performances here come off flat. Well there's no doubt the dinosaurs upstage the humans in the film, but I think the performances are terrific too. Neill, Dern, Attenborough, Mazzello, Richards, and especially Goldblum are very good in this movie. And there are two other familiar faces in the cast in smaller parts: Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Knight as computer technicians who work on the island. ""Jurassic Park"" is one of Steven Spielberg's best movies. It's great fun from start to finish. Followed by the excellent second movie ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"".<br/><br/>**** (out of four)"

","Like every other little boy I was too fascinated by Dinosaurs. Truly amazing beautiful animals that went extinct 65 million years ago. There is so much to learn about Dinosaurs, scientists only know part of the greater story. I once wanted to be a paleontologist when I grew up but then I said I wanted to be a number of things. Wouldn't it be nice to see live Dinosaurs so we could touch them and study them? Would it be possible to control the animals that have been just brought back to life? The movie suggests no way especially if we are going to be ignorant. Malcolm said that life would find a way so breeding them all to be female may not work. The explanation the film gives us for how we could clone dinosaurs is quite logical, scientists said that it could done. (In the future of course) With the use of CGI legendary director Steven Spielberg brought us completely convincing looking dinosaurs. The movie has a terrific story its exciting, entertaining, compelling and a lot of fun. Critics complained that the acting was bad, I thought acting was just fine. The logic behind how the parks electrical system would work is shaky and some of it doesn't make sense. Jurassic Park instantly became an international box office hit. 1993 was a good year for Steven Spielberg he made piles of money from this movie and he won 7 Academy awards for his other movie Schindler's List. 10/10 Great fun for all ages. Followed by The Lost World Jurassic Park."

","Directed by Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), this film, along with Terminator 2, set the standard for advances in special effects, and it was a favourite film for me growing up, still is, based on the novel by Michael Crichton. Basically palaeontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) are renowned for studying dinosaur bones, and are invited by the founder and CEO of bio-engineering company InGen, John Hammond (Lord Sir Richard Attenborough) to visit, certify and endorse the opening of his newly created theme park on Isla Nublar, an isolated Costa Rican island. Also invited are mathematician and chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), the guests enter Jurassic Park, and are stunned by the sight of a living breathing dinosaur, a Brachiosaurus, plus two others and a herd of Parasaurolophus in the distance. Hammond takes them to the visitor centre where a laboratory tour explains that dinosaur DNA was extracted from the bodies of mosquitoes found trapped in hardened tree sap, called amber, and the incomplete DNA strains had sequences gaps filled by frog DNA, and to prevent breeding all dinosaurs have been engineered to be female, despite being initially stunned some of the guests question the ethics of bringing extinct (by selection) creatures back to life. The group are joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Tim (Joseph Mazzello and Lex Murphy (Ariana Richards), children being his target audience, to take the tour of Jurassic Park, with Hammond and his team watching from the control room, but it does not go to plan, as dinosaurs including the Dilophosaurus not appearing, and getting out of the controlled Explorer cars they find a sick Triceratops. It gets worse when a tropical storm has been reported as heading for the island, computer programmer Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) uses this opportunity, he has been bribed by a corporate rival to steal dinosaur embryos, he deactivates security systems to gain access to them and escape, in doing this the guests in the cars come to a stop, and fences are failing all over the park. This leads to this escape of the most dangerous of the dinosaurs in Jurassic Psrk, the Tyranosaurus Rex, Gennaro is devoured, Malcolm is badly injured, and Tim is pushed off the embankment whilst in the car into a tree, but he and Lex are safe and rescued, and they and Grant climb into another tree to hide until the morning, Nedry meanwhile trying to get to the dock is killed by the Dilophosaurus, and the embryos he collected are lost in the mud. Sattler and game warden Robert Muldoon (Edge of Darkness's Bob Peck) search for the survivors, only finding Malcolm alive, they narrowly an attack by the T. Rex, during the night Grant and the children get close to a herd of Brachiosaurus, and as morning comes they come across broken shells of hatched dinosaur eggs, Grant concludes that the frogs used to complete DNA sequences must have been West African bullfrogs, which have been known to change sex in a single-sex environment, allowing them to breed. While the three of them encounter a herd of Gallimimus, and avoid the T. Rex again, Hammond insists that to get security and communication systems working again they should reboot the system, reluctant chief engineer Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson) agrees, and it does work, he heads for the maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. Arnold does not return after some time, so Sattler and Muldoon head out, they find that the shutdown has allowed the escape of the other dangerous dinosaurs, the Velociraptors, Sattler makes it to the shed and using walkie talkie communicates with Hammond and Malcolm to reactivate the power systems, unaware that Grant and the children are climbing an electrocuted fence. Sattler discovers Arnold's severed arm and escapes an attack from a raptor in the shed, Muldoon is killed in a raptor ambush, and Grant and the children make it back to the visitor centre, Grant goes to search for the others, leaving the children inside, but they have two Velociraptors searching for them. Grant, Sattler and the children go the control room, and Lex being a computer hacker is able to restore full power, allowing the group to call for help, they are cornered by two raptors, but escape when the Tyrannosaurus suddenly appears to kill both raptors. In the end Grant voices his intent not to endorse the park, Hammond concurs this decision, and all the survivors board the rescue helicopter and leave the island. Also starring BD Wong as Henry Wu (he returned in Jurassic World), Gerald R. Molen as Gerry Harding, Miguel Sandoval as Juanito Rostagno and Cameron Thor as Lewis Dodgson. The acting is fine by all the actors in it, but the real stars are of course the dinosaurs, brought to life by both brilliant CGI special effects and models, the story is simple and the action is exciting, and the script is well written when you think about it, it is definitely a film the whole family can enjoy, many sequels have followed, but (besides Jurassic World) they have cannot surpass this original blockbuster, a great science-fiction adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Effects, and it was nominated for Best Sound. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 35 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 15 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good!"

","Wealthy businessman Hammond has developed a process for recreating dinosaurs from DNA held inside insects encased in amber.  He uses it to create an island theme park, Jurassic Park, to cash in on the spectacle.  Hammond invites a select group to visit the island under tour conditions - his lawyer, a mathematician, his grandchildren and two archeologists.  However during the tour the man in charge of the computer system shuts down the fences so he can smuggle out stolen dinosaur embryos to sell to the higher bidder.  With the fences down the dinosaurs escape their compounds and the visiting group find themselves with a much closer view than they expected.<br/><br/>Adapted from Michael Crichton's novel, this is basically a summer blockbuster that relies on special effects to cover the holes in the plot. The story is a little daft from the very start however once you get past the first 30 minutes of science you get to the dinosaurs and Spielberg's set pieces and nothing else really matters.  The effects are good and the action is well handled by the master director himself.  The film has plenty of suspense and drama - especially when the raptors break free!  However the film also has plenty of problems that come out when you look past the spectacle.<br/><br/>Firstly the kids!  Why does Spielberg always feel that he's got to put cute kids in every film - just cause it worked with ET doesn't mean it'll come off every time.  They both quickly become annoying and I wished that they would just move that little bit slower so something could get them.  The film also wants to be a family blockbuster and it doesn't want to upset the audience, hence several main characters that die in the book live in the film so as not to upset sequels etc.  The other main weakness is the huge merchandising that came with the film, making it feel like a happy meal package rather than a film.  However outside of all this baggage the film moves quickly and contains plenty of good action scenes that more than cover the other weaknesses.<br/><br/>Neill is OK as Dr Grant and he is clearly happy to get involved in a franchised blockbuster.  Laura Dern is not as good - she is far too hammy and isn't convincing in  her emotion.  Goldblum is excellent as the chaos-therorising mathematician, but it's his usual stuttering scientist stuff so he doesn't have to try too hard.  The rest of the cast are quality, even if they are only to be dinosaur fodder.  Jackson,, Peck, Wayne Knight and of course, Attenborough.  However those children - who seem to have most of the screen time really should have been better.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good summer blockbuster - the effects and the action scenes are big and exciting.  However the plot is weak, the performances mainly poor - without these major flaws it cannot be as good as it should have been."

","Jurassic Park is nothing more than a dinosaur film like so many made in the past,the only difference being the special effects are outstanding.There really is nothing original about this film,the author Michael Crichton does not deserve any credit because there is nothing unique about the story.It's been done a 1000 times before,and done better.The acting is nothing special.The characters are not very interesting,again the main thing that this film has going for it are wonderful special-effects that were never seen before the date of this films release.I gave the film a four because it still is better than anything made nowadays and is at least viewable,mildly entertaining but thats it."

","Could have been great.  Should have been great.  Would have been great. Wasn't great.  Spielberg ruins another movie with his predictable, politically-correct, ""warm and fuzzy"" style.  Read the book, but don't see the movie unless you are only interested in great effects, which are certainly abundant in the film.  In addition to (and more likely *due* to) Spielberg's bad direction, weak performances abound.  The best thing I can think of to say about it is that it is not as bad as the sequel."

The only things not easily predictable in the simple-minded plot are the holes in it. All characters are acting stupid.

"adamshive","2","12","43","29 September 2005"," I thought this movie was great...when I was 12. Now I just point out all of it's flaws
","There are far too many errors in this movie. The T-Rex walks out of it's pen, then the jeep falls down a cliff at the same spot. The acting is the worst I've seen in any movie of the last 20 years. By definition, paleontologists mainly study geology of past periods, rather than biology. Thus, we can deduct that the main characters would be more surprised, or make more mention of- the dinosaurs physiological and anatomical attributes such as skin and eye color, body temperature, sounds, and overall appearance. The lumber some walking and bobbing of heads that Hollywood often adopts for dinosaurs is highly uncommon in modern cold blooded reptiles. Even the giant Gila Monsters move swiftly with grace and dexterity. The dramatic human like personalities of the dinosaurs is another purely Hollywood stunt. Yes, velociraptors may have the physiological ability to open a door, but without human reasoning, they wouldn't know ""why"" to open one. The biggest underlying question throughout the movie is ""why?"". Why do the dinosaurs want to kill? Why aren't the characters more surprised and ask more questions? Why are there kids on the island? Why did the director let so many slip-ups pass through the final cut? Why did the boy survive a 10,000 volt electric shock? Feel free to contact me at kingshive@yahoo.com PS Why'd they have to use Newman as Nedry??? Haha, I think he was the best actor in the movie."

","Okay, it's a nice, knowing reference, but the sole one amongst the mire. Jurassic Park was, at least until the advent of Independence Day and Godzilla, a new low in brain-dead popcorn fodder. I really, really cannot stand this film. Appallingly patronising to its audience, it expects nothing from them and offers them nothing in return.<br/><br/>WARNING: THE REST OF THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SLIGHT SPOILERS<br/><br/>The cast's roles are built up with the most cursory of characteristics. Witness how Sam Neill's Dr. Grant starts the story not wanting children, yet spends the whole film in their company, thus undergoing a typical ""learning process"". Plot points are given unsubtly for future reference in the film, such as the attack patterns of the velociraptors. (I wonder, do you think they WILL attack someone like that before the end?) ""I'm not a computer nerd, I prefer to be called a hacker"" offers Lex after being sneezed over by a Brachiosaurus. Let me guess, would her ability to hack a computer be relevant somewhere in the movie? Let's not even mention the dinos that open doors by the handle.<br/><br/>Richard Attenborough is probably the worst performer as Dr. Hammond. He starts the movie with an effeminate Scottish accent, which fluctuates to English, then to Scots, then back to English... was the continuity adviser drunk? Maybe he should have played the part as ""Pinkie"" from ""Brighton Rock"". At least it would have been entertaining. ""Stick yer perishin' mincers on that T-Rex"". Jeff um Gold arr blum, joins joins him in ah clumsy ex uh position, then spends the rest of the film uh lying lying on a uh couch. Actually, despite having nothing to do, Goldblum shows why he earns every cent of his wages by being the only one to give some sort of life to the cut-out he's given.<br/><br/>The rigid banality and cynical, transparent manipulation of the film, coupled with its overblown incidental music really starts to grate before long. And while some scenes might be disturbing for small children, its PG certificate, mainstream targets and lowbrow denomination means you know none of the cast will be harmed. Or would a family film really show a ten-year-old boy being electrocuted and then dying? Therefore: no tension. See also: Independence Day, or: if it was real they never would have got that saucer out of the nuclear explosion in time.<br/><br/>What everyone always discusses are the dinosaurs, of course. While, for the most part, excellent, they appear for less than - count 'em - 20 minutes of the film's total. This leaves us with 85% of a movie that is stock, run-of-the-mill and predictable. Even the mighty Samuel L. Jackson looks bored in this one*. On reflection, it appears that novelty was fundamental to its success. The sequel, The Lost World, was a better film yet wasn't as popular, critically or commercially.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is a film riddled with ""cute"" kids, ""comedy"" fat bloke, feeble one-liners and double takes. There's even ""humorous"" use of ""ironic"" juxtaposition, such as the T-Rex bringing down a flyer from When Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth. ""Now that is one big pile o'sh*t"" says Goldblum at one point. To highlight that quote for the purposes of mockery would be cheap and unkind.<br/><br/>* I happened to stumble on my old review in September 2005 and edited it for a few minor typos. How ironic that in the five years since I originally posted this review every single part Sam Jackson has played is one that he's looked thoroughly bored in."

","This film was not as good as the book(as often seems to be the case with movies) and like many adventure movies, its plot isn't exactly strong. Nonetheless, one complaint level against this film isn't fair.  That is that some critics have argued that Spielberg made a mistake by showing the dinosaurs too early, making it less fun.  In Jaws, for comparison, the shark isn't see clearly until half way in the movie.  But the dinosaurs shown early in Jurassic Park aren't dangerous or intimidating; they aren't monsters.  They dinosaurs that do attack people, such as T-Rex, aren't seen until halfway through, while the stars of the show, the ""raptors"", aren't seen clearly until the end."
"dbdumonteil","1","26","114","24 April 2003"," worth seeing for its special effects
","Who has ever dreamt of making a movie which the action would take place during our era with dinosaurs in the main roles. Steven Spielberg must have had the idea by thinking: ""it would get a huge commercial success..."". He aimed straight. Indeed, a few months after the launch of the movie in 1993, the movie beat the record of the box-office takings so far hold by E.T. by the same Spielberg. But this commercial triumph is especially due to a great marketing campaign organized around the movie. Like ""Batman"", ""Jurassic Park"" ranks among the movies that made a dramatic commercial way, mainly due to a strategic marketing campaign but which the movie, in itself, is devoid of interest.<br/><br/>The movie, actually, is worth seeing for its dramatic special effects (thanks to them, the movie won three Oscars in Hollywood in 1994). They can only encourage admiration and take the breathe away. Spielberg only intervened the most famous species of dinosaurs such as the tyrannosaurus and I think it's a pity that you don't see many other species. For example, you don't see the pterodactyl. Besides, you could say that dinosaurs were the sole attraction of the movie for an important number of spectators and it's why the movie attracted masses of people in theaters when the movie was released.<br/><br/>But if you take away this quality, the movie appears devoid of interest. The scantiness and the lack of inspiration of the screenplay are something that you feel. The screenplay follows an outline quite predictable: it starts with the explanations concerning the creation of the park and especially the dinosaurs ( well done, nevertheless to he scriptwriters who could show cleverness concerning the artificial birth of the dinosaurs. Then, the movie goes on with the visit and the discovery (inconclusive as dinosaurs don't appear) of the park and this is where problems appear (otherwise the movie wouldn't have existed): a storm is breaking, a bad engineer is switching the current off to steal dinosaurs embryos for his personal interests. More serious, dinosaurs are getting away and spreading panic among the visitors....<br/><br/>You can also notice that the screenplay contains several silly cues and characters appear colorless. They are overburden by dinosaurs that are real stars of the movie. it also  doesn't succeed in hiding a few unlikelinesses: Tim, one of the two children is victim of a strong electric shock and however Sam Neil manages to save him! Moreover, Tim's sister succeeds in locking a dinosaur up in a room thanks to a code which is however, hard to get. So, children are in the depths of these unlikelinesses and it probably reflects Spielberg' tender look of childhood.<br/><br/>At the end, ""Jurassic Park"" is definitely one of Spielberg's worst movies."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","6","3","7","2 March 2012"," A sick park.
","I need to get one thing out of the way first - I hate those awful children. Spielberg often makes huge mistakes when casting children in his movies (Hook, the aggravating Henry Thomas), but the JP kids really get on my nerves. He should have done with little Tim and Lex what he did to Alex Kintner in Jaws in have them devoured in torrents of gore. This would have pleased me a great deal.<br/><br/>Sam Neill (one of my favorite actors) plays Alan Grant, a dinosaur expert who is called to a remote Pacific island with his colleague Ellie Sattler and Chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) by excitable billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to give a fresh perspective on his new theme park and appease his anxious investors (although why a billionaire would need investors is kind of odd). The theme park turns out to be a dinosaur zoo, but nothing works as it should.<br/><br/>Park computer nerd Dennis Nedry (Peter Griffin in a rare live-action role) shuts down the security in order to smuggle dino embryos to the competition, and with the electric fences switched off the big things with pointy teeth step out into the bits of the park where they're not supposed to be.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park has often been nicknamed ""Jaws with Claws"". I don't think that's a good description. Where Jaws was a difficult shoot, was organic, and was a huge hit against expectations, Jurassic Park is deliberately designed to be a blockbuster without any of the raw edge that made its big brother so believable. I just can't get excited by a film that was made to sell merchandise.<br/><br/>My favorite aspect of Jurassic Park, is often the most overlooked. Dean Cundey's photography is great, full of darkness and backlights. I just wish that Spielberg allowed him to give the film a harder look as it sometimes has a fake, plastic feel. The CGI, having been rendered just a little shy of 20 years ago, are mostly photo-realistic but there are a few dinos that look incredibly fake (the brontosaurus on the grass plain looks terrible).<br/><br/>When making Jaws, the animatronic shark rarely worked. With nothing much to show on screen Spielberg compensated by giving us lots of shark POV shots, and Williams gave the unseen predator a constant presence with his iconic score. Now, in an age where filmmakers can give us anything with a computer effect (in a way, Spielberg made this trend mainstream with the success of Jurassic Park), the monsters are brought right out into the open, lessening our fear of them. A monster is only scary when it is in the shadows. Bruce the Shark was also an unstoppable force of nature, his random appearance out of nowhere giving him a mythical edge. The dinos in Jurassic Park were designed, within the movie, to entertain kids, and intended, as a movie, to entertain the kids in the audience.<br/><br/>They're not scary.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is a good film, but it absolutely does not deserve the classic status that pop culture has marked it with."

I've seen it for the first time on TV this morning. Over and over again, I kept asking myself at different scenes, ""How can anybody be that stupid?"" and, ""What screen writer can REALLY believe an intelligent audience above the age of 4 1/2 would think people would do these things under similar circumstances.""<br/><br/>Sure, the special effects were great for the time.

However, even if one accepts the silly premise, the film rarely rises above the level of a 1950s monster movie like Godzilla and it goes on too long. It's not clear why the dinos are angry, perhaps they're thinking, we came back after 65 million years for this cheesy movie? The computer-generated creatures (no actual dinosaurs were harmed during the filming) are the main attraction here and they're fairly well done.

The CGI work, which still holds up decently today, is stunning and groundbreaking stuff for the early 90's. Spielberg directs with a deft hand, and the action never lets up.<br/><br/>If I had any complaint, it would be that the acting (except for Goldblum and Attenborough) is merely average -- in particular, the usual weaknesses involved with child actors applies here. Also, the movie is long on popcorn action and relatively short on brains... the subjects of cloning, ecology and paleontology are lightly and briefly touched upon but that's it (if you want more in this area I'd suggest reading Crichton's book, which is quite good).<br/><br/>Overall this movie is worthwhile, and easily one of Spielberg's stronger films.

"jmillerdp","5","4","11","5 June 2015"," Crichton = Thriller, Spielberg = Adventure
","This is one of those issues where reading the book before seeing the movie is going to give you a different perspective on things. I read Michael Crichton's novel first, and enjoyed it much more than Spielberg's movie.<br/><br/>Crichton wrote a very R-rated thriller that was dark and terrifying. You felt like you were trapped on that island with those people. And, instead of off-screen or ""Godzilla""-like violence, Crichton had people getting eviscerated, etc. In the movie, Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp (who I think is AWFUL!), have Tyrannosaurs miraculously saving people and so on. <br/><br/>In the novel, people are trapped in the dark, having to use their wits to survive. The bottom line is that the novel is a hard-core thriller, and the movie is an adventure film.<br/><br/>So, if the adventure thing works best for you, then you're in luck with Spielberg. But, if you wanted the dark horror, you go with Crichton. I go with Crichton.<br/><br/>What I remember most when seeing this is that it was the first movie where digital sound was synced with the film print. And, when the Tyrannosaur shows up in the rain to attack, I know you're supposed to be terrified, but I was applauding wildly, absolutely floored by the Visual Effects!<br/><br/>Otherwise, this is a pretty typical Spielberg production: Flat cinematography, lots of push ins to actors' faces, precocious children that are subsequently set upon by dinosaurs, ghosts, etc., overripe acting by hammy actors, etc. I know you're supposed to want the children to be saved. I just wanted them to be eaten!<br/><br/>I would be much better if someone remade this as Crichton wrote it. Supposedly, Crichton had thought about directing it, but was very uncertain about handling the Visual Effects. But, since this movie is basically ""Westworld"" with dinosaurs, I think he could have pulled it off.<br/><br/>***** (5 Out of 10 Stars)"

The word ""classic"" gets thrown around too easily when describing movies. But here it's deserved. Jurassic Park truly is a modern classic. It's family/action/popcorn filmmaking at its finest. It's hard to believe that Jurassic Park is almost 25 years old. I remember seeing it in the theaters and being completely blown away by the special effects. They were simply stunning. More amazingly, however, is how well the effects hold-up. I hadn't seen it in several years, but I watched it the other night with my 5 year-old. This was a first time viewing for him and I'm happy to say he's now a fan. When the first dinosaurs came on screen, I could see he was filled with the same excitement and amazement that I was in 1993. The CGI here is as good as any movie I've ever seen. While CGI may have become more common, I think filmmakers have gotten lazy. In too many modern movies, the CGI is obviously CGI. Here, everything looks ""real"". They took the time and spent the money to get it right. And the mix of computer effects with puppetry is pretty much seamless. I may not care for everything he's made, but I'll give Steven Spielberg credit here. He took an unbelievable premise and turned it into a very believable world. Jurassic Park is pure movie magic."

","As a kid I so well remember my younger brother and those dinosaur toys he had as a kid. We've seen dinosaurs in film before going back to the silent version of The Lost World. But they were never better shown than when Steven Spielberg made Jurassic Park out of Michael Crichton's novel. These put other screen dinosaurs to shame.<br/><br/>Through some cloning billionaire Richard Attenborough has succeeded in recreating those long dead creatures of the past and now has a theme park, Jurassic Park. All the herbivores and the carnivores of the past are now alive. But when you come right down to it, Attenborough has just become another Dr. Frankenstein. Some things dead should stay dead.<br/><br/>At least that's what scientists Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum try to tell him. And I have to admit Attenborough does have state of the art security. But he has a greedy employee in Wayne Knight who has made a secret deal with some rival tycoon. His greed brings the whole operation to disaster as dinosaurs start running amuck.<br/><br/>The tyrannosaurus rexes and the raptors are what captured the imagination of the public when Jurassic Park was reached. Up to that time dinosaurs when they were on screen were slow moving behemoths. Spielberg's dinosaurs have some speed to them, far more like what they were in the Jurassic Age.<br/><br/>I have to say I loved Wayne Knight's performance in Jurassic Park. He's such a loathsome creep, but also a real putz. The end he meets is truly just.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park and its successors and imitators have brought about a renewed interest in paleontology. That's always healthy in any society, an interest in the sciences.<br/><br/>My brother Daniel loved this film when it came out. As will you."
"arifwaits","9","2","4","19 July 2016"," Timeless classic... a film that doesnot age... loved it
","To express the feelings about this movie in just 1000 words is impossible. Directed by the mighty Spielberg with the ""living"" dinosaurs created by the Stan Winston team, this is truly a milestone in film making. I cant remember a single scene in which i felt the movie like dragging or slow paced. Every shot felt like so flowing that simply flowed into one thrilling adventure or another. The music by John Williams is another highlight that blends so perfectly with each and every shot. Instead of portraying super humans trying to stop the dinosaurs on loose, it portrayed the dire result if humans try their hands in the creation of life. I don't remember a film I felt so original like Jurassic Park- in story, execution, visual effects-almost every aspect- even after watching today's movies that simply aim at an exhibition of technological advances instead of telling a story as convincing as this. A true masterpiece....!!"
"NOcritic","10","2","4","19 June 2016"," A groundbreaking experience
","Steven Spielberg is a MASTER of filmmaking. This is common knowledge, he has proved it many times and especially with ""Jurassic Park"". It's a legendary blockbuster and was an amazing hit when it came out in 1993. It has been loved by audiences everywhere and it's a movie all 90s kids grew up with. <br/><br/>The plot is that a rich man named John Hammond wants to open up a park with genetically made dinosaurs, but has to have the approval from a certain dinosaur expert named Alan Grant who reluctantly comes along and brings his girlfriend Ellie. He also got Dr. Ian Malcolm who is a mathematician studying chaos to come along to the island. This is where the adventure starts. <br/><br/>I personally feel that he (vaguely) made ""Jurassic Park"" the same way he made ""Jaws"". Everybody is so excited to see the T-Rex and the shark but they find themselves more invested in the characters because they are amazingly written and fleshed out and the dialogue is perfect. As with Jaws, the dinosaurs doesn't have too much screen time which is good. It makes the scenes they are in much more special and let's us use more time on the amazing characters. <br/><br/>The trouble of having an old movie which relies on dinosaurs is that it could easily look dated (like Jurassic Park 3 looks now), but this movie holds up amazingly well. Steven Spielberg shows again that he is a master by only using CGI in the wide shots and using an animatronic in the closeups. This makes the dinosaur look real and even 23 years later it feels real. <br/><br/>The score is probably my favorite score of all time, i like it better than jaws, Indiana Jones and maybe even Star Wars. It's John Williams at his best. Everything in Jurassic Park is as close to perfect as i could want it and it is a movie everybody should see. <br/><br/>Please enjoy it."
"argarachraf","10","2","4","13 June 2016"," Jurassic Park: a wonderful piece of cinema that will leave an impact on popular culture as one of the greatest films of all time.
","Steven Spilberg's blockbusters have never stopped amazing people in the 90s, and it's this humble critic's opinion that the pinnacle of his films is his massive summer blockbuster known as Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>It's been 23 years after it's first theatrical release and it holds up like no other film. How? were do I begin?.<br/><br/>The story is great. Based on Michael Chricton's bestseller with the same name, Spilberg's masterful directing manages to capture both an awe an wonder that just doesn't exist anymore, and some thrilling terror than gives goosebumps to anyone that watches it. All while giving a thought-provoking commentary about man's interference over nature. The characters are memorable and likable. From the paleontologist Alan Grant, to the witty Ian Malcom. From the positive Ellie Satler the whimsical yet developed John Hammond. If this doesn't sell you as to why this movie is absolutely fantastic, we haven't got to the dinosaurs, so let's talk about them.<br/><br/>The dinosaurs in this movie are as close to perfect as you can get in a motion picture. Not only do they successfully deliver the terror, but the wonder as well. And they are brought to life like no film today can. The use of both computer generated imagery that, on it's time, pushed the boundaries of technology and animatronics that are done to the absolute best, these effects hold up just as well as they did back then. The effects are so amazing that they surpass most modern movies made today (including it's sucessor, Jurassic World). On top of that, the spot on sound mixing to generate the creature's sounds makes them feel more life-like than any other film.<br/><br/>On a film level, regarding the camera-work, lighting and pacing, this movie is great. And I cannot go without mentioning John William's musical score. This score is so amazing, that rivals that of Star Wars, William's most well known soundtracks. And considering the music for that film is regarded as one of film history's best, that's saying a lot.<br/><br/>I could go on and on as to why this movie is amazing, but I think you all know this.<br/><br/>If I could give a higher rating than 10, this movie would get it. But to follow IMDb's guidelines, Jurassic Park absolutely gets a 10/10 (one of the greatest films of all time).<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, do it immediately, you won't regret it."
"nicolechan916","9","2","4","24 March 2016"," Immerseful
","The story of Jurassic Park is certainly a unique one, and is based on the book of the same name by Michael Crichton. The creative world of Jurassic Park shows us one possibility of how dinosaurs would live if they existed in modern society. Though the science of it isn't very convincing, they did a great job at creating a scientific sort of atmosphere. <br/><br/>Adding to that, the cast fits well into their roles, and the acting is pretty good. Sam Neill is a little expressionless and mumbles quite a bit, but is otherwise a good fit for his character. Larura Dern gives a great performance, and I especially like her rebuttals in the face of sexism. However, Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello, who play the grandchildren, are pretty much the only ones who react like they should when faced with a dinosaur- that is, with fright and terror. Jeff Golblum seems to be there only for comic relief, and mostly delivers his lines awkwardly. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, the visuals for this film is very realistic and not at all like I would have imagined a 90's film to be. Not like some films with horrible CGI work, the film-makers and animators of Jurassic Park went through extensive renderings and scans to compile realistic visuals and movements of the dinosaurs. Some action is obviously fake, but overall, this film had great visual effects. <br/><br/>Finally, the soundtrack for the film is amazing, with each song fitting into the setting of the scene perfectly. The suspenseful and thrilling scenes have music that aids in giving the audience that sense of anticipation. In some scenes the music is a little cheeky in that the film-makers are deliberately letting you know that something is going to happen, and is aware that you know. <br/><br/>Overall, a fun film with excellent production quality and great directing. A film worthy of being in the 'classics' category."

"John_Truby","Null","2","4","7 January 2010"," Textbook blockbuster craftsmanship
","How do you write a blockbuster? If you're Michael Crichton, you write Jurassic Park, the highest-grossing movie of all time. This deceptively simple film is very instructive for anyone trying to write the big hit in today's Hollywood.<br/><br/>To see Crichton's choices, let's start by exploring the author's predicament, that is, the structural problems the writer would have to solve to write this idea successfully (Crichton co-wrote the script with David Koepp, based on his novel).<br/><br/>The inherent problems of any story can be found most quickly by going to the genre (this is another reason I place so much emphasis on mastering your genre). Jurassic Park is fundamentally a horror story. Like the detective form, horror does some tricky and not too pleasant things to story structure.<br/><br/>First, it tends to give you a monotonous plot; the monster attacks relentlessly and the hero tries to escape. Second, the standard horror story is opponent driven; the hero is reacting to the intense desire line of the more powerful opponent. Third, since the main character is usually just trying to survive, he/she rarely has any character change. Fourth, horror stories tend to remain small, because the feeling of horror is best created by trapping characters in small spaces.<br/><br/>Crichton's solutions to these problems begin with the story's basic design. Success in film, like success in architecture, is based mostly on the initial design, and Crichton comes up with a once-in-a-lifetime premise. If anyone still needed proof, Jurassic Park shows why Hollywood is so crazy for high-concept stories. By jamming together the two titans of evolution - man and dinosaur - in a tropical Disneyland, Crichton magnifies the power of the horror genre a hundred times.<br/><br/>By doing so, he not only reaps the benefits of the action-horror combination, he creates the first of what I refer to in the World Myth class as the Epic Horror story. This is one of the ten myth forms that I believe will dominate movie-making for the next ten to twenty years. The reason is simple: horror has a strong appeal that crosses cultural boundaries, and epic action magnifies the speed, power, scope and stakes of the story.<br/><br/>While adding action to the horror erases the problem of small size, it does not solve some of the other problems inherent to the form. These solutions can be found by looking at the structural nucleus of any story, the seven steps.<br/><br/>Problem/Need: The hero of the story is paleontologist Alan Grant. Normally we would begin the story with his problem, but this is an action-horror story. So the writers must begin by setting the dangerous context and suggesting the monster who will soon drive the story. The problem then is given to John Hammond, the visionary who has created Jurassic Park. Because one of the workers has been eaten while setting up the park, the financial backers require endorsements from noted scientists before they will allow the park to open. The problem for Grant results from the fact that he and his fellow scientist and girlfriend, Dr. Sattler, must leave their research to check out the park if they want to gain funding for their work.<br/><br/>Grant's need is established right away when he terrifies a boy with details of the killing techniques of the velociraptor. Sattler wants kids, but Grant says they are noisy and smelly. Grant is an arrogant and cold man, very much in his head. His need is to learn to empathize and care, and specifically to become a true father.<br/><br/>This need seems a bit contrived and arbitrary, but it does give the audience some character change in a story form that usually lacks it. It also has some thematic justification, in that this story is about evolution and extinction on the largest scale. So teaching the hero how to create a family, and learn human love, is quite appropriate.<br/><br/>Desire: The early part of the story is driven by Hammond who wants to convince Grant, Sattler, and chaos theorist Ian Malcolm to endorse his park. But all this is just detailing of the context in which the horror battle will occur. This delays the real desire line of the hero quite a bit. But that is a good idea in this film, first because this highly fantastical story needs extensive detailing up front to be believable. And second because once an action-horror story gets moving, it's a high-speed, straight-line run with very little plot.<br/><br/>The true desire line of the story kicks in when the park's system fails and the dinosaurs attack. The hero's desire is clear and intense: save as many as possible from the dinosaurs and get out.<br/><br/>Opponent: Just as the true desire line is delayed, so is the true opposition. Initially the opponent is Hammond. Though a friendly enough man, he is actually an opponent because he has created a world without the proper respect for the power of life. And he has brought Grant and the others into that world without adequate protection.<br/><br/>The terrible power of life finds its greatest manifestation in the dinosaurs. This, of course, is Crichton's brilliant stroke. Through fantasy he has put man in a closed arena with the deadliest killers in history. By adding the action form to horror, he has multiplied the number of killers so that they are attacking with almost nonstop ferocity.<br/><br/>To finish reading this review, and to find others, please visit http://www.truby.com/im_jp.html"

","I have such fond memories of this Spielberg classic. I saw it with my Dad and my younger sister in 93 when it first released, at the time I had seen nothing like it. It was a very expensive movie to make, a lot of money was spent not only on the superb special effects but also the merchandising(the books,the toys etc). It was money well spent, Jurrasic Park went on to make millions and millions(it is in the top 10 grossers ever). The special effects were way ahead of it's time, the Dinosaurs looked so real and terrifying. I watched Jurrasic Park a couple of weeks ago and realised it holds up remarkably well,special effects have advanced since 93 yet the special effects for Jurrasic Park still look great. Adapted from a Micheal Chriction novel(which is also superb) it tells the story of people who visit a Dinosaur theme park and how their lives are put in danger during a blackout when the Dinosaurs escape. Spielberg put in some great moments of tension, for instance in the scene where they are sitting in the jeeps and the glass in the front of the jeep starts to vibrate is absolute genius. I love the part in the end where they are going back in the helicopter and there is that shot of the bird which reminds us how the Dinosaurs have evolved."

","I recently watched this film again after not seeing it for a few years, and I still can't believe how captivated I am. Every aspect of this film keeps you interested in what's going to happen next, from the intro-scene where the two title characters are digging up fossils, to the ending-scene where they are flying away over the ocean, I love this movie with absolute certainty.<br/><br/>I remember growing up as a boy, idolizing T-Rex's and Brachiosauri. Watching how the film, (and book which is even better than the movie), explains how the creatures are created, from finding the DNA, to the actual full-sized,(CG), version, it is a visual production of my own dreams. Although, some critics have commented on the amount of gore, and violence associated with a family film. Yet, this is an acceptable level in my eyes and should be acceptable to most other who view this film.<br/><br/>Big props to Spielberg, and Crichton for creating this lovely story. I just hope there is some young boy, or young girl out there who still have not seen this movie, and after the first time they view it they dream about it. That's what this film and story are about, letting us know that imagination is still important."

There were things in the movie that could have been improved though, like the T-Rex for example.

Instead of making robots for the film, they used cutting-edge computer technology to create dinosaurs that don't look like puppets. Congratulations to the technology. Also, the cast performed excellent. Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and others (even Samuel L. Jackson!) performed almost perfectly. Even the minor characters (Bob Peck, B.D. Wong, Wayne Knight) did a great job. It seems that Universal and Spielberg have made.....the perfect film!!!!! Steven Spielberg is just a genius............i mean my god!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not many people could come up and direct something as hard as this.

"ferryboy","8","2","4","6 November 2007"," I Nearly forgot how good this movie was
","I remember my dad and I watching the first two movies when I was about seven through ten years old. Between Jurassic Park, Star Wars, and Indiana Jones, I think I spent nearly a third of my life popping videos into the VCR and having a jolly good time while rain poured constantly in northern Washington.<br/><br/>but anyway, on to the movie:<br/><br/>It just came on AMC, and I decided to give it a shot again. Curious about one of the actors, I decided to boot up IMDb and check out the flick. I was a little perturbed by the negative feedback left by some, but I'm sure they just have problems with enjoying themselves. This is one of those movies that are impossible not to enjoy. It's funny, thrilling, eye-catching, interesting and altogether fun as hell. All of this from just one scene. <br/><br/>When you think of Jurrasic Park, one of the first things to come up is, of course, the Special Effects. Regardless of what many naysayers of CGI (I'll count myself as one of those), Jurassic Park was way ahead of its time. Between the massive T Rex and the fast and devious velociraptors, it becomes very apparent very soon that the makers of this movie were looking to shake things up a bit. And the best thing? No matter how grandiose the animations and effects, all of it seems tasteful. Nothing seems overdone or out of place. None of the effects in this movie seemed out of place or ""too much."" I've looked at some movies that I loved as a child, and seen the raping of technology just for the sake of it. Jurassic Park is not one of those movies, and, naysayer that I am, I still enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>What can I say about the story? Since we first uncovered a fossil, the human race has been amazed by dinosaurs. I'm just surprised that it took so long for someone to write a book about something like this. I love the original book from Michael Crighton, a masterpiece in science fiction, and I can say that the original premise for this movie and the book itself is probably one of the better I've ever seen. What young child doesn't want to see a real dinosaur? And, in all honesty, what adult really ever grows out of that dream? Even if the sh1t hadn't hit the fan, the movie would still be intriguing.<br/><br/>""BOOM. BOOM. You know what that is? An impact trauma, that's what that is"" I don't think a glass of water has ever had me more excited. The actors pulled out all of the cards to make this work even more so for me. As an actor, I've seen when someone isn't working their hardest. When someone doesn't really care about what they're doing. This is why I respect the actors in this movie so much. There is never a point where I feel like something could have been done better, or even slightly different. What is really wonderful is that Spielberg again shines in directing the kids, who are always immersed in the action, right along with the experienced veterans. Instead of being a sort of extra bit added on to evoke some extra emotion, the kids shine with the light of stars, creating the illusion, rather than just portraying it.<br/><br/>Of course, the science is often a bit off, but I don't know if I'd like the movie so much if it were pumped full of as much jargon as the book. Like any self-respecting American raised in the 1990's, sometimes I just want to see a good action-adventure, and Steven Spielberg really gives us what we want in Jurrasic Park"

","When I first saw Jurassic Park I was astonished at the powerful effect of CGI dinosaurs with a rather well built script, fairly good acting and some form of idea behind it.<br/><br/>More than ten years on, I still feel the same. Of course the story is no longer a surprise, but I see that the film has not aged and got even a bit better with time.<br/><br/>For anyone who does not know what the story is about, it is about a dinosaur zoo turning wrong - and two sequels which should not have been made.<br/><br/>Overall, you will probably enjoy the CGI Trex chase because to be honest Jurassic Park is less accurate than Walking with Dinosaurs but more fun.<br/><br/>Watch this on a big screen."
"Antagonisten","8","2","4","13 August 2007"," Stands the test of time
","I remember seeing ""Jurassic Park"" for the first time in the theater when it came out. It was probably one of the defining moments for me when it came to movies. It was magic, pure and simple. Of course, i wasn't very old and far from as blasé as i am today. But still, i can't shake that memory.<br/><br/>Watching the movie now though, with a bit more sober eyes, proves that it is a very competent movie. It might not be the magic show it was when i saw it for the first time, but how could it be? We have seen everything from Transformers to aliens and every critter imaginable come to life on the screen since then. What was groundbreaking and hot in 1993, is such standard-fare in 2007 that you're more surprised if a movie doesn't have huge impossible creatures running around. Or well, that might not be true, but it's commonplace to be sure.<br/><br/>What surprised me the most was the fact that the movie has aged rather gracefully. It's almost 15 years old now and it feels like the special effects industry has taken leaps since then. But the effects in ""Jurassic Park"" still look great for the most part. Sure, they are less ""there"" than the effects today and some effects look rather dated. But for the most part the illusion is intact. And that's important, because this movie is of course about illusions. And when the illusion is believable and you let yourself get immersed into it, you get one of the best adventure movies...ever.<br/><br/>Complaining about the lack of pulse-raisers and heartbeat in many adventure- and action-movies feels almost moot at this point. I've done it in what feels like half my reviews. But the argument is still valid, a movie like this one needs something to raise the pulse and make you sit on the edge of your seat for the rest of the movie. This one has something like that. It starts out rather calm, but with a clear sense of impending doom. And then, when it happens, it doesn't let you go until the very last frames. What is perhaps most impressive is that it does this without excessive use of neither violence nor blood. Of course there is blood and violence, there has to be. But it's used sparingly, and therefore to greater effect when it does happen. And Spielberg might not be my favorite director, but you can't say that he's not a highly competent man. He plays this movie like a grand piano, finding the right pace, the right tone and the right moods at the right moment. The result is a movie with hardly a single dull moment.<br/><br/>In the end this movie has stood the test of time better than i expected. And still, fourteen years later, i found it to be exciting, well written and highly entertaining. I rate it 8/10."

","Jurassic Park(1993) <br/><br/>Review: This is a landmark. I remember seeing this for the first time and this movie still does not get old.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is a great movie. What would you expect from a summer thriller? Sam Neill is in fine form as Dr. Alan Grant who is curious of the new park. The other fine performance is Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm, the expert in chaos theory who is funny and intelligent.<br/><br/>This movie has some very memorable one-liners and action to satisfy anyone. The look of the dinosaurs was quite scary and well done. This movie also shows the sheer rage, instinct, and beauty of the prehistoric savages.<br/><br/>This movie would have gotten a better rating if only not for one scene that was so bad and made no sense at all. The feeling this will give the viewer is the ""Why would they do that?"" feeling. Still drives me nuts.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Excellent. The first installment delivers.

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>You can always count on Steven Spielberg to make a great movie based on other material. Sometimes it can be exiting and suspenseful, or other times the movie can be sad and depressing. Well, this movie is exciting and suspenseful. This movie has groundbreaking special effects that are almost as amazing as the effects in Star Wars. I mean, the dinosaurs in this movie are incredible. I also like that the T-Rex is portrayed as a good guy in the last couple of minutes in the film, despite the fact that it eats a guy in the first forty-five minutes in the film.<br/><br/>Here is the plot. It is pretty simple. John Hammond, Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler, Ian Malcolm, and Donald Gennaro have to go to a park that is inhabited by dinosaurs to see if the park is safe for the public. The dinosaurs are real and breathing. There are cloned from dinosaur DNA in mosquitoes. Hammond's grandchildren are also there. Then the park closes because of a storm. Gennaro is eaten by a T-Rex. The dinosaurs continue to try to kill everybody. The Velocoraptors almost are going to kill everybody, but luckily the T-Rex saves them by killing the Raptors. Everybody escapes the park. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a great film. There are also some really intense sequences in the film. For example, there is a scene in which the children are hiding from two Raptors in a kitchen. They just escape. There is also a scene in which a T-Rex chases them while they are driving in a car. There are so many really scary and intense sequences that you would have to see to believe. Anyway, this is a fantastic suspense film that you have to see if you want to witness the amazing effects.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Recommended Films: King Kong."
"DKosty123","8","2","4","18 February 2007"," Welcome To Jurrassic Park
","After viewing this film several times, it is very clear to me that Michael Cricton's book is a base for this, but the film for entertainment value goes far beyond the book. It literally borrows from the original King Kong to try & make itself into an epic. While it falls a little short of that goal, it is an admirable effort.<br/><br/>Spielberg even makes fun of borrowing from King Kong with the gate at the beginning of the Jurassic Park tour. In fact, tung in cheek humor is rampant throughout the adventure film. The casting of Wayne Knight as the evil guy who brings the park tumbling down perfectly illustrates this. Knight is great in this role, a fine supporting actor of this era.<br/><br/>The opening sequence of the film gives you an idea that this is going to be a low budget film, even the impression of a slice & dice melodrama. Then, it goes in the other direction entirely. The scenery is lavish, & the scale of reality is amazing. They do have to dumb down Michael Creigton's explanation (novel idea) of genetics in order to appeal the film to a mainstream audience.<br/><br/>This film marks some of the earliest modern computer technical special effects being used to great effect. When you watch the film repeatedly, you realize how well the viewer is manipulated into a fantasy as large as King Kong.<br/><br/>The cast is still largely a group of unknowns with the exception of Sir Richard Attenborough who is used to great effect in his role as the creator of this park destined to fail. Jeff Goldblum & the others went on to other films but only Jeff has really established much outside of the sequels.<br/><br/>This film is the blockbuster of the 1990's for Spielberg. Sam Neil & Laura Dern still have little fame beyond this film. Wayne Knight is more famous for the sit-com Seinfeld than this movie though this film & JFK prove his talent in support of films.<br/><br/>Influence is what makes this film unique. This film stimulated an entire younger generation to have more interest in dinosaurs than there had been for many years. It created the imagination for rides at Universal Studio & at Walt Disney's Animal Kingdom. Next to ET, this is Spielbergs largest kids film."
"Cocacolaguy912-2","8","2","4","18 January 2007"," A landmark in special effects and a great blockbuster as well.
","In the early 90s, the level of realism seen in CGI was climbing the ladder. Most notably, we had ""Terminator 2"" and ""Jurassic Park"", two movies that still have wonderful CGI even for today. The thing about Jurassic Park is that it perfectly combines these stunning visuals into a believable and entertaining story line (not that T2 doesn't, which, in my opinion is actually better). It seems like Steven Spielberg has a real talent in entertaining us but at the same time not letting us laugh at the script, acting, or cheese (No doubt Indiana Jones was pretty high on the cheese level, but still). I will say again what ever other reviewer has said long before me - Jurassic Park is the definition of a blockbuster. It remains a classic today, and it will be remembered in the future as that ""awesome movie with realistic dinosaurs."" At least...that is what I think about it. Also, Jeff Goldblum is funny.<br/><br/>8/10."

","Very few films have the capability to be carried by their visual effects and editing alone. Jurassic Park is, however, one such film and despite now being nearly fourteen years old the CGI still look superior to those in not only subsequent films in the series (especially the third one) but also CGI in later films. Jurassic Park is truly a film that can be watched simply for it's eye-candy.<br/><br/>That said though Sam Niell and Jeff Goldblum are pretty amusing as the I-told-you-so scientists. Whilst the cast as a whole is happy to accept that they simply ain't the film's stars.<br/><br/>Overall I REAL thrill ride that succeeds at leaving on the edge of your seat, yeah the plot may be ridiculous but who cares?

"Phillemos","8","2","4","3 September 2006"," More Velociraptors!!! More Tyrannosaurus rex!!!!!
","This is probably the best all-around dinosaur movie ever made. Yet I somehow feel the need to write about its flaws more than what was great about it. FLAWS: 1) You'd think a movie that invests so much into dinosaurs would get some basic facts straight. It's ""StegOsaurus,"" not ""StegAsaurus"" as it says on one of the DNA vials. And the Velociraptors are way bigger than they would have been in real life, the creatures in question are probably the much bigger Deinonychus, not Velociprator. Conversely, the Dilophosaurus is much smaller than it would have been in real life. If they had shown it real size, they wouldn't have had to concoct the ""spit-kill"" scene. 2) The movie drags at times. Just stick with the dinosaurs-run-amok theme. We don't care about all the peripheral dinosaurs they show from time to time that have nothing to do with the movie. Great, there's a sick Triceratops lying in its own dung. You won't see him again, so why bother showing him in the first place? 3) When Dr. Neill, Jeff Goldblum and the kids are in their Jurassic Park-mobiles, they can sense the T-Rex coming from the vibrations and sounds of his footprints for about five minutes. Yet, when they're being attacked by the ""Velociraptors,"" the T-Rex all of a sudden appears out of nowhere to save their a**. You couldn't hear T-Rex coming then? I would have liked to see a pack of five or six Velociraptors battle the T-Rex, just to make it more interesting. That said, this really is an entertaining movie. Among the characteristics that make this movie so good are: 1) The dinosaurs are first-rate, the best and most realistic ever. 2) Laura Dern's backside. We get to see her scale up and down walls to run away from dinosaurs all throughout the movie, and it's a wonderful sight. 3) All the lawyers get it in the end. Overall, they finally made a dinosaur movie that actually could receive critical acclaim. I give it an 8 out of 10."

","It's been a long time since Steven Spielberg made his last great move as a director. In fact, his last great achievement could have been ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" (1989), but it was generally a facsimile of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981). His latest landmark was probably ""E.T."" (1982). So maybe that it was time to unleash a hurricane...<br/><br/>In 1993, with the computer revolution at full speed, Spielberg effectively used the latest technologies in order to create a movie about the latest technologies. Using computer-generated-effects from George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic Company, Spielberg and his special effects team created ""Jurassic Park"", perhaps the greatest dinosaur movie of all time and, at the moment, the most technologically advanced movie ever released.<br/><br/>""Jurassic Park"" stars Sam Neill as paleontologist Alan Grant and Laura Dern as his girlfriend, paleobotanist Ellie Satler. They're both invited, along with professor Ian Malcom, a cynical scientist played by Jeff Goldblum, to visit an attraction park created by a biotechnological company headed by eccentric John Hammond (played by Richard Attenborough).<br/><br/>But Jurassic Park isn't your local carnival. It's a faunistic reserve housing real dinosaurs and plants from the prehistoric era. Dinosaurs, as we learn in the movie, have been made with DNA coming from the blood of fossilized mosquitoes, which had bitten dinosaurs 100 millions years ago.<br/><br/>Accompanied by Hammond's grandchildren Tim and Lex (played by Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards), Grant, Satler, Malcolm and a bureaucratic lawyer (Martin Ferrero) are sent on an interactive tour inside the jungle in order to observe the dinosaurs.<br/><br/>However, the initial wonder turns into a nightmarish ride when the security systems are sabotaged by unscrupulous computer specialist Dennis (Wayne Knight), who attempts to steal dinosaurs' embryos and to sell them to a concurrent firm. With the security off, dinosaurs (including deadly Tyrannosaurus Rex and Velociraptors) can easily seep into the park and become threats for everybody.<br/><br/>So, from now on, what was just a gentle jungle ride turns into a life-or-die cat-and-mouse game with the dinosaurs and a single false move can easily become a deadly mistake. It's at this moment that Spielberg's movie turns into a harrowing adventure thriller as only him can make.<br/><br/>But the movie's calmest moments principally involve fairly good character development and greatly interesting philosophical debates that take place inside the film, and not in a movie-fan committee reunion. We're introduced to the concept of nature's rights, as well as the limits of technological progress, which is ironic, due to the fact that the movie itself involves so much technological progress.<br/><br/>Actors are generally good, but some are above the others. Beginning with Sam Neill, who is awesome as professor Grant and he embodies his paleontologist role like if he was one of them. Director Richard Attenborough is also noticeable as John Hammond and he shows that he's good for acting, too. But my best regards go to Jeff Goldblum and his Ian Malcolm role. Malcolm is that type of character who never delivers a phrase that is not quotable. His cynical and philosophical speeches are very interesting and surprisingly entertaining. I particularly love the phrase that is also the title of my review.<br/><br/>But the best aspects of the movie are the dinosaurs themselves. The CGI-created beasts appear so real that we can almost forget the computer illusion. It's a step forward inside the film industry and it shows the powers of the computer era. It helps to show that Industrial Light & Magic are the best among all of the industry's special effects teams.<br/><br/>With a movie like ""Jurassic Park"", it's not surprising that people developed a sudden interest for dinosaurs, paleontology, computers and scientific progress. In a movie so well done, with sublime special effects, thrilling scenes and entertaining characters, it was also not surprising that it became the highest-grossing movie of them all at the time."

To preview the park before it goes operational, he brings a paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a lawyer, a mathematician, an his two grandchildren to see it. Unfortunately, everything goes wrong, and the dinosaurs end up escaping and causing all kinds of mayhem on the island. Jurassic Park is an exciting film with great special effects even by today's standards.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is one of my favourite directors because he is able to bring a realistic style to everything he does. Almost every movie he makes handles itself perfectly. His camera angles and his style are a huge part of what makes his movies so good. Michael Crighton's book is also huge. It was an instant best seller. The book is basically all of the scientific aspect, and it seems so believable, I'm surprised cloning dinosaurs hasn't happened yet. Spielberg made a smart decision by cutting out a lot of the scientific jargon and replacing it with action. Michael Crighton's book is great, but as a movie, an audience couldn't stand it. Spielberg handles it just perfect. Of course, Joh Williams' score helps the movie as well. His movie themes are always good.<br/><br/>The actors in this movie are all really good. Sam Neill and Laura Dern are great as Alan Grant and Ellie Satler, the two leads. Jeff Goldblum has never been a favourite actor of mine, but I do like him in this. His style of acting provides just the right amount of comic relief.<br/><br/>While some people may find the film is a little slow, I think it's a great movie to watch on a rainy day.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Jurassic Park is very well done. The film has a good cast and great special effects. But of course, you all know Spielberg has the potential of making great movies. However, I was disappointed in the story. The original story (from the book) was to prove the fact how humans can easily destroy themselves when it comes to tampering with nature, but Steven never really brings out that message as it was suppose to be. It was more focused on the action and adventure of the dinosaurs. But for those who never even heard of the book wouldn't have any disappointment. I thought Richard Attenborough did a good job portraying the role of John Hammond and I think Jeff Goldblum is great in it as well. Sam Neill and Laura Dern did average jobs on the film I think (Laura Dern up by one point).

"MinorityReporter","8","2","4","18 November 2005"," One of the best films of 1993
","1993 was an amazing year for director Steven Spielberg. He proved that he could make realistic and serious war time dramas with his masterpiece, Schindler's List, and he proved that he is still one of the best directors at making pure cinematic entertainment with Jurassic Park. Jurassic Park isn't all fun and giggles, however, the film does make a statement. I'll get back to what the statement is later in my review. Basically 1993 was the year when Spielberg proved once and for all that he is the greatest director ever to have lived (a title he was recently awarded ahead of Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott).<br/><br/>Spielberg is a master of special effects but more than that he is also very much an actors director. He really does bring out the best in his actors. Sam Neill, whom I already knew was a class actor has one of his very best performances in this film. His acting is very realistic and he brings a high level of credibility to his character and equally important he seems believable as a scientist. He certainly seems intelligent enough. He is quite a subtle actor meaning that he is not afraid to stand out but he is also not afraid to blend in and let others steal the show which of course helps to make the acting seem more polished overall. Laura Dern is, like Neill, a very realistic, no nonsense, actress and her scenes with Sam Neill are marked by great chemistry between the two actors. Jeff Goldblum has a very flamboyant energy about him in this film (as opposed to the sequel where he tries to act in a more realistic manner) and for me his character worked great. Both as comic relief but also dramatically. Richard Attenborough is great! No questions asked. He plays his character very enthusiastically and makes the character both likable, charismatic and well meaning. Other actors worth mentioning are Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight and the child actors: Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards who do very well for child actors.<br/><br/>Effect wise the film is stunning. Simply stunning. Even today 13 years later the effects are still believable which is very rare as most films tend to become very dated when such an amount of time has passed. Jurassic Park was the first film to use computer effects extensively and coupled with some very believable puppetry it takes at least 2 viewings to spot any obvious mistakes. Especially the tyrannosaurus, which has become the signature mark for the films is incredibly well done. There is a scene where one of the children flicker a light in the eye of the dinosaur and you see the pupil contract. When I saw this the first time I thought: ""Wow, what an incredible detail."" and it is exactly the details that marks the difference between Jurassic Park and other films in the genre like, Godzilla (1998). Also the raptors are very well done and more importantly they work great as tension makers. The first time I saw the film they scared me. All in all the effects are stellar. Two thumbs way up.<br/><br/>The film is not purely entertainment (although that is the film's primary goal). Spielberg makes a statement with the film about genetic research and how it is wrong for humans to play God and this element works great as well because it is not done wrong. It does not make the film seem preachy. Its not blasted up in our faces every five minutes but it is mentioned once and remains an underlying message all the way through the film. I must once again commend Spielberg for the way he handled this. He balanced entertainment and a message extremely well. Kudos to Mr. Spielberg. Also Spielberg has a wonderful way of not making the film all about the effects (even though that is what attracts people). I actually cared about the characters and their fates but this is something that could be said about all Spielberg's films. His way of making the audience care about the characters.<br/><br/>All in all Jurassic Park is not Spielberg's best film but it is highly entertaining and can be watched several times if only for the effects. There are a few ridiculous moments, like one of the children getting electrocuted by a fence that could kill a tyrannosaurus and survives without any permanent injury. Aside from a few minor errors the film is very, very good and I highly recommend it to fans of Spielberg and film lovers in general.<br/><br/>8/10"

","If you ask me, a lover of all things dinosaurs, this was a great film. It is still one of my all-time-favorites these twelve years later. Steven Spielberg does a fantastic job, bringing to the screen the amazing tale Michael Crichton first spun in his book by the same name. There are a few discrepancies between the two- but nothing to get too upset about. The special effects are literally awesome and truly bring these ancient creatures to life. The actors do a great job; Sam Neil, Laura Dern, and (the great) Jeff Goldblum, especially shine. Each character seems to have a different view of the park, and the experiment as a whole, which makes it easy for the viewer to identify with them. This film focuses on ethics, the responsibilities of scientists, and the consequences of their actions. It was also nice to see that they included less obvious dinosaurs in the ""cast"", along side classics. This is not a film one should expect to be something it's not-- but that's true of every flick out there. The cast and crew put a lot of genius into their work, which is evident without it becoming something the average viewer can't enjoy. You get out of this movie what you want to, and I think anyone who misses it is missing out."

","Steven Spielberg blazes the trail of investing movies with legions of CGI beasties in this breakthrough special effects movie. Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern visit the island theme-park of Richard Attenborough, who has been breeding dinosaurs <br/><br/>The astounding commercial success of Spielberg's theme-park movie proved once again the power of marketing and awesome special effects to overcome a thin story line and feeble characterisation. Another surprising aspect of the response was that the film seemed not to depend on a decent-sized cinema screen but proved effective when reduced to little brother telly. A definite tribute to the director's manipulative skill in dotting the overlong proceedings with enough shocks, scary moments and sentimentality to take up the slack. <br/><br/>Amid the special effects showcasing and chases, Jurassic Park exhibits the perennial concerns of Michael Crichton - who wrote the source novel. Said concern is man abusing scientific knowledge and playing God. The culprit here is Attenborough's John Hammond, an entrepreneur who has used dinosaur DNA taken from blood-sucking mosquitoes that have been preserved in amber to re-create the prehistoric dinosaurs, with the intention of opening the ultimate theme-park cum nature reserve. To prove that all is well with his proposed park, Hammond is forced to call in three 'experts': paleontologist Dr Alan Grant (Neill), his girlfriend paleo-botanist Dr Ellie Sattler (Dern), and chaos theoretician Dr Ian Malcolm (Goldblum). Oh, and sadly some kids are along for the ride too - they are the target audience after all, both for Hammond and for Spielberg. <br/><br/>After the initial splendour of viewing a brontosaurus chomping on a tree-top and the thrill of cuddling a sickly tricerotops, things inevitably go sour and the predators make their presence felt. T-Rex reestablishes his reign, this time as king of movie monsters (a kind of bipedal Jaws), while the smaller velociraptors prove their viciousness by hunting and chowing down on various cast members. Much of the film consists of being chased by dinosaurs and trying to survive. It's a simple formula, but crudely effective.<br/><br/>
Attenborough is preposterously bad as Hammond, with an accent as wobbly as his scientific and moral judgement; the performance is only redeemed by his twinkly eyes. The rest of the cast are adequate, but hobbled by under-developed characters. Possibly the rather characterless leads work to the movie's advantage, since no one going to see a dazzling special effects movie needs distracting by a tame scientist's view of very untamed monsters. Not surprisingly, the sound and the computer-generated visuals received Oscars."

","I remember seeing this movie when i was only seven years old. That same night after watching the movie I was so scared and had a nightmare of a velocirapter standing on the side of my bed. I vowed never to watch this movie again for as long as i lived.<br/><br/>But know, when i am 15 years old, i find jurassic park one of the best (not to say the best) movie i have ever seen in my entire live. The whole concept of the movie and the content make this movie one of the best. In some movies the characters are kind of flat, they have no background and no ""filling"", but here the characters are developed very well, and you can really see what makes them do what they do. <br/><br/>One other thing that makes this movie so great is the music, john williams has made beautiful music for this movie that ,once you hear it, keeps playing in your head. Personally, i think the shot when the helicopter reaches isla nublar is the best shot in the whole movie, you see a beautiful green island in front of you and hear the beautiful soundtrack on the background. That will last a lifetime for me.<br/><br/>If would have to grade this movie, i would give it an 11/10"
"Gogo83","10","2","4","26 May 2004"," An all-time blockbusting classic!
","Movie magician Steven Spielberg's prehistoric blockbuster Jurassic Park is without doubt one of the directors greatest achievements to date. Combining groundbreaking special effects that will make your eyes water with both joy and fear, with a gripping story and note-perfect script, the king of the Hollywood blockbuster has created a film that will live long in the memory of all who see it for years to come.<br/><br/>Multi-millionaire John Hammond (played wonderfully by Richard Attenborough) has made a discovery that could change the world forever. His scientists have developed a technology that allows dinosaur D.N.A. to be extracted from fossils and then developed into living, breathing specimens of the extinct creatures. Hammond's idea is to breed these monsters and establish a prehistoric zoo, or Jurassic Park as he christens it, on a remote island off Costa Rica and create the greatest tourist attraction the world has ever seen. Sounds like great idea doesn't it? Well it is until during a pre-opening visit by a party of archaeologists and Hammond's own grand children, events take a disastrous turn and the dinosaurs escape and begin to feast on the helpless humans.<br/><br/>The real standout element of the film is without doubt the incredible dinosaurs themselves. Combining animatronics with computer animation the special effects team have created a visual feast for the eyes like nothing seen before. The creatures look so real you could almost be persuaded that they were just that, and several scenes really will leave you picking your jaw up off the floor. The first time you see the giant Brachiosaurus stretch up on its hind legs to feed from a tree you will be simply be amazed by the magic you see before you, and without giving anything away, every scene with the huge bloodthirsty T-Rex is guarantied to either leave you on the edge of your seat or send you cowering behind it.<br/><br/>The story zips along at a rip-roaring pace with plenty of twists and turns to keep the audience engaged between dino-scenes, and the characters, in particular Sam Neill's skeptical archaeologist and Jeff Goldblum's bonkers chaos theorist, prove highly engaging personalities throughout.<br/><br/>So are there any faults with Spielberg's film? Well, for this reviewer at least, I found the on screen action so overwhelmingly enjoyable that I find it hard to pick holes, and picking holes is really all it would be, in a film that provides 2 hours of such pure visual and aural excitement. Steven Spielberg and his crew have created a perfect spectacle the like of which has only come along a scant few times in cinema history and will no-doubt do so only a limited number of times again. Jurassic Park truly is a blockbuster classic and should rightly take its place among film histories finest."
"Woody53","10","2","4","13 April 2004"," A masterpiece. A must-see!
","This is quite possibly the greatest movie ever. Why, do you ask? Well, for one, it is a very original idea taken from a well-written novel by an established author (Michael Chrichton). It features extremely well-done props and CGI, especially for its time. The acting was rather good, and it featured some top-notch stars (Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough to name a few).<br/><br/>Should I mention the dinosaurs?! Oh, man, as a dinosaur-loving nut I loved this film! Excellently-rendered brachiosaurs, vicious velicoraptors, and fearsome tyrannosaurs rampage across this tropical isle. The setting is EXCELLENT with sloping, forest-carpeted hills and realistic plains, with well-done bungalows and gift shops dotting the tourist area. The concept of the movie is amazing, and the special-effects are top-notch indeed!<br/><br/>Is there a movie from the 1990's greater than Jurassic Park? Some may argue Titanic, some may argue Shawshank Redemption, others may say Forrest Gump. But this movie had ALL the parts come together! Action, special effects, setting, directing, CGI, robotics, drama, horror....great, great flick.<br/><br/>My only regret is that Muldoon didn't stick around longer!<br/><br/>10/10. Best movie of the 1990's, if not ever!"
"litpics","10","2","4","12 February 2004"," The best film of all time?
","The answer to that question is yes, yes, sixty five million times, yes. There are no movies that can begin to match this great gold of a film. First off, the adaptation. IF you haven't read the book, you're missing quite a lot. It only enhances the greatness of this film. Like, for example, the effects. Yes, on this day, it looks cheap, but remember that most Bond films, when they first appeared, look cheap even today, but we love them all the same, because they inherit a classic value. Beside that argument, I think they still look fantastic. Every time I watch this movie, I think wow, how did they do it?<br/><br/>Secondly, comes the acting. You have Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, the late Bob Peck, need I go on? But the best of all, comes with Sam Neill. He is, in my opinion, one of the greatest actors living, and is completely underrated. When I read the novel, I pictured exactly what Mr. Neill brought to the screen in a ten-fold great performance as Dr. Alan Grant. All of these actors and actresses made the film even better. It wasn't just dinos running around killing people, but also the drama in the mix.<br/><br/>Finally, comes the directing by the remarkable Steven Spielberg. Only a genius like he could take a great novel and turn it into a cinematic epic. The unique camera angles, the suspense to keep you thinking about what is about to happen, everything down to the last line spoken. He created a film that our children's children's children will consider classics.<br/><br/>I consider it a classic even now, and for all time, nothing will come close to Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

However he (still being a jerk) ends up being a bit of a hero and to a pleasant surprise. . .lives.  As for John Hammond, in the movie he was santa clause.

It captures the imagination alike ""Star Wars"", ""2001."" As well as grasping hold of the thrills of ""Jaws"" and ""Alien."" The characters are such spectacular ones, filled with ENOUGH LIFE FOR ME AT LEAST, by Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Sir Richard Attenborough and Bob Peck. As well as the others in the cast. Its really a toss up for all the dino-action scenes in the film. Steven Spielberg grips our imaginations and takes us through a wild ride! For me any way, there are some very classic scenes. Many will agree, even though its unfortunate it seems so forgotten. Its CGI is still some of the best and for me AT LEAST, the CGI creates real, living creatures, just like in Jaws and Alien, not just dis-respectable names many people give it. Though the disappointment of the sequel, is the large quanity of missing cast members, it too is a classic wild ride through the very real dinosaurs of the world of Jurassic Park."

","I remember seeing Jurassic Park back when it was first released in theaters with the booming THX sound and big screen.  It quickly became one of my favorite fantasy films of all time, and still remains so today. <br/><br/>
While it takes several artistic liberties from the book, it has a great cast, a wonderful musical score (Courtesy of the ever-talented John Williams), and the special effects still hold up as well today as they did when it was released nearly 7 years ago.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is a movie to be savored, like ""Star Wars"" or ""Indiana Jones"". It's one excellent non-stop thrill after another that can only be described as fun.  The introduction of the T-Rex is still one of the most memorable scenes in the entire film, and the raptors were just relentless.  I don't think the dinosaurs would have been nearly as frightening if they were just ""monsters"".  The fact that these creatures behaved like instinct-driven animals kept the tension factor high.<br/><br/>My only complaint?  I wish that the ""Lost World"" sequel had been as good to keep the thrills up past this film.  At least Jurassic Park didn't have as many drastic changes made to it like the sequel.

In fact, my opinion of the film has changed over the years.  But I will say, it was very enjoyable!  It was well acted, scripted, and directed. Best of all, was the sound and the special effects.  This was the first movie to use DTS DIGITAL SOUND in movie theaters.  I can remember it being so loud, that when I went to see a different film, I could hear the T-Rex stomping around from the other room.  It also made me jump out of my seat many times.

Then you throw Steven Spielberg into the mix and you have sure success.<br/><br/>There is virtually nothing bad I can say about this movie.  Although there are a few things are awesome at first but then you think about it and you think yourself ""Wait a second""...case and point...at the end when the T-Rex magically appears behind Dr. Grant and the group and nobody noticed.  And how on earth could that beast have gotten inside the building?  So, there are a few scenes like that, but nothing that I can't deal with.<br/><br/>Overall, I could watch this movie a hundred times and NEVER get sick of it. The special effects alone are worth seeing this film.  It's just absolutely incredible how realistic the computer effects look.  The acting is very good as well.

","JURASSIC PARK is a ton of fun.  Steven Spielberg has created a thrilling roller-coaster ride of a movie.  The basic setting is a island compound that allows people to interact with living dinosaurs.  The only problem with the film is it's a roller coaster ride, and should be just that.  Spielberg tried to add an extra message that ""We shouldn't mess with nature.....""  I think the breath-taking dinosaur vs. our heroes scenes proved that enough.  <br/><br/>     Sam Niel and Laura Dern are terrific leads.  Jeff Goldblum (in a role he'd almost repeat in ID4), Samuel Jackson and Sir Richard Attenbourgh fill out the top notch cast."

Originally, I had given it a 9/10, but I hadn't seen it since it was first in the theaters in 1992 and was just remembering how cool it was that first time you saw a computer animated dinosaur, how the word ""wow"" was on everybody's lips for months and even years afterwards when recalling this film. Unfortunately, when I saw it again in 1999, and after I had actually studied film and had a superior understanding of the art form, it seemed trite. Comparing it to the other toothy monster which Spielberg brought to life, Jaws, Jurassic Park is a near dud. One who once made action masterpieces later made pap, hardly better than any other action film at the theaters. JPI is better than JP3. It creates suspense a bit better. I can't think of a more tense moment than when the little girl falls through the floor and a raptor's mouth comes about an inch from her dangling foot. Still, it is nothing more than an actioner.

","After seeing the film for the first time I realized that it was nothing but Westworld with dinosaurs.  If you take out the robots and replace them with geneticly created dinosaurs then you have the movie Jurassic Park.  A few items that Jurassic Park(1993) borrows from Westworld.  The idea of a spectecular theme park that is to bring out the child in tourists. Something goes wrong and the exhibits of the theme park turn on its creators and anyone else that's around there.  The heroes overcome the exhibits and barely flee with their lives.  Although I wasn't impressed with this movie I did find it more entertaining to watch than the sequel The Lost World(1997). Attempts to do for dinosaurs what Jaws did for sharks.  Wasn't as good as Jaws(1975) because at least in that film there were genuine attempts to create suspense, tension, and terror.  The direction is average for the talents of Steven Spielberg.  The cinematography is excellent for an average film.  Sam Neill plays in his fourth genre film besides Possession(1981), Omen 3:The Final Conflict(1981), and Event Horizon(1997).  The rest of the acting ranges from over the top to very good."

I can still remember when my lower jaw dropped and thundered into the carpet as that Brachiosaur was revealed in all its CG glory. This is the film that put digital effects on the map. I can still remember that first Tyrannosaur attack. Steven Spielberg, the master of the suspenseful build up, crafted one of the most memorable and terrifying sequences ever to be unleashed upon an unsuspecting public. My heart still beats a might faster today as it did back then when that scene comes up. I can still remember the screams in the audience as the Velociraptor rammed its head through the fence behind Laura Dern, in a scene akin to that of the 'head through the hole in the bottom of the boat' scene from Jaws. From Jeff Goldblum's trademark quirky performance to the now legendary effects this movie is an exercise in excitement and terror, mixed in with a little message about the dangers of cloning and science run rampant, best outlined in Dr.Malcolm's speech at the dinner table. A must see movie for anyone."

","So many reviews.  So much praise.  What could I possibly add?  Well, not a whole lot really.  This film is the best dinosaur movie ever made without question.  It is above the scope of the normal film of this nature, it transcends the ordinary to become the extraordinary.  Director Steven Spielberg has created a timeless gem here that entertains on many levels, but ultimately is a scary, horrifying look into what would happen if dinos and man mixed.  The special effects are what keep this film going and they are spectacular.  The dinosaurs look so real and animated with life.  Their ability to move, eat, and even think is a sight to behold.  The acting in this film is also very good.  Most of the characters have very definable personalities and you care for them throughout their struggles to survive. Sam Neil is excellent and Jeff Goldblum easily has the best lines in the film.  The musical score is wonderful.  For me, some of the best scenes in the picture are when Sam Neil is watching the dinosaurs that he has only theorized about his whole life.  He looks on like I imagine I would...with almost a child-like fascination.  The scene with all the little dinos running in a herd in the middle of a field in particular stands out as the enchanting musical score plays in the background.  This movie is one of the all-time money makers.  It is obvious to see why.  I cannot imagine that there is still someone that hasn't seen this, but if you are out there and have not - make sure you watch it lest you become a dinosaur in your own right."

","65 million years ago, dinosaurs became extinct. In 1993, imagination, science and technology came together, bringing these remarkable creatures back from extinction in a spectacular motion picture that became a worldwide phenomenon: Jurassic Park. A Steven Spielberg film starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough, Jurassic Park is a breathtaking adventure that opens the gate to a lost world, the incredible world of the dinosaurs.<br/><br/>On a remote island in the west coast of Costa Rica, a venture capitalist called John Hammond figured out an astonishing recovering and cloning technique to re-create dinosaurs from DNA fragments preserved in amber. He started a company called InGen, which placed the genetically engineered dinosaurs in a theme park called Jurassic Park. Before opening the attraction to the public, Hammond invites a top paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a mathematician/theorist, and his two eager grandchildren to experience the park and help calm anxious investors. However, their visit is anything but tranquil as the park security system breaks down and the prehistoric creatures break out... This is the original story of Jurassic Park, a simple but well developed idea based not only on the best-selling novel by Michael Crichton, but also on truly scientific evidences.<br/><br/>It presents a world lost by time and by the human kind, a world where nature and its inhabitants used to live in perfect harmony. In order to evoke this lost world, Jurassic Park makes use of striking visual and sound effects that depicts faithfully these extraordinary creatures which were the dinosaurs, how they were and how they lived;  and a wonderful soundtrack composed and conducted by John Williams, which is the spirit of this unforgettable adventure, one of the greatest successes in the history of Cinema, winner of three Academy Awards.<br/><br/>This incredible motion picture goes 6,5 million years back of evolution to inspire millions of people today and give us what we humans must need: hope. Because although dinosaurs appear to be the real creatures, we are the villains of this story  which is life. And as the birds fly away at the end of the film it is time to think about our own existence and our place in the world habitat. Nature cannot be contained, cannot be controlled by men. `Life finds a way'. As Spielberg said during filming of this biogenetics adventure `My interest is in making a good movie that honors the existence of dinosaurs'. And he really made it!"

","Out of all the movies I have ever seen, Jurassic Park stands head and shoulders above the rest. Years later, no other movie has managed to outperform JP in visual effects.

The dinosaurs are the real stars anyways.<br/><br/>My favorite movie of all time, and it should be yours too."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","2","4","30 August 2000"," Steven Spielberg comes forth with yet another classic. Jurassic Park will not be forgotten.
","This is the best dinosaur movie that has ever been made. Maybe a better one will be released sometime in the future, but so far, Jurassic Park is unparalleled. The story involves the re-creation of actual living dinosaurs from their own DNA which was recovered from dinosaur blood remaining inside a prehistoric mosquito which, millions of years ago, was unlucky enough to get caught in the soon solidified sap of a tree. Even all of the scientific elements of the story are explained in a way that even the youngest viewers could understand. <br/><br/>Jurassic Park, However, is not just about making dinosaurs and then getting eaten by them, it is about what happens when humans play with life and try to re-make and contain it in ways that were never meant to be. Dinosaurs once ""ruled the earth,"" but the earth is now ruled by humans, and the two species, separated by millions of years of evolution, cannot coexist. Neither can contain the other, one is sure to overcome.<br/><br/>
The spectacular visuals and amazingly convincing special effects and make-up provide an absolutely incredible cinematic experience. Never have dinosaurs been so convincingly made on screen. The fact that the dinosaurs were so real allowed for the film to really keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Particularly memorable moments include a velociraptor jumping up and almost out of the screen as it tries to get Alexis (Adriana Murphy) as she climbs up into the ceiling to escape, and also a scene with a Tyranosaurus in the rear-view mirror of the fleeing humans' Jeep(imitated hilariously in the great Toy Story 2). <br/><br/>However, even though the special effects have the rare combination of being both overpowering and amazingly convincing, Jurassic Park had a good number of important messages to deliver. There were a lot of things that could be learned from this film, and many of them were put right into the dialogue, mostly that of Dr. Ian Malcolm, played wonderfully by Jeff Goldblum. Michael Crichton needs to be recognized for his brilliant creation of such a man as Ian Malcolm, talking understandably about chaos theory and scientific responsibility and the extremely important fact that ""life finds a way."" Sam Neill also delivers one of the highlight performances of his career as the wonderfully convincing Dr. Alan Grant, alongside Laura Dern as Ellie Satler, and both of them, along with the rest of the cast, were perfectly faithful to the original novel. That, in my opinion, is an extremely important element of films that were adapted from books, and Jurassic Park is rivaled in its literary faith only by other great films like The Green Mile.<br/><br/>
Jurassic Park is not a film about a dinosaur amusement park. That is the premise, but the message of the film has a lot to say about the vulnerability of the human race, and it is a testament to the skills of Steven Spielberg and the other filmmakers involved that they were able to make a movie with such an important thing like that to say (among others), while at the same time making the whole experience so much fun."

","Seeing the movie now, almost 30 years later, some parts of it definitely didn't age as well as we might have thought it would back then (mostly the shoots of the dinosaurs during the day). However, it's insane, how the movie is still entertaining, after a first half of slow setup and exposition. I get it tho, it would have been impossible to have dinosaurs throughout the whole thing. But even still, I love the element of surprise, and suspense we have until we first see the T-Rex, for example. That scene is incredible, and one of the most memorable scenes in cinema's history.<br/><br/>One of the examples of how well the movie holds up: I saw with my family, and my dad (who isn't much of a film guy) was scared as f, in so many scenes! lol That showed me that, if I thought the movie holded up well for most of the time, if the computers didn't tell the age of the film, my family probably would have believed this movie came out in the last 5 years or so. That to me is one of the major proofs of how incredible this movie is, and what it represented back in 1993.<br/><br/>That mostly what I have to say about Jurassic Park, it's a great, and fun movie to watch even today. The acting is pretty good (I love Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm). The score... man, the score! I love you John Williams. That's all I'll say.<br/><br/>Overall tho, it's undeniable the impact Jurassic Park (as well as other Spielberg's classics) had on movies in general, it was probably one of the first time we saw through CGI (and also a hell of an animatronics job) a brand new world we could almost feel in the screen (since there was almost non-CGI in the first versions of Star Wars, I'm not counting it here, in this example, and also, JP is a story that takes place on Earth, there is an element of fantasy to it, but you can actually see it happening for a moment).<br/><br/>From the T-Rex scene, Malcolm's jokes, and Velociraptors opening doors, I loved the second half of the movie. If the first half I thought struggled a bit, the second still flies way high in the sky. A classic."

","Extremely good stunts, and the imagination of the sea and the sky. Spielberg is indeed a very great director. Looking back last night, the dinosaurs made by those stunts are still very, very cute, and the image of free walking in the primitive forest living freely is popular. This led me to be more familiar and familiar with the animals 60 million years ago than many animals that still exist today. At the tension of the plot, the brutal shot also scared me to blindfold. There are few loopholes.
One of the most interesting discoveries is that in this film, due to the high development of technology and the extensive use of computer special effects, Spielberg has questioned modern science through the genetic engineering of dinosaurs: can science make humans think they are the world The master of can control nature and transcend nature? Of course, the answer given by the director is no. It can be seen that this reflects the modern West's understanding of the limitations of science after introspection of science since the 20th century. Science cannot be an excuse for human arrogance. However, this does not affect the greatness of science. After all, because of the development of science, Spielberg can create, we can see the image of a dinosaur living freely in nature 60 million years ago."

","The most perfect dinosaur movie, it is hard to imagine that the movie was born in 1993. Under the leadership of a great director, the dinosaurs that were seen from picture books countless times in childhood, and the familiar names of dinosaurs were continuously carried out in the movie Elaborate, shocking and moving. The development of the story is also very thrilling and exciting, with some horror and humor, and also the nightmare that was a childhood night has been reborn again. A thrilling encounter brought a thrilling adventure. The significance of the film lies not only in its plot, in line with theoretical thinking, but also in the meaning that spans the film era, but also makes us countless people remember the great director
The first half of the bedding is still very cumbersome. When the dinosaurs appeared, they looked at the vibration of the water cup. The sense of suspense is similar to that of ""Great White Shark"". The kitchen chase is also very interesting. The bridge section played well, and the plot improved a lot. In general, the special effects and models at that time were very shocking, and even if you look at these special effects now, you will not feel outdated."

After all, greedy people will not have good results, and selfish people will not have a good ending. Only responsible people with perseverance can persevere and survive. Although they bear more burdens, although their path is very difficult, although sometimes they can completely give up others and escape alone. However, they did not leave anyone behind. They were strong and brave to face the difficulties and survived. They lived bluntly and without guilt.

","Jurassic Park is just perfect in every aspect. The plot, characters, screenplay, music and CGI are all superb, combined to make the film entertaining to the last second of it. It's an all-time classic, more than a ""cult"" movie as some call it.<br/><br/>The plot is an exemplary show of storytelling. Two hours of this film never get boring partly because of the well thought-out plot structure. It begins quietly, though with some menace lingering over the horizon. We are taken to the park, and (along with the characters) get awestruck with the magnificence of dinosaurs. More fine details follow to let us breathe and be ready for the coming storm. A struggle for survival begins with the T-Rex, but their journey through the park has ups and downs, sometimes keeping us on edge and other times heartwarming. This rhythm of rush and calm is so finely tuned that we never get bored or tired. Their struggle is ended, again fittingly, by the T-Rex, and the film concludes with a definite answer: Life finds a way.<br/><br/>That also introduces an interesting twist of this film. Jurassic Park is often called an axiomatic blockbuster. Well, it is. But it is more than that. While being entertaining, it also poses important questions. Specifically, is genetic engineering ethical and safe? More generally, isn't technological advancement getting out of control? Shouldn't we ask more often if we should, rather than just if we can? This film is powerfully humbling.<br/><br/>All the characters are lovable and have an important role to play. They also develop as we watch them. The chemistry between Dr. Grant, Tim and Lex is amazing. Even those in supporting roles, such as John Hammond, Dr. Malcolm, Nedry, Arnold, and Muldoon all give us memorable moments. This film can't have one more or one less - it has a perfect ensemble as is.<br/><br/>The original music score by John Williams is again a perfect match to the movie. I'd even say this is his best work (though admittedly it's a very tough call). The music never fails to add more emotion to each scene, whether in peace or in danger. Whenever I listen to the Main Theme from Jurassic Park (on my iPhone), the majestic view of Isla Nublar is visualized on my mind.<br/><br/>CGI was cutting-edge when it came out in 1993, and it still is watchable after two decades of incredible technological advancement. That tells something about a wisdom of using CGI where it does the job best. They certainly had technological limitations back then, but their creativity more than made up for it.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is an absolute masterpiece. Anyone from anywhere can enjoy it. Even someone who has watched it a dozen times can still enjoy it. Even while the modern sequels stumble, the original Jurassic Park continues to shine."

","I have a long and detailed history with Jurassic Park. It may or may not be particularly interesting, but discussing that kind of thing can be potentially helpful when it comes to movies that have already been discussed to near death.<br/><br/>I was a 5-year-old kid once, and so I loved dinosaurs. Part of me still things they're really cool, to be honest. And so I can remember watching Jurassic Park quite a lot as a kid. I don't know if it was ever one of my absolute favourite movies, but it was always very cool, very exciting, and sometimes very scary. Then in 2013, it got a re-release in cinemas, in 3D (remember 3D? Remember when so many movies were released in 3D? It only lasted a few years but it was crazy, and sometimes really annoying. Anyway...) I was 18, hadn't seen Jurassic Park since I was in the single digits, and went to watch it. I really liked it again. It was still fun, still exciting, and I could now respect the craft behind it a whole lot more. As an added bonus, it looked and sounded so great on the big screen that the shoehorned in 3D effects were even tolerable.<br/><br/>Another rewatch five years after that gave me a similar feeling, but it was my most recent viewing a few nights ago where I realised Jurassic Park wasn't just a very good movie: it was a great one. A near perfect one, to be perfectly frank. A film with fantastic pacing, characters who are simple yet instantly understandable and also sympathetic enough so that you don't just want to see them all get eaten, a great balance of genuinely funny humour and incredible tension, an engaging story that's still involving despite being refreshingly small-scaled compared to many other blockbusters (the stakes involve the survival of a few key characters, not the entire world), and maybe most surprisingly: special effects that have hardly aged a day.<br/><br/>Okay, without sounding too hyperbolic: technically the effects aren't perfect. If I want to nitpick, there are some CGI shots of dinosaurs here and there (particularly when they're very well lit) where nowadays the detail would be greater. But if you take the first big T-Rex scene, or the velociraptor sequences towards the film's end, I don't honestly think you could make them look much better nowadays than they made them look back in 1993. Spielberg and his effects team nailed most of the sequences here perfectly, and it's incredible to consider the film is now 27 years old. I love Terminator 2, and the effects in there look very good still, even the CGI ones. But they're not as good as this. Even if dinosaurs didn't really look like how they're depicted here (apparently velociraptors might have been much smaller than they are in this film and FEATHERED), you still buy these creatures as existing on this island, with these characters.<br/><br/>As a kid, I felt like the pre-island scenes took up a good deal of time, but as a (slightly) more patient adult, they honestly feel perfectly paced. There's just enough overall set-up for both the characters and the basic plot without making the audience feel bored. I also love how it wraps up nice and quickly in the conclusion, without feeling abrupt. Spielberg back in his hey-day often had such a good grasp on what to stretch out for the purposes of suspense and what would work better if it was accelerated. He was a master of pacing as much as he was an absolute master of knowing where to point the camera and how to direct his actors in a way where no one felt out of place, and everyone knew what kind of tone the movie was going for.<br/><br/>I feel like I'm rambling, and I could go on, because it's hard to run out of good things to say when it comes to a movie as great as Jurassic Park. If there are flaws, they're minor. Some may find the child characters annoying (I didn't think they were too bad though, and while this isn't strictly a kid's movie, I think it makes sense to have them there to make it a widely appealing movie). A couple of Laura Dern's character's feminist remarks sound a little clunky- female characters in films like this have come a fair way, and so nowadays those sorts of lines would probably be worked in a little more naturally and in a less cheesy manner. Maybe Samuel L. Jackson is under-utilised? He's good here for what he has to do, but maybe because this was a pre-Pulp Fiction era, most people hadn't realised just how to utilise his immense talent and screen presence correctly.<br/><br/>I could go on, but these are honestly fairly insignificant problems. And sure, it's not a particularly deep or complex movie, but neither does it feel like it's stupid or pandering, and so if it wants to focus on being entertainment first and foremost, given that it succeeds in that regard, I think that's more than acceptable. And there is some interesting (though admittedly simple) stuff in there about man vs. nature and making a profit out of natural resources, if you really do need something to analyse.<br/><br/>If you somehow haven't watched Jurassic Park yet, I'd highly recommend changing that as soon as possible. This is a gripping, fun, intense, exciting, and surprisingly funny movie that hasn't lost any of its power and likability since its release close to three decades ago now. It's so good I've spent 900 words praising it so far without even touching once on how Jeff Goldblum is so great and so hilarious he comes close to stealing the entire show from the amazingly well realised GIANT DINOSAURS.<br/><br/>Watch it now. And if you have seen it, but it was a while ago, watch it again, and prepare to be amazed by how well it's aged. Spielberg, the cast, John Williams, Michael Crichton, and everyone else involved deserve so much praise for the two hours of fantastic entertainment they worked together to put out. It's an absolute (and essentially timeless) classic in every sense of the word."

It was on VHS, which was awesome, it was a fun experience because I saw it with a really good friend.<br/><br/>The movie itself is plenty of fun. It already has a lot of it's appeal in its '90s feel, the whole of the '90s has a sort of muted, restrained quality to it in my memory. This is easy viewing for a weekday: it can seem perfunctory now as far as these adventure blockbusters go but it's quiant, stylish, well characterised and efficiently told. It's a great testimony to how one should use CGI effects but try to limit them things strictly impossible to other kinds of effects (I think people are calling them ""practical effects"" now).<br/><br/>So although it doesn't really shine compared to the new movies of this type, this is still quite worth your time as a delightful archetype of a genre I presume it gave a lot too."

","Numerous films have built on the inventive story telling methods pioneered by ""Jurassic Park,"" Jurassic Park remains a truly remarkable and impressive film and a great addition to any movie lover's collection.<br/><br/>""Jurassic Park"" tells the story of the creation of a theme park filled with genetically re-engineered dinosaurs and the problems which arise when things go awry on the secluded island where the park is located. The film is packed with excitement and thrills as some of the dinosaurs begin to hunt the humans on the island. Some of these scenes might be a bit much for young children or fairly timid viewers, and there are a few scenes in which children are put in peril, however, for those who can stand these more intense scenes, such scenes in the film are exciting and fun. Much of the second half of the film offers edge-of-your-seat thrills which will often get a viewers heart racing a bit more. Because this is somewhat of a family film, many of the suspenseful scenes are more exciting than scary, and it is constantly entertaining to watch the interactions between humans and dinosaurs .<br/><br/>The film is based on the novel by Michael Crichton, and Crichton's constant attention to even the most minute details is carried into the film version quite well. Despite the somewhat far fetched central notion in the plot, between the efforts of Crichton and Spielberg, the film seems fairly believable. The film encourages a suspension of disbelief of the viewer with dazzling visual effects and the surround sound serves to envelop the viewer in the suspenseful action.<br/><br/>Unquestionably, the visual effects and dinosaurs take center stage, the film is made even better by a number of enjoyable performances. The stars of the film, Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum all put in strong performances, particularly Goldblum who offers a bit of comic relief as caustic chaotician Ian Malcolm. In addition, the film features a fine performance by Sir Richard Attenborough as John Hammond, the Park's proprietor, and good supporting performances by Wayne Knight (who basically plays a computer genius version of his ""Newman"" character from Seinfeld) and Samuel L. Jackson (about a year before his career skyrocketed with ""Pulp Fiction"").<br/><br/>Although contemporary films, such as ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" now use CGI visual effects with great frequency, due recognition must be given to the film which was a quantum leap forward in visual effects. While the film has attained landmark status for such developments it is also an extremely spectacular film. In the DVD's bonus materials, Steven Spielberg speaks about the wonder and fascination with which children view dinosaurs. With this film, Spielberg instills similar feelings in viewers of all ages with an extremely majestic and enjoyable film. While the film does contain some scenes of violence and suspense which might be a bit frightening for children (or more timid viewers) this is a film which is not to be missed and makes a great addition to any film lover's collection."

","A cracking film about a team of archaeologists sent to evaluate a theme park with a difference. It has end-to-end thrills and some truly groundbreaking special effects. The acting is, however, another matter entirely. Sam Neill and Laura Dean as well as the truly irritating children, deserve to be eaten (preferably as early on in the film as possible) and Richard Attenborough' s accent - well goodness only knows where that is supposed to come from. Bob Peck and Jeff Goldblum hold up their end of the bargain rather better and the dinosaurs are just magnificent.

","Jurassic Park (in Brazil, Jurassic Park - Parque dos Dinossauros) is an American adventure and science fiction movie from 1993 directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the eponymous book written by Michael Crichton. Produced by Amblin Entertainment and distributed by Universal Pictures, it stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Ariana Richards, Joseph Mazzello, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bob Peck. The film is centered on the fictional Isla Nublar, where a billionaire philanthropist and a small team of geneticists create an island theme park where the main attractions are varied dinosaur species recreated through genetic engineering. A park built by a millionaire (Richard Attenborough) is home to several dinosaurs, extinct sixty-five million years ago. This is possible because a fossilized insect was found, which had sucked blood from these dinosaurs, from which the DNA, the chemical code of life, could be isolated, and from that point recreated in the laboratory. But what seemed like a nightmare dream, when the experience gets out of control of its creators. The special effects were very well done were produced by Industrial Light & Magic (with effects created by computer graphics) and Stan Winston Studios (with effects produced by animatronics). The virtual reenactment of the flesh-and-blood dinosaurs with the actors was a tremendous box office success. Script simply very good (only almost sleeping twice) is not because it is less interesting for me I found it very interesting, but I was tired so it happened, chose the actors very well, very good musical background and my movie score was going being 10.0 (masterpiece) out of 10.0 I have already explained why tiredness so my movie grade is 8.0 (very good) out of 8.0.<br/><br/>Movie watched on May 6, 2019"

","Steven Spielberg's phenomenally successful sci-fi adventure thriller is graced by state-of-the-art special effects. The film follows two dinosaur experts -- Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr. Ellie Sattler Laura Dern) -- as they are invited by eccentric millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to preview his new amusement park on an island off Costa Rica. By cloning DNA harvested from pre-historic insects, Hammond has been able to create living dinosaurs for his new Jurassic Park, an immense animal preserve housing real brachiosaurs, dilophosaurs, triceratops, velociraptors, and a Tyrannosaur Rex. Accompanied by cynical scientist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), who is obsessed with chaos theory, and Hammond's two grandchildren (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello), they are sent on a tour through Hammond's new resort in computer controlled touring cars. But as a tropical storm hits the island, knocking out the power supply, and an unscrupulous employee (Wayne Knight) sabotages the system so that he can smuggle dinosaur embryos out of the park, the dinosaurs start to rage out of control. Grant then has to bring Hammond's grandchildren back to safety as the group is pursued by the gigantic man-eating beasts."

","Directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg, this movie made dinosaurs really popular with children and then frightening. This is the first installment of the Jurassic Park franchise (including Jurassic World). And I was surprised that this movie is based on Michael Crichton's novel with the same name, though I never read it. Crichton also wrotre the screenplay with David Koepp. It's about a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.<br/><br/>I liked the performances, especially the children. They had proved that not all children actors were terrible in acting. There's Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant, Laura Dern as Ellie, Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm. I actually though Ian was dead when he collapsed on the ground when the T-Rex was about to eat the man in the toilet. Then he got back alive, injured and I was astonished. He also appeared in the Lost World - Jurassic Park 2. Another surprising thing was there was Samuel L. Jackson in the movie being Arnold before he got famous in Pulp Fiction (1994). When I didn't know that fact, I saw this Arnold man looked like Samuel L. Jackson and when I saw there's him in the cast, I was like ""WTF!!!"". Crazy!<br/><br/>The CGI was the best things in here. They made the dinosaurs looked real and they did, nothing was a bad sign of CGI, except for the orange running dinosaurs, they're a bit bad. The fight scenes between dinosaurs were cool and when the goat's leg fell on the car, it was just INSANE!!! Although it was considered to be not scary, I think the movie had made its entrance to be R-Rated but then I thought again, because of the dinosaurs walking in beautiful nature more than that, I think PG-13 is okay!<br/><br/>The movie was scored beautifully and satisfyingly by the amazing John Williams. The score made us feel that we're in a paradise if we're watching this movie in a 3-D version. I just loved the music so much.<br/><br/>This was definitely one of Steven Spielberg's masterpieces. He had made an awesome R-Rated movie that year and it was Schindler's List, I hope Jurassic Park is gonna be as good as that, even though it's not."

","As other flicks in the hall of classics 'Jurassic Park' is a common reference between adults and children, but among film addicts it is also known for its incredible novelty and use of practical effects that defied any expectations.<br/><br/>As a child, I was not that into dinosaurs but one thought of having a full park inhabited with those ancient lizards would stir up my blood and whirl my head. Stephen Spielberg has created a dream attraction that makes you regret that you are living in a wrong reality. However, not everything is so perfect and bright; you need to take care of your child or it will sneakily bite you and throw a bunch of unexpected surprises.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the film is the thing that glues my attention right away: you could see that the owner of the park cares about the park as for nothing else in his life and frankly I believe that this love comes directly from Stephen Spielberg. You could feel the touch and the struggle to make everything as real as possible, the music throws you at the state of admiring serenity with occasional moments of trembling tension that hold your breath without you even noticing it.<br/><br/>For the cast, the picture is fairly good but still the conduct of the characters is extremely weird and unnatural, we will omit the behavior of Jeff Goldblum because he is an exceptional diamond that cannot be judged. Anyways the human part was overshadowed by the real heroes of the time - dinosaurs - the complex and, for sure, costly machinery paid back handsomely: even for the current standards it is considered as a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Back from the messed up trip we go and I must say that the idea shines brighter than a sun, implementation is amazing, performance slightly limps behind but overall the motion picture for sure has to be on your home shelf with ""Cool stuff"" label on it, however, the fragility is that the older you are at the time of the first look, the less you are impressed by it."

","A Childhood staple film for me, Jurassic Park has become one of the most successful film franchises of all time. Nowadays there are hundreds of people who share a type of cult following to the film. Famed Paleontologist Jack Horner assisted in the design of the dinosaurs, and his expertise really helped make it feel more realistic. Jurassic Park isn't just a film, it's like a gateway into the imagination of a child that we can all share a piece of. Even today, parents and child alike can both share in this wonderful masterpiece. Yes, some are eaten and killed by dinosaurs, but not in such a horrific and graphic way that would make a child too uncomfortable. It also serves us who are a tad more scientifically oriented, as a reminder of how precious and delicate life is. How we shouldn't be so quick to try and achieve things simply because they are possible...but shouldn't really be achieved due to our humanity.

","This movie reminds me of a story in Tinkle Comics of the Amar Chitra Katha series, an old I am assuming fairly popular and well known comic book series in India, that I read as a kid. The story is about four students three of whom are very intelligent, always straight A , and the fourth one is a dunce, always F. Having completed their education, they set out into the world together to try out their prospects and it so happens that on their journey they have to go through a forest where in a clearing they find the skeleton of a dead animal. The three smart students agree this is a good opportunity to apply and to test their knowledge and their skill and put it into practice . One smart one says I can reconstruct all the internal organs for this skeleton, and the second smart one says I can give it external muscle and tissue and skin, and the third smart one says I can give it life. The dunce takes one look at the skeleton and flees and climbs up the tallest tree he can find. So the three perform their feat and raise up the dead animal which turns out to be a lion which devours the three of them. Maybe there could be a message and a moral to this movie similar to the one in the story and movies and stories can be be both entertaining and enlightening at the same time after all."

","JURASSIC PARK was the film that ignited my interest in filmmaking and drove me to get a degree in it, so I will always have a soft spot for it. I was eleven when I read the book, but all the technical stuff lost me and I never finished it. A couple years later when I heard the movie was coming out, I decided I would just see it instead. With advance tickets selling out fast, my mom was lucky enough to get some a few days before it's premiere. We stood in line for roughly thirty minutes before we finally got in. Even as the lights were dimming, I still had no idea what to expect. Within moments I was glued to my seat. The opening sequences remains one of my favorite scenes in any film and continues to give me goosebumps to this day. For the next two hours, I sat in my seat just staring at the screen as these marvelous, life-like creatures that were unlike anything I had ever seen before. The film was full of awe and scares. I walked out of the theater virtually trying to catch my breath. What a thrill ride the film had been, and I eventually went back and saw it a few more times. The film was a turning point in my life, as I said, because I walked out saying to myself, ""That's what I want to do."" Sure the characters aren't deep and the dialogue isn't great, but who cares when the film is this entertaining? The actors are good in their parts, especially the always great Sam Neill, and the dinosaurs are incredibly life-like. The action is great, and the pacing (after a slow start) is relentless.

","The opening scene of the film sets the erie tone where a large animal crate and its contents are being loaded into a paddock, over a dozen men stand intensely around taking orders from Robert Maldoon (Bob Peck) the creature inside knocks the crate away from the paddock and drags a worker inside with menacing roars from the creature and a panicked commotion from the men Spielberg does a wonderful job starting his film out with essentially saying for the park ""we have no idea what we are doing."" John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) multi-billionaire and owner of ""Jurassic Park"" recruits a group of Paleontologists Dr. Grant (Sam Neil) and his assistant Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) as well as Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to be brought to his amusement park to tour and make sure that it is safe for tourists and that all the dinosaurs are healthy. Unlike anything that has been on the earth, the park located on a remote island called Isla Nublar off the coast of Coasta Rica, it is a zoo of scientifically engineered dinosaurs. Scientists have cracked the prehistoric genetic code, and with help from the genes of living species to fill gaps in the genome, we now have living, breathing, walking and eating dinosaurs. <br/><br/>The Paleontologists are flown in via helicopter and we are presented of a beautiful view of the lush green island backed with beautiful music that when I hear takes me back to my earliest memories of watching this movie. Upon arriving on the island Dr. Grant and his associates first encounter a very large Herbivore dinosaur known as a brachiosaurus, they are all blown away, Dr. Grant begins to ramble off scientific facts of the dinosaur as Ian Malcolm can only piece together, ""its a dinosauryou actually did it you crazy son of a bitch."" Which is followed by Grant asking Hammond a question about how fast the dinosaur is and Hammond responds with, ""we clocked the T-Rex at 32 miles per hour."" Grant and Sattler are shocked ""you have a t-Rex???"" as their faces are over come with fear, essentially telling us that obviously they don't approve of the idea to bring history's greatest killer another breath. After given a sneak preview of the behind the scenes of the research and scientific engineering complexes, the group is taken in jeeps attached to a monorail system they are taken to all the exhibits before it is open to the public, One of the paleontologists, Malcolm describes a chain of events, ""God creates dinosaurs, god destroys dinosaurs, god creates man, man destroys god, man creates dinosaur, dinosaur eats man."" Further on the exploration of the park the group encounters a sick triceratops gives the Paleontologists an opportunity to view this genetically created behemoth up close and personal, fulfilling every young child's dream of seeing one of these ancient creatures. A tropical storm blows in as the group reaches the next paddockthe Tyrannosaurus paddock. The power to the park gets knocked out completely, even the electric fences that keep in the dinosaurs are out, 65 million years of Hell is unleashed, and humans are hunted down one by one by raptors and the infamous t-Rex.<br/><br/>Spielberg has done a phenomenal job with this film, from script to CGI, he pieced together a beautiful masterpiece. A film that can entertain all ages, as a young kid I idolized Dr. Grant, his knowledge and love for dinosaurs made me want nothing more than to follow in his footsteps and become a paleontologist. Now as an adult I am still fascinated by the visual excitement of the film, the tyrannosaurus Rex chasing down and attacking the gallimimus, the ""final battle"" between the raptors and the t-Rex, but now I have a greater knowledge and respect for the craft of Spielberg in creating this film."

","Jurassic Park was one of the first movies I remember watching at the cinema as a youngster, and I was so blown away I quickly acquired a pirate video of it, which I routinely watched to death. The special effects, the music, the set-pieces, that familiar park logo - it all had me riveted. It's one of the game-changing blockbuster movies, and watching it again an astonishing 22 years later, it's remarkable just how well the movie has aged. It's not quite the perfect experience I remember - those Spielberg-isms are now clear as day - but Jurassic Park's mixture of robotics and CGI blows most modern films away in terms of tension and pure spectacle.<br/><br/>Eccentric millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) approaches palaeontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and his palaeobotanist partner Dr. Ellie Satler (Laura Dern) to join him on a journey to his newly built theme park. With the promise of a life-changing experience, the young-ish doctors cannot resist, so they journey to Isla Nublar, an island off the coast of Costa Rica, along with mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero). Upon arrival, they are greeted with the sight of a living, breathing brachiosaurus. Using the preserved dinosaur DNA extracted from mosquitoes preserved in tree sap, Hammond and his company have used cloning technology to birth a wide range of dinosaurs, including the terrifying tyrannosaurus rex and a group of velociraptors.<br/><br/>With this revelation comes the debate of whether man creating life is ethical, or in this scenario, safe. The dangers quickly become apparent to the group of doctors, but they cannot restrain their curiosity and are whisked off on a tour of the park. So confident is Hammond in the safety of his park, he invites his grandchildren Tim (Joseph Mazzello) and Lex (Ariana Richards) to participate. However, disgruntled employee Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) has cut a deal to sell dinosaur embryos to a corporate rival, and when a storm hits the park, he shuts down all the power in order gain access to the eggs. With the electric fences keeping the dinosaurs in temporarily down, it isn't long before the dinosaurs are fleeing their pens.<br/><br/>At first, this is the patient Spielberg who gave us Jaws (1975), opting for a slow build-up to the big reveal rather than giving the audience instant gratification. The introduction of the T-Rex is now an iconic moment in cinema, a thrilling combination of tension and pure terror, with a jump shock thrown in for good measure. But once Spielberg finally unleashes his monsters, the film simply doesn't stop. Delivering set-piece after set-piece, Jurassic Park abandons all restraint and packs it's second hour when it should be preparing us for the next big scene. Jaws gave us that wonderful moment when the crew compared battle scars, but there is no such scene here, just another problem for our relatively bland archetypal heroes to solve.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting aspects of the film is the character of John Hammond, Essentially the main antagonist, Hammond is a good- natured capitalist, a visionary who wants to bring wonder to the masses and make a tidy profit at the same time. Without a second thought for the consequences of his actions or the ethics of playing God, Hammond comes across as misguided, and too likable to be labelled a villain. Hammond aside, Jurassic Park makes no apologies for its thinly- written characters, as this is a film of visual spectacle after all. When John Williams' famous score kicks in, it's easy to forget about the movie's many niggling problems and, for me at least, be reminded of that kid who would watch it on repeat with his nose a few inches from the screen."

","This film has everything. Action, tense scenes, great acting, and great cgi. Despite being made over 20 years ago, the dinosaurs still look better then much of today's cgi. The plot is about a group of people going to an island with live dinosaurs. But some of the workers are trying to smuggle embryos off the island and they turn off the power releasing all the dinosaurs. The survivors then have to make it off the island before they get killed. This movie has dozens of memorable scenes which are too many to name all of them but the most memorable for me is when we first see the T-Rex destroy the car. The movie actually explains why the dinosaurs exist and it explains how they made them. Even though this can't happen in reality, it's always impressive for sci-fi films to have the plot have believable elements. Realism isn't necessary but it does make them more interesting to me. The 2nd and 3rd movies weren't that good compared to this one but ""Jurassic World"" might be the one that brings back the charm of the original one. This is an outstanding movie and every sci-fi fan needs to see this."

","I saw quite a few movies when I was a kid, there were three VHS tapes that I watched more than any others. They were The Lion King, Home Alone, and Jurassic Park. The first two are good movies but I always thought Jurassic Park was the best because it had dinosaurs. I'd say it's my second-favorite movie of all-time, with the first being Blade Runner.<br/><br/>Since this movie's a childhood favorite of mine, there really is no way I can't see this without rose-tinted glasses. Kind of like how a lot of people saw E.T. as kids and think it's the best movie ever when, um, it's not.<br/><br/>But yeah, Jurassic Park isn't a perfect movie. Some characters make illogical decisions. For example, Robert Muldoon who's the park's game warden and who should know more about the velociraptors than anyone else in the world, tries to kill a velociraptor when he should have known about their hunting strategy and is killed by velociraptors who use said strategy, which Grant explained to a kid in the beginning of the movie (and Grant had only studied fossils at that time while Muldoon could actually see the velociraptors in real life). Also the park is not designed very well. That's kind of the point of the movie but still, it's kind of weird how no one thought to modify the vehicles so that they could be driven in an emergency instead of guided by the metal track on the road (among other things). Also, how is it that the T. Rex can step out of the paddock then a few minutes later, pushes a car down a hundred feet into it?<br/><br/>And the movie ends with a deus ex machina, even if it's a really cool deus ex machina.<br/><br/>I'll admit, if I saw this movie for the first time now instead of when I was 4, I'd give it maybe 8 stars. If I was generous, maybe 9. But not 10. But I saw it for the first time when I was 4 and it makes me feel nostalgic so I have no problem with giving it a 10."

","I still remember the day I went to watch this movie. I was with my elder brother and one of his friends. I was ten years old. The theatre was crowded, full of people. In the queue, I could barely breathe as I was smaller to anyone around. But I waited patiently. We then moved to the room: it was one of the biggest screen I had seen in my like. The movie started: I was so excited. And then I felt something I would never feel again: a cinematographic shock that completely took me by surprise. I loved every second of this movie, it was the greatest experience in my life as a young movie-goer. I think it is on this day that I decided that I would do visual effects for a living."

","This review is mainly for Jurassic Park 3D. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is how the movie was meant to be seen. Everything seemed much cooler in 3D-the dinosaurs, Brachiosaurus scene, the last scene, and even the end credits! If you have seen the original movie, but not the 3D version, you really need to see it! No matter how you see this film, it'S AMAZING!I would recommend seeing this film before watch in the fourth installment of the Jurassic Park series: Jurassic World (to be released on June 12th, 2015). Also, I would read the book if I were you, because the book and the movie are equals! If you love dinosaurs and science fiction-here's the picture movie for you. Jurassic Park is a perfect dinosaur-science fiction mix! You should really watch it!"

","This is my favorite film. It is DEFIANTLY under-rated. <br/><br/>For starters, this movie's CGi is better than most modern CGi films, for example, the CGi in some of these newer flicks is unbelievable. <br/><br/>The movie is also exceedingly gory for the rating it has received here in the United Kingdom. It received PG by the BBFC and 12 by the Irish Board of Classification. <br/><br/>Some of the scenes like (SPOILERS!!!) the scene where Mr Arnold's arm falls on Ellie Sattler is very bloody, and the language is quite strong (see parental guide). <br/><br/>Anyways, the acting is perfect and is great for all ages (except for the younger audience, who may get scared). <br/><br/>10 out of 10, 100%!"
"ugyenpeljor","10","0","0","15 September 2013"," A blockbuster phenomenon 65 million years in the making!
","Few movies have had as great an impact on me as Jurassic Park the first time I saw this back in the 1990s as a little kid. This movie was not just a summer blockbuster, it was a pop culture PHENOMENON! I remember fondly those good ol' days, and the EXPLOSION of dinosaur toys, books, movies, TV shows, everything following in the wake of Jurassic Park. <br/><br/>I recently had the pleasure of catching Jurassic Park once again on the big screen during the 20th Anniversary Rerelease. Let me begin by saying that Jurassic Park looks as beautiful and stunning on the big screen now as it did 20 years ago - even after so many years, even after Avatar and Inception and The Dark Knight, there is simply no experience that stacks up to seeing Jurassic Park on IMAX 3D! <br/><br/>I can speak at great lengths as to the fantastic visual effects and sound work behind the film, the excellent directing by Steven Spielberg, the amazing soundtrack provided by John Williams (which may or may not rival those of Indiana Jones and Star Wars!), or the inspired acting performances by Sam Neil, Richard Attenborough, and, of course, the iconic ""Must Go Faster!"" Jeff Goldblum. But no, instead, I will focus on what I consider to be the REAL strength of this film, and the main reason why people see it in the first place: why, DINOSAURS, of course!<br/><br/>Now, for a film starring DINOSAURS, actual dinosaurs only appear on screen for a total of 15 minutes. The brilliance of Jurassic Park is that, like Spielberg's JAWS, the entire movie is about the BUILD-UP to the dinosaurs, and about how we humans interact with them. Dinosaurs inhabited this planet for 150 million years, over 300 times longer than our species, Homo sapiens, has been around for. They were some of the largest and most magnificent creatures to ever grace Earth's natural history, and even after 65 million years of extinction, they continue to win the fascination and admiration of the human race the world over. <br/><br/>Unlike many other movies that portray dinosaurs as mindless man-eating monsters, Jurassic Park actually takes great care to point out that dinosaurs are just animals like any other animal alive today - even the scary carnivores like the Tyrannosaurus Rex have a certain quality about it that you can't help but feel awed and fascinated by it even while you're running for your life! In a way, MAN is the true monster of the film, as it is man who believes himself above nature, and when man interferes with the natural order of the world, chaos and destruction ensues. For a Hollywood summer blockbuster, Jurassic Park is far more cleverly written than it has any right to be, but a lot of that is owed to writer Michael Crichton, that master of original and inventive science fiction stories. Rest in peace, Michael Crichton.<br/><br/>Now, all that said, the science and paleontology behind Jurassic Park leaves something to be desired. The portrayal of living dinosaurs and of genetic engineering and cloning was highly scientifically accurate (or at plausible) for 1993. However, new discoveries since then have disproven many of the film's theories and assertions. For example, real life velociraptors were the size of a turkey and had feathers. More importantly, the very basis of the film is discredited: we now know that intact DNA cannot survive more than a few million years at most, even in optimal conditions for preservation. Sadly, at least for the time being, it seems like Jurassic Park the IMAX 3D experience will be the closest thing we can get to the awe and majesty of seeing real life living dinosaurs ..."

","It's so hard for me to put up a summary line that catches just how great this movie is. I actually just saw it for the first time all the way through (in 3-d) and my mind was blown. Is that supposed to happen when you first see movies, even 20 years after their initial release?<br/><br/>The story itself is told brilliantly. Steven Spielberg made this movie damn near perfect. everything falls into place just right. Dr. Alan Grant is one of the best developed characters throughout. Jeff Goldblum fits right in there, adding a M*A*S*H-like dry sense of humor which can turn the most serious moment into something funny. Then there's the kids. Yeah, they're just kids, they might be annoying at times but they support the bigger names well. You have Wayne Knight, as the park's computer guy, Dennis Nedry. Wayne's been in a couple famous roles, my personal favorite is the organ delivery driver in Rat Race. Here, he's the match that sets off the cataclysm the movie is known for. And he does it well.<br/><br/>My favorite guy throughout the whole thing, was Richard Attenborough's character, John Hammond. While my favorite Attenborough role was ""Big X"" Roger Bartlett from ""The Great Escape"" Here he's almost the same guy. He's a big dreamer who tends to not think about the price of his creation. In the great escape, he doesn't want to think the 250 lives he's risking in order to save possibly thousands is too big a price. In Jurassic Park, he doesn't want to think that the dinosaurs are going to pose a risk, even the ones that are apex predators. To put it bluntly, his character concentrates so much on one aspect, he takes the other aspects for granted.<br/><br/>Now, to the movie. As I said before, it's told very well. I'm going to try and not spoil it entirely, but there are some points i'll mention.<br/><br/>The movie's skeleton is made up of respect for the dinosaurs. one of film's first moments is a boy mocking a dinosaur's appearance, when Dr. Alan grant decides to let him know just how scary a velociraptor really is, with very ogrish detail. by the end of the movie, if you still think dinosaurs are a joke, then something's definitely wrong with you.<br/><br/>One scene that really stood out for me, was the cow scene. It's a harbinger of events to come, and even though you don't see what goes on beneath the bush, you hear it and when it's all over, you get a look at the aftermath, and it leaves you thinking ""Thank god that was not me."" To add flavor to it, Hammond doesn't seem phased at all by the horror that goes on. as far as he's concerned, it's just nature the way God intended.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say any more about it, I highly recommend you take the time to see it, it's definitely worth watching.<br/><br/>10/10"

","(Reviewed on the basis of watching on video 20 years after release)<br/><br/>Plot: John Hammond, a business tycoon has established a biosphere reserve named 'Jurassic Park' which breeds and preserves living dinosaurs reproduced from fossilized mosquito DNA. Hammond invites three experts on tour of his amusement park where his two grandchildren also join them. Meanwhile, one of his security experts betrays him by stealing the embryos of all species for which he shuts downs all security including the perimeter fences. As a result, the animals get loose and they soon wreak havoc on the whole island.<br/><br/>Review: Normally in these articles I analyze films from a critic's point of view penalizing them for any minor flaw as if I myself would have done a better job than that. But considering my very limited knowledge of Hollywood history, I am in no position to critically comment on any offerings from the greatest film-industry in the world. And in the case of a film like Jurassic Park, I can only offer the wide-eyed overwhelm of a blind-admirer who continues to be spellbound by these incredible franchise right from his childhood.<br/><br/>When I first landed the VCD 10 years back, I could hardly understand the dialogues spoken in hard American English. There were subtitles; but which kid has the patience to follow them? I didn't and I didn't need to. The visual extravaganza stimulated such amounts of thrill, terror, joy and sorrow; it cast an ineradicable web over my imagination without my understanding a single word! I did memorize some dialogues and developed a general idea of the whole story upon numerous repeat viewings; although some details still eluded me. As a result after many years when I again sat down to revisit it; I was determined to follow the subtitles as my understanding of American English hasn't improved much. After all I am a freelance critic now and can't afford to rate a film without understanding its story. So after I diligently tracked the subtitles (through quite a few pauses and rewinds); imagine my excitement when I ended up watching a film far-removed and improved from the impression of the childhood spectacle which had been preserved in my consciousness till then!<br/><br/>Every dialogue seemed to convey a whole lot of information which stands testimony to the fluency and intellectualism of Hollywood film-making. Surprisingly, I found the dialogues filled with humor and irony even in the gravest of situations which is impressive. I understood the details of the dinosaur breeding, the embryo-theft plan, security functioning of the whole park and the characteristics of the various species (especially the striking ones of the velociraptors) which hitherto were unknown to me. But the funniest thing was the catchphrase of Mr. Hammond: 'spared no expense'; which I wonder how I had missed before. Overall, the script presented itself to be as one of the most complex I have ever seen and hardly any less impressive than the computer- generated special effects (the discussions were as engrossing as the thrills). And we Indians believe who needs a script when we can have the VFX!<br/><br/>But it would be unjustified to say, it was only the plot which bowled me over this time. All the sequences featuring those amazing and terrifying beasts still zapped me just like they did some years ago. The scene where Ellie, Grant and Malcolm see a brachiosaurus for the first time, jumping to bite a branch and then falling with a thud; was and remains my favorite scene from the movie. The other favorites include the scene where Tim sees the ripples on glasses of water indicating the arrival of the T-Rex. When the T-Rex breaks free amidst the lashing rains, it provides one of the greatest moments of cinematic terror. Along with it, the-car-rolling-down-the-tree sequence and the shadow of a raptor behind the dining table are moments which create a deep impression. Also the climax, where the T-Rex demolishes the main building, has a metaphorical significance.<br/><br/>I had become an instant fan of Sam Neill after watching him first time and he continues to look equally dashing especially in his hat and goggles. Sam perfectly portrays Allan Grant who becomes the embodiment of protection in evil terrains. As Hammond rightly mentioned, ""Who better to guide them through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?"" How a man who detests kids gradually gets intimately involved with a couple of them is a heartwarming sub-plot. Along with this, he also experiences the joy of verifying his theory that birds are the descendants of dinosaurs and also the realization of the obsolescence of his profession in the current scenario. Plus who can forget Grant's expression on watching the brachiosaurus for the first time!<br/><br/>Richard Attenborough, whom Indians know as the maker of 'Gandhi',plays the founder John Hammond. From a boastful personality hiding his inner insecurities to a crumbling old man who sees his dream shattered; Attenborough is able to draw the viewer's sympathy despite his mistakes. Laura Dern portrays a courageous woman while Jeff Goldblum is quite funny with his dialogue delivery. It was really sad to see the valiant Robert, played by Bob Peck, meet his end; but that shows how dangerous these creatures are.<br/><br/>Based on the famous Michael Crichton novel of the same name, the film conveys a message against interfering with nature. One must duff his hat to the maestro Steven Spielberg for providing us an experience as to what might happen if dinosaurs and humans, separated by 65 million years of evolution, were to come together. But being an Indian we are habituated to 3-hour entertainers; hence a running-time of 127 minutes is just a little inadequate. For this reason alone I can only give it 9.5/10. Lastly, the dinosaurs were supposed to die if they weren't artificially provided with Lysine. But as we will know, that won't happen. Why? Maybe The Lost World has the answer. Can't wait to revisit that one now!"

","Saw this in 3D and while the 3D is mostly good, the movie itself is what holds up. No new CGI that I noticed. But good plot and film making hold up in the theater forever. <br/><br/>I was reminded just how great Richard Attenborough is in the movie. His acting is charming, poignant and luminous. It's a shame his performance is so over shadowed by the dinosaurs and story. You wish there was a prequel for his character to really dominate.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I remember how little I miss Jeff Goldblum on screen as well. If he weren't in the sequel, they could have used the new release to have him savagely eaten.<br/><br/>Great fun and something parents and their kids will enjoy equally. A popcorn masterpiece."

","Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park is his best original film, and by original I mean not a sequel, since Raiders of the Lost Ark. And what a film it is, and it takes a director like Spielberg to make this more than an animals gone bad special effects film, but adds in the human characters that make it exciting. When it comes to C.G.I., these effects, though primitive, are some of the most effective and well done I've seen even to this day. And do you know why? Because the dinosaurs are, in the story, almost computer generated themselves. Therefore, it's appropriate that they seem a little fake, because after all, they are not real, real dinosaurs. I must say, the human characters, played by Sam Niell, Laura Dern, Richard Attenborough and so on, are good, with the best being the almost childish at times Jeff Goldblum, who of course came back for the sequel, and it's fun to have some humans to identify with along with the mindless, yet tremendous special effects."

","After first watching this movie when I was about five years old, I couldn't help but watching this movie over and over again throughout my childhood and even still to this day, I love this movie. It is in my top five of all time. <br/><br/>From the Brachiosaurus taking a bite out of the trees, to the T-Rex's pupil dilating when it is shined on by a light, and Tim and Lex being hunted by Raptors in the kitchen. Never before has anyone seen a film this thrilling and terrifying, yet beautiful and majestic. Spielberg did a wonderful job directing this film and really keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>This movie is very original and the special and sound effects are amazing, especially for 1993. The Raptor and T-Rex's roar gave me chills when I first heard them. The acting is also terrific, Ian Malcolm is my favorite despite his negativity and cynical views, Jeff Goldblum does a great job playing his character. I also liked that this movie was not just about people eating getting eaten by dinosaurs. The main theme was more about how humans should not interfere with nature and cannot control it as said by Dr. Malcolm, ""Life uh...finds a way"". <br/><br/>The dinosaurs themselves are not actually in the movie for that long but I think that is better because it makes the scenes they are in more suspenseful along with Spielberg's unique camera shots. John William's music is also great, I will forever remember the main theme song.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a must see for everyone of all ages. I think that everyone needs to see this movie at least once. Like I said before, it is one of my favorites of all time and I will always love this movie."

","Jurassic Park showcases the brilliance of the novel, but with that extra factor which is the Steven Spielberg's touch. The effects steal the show and hook one on from the first moment Grant (Sam Neil) and Sattler (Laura Dern)see a towering Brachiosaurus to the final few moments when a Tyrannosaurus attacks Velociraptors allowing Grant, Sattler, and the kids to escape.<br/><br/>The acting at times does disappoint at times,but ever so slightly and some of the story's depth was lost to suit a larger audience however in the end all the faults are overshadowed in my opinion. The effects still bode well today, and the movie lives on as an amazing cinematic feat."

I could not get enough of that movie. My brother and sister watched it with me most of the nights, but was never as faithful as I was to Spielberg's great masterpiece. I still watch it. Spielberg has obviously done something so wonderful that although the suspense subsides after the first few viewings, the film was such an experience that I can still to this day remember how I felt during my first screening. In that cheap theater in the small town sitting next to my dad and best friend, watching in terror as the T-Rex slowly rose out of the trees. This film, to a ten year old, is absolutely horrifying. It was the suspense, the magic, the fact that this film (unlike any other) actually stimulates my imagination. I bought all the toys and played with them until their joints were lose. I bought all the Jurassic Park memorabilia. And to this day, that film still incites my magic in my heart.

I'm sitting in the theater waiting for the movie to start and I'm thinking about the preview I partially and thinking, yeah, I can go for a comedy. Little did I know.  Once the movie went black and the trailers ended, I heard this loud THUMP! The music of the movie had begun and it sent a chill up my spine and I said to myself, I have the feeling this isn't going to be a funny movie.  And I was right.<br/><br/>This was a good movie.  I wasn't prepared for the technological piece of work I was about to feast upon.  I really enjoyed the action scenes and the part at the end where they are trying to escape from the velociraptors was great and intense making me wonder how were they going to get out, although if that was me I would be packing multiple guns and ammunition.  I would have looked like Issac Hayes from I'M GONNA GET YOU SUCKA, during the scene where they are getting ready to take down Mister Big and he has all those weapons strapped to his body.<br/><br/>Anyway back to the Jurassic.  The movie was so great, that this was the first movie that I saw more than four times, seeing it a total of eight times which back then was a lot for me since I didn't have my own car at the time.  The record being beaten in recent times by the movie TOMORROW NEVER DIES (9) and THE X-FILES: FIGHT THE FUTURE (10).<br/><br/>After seeing the movie, I decided to read the book.  And I'll say this much, if I had read the book before, I would have been upset about the fact that the old man didn't die because I really hated him, but outside of that, I think I wouldn't have minded to much with the obvious changes except for the fact that I really liked Muldoon and didn't want to see him die.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a good movie and I recommend watching this any day of the week you want to watch something with excitement and dinosaurs."

It sadly strayed far from the fine novel it was based on. Good actors were on hand but were only there as furnishings for the Spielberg special effects.

I know that people are still (as they were back then) impressed by the visuals, which might have faded a bit since then, but still are decent. But the movie itself or the story it ""tries"" to tell is seriously flawed.<br/><br/>But there is enough special effects moments and moments of suspense to cover anything up. Didn't work for me though, because I wanted and needed something more than just ""Dinosaurs for the first time feel like they could exist"" (read be in a movie and feel real). Again good job with that, but lacks in many other things (that's my humble opinion). So if you can't be swayed off your feet by the idea itself and start questioning the characters and their ability to think in general, you still might be swayed by some of the actors.

","You know what? I recently wondered if I had actually seen Jurassic Park. I vaguely remembered I had done it some years back but couldn't be sure the couple of images in my memory arrived there while watching it or because images of JP have been so ubiquitous since.<br/><br/>I decided to watch it and it really felt like I had never seen it... and I understand why: it is so much of a marketing product and so little of a real movie with interesting characters, elaborate plot and timing. Well I watched it anyway and it turned out that I had already seen it since I previously had given it 4 stars on IMDb.<br/><br/>I admit I have never seen it on the big screen. Not in 1993, neither when it was reissued in 3D (I seen dead species, but not 3D... like 40% of the people). I never bought the hype because I was never interested in dinosaurs, so that makes me a blank viewer who can tell the true quality of the movie. And quite frankly it is the worst Spielberg movie I have watched (I skipped Always, and couldn't sit through Hook). Actually I don't know where it takes a talented director to shoot this. Maybe in pre-production for the artistic and ground-breaking technical choices. But that is mostly a producing job. The story itself is weak (I haven't read the book but feel it's always a bad idea to let the writer chose what to keep or not i the script) and action feels disjointed as we cut to various places that end up feeling more like the shooting sets they are than like parts of the fantastic island we are shown during the outstanding helicopter trip.<br/><br/>Why wasn't I more impressed by the CGI + animatronics? Maybe because I didn't run to watch it back in 1993 and 10 years later this was just commonplace SFX. And again the still pictures from the movie had been so publicised that I knew exactly what to expect.<br/><br/>So I will maintain my 4/10 rating because of the technical work in it, but it really is a poor movie. Spielberg did an excellent job with poor SFX in Jaws, here he does an excellent job at getting the right amount and quality of SFX but forgets the job he dreamt of when he had his first Super-8 camera. He even soften the evil Dr Hammond who is mostly like him: he initially has a passion for what he does and wants to do good but gets overwhelmed by the business stakes and the fact that most people around him are sycophants blurting how good he is."

The special effects are OK but nothing to get excited about. Especially the dinosaurs...and that's bad because this is a film about dinosaurs. If the dinos aren't real, the film won't seem real. They just don't look that real. They somehow look and act mechanical. I thought the acting was pretty good throughout, but certainly nothing to write home about. Overall, I was very disappointed with what I saw vs what I was expecting. I just don't see what all the fuss was about."

","""Jurassic Park"" tells the story of an eccentric millionaire, who pays dns-specialists to awake long extinquished dinosaurs to life. Unfortunately, through a scheme of one of his workers, the security measures fail and everything starts to slip out of control.<br/><br/>I am really not a huge fan of catastrophe movies, especially when they evolve large creatures, because more often than not they are built up similarly. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised to see the film touch a lot of moral questions in the first half and rather discuss the topic on a theoretical basis. Unfortunately, the second half then meets the average catastrophe quite precisely, showing mainly characters hunted by dinosaurs, fighting for their lives in rushing and colorful pictures. This might be an unpopular opinion but I would have liked to remain on a more thoughtful basis rather than displaying a lot of action.<br/><br/>All in all this is surely a well-produced and carried out movie that a lot of people will like. My problems with the film are more questions of taste and therefore I recommend you to give the film a fair chance, in some points it was way better than I expected."
"Lechuguilla","6","2","5","19 December 2014"," Pop-Culture Friendly
","Leave it to Spielberg to trivialize such a profound topic. The big draw is the dinosaurs. Yet they appear in only about 15 minutes of the film's 120-minute plot. Mostly what we have here are banal humans, and even an obnoxious character named Dennis (Wayne Knight), engaged in trite conversations, and exposition contrived to bring viewers up to speed. At the film's worst, viewers and the two lead ""scientists"" are treated to what is literally a cartoon on the relationship between mosquitoes and dinosaur DNA. The film talks down to its audience.<br/><br/>And there is no intrinsic need for those two kids. They are added to draw in viewers from across all age ranges. ""Jurassic Park"" is a popcorn flick that's pop-culture friendly. At least it's not as bad as Spielberg's ""Jaws"", a kiddie movie lacking in thematic depth.<br/><br/>The only character in ""Jurassic Park"" that acts like an adult is Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). He conveys a skeptical view of the intent of the Park's creator, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), when Malcolm says ... ""Gee, the lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here, staggers me"". He further critiques Hammond: ""You packaged (your discovery), slapped it on a plastic lunch-box and now you're selling it ... What you call discovery, I call the rape of the natural world"". So there is a bit of depth to the film, if only in passing.<br/><br/>By far the best element is the visual effects, truly spectacular. The dinosaurs look realistic and believable. These visuals are enhanced by sound effects accompanied by a subtle echo. Which, when combined with the rain forest background, create a faraway feel, consistent with the historical remoteness of the Mesozoic era in which the dinosaurs lived.<br/><br/>Casting is acceptable. Acting trends a bit overblown. Production and art design are almost as good as the special effects. But I did not like the overbearing and manipulative background music.<br/><br/>With a huge budget and a famous director, this Hollywood blockbuster aims at a mass audience. Though the visual effects are spectacular, the script gives us a childish story, with childish characters, that I find mildly insulting to the study of such a fascinatingly alien era in Earth's history."
"MovieCrusher","6","2","5","17 July 2013"," A movie ahead of its time, but too much clichÃ©s
","I watched this film again, 10 years after its launch, and I must admit it turned out to be not boring, but annoying instead.<br/><br/>Ill skip the CGI achievements of the film, as they were already fairly commented here on IMDb, and on my opinion they are quite ahead of its time.<br/><br/>The idea of the film is very good and original, and also got some credible scientific reasoning to explain it (although not true, it is a plausible explanation to get DNA from a mosquito trapped by amber).<br/><br/>Iam Malcom is clearly my favourite character, although I can see an explanation on why would a chaos-theorist be there.. <br/><br/>However, here is the list of what really annoyed me:<br/><br/><ul><li>The amount of highly predictable scenes.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The lack of adequate caution on things that even with regular wild animals is done much more safely, such as the first velociraptor scene, when some men are about to transfer a raptor out of a cage, which is neither properly attached to the outer fence, neither has an electric door.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The irritating hysteric girl (sorry, I had to mention it), which not only was completely misinformed about dinosaurs (despite being a self-proclaimed hacker) and insisted on using words such as veggie-saur, instead of herbivore and carnivore.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The complete lack of common-sense shown by some characters, such as their cumbersome ability to get out of the trail, and split themselves.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The fact that although a big storm was about to reach the island, the tour was not interrupted, even when the safety of the passengers (not only Hammond's grandchildren, but the ingen's inspector as well) could be on risk.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The cars are constraint to a rail, although they run on batteries, which run out. It would be more plausible to just make the rail electrified. If the writer wanted the cars to stop throughout the story, just damage such rail or cut the power (as happened).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When the four main characters are trapped, and are required to electrically seal a door which is being rammed by a raptor, there are two major flaws. First, there is no switch on the door, as would be expected, and secondly, when the girl gets on the computer, she still had to search how to lock the door, when she could just ask Sattler, which was ""busy"" pushing exactly on the least effective part of the door.. And after her brilliant quote ""Oh, its an UNIX system!"", we are presented by a security interface looking like a flight simulator - why not use the more geek-looking, ""advanced"" and typically used command-line interface commonly used throughout the film? And BTW, the way she grabs the mouse is absolutely delightful.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The main characters are too-obviously protected by an invisible force-field...</li></ul><br/><br/>In a general viewpoint, I think it is a nice family/kids film, but highly unrecommended film for an older (and more critic) audience, as it will surely trigger some ""LOL, what is he doing??!!"", ""don't go there!"" and ""omg...not even a scratch!"" exclamations."

(The grand scene of the grazing dinosaurs that blew me away in 1993 no longer seemed so thrilling. We've seen cinematographers do so much more since then.

","Steven Spielberg's ""Jurassic Park"" is a true movie milestone, presenting awe- and fear- inspiring sights never before seen on the screen. The more spectacular of these involve the fierce, life-like dinosaurs that stalk through the film with astounding ease. Much scarier, however, are those aspects of ""Jurassic Park"" that establish it as the overnight flagship of a brand-new entertainment empire. Even while capturing the imagination of its audience, this film lays the groundwork for the theme-park rides, sequels, and souvenirs that insure the ""Jurassic Park"" experience will live on. And on. And on. This is a fairground ride of a movie, and as such it's one of the best. Suspense and technical wizardry are the only reason to watch ""Jurassic Park."" Screenwriter Michael Crichton, adapting his popular novel with David Koepp, slashes almost everything that made the book an entertaining read.<br/><br/>Amazingly graceful and convincing, they set a sky-high new standard for computer- generated special effects. But thoughts about how those effects were achieved aren't likely to surface while the film is under way. The most important thing about the dinosaurs of ""Jurassic Park"" is that they create a triumphant illusion. You will believe you have spent time in a dino-filled world. ""Jurassic Park"" keeps its viewers on edge while leaving much of its real violence to the imagination. When it's dinosaur feeding time, Mr. Spielberg avoids obvious gore; he gets a greater thrill out of showing farm animals that are left near the hungry beasts and suddenly disappear. Ultimately, the stars of the movie are the dinosaurs, and they still impress today. Thanks to another industrial source of make-believe, Steven Spielberg and the dinosaurs will scare you to debt, as you shell out ticket money for the kids, as they demand a second viewing."

","Am I the only one in the world who is disturbed by glaring continuity mistakes? And this film has two of the biggest I've ever seen. I've heard Spielberg doesn't care about continuity, and if this film is an example, then it's true. Firstly, on the helicopter trip to the island, old man Hammond is sitting with his back to the front of the helicopter. You can clearly see the water going by outside. And yet he gestures in front of him ""and there it is"" or whatever he says, but he's pointing in front of himself. No. Wrong. The island should be BEHIND him. Secondly, and this is just stupid. When we first see the T-Rex enclosure, the cars are on the same level as the enclosure. They are clearly looking straight across at it. Later when T-Rex escapes, he/she walks straight across to the cars from the enclosure, so far so good but...When T-Rex knocks the car off the edge of the road...WHAT EDGE OF THE ROAD?! Was there a landslide that wasn't shown? Did one half of the island sink thirty metres? This is ridiculous, and totally unnecessary. A dinosaur attack would be exciting enough, one would imagine, without being knocked off the edge of a cliff (or whatever it is) that doesn't exist. Also, with the exception of Bob Peck, all the actors are really phoning this one in. I mean come on."

","Jurassic Park doesn't hold up against the test of time. Looking back at the plot you realize there barely is one. The movie establishes a good premise early on, but it doesn't succeed in exploring the possibilities that come along with it. The movie is really just a vehicle for the idea behind it instead of having a plot that succeeds in reaching all opportunities that the premise allows. A great example of a movie that does this is The Truman Show. It was very original from the start and had a plot that helped its premise stretch its legs. Jurassic Park's creators' only objective was to make money off of the world they set up around the movie. Second after that in their mind was to make a good movie. Hey, at least the special effects were good (for the time)."
"wmweibel","4","4","15","20 May 2002"," A lot to endure to see dinosaurs
","I first saw this movie in 1993 for one simple reason: DINOSAURS!  15 minutes into the film, I stood with Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), craning my neck upwards to stare in awe at a 40-foot tall Brachiosaurus pulling leaves off the tops of eucalyptus trees.  For it's time, the special effects were astounding, and still are today.  But more important, they did their job, they left me feeling as though i had truly walked among dinosaurs.  I had seen them presented not as bizarre monsters, but simply as animals, as part of nature. I left the theater largely satisfied.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this movie fares much worse upon second viewing.  All the trademark Spielberg cliche's are brought out in full force: shafts of light penetrating smoke and mist; painful sequences of expository dialog, such as Dr. Grant's encounter with an obnoxious kid at a Dinosaur Dig in Montana; long, slow zoom-in shots of dumbstruck actors with astonished looks on their faces; overwrought action scenes in with even the suspense becomes tedious. The dialog is not even entertainingly campy, it's just plain awful.  In 1993 in a dark theater, the thrill of seeing a few minutes of these marvelous dinosaurs roaming the countryside vastly outweighed such annoyances. Chancing upon a viewing in a video store, or renting it for my son, the annoyances become just too distracting.<br/><br/>John William's score is, as usual, tremendous.  The signature tune captures the sense of awe and majesty in gazing upon an animal that has not walked the earth for over 100 million years.  Of the cast, Richard Attenborough, Wayne Knight and Sam Jackson are the most satisfying.  I recommend this movie only if, like me, you just really really want to see dinosaurs. (4/10)"
"fjhuerta-2","5","3","10","31 July 2000"," Nice dinos, but what about the people?
","After watching Disney's ""Dinosaur"", I simply had to come back and watch this movie to see why I had liked it more in the first place.<br/><br/>Well, it might have been because Jurassic Park is, unabashedly, a grown-up film, while Dinosaur walks the thin line between a kiddie flick and an all-out adult assault on the senses. And I couldn't stop noticing the fact that 7 years of advance in CGI haven't been all that wonderful. I still somehow think that JP's creatures are more realistic than Dinosaurs'. Maybe the fact that the Disney flick had to make the creatures talk and have facial expressions were the reasons I give the nod to JP's beastly creatures any day, any time.<br/><br/>But then, I focused on the characters. Excluding Ian Malcolm and John Hammond (Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough), I reached the conclusion that I hated the rest of the cast almost as much as I hated Jar Jar Binks (and that's saying I really hated them). The best example I can think of is the one where the child is playing with the computer saying she is a computer wiz. Or when Laura Dern and Sam Neill stare in desbelief at the first dinosaur in the movie. One can see in their eyes they are trying to be impressed by something they are trying to visualize, without much success. Talk about bad acting!<br/><br/>I guess the day when someone decides to make an epic with CGI dinosaurs *without* facial expressions and voice, and where no humans are present, that will be the day a dino-flick will earn my ""10"" rating. As it is, JP earns a solid 8 on the basis of acting from the dinos."

","There's a thing about films that are based excessively on special effects: they age quickly as the technology of special effects progresses. That's how it is with ""Jurassic Park"", which made a sensation when it came out because of the special effects, but the same special-effects look painfully ordinary now.<br/><br/>So, putting the effects aside, as a film this is pretty bad. In the first hour pretty much nothing happens, while the second hour is a series of chases (which get boring by the end). In the meantime the message is: god was wise to extinguish the dinosaurs, so how dare you bring them back? Which is the eternal paradox religion-believers find themselves in all the time. Because if god's axiom is the survival of the fittest, then moralistic values have no place in such an axiom."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","6","30 May 2017"," The defining dinosaur movie, a good but not great watch
","""Jurassic Park"" is an American 2-hour movie from 1993, so this one will have its 25th anniversary next year. The director is of course Steven Spielberg and with this effort he returned to animal scare films, even if this one is certainly not as much on the horror level as ""Jaws"". The writer is David Koepp, who even if still without an Oscar nomination as of today worked on really many prestigious projects over the years. He was only 30 when this one here came out. And the cast includes several familiar faces too. Lead actor Sam Neill is probably the kind of actor where you recognize the face immediately, but perhaps not the name. Samuel L. Jackson and Jeff Goldblum (would have preferred more screen time for both as I like them quite a lot) on the other hand are really famous these days still and the young Laura Dern just had her first Oscar nomination back then and a second followed fairly recently. And then there are the late Attenborough and Peck as well as BD Wong who is also another familiar face.<br/><br/>The story here is about what happens when a group of scientists go visit a theme park and find out that the old scientist working there actually managed to breed real dinosaurs from frog DNA and it is a revolutionary achievement of course. But things go wrong fairly quickly when they realize that next to the peaceful vegetarian dinos, there are also brutal carnivores and this means not just small raptors, but even big versions of the most known dinosaur in history, the infamous Tyrannosaurus Rex. The fact that the scientists also brought their children grants for some great scare scenes overall. I think that this film here is not really about great acting, even if the cast does a solid job with the material they are given. It is all about the scenario of actual dinosaurs living in our world. Fittingly, the movie took home no less than three Oscars and these 3 wins out of 3 nominations are a formidable achievement that really is a rarity in filmmaking (if we ignore Lord of the Rings for example). These wins were all technical categories. And the film's success, not just with awards bodies, also resulted in several sequels being produced and Chris Pratt also took over in a relatively recent movie based on the work by the original writer Michael Crichton (rip) who also worked with Koepp on the screenplay here for the 1993 film. And I guess you could say that they did a pretty decent job as scenes like the shaking water or the dino hatching the egg are still very well-known today, such a long time after this film came out. And so did Spielberg. I would not necessarily agree with IMDb voters though that this is one of the best 250 films ever made. But it sure makes for a good watch. I give ""Jurassic Park"" a thumbs-up, also because it never drags despite its fairly massive runtime. Go see it if you are among the very few who haven't already."

Its human reactions as interpreted by Muppets, instead of natural reactions of wild animals. So the horror factor is all the more diminished for it. Could you imagine ""Jaws"" giving looks like that? ""Jaws"" wouldn't work!<br/><br/>How quickly and efficiently the raptors learn to find their way around and use hi-tech kitchen doors and handles is also unlikely and ludicrous. They're not apes for crying out loud!<br/><br/>I never saw any of this when I watched the film at the theater with our kids in 1993, and we had the time of our lives.

"david_rudy_lee","10","1","2","2 July 2019"," One of the Best Films of the 90's
","Now this was a film that was one of my favorites growing up. I can remember that my aunt and cousin took me to see this one when it was in the theaters and it sparked my love for dinosaurs. I've probably seen it a handful of times since then and it was one that I could just pop into whenever it was on television. The synopsis is during a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.<br/><br/>We start by seeing a large trailer being moved toward a wall and gate. We see Muldoon (Bob Peck) who is in charge. We know there's something inside the trailer that is dangerous. It is screeching and a man on top falls off when its pushed back from the wall. He is pulled inside the gate while Mulddon tries in vein to save him..<br/><br/>We then shift to the Amazon, where we see a man in a suit is floating up to land on a raft. The man is Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) represents the investors for something and he was expecting to speak the man in charge. He climbs off and walks with Rostagno (Miguel Sandoval), learning that the guy he was there to see has left. In order for them to proceed with the investment, they need to have two experts sign off on its safety. Rostagno says the one they want is a digger like him and won't do it.<br/><br/>The film then shifts to a dig for dinosaur bones. The man in charge is Grant (Sam Neill) along with his girlfriend, Ellie (Laura Dern). He's one of the leading expert on dinosaurs from what I gather and she is a renowned paleobotanist as well. After Grant scared a child for mocking Velociraptors, a helicopter comes and pushes around the dirt they have shifted. This upsets the two, but they soon change their tune when they realize who it is. The man who came from the helicopter is Hammond (Richard Attenborough). The person whose been funding their dig. He asks if they come with him, he will fund them completely for three years. To which, they agree.<br/><br/>It then shifts to San Jose, Costa Rica. A guy arrives, trying to be incognito. He's called out to by Nedry (Wayne Knight). The other guy is Dodgson (Cameron Thor). Nedry is hired by the man to steal viable embryos from where he is working to help a rival company catch up in research. In return he will be paid handsomely and he's given a shaving cream canister to hide them in.<br/><br/>Grant, Ellie, Hammond and Gennaro are joined by Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) on a helicopter to an island off of Costa Rica. Malcom is a mathematician who focuses on chaos theory. He's asked to come to help give the park his blessing to open as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grant and Ellie are still a bit confused as to why they're brought to the island. It is then they realize, Hammond has brought back dinosaurs. With some of the recent mishaps, they need their opinion in order to open the park. Things don't go well from the start and an incoming tropical storm doesn't help. Nedry makes it even worse though when he shuts down systems in order to steal the embryos and make his escapes. He's not the only thing that does this and the other things are much more dangerous.<br/><br/>As I lead this off with, I remember seeing this film in the theaters as a child and it is still amazes me as an adult. The CGI and the dinosaurs look real. I normally lead off here with the story, but I think I'll switch it up and go with the effects. They are truly amazing for the time. I could tell this time when analyzing that there's some CGI, but it still holds up. It is quite amazing actually. The film is also shot beautifully which definitely helps.<br/><br/>Now unlike a lot of major blockbuster films we see today, there is a really good as well. Part of that is in part that this is based off of a novel by Michael Crichton. Him, Stephen King and John Grisham really dominated the 1990's with their books being adapted to film. The idea in theory here in Jurassic Park is great. It is actually interesting that a lot of experts were consulted in bring the dinosaurs to life and I believe due to this film, we get a lot of what we think they move, act and sound-like. Some of the great writing is thinks that Grant says early on are shown through the dinosaurs in the park which I liked.<br/><br/>There are some deeper issues in this film was though. The first of which that really stands out is the idea of 'playing God'. Malcolm is the first one to think this park is a bad idea and he is joined by Grant and Ellie as things go downhill. They're right though. They created something they think they can control. Much like what Malcolm and I also think Hammond finally sees, nature will find a way. You can't account for what Nedry does, but there is the human element there. They also think that the dinosaurs can't breed and that's where nature shows it can't be controlled.<br/><br/>Something I've seen debated quite a bit is if this film is a horror film or not. I fall into camp that you most definitely can, more so than most of the other films in the franchise. The scenes with the raptors play like a slasher film. They stalk their prey in order to kill them, especially in the kitchen sequence of this film. As for the Tyrannous Rex, this really isn't that much different from Jaws in that we have a creature that is running amuck. There's not a lot of deaths, only 5 I can think of off the top of my head, but I do know slasher films with less than that for sure. The tone doesn't come off as horror, but there are definitely some tense scenes.<br/><br/>That actually brings me to the pacing of the film, which is really good. Even though I've seen this film multiple times and knowing that it runs just over 2 hours, it doesn't feel like it. I think that a lot of it comes from the set up of out of the frying pan, into the fire aspect. Every time they get out of a situation, they get right into another one and I think that actually keeps you engaged. It definitely builds tension all the way to the climax, which I thought was good along with the ending.<br/><br/>As for the acting of the film, it is absolutely amazing. Neill I think is great in his role. What is interesting is that he is dating Ellie, who wants a more traditional family. He is resistant, but we see him interacting with Hammond's grandchildren, Tim (Joseph Mazzello) and Lex (Ariana Richards). He is actually very good with them. Dern is great as well as Ellie. My favorite scene is her impassioned speech to Hammond about how he's messed up. Goldblum is also absolutely fantastic. He brings a level of sexiness to the role and humor as well, but he points out some of the greatest lines. Attenborough, Peck, Ferrero, BD Wong, Mazzello, Richards, Samule L. Jackson, Knight and Sandoval are all solid as well and help to round out the cast of this film.<br/><br/>The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack of the film, which is also fantastic. It really brings the film to life, it fits each of the scenes and for some of the more tense ones, it really helps ramp up my anxiety. Even the sounds of the dinosaurs when they are roaring sounds definitely real and really helps to bring this film to life. This is a score I actually listen to when writing at time as well.<br/><br/>Now with that said, this film was one of my favorites growing up and it still holds up today. I can see its greatness at what director Steven Spielberg abilities here. There's a great story here that has some real depth. The pacing of the film is perfect and despite a bit longer run time, it really doesn't feel like it. The acting is great in bringing this to life and the effects are as well. There's a mix of practical and CGI, but it all looks really good. It is quite insane how well it holds up. The soundtrack of the film also fits the scenes and really enhances the film overall. This is a pretty much a perfect film to me. If you never seen it check it out for sure."

","THe idea of the way of bringing dinosaurs back from extinction is great and also of the Park, how it operates. The whole movie was actually consistently exciting concerning all what happened. So definitely entertaining. Some scenes and especially the characters were admittedly stereotyped, but Not in a negative way. The plot was obviously too minimalistic to my liking and a bit more background information would have been better. According to Dennis Nedry who accepted a bribe by an apparent competitor of John Hammond. The question is: Who was this man and what exactly were his plans? What did he want to achieve with these stolen Embryos of Dinosaurs? Me personally, I lack this in the movie."

","I recently began binge watching the Jurassic Park series. I have watched the original JP several times. Normally I love Laura Dern but she was beyond awful in this. The constant giggling and spaghetti legs and arms movements in their opening scene. The self righteous chastisement of Hammond. Tutting Hammond and the rehearsed feminist speech prior to crossing the compound. I had to fast forward through her scenes. But all in all it's a small price to pay for an otherwise great movie. But trust me after this review you'll never watch that Badlands scene the same after this. Dreadful. Ugh."

","Jurassic Park was a cornerstone of special effects and even today after 25 years the film is as good as it was on the day it released. Based on Michael Crichton's novel the synopsis goes something like this- On a small island off the coast of Costa Rica exists a most unusual animal preserve by the name of Jurassic Park. Operated by dinosaur lover John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), Jurassic Park is the first of its kind. Its population of creatures includes brachiosaurs, dilophosaurs, tricerotops, velociraptors, and a Tyrannosaurus Rex, each of which has been cloned using the latest technology that takes DNA from dinosaur-biting prehistoric insects preserved in amber, and uses that DNA for the re-creation. When the consortium funding Jurassic Park become concerned that all is not as it should be, Hammond is forced to call in three experts: paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), his partner, paleo-botanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and the brilliant-but-cynical mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). When the trio arrives at Jurassic Park, they are astonished by what it represents. It doesn't take long, however, for astonishment to turn to horror. Great film by a great director."

","In preparation for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom I have decided to go back and review the original Jurassic Park trilogy and I have started with the utter classic that is Jurassic Park and it is still truly amazing. The premise of this film sees a couple of experts travel to a theme park to find Dinosaurs that could be the next stage of evolution. The lead of this film is Sam Neil as Dr Alan Grant and he is great in this film, he is charming and charismatic in this role but he also has a really good journey throughout this film. Laura Dern plays his partner in this film and she is really good, she plays more then just your typical damsel in distress and you buy how cool her character is during the film. Though the star of this film is definitely Jeff Goldblum as Dr Ian Malcolm, he oozes charisma and has the best lines in this film to make him one of the most memorable supporting characters of all time. Richard Attenborough plays John Hammond the head of this park and you can see his true passion for this role and it goes to his character as you feel like he does when you see this park. Also a small mention that Samuel L Jackson has a small role in this film and he does a decent job. The story in this film is very simple but also full of larger themes. The first hour of the film doesn't have much action in it but I feel like it brings you into the awe of this world and sucks you into this universe. Then when the chaos unfolds you are invested in the characters and the breath-taking and suspenseful moments that make this a film you can't take your eyes off. The script has some very important drama in it that asks plenty of questions about nature vs science and it really interested me. Also the humour really works, especially when delivered by Goldblum because he has a perfect delivery. The style of the film makes this one of the most important films ever made in my opinion. These CGI Dinosaurs look amazing especially when you consider this film came out in 1993 and nothing like this had ever really been done before. Also you have to appreciate the amazing score by the incredible John Williams that transports you into this world and is one of the greatest of all time. The suspenseful scenes kept me invested even though I have seen this film before and deliver on the excitement that I require for a film like this. Overall this film is one of the best films ever made in my opinion and if you haven't seen it this is a film that must be seen."
"TheMovieDiorama","10","1","2","24 February 2018"," Jurassic Park may just be the quintessential blockbuster.
","Folks, they do not come better than this. This was the game changer. The pinnacle of entertainment for future Hollywood blockbusters. Spielberg crafted what is now one of the most quotable, memorable and revolutionary films of all time. You cannot deny the staying power that Jurassic Park has. A group of scientists are invited to an island theme park where dinosaurs have been genetically modified and cloned. A storm approaches, one employee decides to steal and in doing so shuts down the park's computer security systems. You know what that means...enter the Tyrannosaurus Rex! Everyone has pretty much seen this, there really is nothing I can add to the appeal. It's a perfectly structured narrative where the first half builds the characters (in order to prevent them from being just expendable assets) which leads to a thrilling second half where they must escape. One scene turns the film from a family adventure to a terrifying thriller, the T-Rex. It's sheer animatronic perfection. The stature, the colossal size and detailed craft creates a magnitude of awe. Quite literally blown away when it roars through your sound system, it gets me every time. The visual effects were revolutionary and would provide a bench mark for future films. The acting was solid all round, Sam Neill and Laura Dern's chemistry felt natural. Jeff Goldblum is a marvel and Richard Attenborough is Jurassic Park, wouldn't be the same without him. Spielberg's electrifying direction comes to no surprise for anyone. He is the ultimate ""event director"". Dinosaur POV shots to tracking shots outside the jeeps He really does know how to conjure up a magical adventure, always has done. Bear in mind this is a PG, some of the scenes actually scarred me as a child. The T-Rex casually devouring a lawyer and the velociraptor grotesquely ravaging an innocent. Some would say Jurassic Park is the definitive blockbuster, to which I agree. Jurassic Park...""Welcome, to the perfect rating club""! Queue John Williams' amazing score (that theme tune is perfection)..."
"zaremskya-23761","9","1","2","23 October 2017"," Dinosaurs done the right way
","There have been a few big dinosaur movies over the years but anyone will remember this one first and for a long time. Spielberg really takes you for a ride with this one, and the animals look very real and very dangerous. It's deep, intriguing, and ultimately a classic blockbuster sci fi experience.<br/><br/>The premise is that a man creates an island of cloned dinosaurs as an amusement park. Things go awry however thanks to the weakness of human corruption and bad safety fence maintenance. The dinosaurs, as you may guess, are pitted against the visitors in a harrowing struggle for survival. People are killed, dinosaurs are killed, the whole mess becomes an amazing cinematic adventure.<br/><br/>The scale of the film is vast, reflecting the immense nature of the animals and scope of the park creator's vision. The characters are believable, and their intense experience is played well by the actors. The special effects are spectacular, and still hold up to this day. The action is harrowing and gives Spielberg more notches to add to his directing belt.<br/><br/>This film lives up to its expectations and then some. It is an epic sci fi adventure that puts you right in the middle of the action and creates an amazing and terrifying world. Perhaps bringing dinosaurs back to life is not the best idea in the world, and this realization quickly dawns on the characters, but it does make for some incredible cinema."

Along the way, they find themselves in somewhat of a pickle as they discover that humans and dinosaurs most certainly don't mix together.<br/><br/>The visuals are amazing. The dinosaurs are animated so well that at times, it's rather difficult to make out what is supposed to be computer generated and what is supposed to be an animatronic. The scenery is gorgeous. Looking at all of the diverse plant life and animal life is such a fascinating experience, I have to give tons of credit to the people who put the scenery together. One day, I'd love to visit the island and meet all the dinosaurs. Oh wait, this is fictional. I almost forgot because of how well the movie is put together!<br/><br/>The story is intense and exciting. There are many fast paced scenes that have been terrifically put together. There's lots of running from the dinosaurs, and there's lots of falling and hiding too. There are also many scenes where people are thought to be dead, particularly Tim. But fortunately for all of us, the protagonists manage to survive. What also makes this movie great is the proper use of light moments. They have jokes, puns, punchlines all put in during the more quiet moments and even during the intense scenes to keep our attention and keep us exhilarated for what would happen next. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg, you do an amazing job.

"Screen_Blitz","9","1","2","28 April 2017"," An astonishing science-fiction adventure set with landmark special effects marks one of Steven Spielberg's finest works
","Over the many years in his directorial career, Steven Spielberg has proved he is more than capable of collaborating with nearly every genre in the cinematic roster. This science-fiction adventure based on Michael Crichton's novel exhibits the absorbing talent of the influential filmmaker. In short words, this film is an eye-catcher in both its story and state-of-the-art special effects. Clashing together the prehistoric age with the present, this movie drops its character in the blistering heat of a battle against dinosaurs, who are polished with one of the most eye-popping computer-generated imagery ever put to screen; effects that still hold up to this day. But whether or not the film is faithful to Crichton's source material is not wired to my knowledge. It is terrifying adventure, but is one that manages to bring on the thrills and tension that make it a wild ride for the whole family. That is if the children can handle the immense scare factor of the giant dinosaurs causing mayhem. This movie stars Richard Attenborough as John Hammond, a biologist who opens up wild attraction on a remote island known as Jurassic Park where dinosaurs are brought to life by genetic engineering. Coming along for the ride is writer Grant (played by Sam Neill), his partner Ellie (played by Laura Dern), animal biologist Dr. Ian Malcolm (played by Jeff Goldblum), and Hammond's grandchildren Timmy (played by Joseph Mazello) and Lex (played by Ariana Richards). When the tour around the park goes awry and dinosaurs become hostile, the group along with several other tourists are pitted in a terrifying fight for survival.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg left a cinematic landmark on summer blockbusters with his film 'Jaws', a movie that left many terrified of going back into the water. Here marks another creature feature where the main villains of the story are prehistoric monsters who pick off humans one by one. And with hair-raising suspense and jaw-dropping visual imagery, Steven Spielberg showcases the characters' fierce vulnerability in a thoroughly effective manner. There are some truly scary moments sprinkled throughout the second half, some characters meet their ends in dinosaurs' bellies and children are in deep danger. For instance, the scene featuring the dinosaur's big eyes are peering through the windows of the truck where the young children are crammed, ready to make a meal out of them is a spine- chiller. But Spielberg effectively illustrates these moments in an effective fashion without veering into the horror territory. One of the absorbing aspects of these sequences is captured through astonishing computer-generated effects that bless the giant monsters including the velociraptors and tyrannosaurus rexes with a realistic feel. And visual effects wizard Stan Winston who did the effects for James Cameron's 'Aliens' is to thank for this. As for the performances, everyone does quite a solid job. Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are both equally charismatic as is Richard Attenborough in his role. Laura Dern and the young child actors make good use of their roles as well. If there is anything missing, it may be proper character development. But it just shortcoming that plenty of viewers can almost easily skim over. <br/><br/>Jurassic Park is a fun-filled science-fiction adventure operated the hands of Steven Spielberg. It is scary, but it is also exciting to the point of leaving viewers alternating between cheering and leaning at the edge of their seats. Although there is no doubt that some children of the single-digit age crowd will find themselves scared, this still makes for a fine family-oriented entertainment."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","2","19 April 2017"," ""Jurassic Park's"" great feat is crossing from 'movie' into 'visual cinematic experience'
","The movie that heralded the coming of the digital era, ""Jurassic Park"" changed blockbuster filmmaking, a phrase that had been said many times before, unsurprisingly, about films directed and/or produced by Steven Spielberg in the '70s and '80s.<br/><br/>""Jurassic Park"" was the perfect film for Spielberg to make: The fear and man-eating creatures of ""Jaws;"" the adventure, history and science of the ""Indiana Jones"" movies; and the family-friendly fun and wonder of ""E.T."" The fodder of Michael Crichton's novel, which he helped adapt for the screen with David Koepp, had the broad appeal studios can only dream of, and few directs had made such broadly appealing films as Spielberg.<br/><br/>The film's computer-generated imaging (CGI) holds up surprisingly well nearly 25 years later, but perhaps that credit belongs more to the story and to Spielberg, who knows how to put viewers into a big- screen moment. The first scene with the tyrannosaurus rex and the characters stuck in the 4x4s is still one of the best blockbuster movie scenes ever committed to film. The sense of danger is palpable and Spielberg draws it out with pure mastery from the water rippling in the cup down to the characters' narrow escape. If the dino had been entirely animatronic, it still would've worked; the CGI made it all the more believable.<br/><br/>Spielberg also knows how to create a sense of wonder, punctuated by his many collaborations with theme-driven composer John Williams. The way the movie fills you with childlike awe at what it would be like to see a real-life dinosaur and then pivots into monster horror is nothing short of remarkable. It's hard to accomplish one or the other, and rare to do both with seamless aplomb. <br/><br/>""Jurassic Park"" doesn't have the best characters. Even Sir Richard Attenborough in a rare on-camera appearance as park creator John Hammond is missing a degree of complexity despite the opportunity of portraying a hybrid of Walt Disney and Victor Frankenstein. Mostly, these characters are stand-ins for us. It's not a movie about their stories or who they are, but about their experience in the park, their reactions and emotions. Rarely is that enough to carry a film, but it does.<br/><br/>The truth is that ""Jurassic Park"" transcends traditional notions of film and enters the realm of experiential cinema, something in between a movie and a theme park ride, which is fitting for a movie about a theme park. James Cameron is the only other director capable of making these kinds of movies, and it's no surprise he tried to get the rights. All this to say, transplanting audiences into visual theme park ride of a movie isn't easy and is part of what makes ""Jurassic Park"" so entertaining and timeless. Even some of the most outdated theme park rides are fun, and this ride isn't getting any less so. <br/><br/>Despite the countless films that have bombarded audiences with CGI (including 2015's ""Jurassic World""), ""Jurassic Park"" is better than most of them. Released today, it would be more of a very good film rather than a great one because the visual splendor of seeing this in 1993 was exponentially more incredible, but Spielberg's ability to create a real proximity to what's happening on screen is something a lot of movies fail at or don't even bother to do. It preserves ""Jurassic Park"" as a unique experience. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
"stevenrotherforth","10","1","2","19 March 2017"," Nothing wows us anymore like those dinosaurs did back in 93!
","Jurassic Park<br/><br/>There are certain events in life that change the world we live in. Can that be said about a movie? Yes I think it can. There has to be game changers in everything in life or we would never progress. In terms of cinema Jurassic Park certainly was a game changer. Special effects for one would never be the same again. Just as Star Wars radically changed the face of cinema in the 70's, Jurassic Park landed like the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs. The summer of 93 was overrun with Velociraptors and the sound of stomping feet. It was the first time I'd ever seen a newspaper advert encouraging me to go see a movie for a second time just so I could believe my eyes. At seventeen years old when this film was released even I was scratching my head wondering where they had managed to get a load of dinosaurs from. The SFX really are that good. Even today over twenty years on they still stand up.<br/><br/>Based on the novel written by Micheal Crichton, Jurassic Park revolves around the idea of genetically created dinosaurs that roam around a safari park on a secluded Island. The owner of the park needs it to be signed off by so called experts before he can go ahead and open it to the public. Monster mayhem ensues! From the opening credits with the escalating sound of pan pipes to the cracking of branches as a large crate is brought into view. Director Steven Spielberg has the audience hooked. There are so many amazing memories to take away from this film. Many becoming embedded in popular culture. The shaking glass of water on the dashboard being probably the most famous. All though it can be said that it's the dinosaurs that are the true stars of this picture, Spielberg did wrangle together a very impressive cast. Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum lead the way but superb support from Sir Richard Attenborough, Bob Peck and Samuel L Jackson among others all add to this movie masterpiece. I really do believe in terms of movie making this film is a masterpiece. Subsequent sequels were bound to follow but they paled in comparison. Jurassic Park was one of those films you watched with your mouth open. In awe of what was happening on screen. It's a shame now that we have come so far in terms of special effects that nothing really wows us like those dinosaurs did back in 93! Jurassic Park was a turning point in movie making in regards to SFX. A true game changer."
"badoli","9","1","2","24 February 2017"," A masterpiece by a master craftsman.
","I watched this movie back then in the cinema and now that i watch it again, i just can marvel at the craftsmanship that Steven Spielberg possesses. Anyone could have made a dinosaur movie and a lot have tried. But making the best dinosaur movie while setting new technical standards is only possible to the best.<br/><br/>The story is solid, the character arcs are well-rounded, the various concepts are portrayed sufficiently authentic and the world is believable. It's the right amount of scary, the right amount of funny and the right amount of action-loaded. Of course the dinosaurs are the real stars of the movie, but it's also great to see how the interpersonal relationships develop between the various protagonists, which validates their subsequent actions throughout the movie. When you're portraying such a surreal concept as recreating extinct species, you need the transfer a lot of information from the silver screen to the audience and the seeming ease with which Spielberg accomplishes that is just astounding. Making learning about DNA, chaos theory and paleontology in a monster action movie not boring? That's a task most directors would fail miserably. Having the perfect cast for the job helps a lot too. Watching Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough argue about the consequences of playing god is just pure movie bliss. The fact that the special effects still hold up is just the cherry on top. <br/><br/>If you haven't watched this movie, you have missed one of the most influential movies of the 90ies. Spielberg deserves every academy award he won."

","CAUTION: *May have spoilers*<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is a movie about a man's quest to play God, Hammond played by Richard Attenborough, brings back extinct species, and parades them in front of an audience for his theme park. As one could conclude, it goes terribly wrong. When the fully computerized theme park suffers a malfunction, chaos ensues. An interesting cast of characters, Grant played by Sam Neill, Ellie played by Laura Dern, and Malcolm played by Jeff Goldblum, give a convincing portrayal of frightened humans trying to escape the island where the theme park is found. <br/><br/>The subject of this film has many moral implications as well as what happens when we rely exclusively on technology. When humans play God, we often set ourselves up for crushing disappointment. There is a reason extinct species are no longer around. Another theme is about human nature. The character Nedry played by Wayne Knight is an excellent example of greed in human nature. His entire purpose in the film was to remain deceitful, conniving, and full of greed, while he stole dinosaur embryos for profit. His greed was his ultimate downfall. <br/><br/>Jurassic Park is full of CGI and special effects, but I found the sound to be the most important part of this movie. The sound is used to create anxiety when animals draw near. There are moments in the film where no dialogue is present, and the audience is left to conclude based on sound alone what might happen next. When the children, Lex and Tim played by Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello along with the greedy lawyer Gennaro played by Martin Ferrero, are stuck in an electric jeep at night when the power goes out, we have a moment of zero dialogue of those actors. We hear the storm going on outside the vehicle, and the reverberations of something large headed their way. It creates such a frightening atmosphere that the audience can be made to feel like we are there with them. Without the sounds and music of this film, it would have been very disappointing. The editing of this movie is seamless. Each shot is done to include the actors in as much background as possible, so the audience is always left with a sense of where the actors are in the set.<br/><br/>This movie is a somewhat slow paced thrill ride that gives the audience a sense of what it would be like if dinosaurs still existed. This is also a great look at the dangers of relying on technology. Of course, technology has come a long way since the making of this film, but it is something we rely on too heavily even today. We rely on technology to keep us safe when this film clearly shows us that we should not."

When Paleontologhist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), and the park creator's grandchildren, Lex and Tim Murphy (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello), first hiked through the park, looking in amazement as herds of swiftly running Gallimimuses, swooping pterodactyls, and plodding brachiosauruses appeared all about them, they reacted so appropriately that the action and suspense that followed felt a little anti-climatic. Astonished and wide-eyed, Lex and Tim Murphy innocently asked questions, and wise Dr. Grant imparted his knowledge when he wasn't shaking his head incredulously each time he saw another enormous, heretofore extinct reptile. <br/><br/>The performances, images, script, and the scenes featuring the rampaging tyranasaurus as it thundered after the jeep or plucked a man from an outhouse toilet, all deserve very high marks. For me and possibly for other viewers, though, who as 8 year-olds had read about the brontosaurus, allosaurus, stegosaurus, and triceratops, and had played and pretended with little plastic versions of them, the makers of Jurassic Park had to present the first human-dinosaur encounter very believably.

","Jurassic Park is a wonderful movie. It's about a park on an island 120 miles west of Costa Rica which has dinosaurs on it that were brought to life by the cloning of their DNA from mosquitoes preserved in amber that had drunk their blood. The park is called Jurassic Park. Scientists and a lawyer are asked to come see the park and give it their endorsement. They aren't told about the dinosaurs. They are astounded when they see their first dinosaur which is a brachiosaurus. They go on a jeep tour of the park and someone who works for the park does a criminal thing and shuts off some of the power and things go horribly wrong. When it was released, it had by way far the best dinosaur special effects ever created in a movie. Those effects still astound people today. The visual effects are absolutely stunning and highly realistic. The sound effects are really great too. Especially the roars and hums and growls of the T-rex.

","-Spoiler Alert-<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is the best film of all time for many reasons. The film is unlike anything that was ever made before it, and was done with such expertise that it remains a milestone in modern cinema. Spielberg really hit the gold mine with this one, combining exciting action sequences, with groundbreaking and visually stunning special effects, lots of suspense, and great dialogue and acting. Even considering all of Spielberg's great work, next to Jaws and Raiders, Jurassic Park is his best film. Spielberg shows true versatility as a director throughout the film, moving from emotional scenes with peaceful and loving dinosaurs such as the triceratops in the field, to scary, suspense filled sequences with dangerous and aggressive predators, such as the T-Rex paddock sequence. One of the best scenes in the film, is the raptor sequence within the kitchen. It is well paced, and provides unrelenting tension, leaving you on the edge of your seat, asking, ""what will happen next?"" Throughout the course of the film we begin to realize the main theme of the movie to be a great concern- should man tamper with nature? Should man recreate what was already naturally extinct? The first half of the film leaves one thinking that man should, given all of the happiness and amazement that the dinosaurs create. As the film continues, the audience begins to realize that it is truly a dangerous forte, and should be considered deeply. Another truly great aspect of the film, is how the dinosaurs always are animals, never monsters. This again shows Spielberg's amazing talent as a director, and makes the film the amazing cinematic milestone that it is today."

","Jurassic Park is still a movie that has a powerful effect on it's audience and it's easy to see why. One thing that makes it such an amazing movie is the concept of the plot. Scientists have managed to clone dinosaurs through fossilized DNA and have bred multiple species, set them up in a theme park style hotel resort to be sold to the world. The dream of multi-billionaire John Hammond has become a reality.<br/><br/>But as you could imagine with a monster movie, things go pear shaped as the power goes out during a pretty nasty storm, the main characters are plunged into a cascade of danger as the dinosaurs manage to escape from their enclosures, and the fight for survival is fast paced, scary and extremely well executed. <br/><br/>You can't review this movie without talking about the cast, This movie simply could not have had a better listing of actors. Sam Neil and Laura Dern make very believable paleontologists and their awe struck faces the first time they lay eyes on a real dinosaur is completely legit. Jeff Goldblum stirs the pot as the maths expert who can see plain as day the park is going to fail miserably. The fat, sloppy, mischievous Dennis Nedry is portrayed flawlessly by Wayne Knight and I can't ignore the fact that Samuel L. Jackson is in this movie, playing the programming expert John Arnold. Both the child actors do their bit wonderfully and make you really care about them from start to finish.<br/><br/>The dinosaurs themselves are still the most impressive animatronics i've seen in any film. The Tyrannosaur is utterly terrifying and the scene with it attacking the car with the two kids in it is just so memorable and scary. There's a lot of chase scenes in this movie that have you on edge and make your heart thump and it's always an added bonus when a movie can do that to you. Jurassic Park does this in spades.<br/><br/>Compared to the novel, there's a hell of a lot that was left out of the movie. I know there are certain budget limitations in film making but I couldn't help but feel it would have made for a better experience had the movie have been 3 hours long. There's so many parts in the book I wish were in the movie. <br/><br/>One thing that always amazes me about Jurassic Park is how well it still holds up. Every time I see it, I always enjoy it as if it's my first time seeing it and I cannot believe this movie is 23 years old. Watching it on Bluray for the first time was a pleasure too.<br/><br/>For anyone who has amazingly NOT seen this movie yet, do yourselves a favor, watch it and then try and say you didn't enjoy it. absolutely impossible!<br/><br/>Fox."
"ethanct86","8","1","2","3 March 2016"," Well-made, but a typical action flick at its core.
","Quality: 7.5/10 Content: 6/10 Before Jurassic World and two other sequels, there was Jurassic Park twenty-two years ago. It's good, to say the least, but not great -- well- made, but a typical action flick at its core. Though Spielberg really wished to induce amazement, he introduced the dinosaurs quite too early, mollifying the awe the characters - whom we have known for no more than ten minutes – display (and we should have felt). Based on the renowned Michael Crichton novel, Spielberg, David Keopp, and Crichton himself cut the story down to a simple and bloody nightmare.<br/><br/>We meet Dr. Grant, a dinosaur paleontologist (a power-filled performance by Sam Neil), and his fiancée and assistant, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) working on a dinosaur excavation site. In a surprise visit, a mysterious, eccentric billionaire park owner, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), asks the two renowned archaeologists to endorse his new yet-to-launch, live dinosaur park. As they arrive at the park situated on a private island, they are joined by a mathematician Dr. Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), the ""blood- sucking"" lawyer Gennaro (Martin Ferraro) representing Hammond's investors, and Hammond's two grandchildren, Lex and Tim. But then, just as a foreseeing Dr. Malcolm observes, the park goes amuck due to the betrayal of the only IT guy capable of running the park.<br/><br/>The whole film can be enfolded by an exchange with the mathematician Dr. Malcolm first declaring: ""God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs."" To which Dr. Ellie Sattler replies: ""Dinosaurs eat man. Woman inherits the earth."" First, this story portrays man's destruction of God by creating dinosaurs; man became God and created and ruled their creations as a god, but what they created was superior to them. Secondly, Spielberg involves a forced female lead whose acting falls short of the magnitude of her role. Sure, strong female leads are great, but Laura Dern portrays Sattler as almost weak and gives overdone and exaggerated expressions radically different than her fiancé's near grim looks and demeanor. Even Dr. Malcolm could not see the chemical reaction between the couple.<br/><br/>Granted, this is considered one of the most frightening movies ever made. But deeper than the action and near escapes are the themes of paternal love. The grim Dr. Alan Grant never truly smiles, never has a genuine, good laugh over anything and above all, enormously despises children. However, chance intervenes when Mr. Hammond brings his grandchildren along to be the first visitors to the not-yet launched park. But when everything goes amuck in the park and Gennaro ditches the children in an act of cowardliness, Grant bravely but reluctantly takes them into his custody, who in turn treat him to the joys of parenthood. <br/><br/>Some of you may have even seen it in theaters in its release and noticed that the ""theater shook."" Not surprisingly, Jurassic Park was the first major movie to use surround sound (simply sound that surrounds), bringing the petrifying sounds of the Jurassic period to the screen. With cars smothered in blood and gore, bodies eaten as fast as anchovies and intense struggle of man against his creation, no wonder Jurassic Park has such a bloodstained name on it. The language is no better; expletives drop as fast as the bodies. But cowardliness is avenged, and Dr. Grant finds his own fatherly instinct. Definitely, Jurassic Park is satisfying and the events frightening, but it falls away from the strength and complexity of the original novel."

","Jurassic Park is definitely an all time favorite. The time and money that when into making the movie really helped make it great. Everything is done very well from the plot, directing, acting, special effects, sounds, and so on....This movie had me hooked from the beginning to the end. I never felt like I lost attention considering how long the movie is. Keeping the viewer's attention is important and this movie keeps your attention the entire time. The real feel this movie creates is what gives it great suspense. The dinosaurs were very realistic and gave everyone who watched it a very accurate feel of what these animals were like years and years ago. This movie has always been a classic and will always be an all time favorite."

Just the thought of dinosaurs coming to life is my inner kids dream, still is. I'd of given anything at the time to go to a park like this. The movie set is beautiful. The action and adventure in this movie is amazing. To me it's not too much. Just enough to keep the viewer entertained without being overwhelmed.

I rarely ever re-watch a movie but this one I'll never stop watching."
"StevePulaski","8","1","2","9 June 2015"," One of the five defining films centered on special effects
","Steven Spielberg's original Jurassic Park is one of the five films I can think of that really showed American audiences the capabilities of special effects and the sheer realism of such effects (Tron, Star Wars, Avatar, and Gravity are my other case examples). The film shows creatures, better yet, a world, that I'm sure most kids fantasized about exploring when they were young come to life in a way that balances the mystique, the adventure, and the peril all in one collective package. There's no need to give dinosaurs voices or two-dimensional personalities; seeing them come to life and enthrall is all that we needed.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a company known as InGen, run by billionaire CEO John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), who decides to allow four individuals, in addition to his two grandchildren, into a theme park he has created, housing living dinosaurs. What unfolds, however, is a catastrophic miscalculation, with dinosaurs running amok and people's lives being put in danger. Dennis Nedry (the always likable Wayne Knight) is the park's architect and computer engineer, who works to make sure that all goes well with the park, despite the outcome.<br/><br/>On top of being a love letter to our childhood dreams of being immersed in a world of real life dinosaurs, Jurassic Park really formulates what a summer blockbuster is - realistic special effects, a team of rather likable actors shuffled in the mix, and a grandiose platform on which to play. Jurassic Park's main asset, however, despite its beautiful effects, is the sense of danger it conjures up. Ultimately, while still exercising the principles of science-fiction, the film plays like a horror film at times with its suspense and buildup. Consider the scene when Hammond's grandchildren are hiding from a gigantic Tyrannosaurus Rex, as the dinosaur careens over where they sit, lurching over them like an engulfing shadow.<br/><br/>The intensity Spielberg and company conjure up is akin to the kind of slowburn buildup Spielberg worked to predicate Poltergeist off of several years earlier. There's a liberal amount of time that allows for a setting to be created, characters to be introduced, and a sense of danger to build. After the first hour or so, the film goes from a rather calm and collective drama concerning the erection of Jurassic Park to a full-blown, high-octane adventure revolving around our wildest imagination.<br/><br/>While Jurassic Park is a winning spectacle of special effects and danger, it still falls prey, however, to the typical pitfalls of being a summer blockbuster. As somewhat expected, character development is sparse, as the characters before us (with the exception of Knight's Nedry) speak with the kind of technical jargon that makes them less characters running a park and more vessels to advance the plot. Being that there's little in the way of development for these souls also means it's hard to truly feel anything for them when they're put in danger, the primary reason we should be so invested in the peril on screen. In addition, there is also a lack of the exploration of the ""man playing God"" that is usually instilled in these films. Hammond has great potential to be the anti-hero here, working against popular opinion or science to develop real-life dinosaurs, ignoring all opinions and simply going for what he feels is right rather than what others see as morally right.<br/><br/>But perhaps I'm turning Jurassic Park, a film firmly stitched into the fabric of American cinema, into something it was never meant to be. One of the biggest gripes I get as a film critic is the assertion that I can never take films at face value or pieces of entertainment. The entertainment provided in Jurassic Park is sufficient enough to warrant a recommendation, and the film has already transcended the impact of a summer blockbuster. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right, or maybe in the end, it's for the dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Starring: Richard Attenborough, Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Wayne Knight. Directed by: Steven Spielberg."

","This movie is fun and exciting to watch. My youth years was spent scouring books about dinosaurs reading and learning what I could about them. So watching this movie I remember the days when I would imagine having a pet dinosaur to ride to school, or to ride a triceratops like I was in the joust. I wanted to be in Tim's shoes. Seeing the dinosaurs up close, the adrenaline and fear from running from the dinosaurs. It was an amazing experience for me and it could be for viewers of all ages. You can feel their surprise and joy when they see the real live dinosaurs because you want to feel that too. This movie is a great experience, it involves almost all of your senses so enjoy in the dark on a large screen."

","1993 was banner year for Steven Spielberg. ""Schindler's List"" brought him long-overdue Oscar recognition while ""Jurassic Park"" became the highest grossing film of all time (displacing his own film, ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial""). The former was an artistic triumph while the latter was the latest entry in a long line of blockbuster crowd-pleasers.<br/><br/>Based on a novel by bestselling author Michael Crichton (who also contributed to the screenplay), ""Jurassic Park"" told the story of a theme park unlike any other. The star attractions were dinosaurs recreated through advanced scientific technology. However, the proprietor of the park soon found that controlling his creations was easier said than done.<br/><br/>The story is an entertaining one that features some trademark Spielbergian touches. Sure, it may be distinctly family-friendly and a few of the plot points may be a bit questionable but, overall, the movie is an enjoyable ride. The scientific angle is vaguely plausible and the script has some thought-provoking things to say at times. Ultimately, though, the real star of the show is the pioneering CGI, which was nothing short of awe-inspiring at the time. It still holds up today, though CGI has advanced so much that what's on display here will probably be taken for granted by younger viewers.<br/><br/>The movie's cast is fairly small but well-assembled. Sam Neill & Laura Dern are somewhat unlikely leads for a big budget movie like this but they both performed admirably. Jeff Goldblum welcomely brought his unmistakable style to the movie while veteran actor Richard Attenborough contributed a fine performance, as always. The child actors (Joseph Mazzello & Ariana Richards) both managed to keep up with their adult co-stars. In support, Martin Ferrero is memorable as the lawyer and so is Wayne Knight as a scheming employee. Samuel L. Jackson's here too but it's not what I'd call one of his most memorable performances.<br/><br/>Spielberg's direction was characteristically up to his usual standard. The Dean Cundey cinematography also helped to take full advantage of the colourful locales. The special effects, including the aforementioned CGI (courtesy of ILM), was bolstered by the involvement of stop motion expert Phil Tippett & makeup/animatronics specialist Stan Winston. Yet another important ingredient in the mix was John Williams's fitting score that blended wonder & excitement.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Jurassic Park"" was undoubtedly a revolutionary film for its time. For better or worse, it really got the ball rolling when it came to extensive CGI in films. Apart from the special effects, though, the fact is that the movie is just plain entertaining and that's enough of a reason to watch it."
"wally-rox-today","Null","1","2","31 March 2014"," Good work
","Cool movie (not enough lines, so a piece of useless text) But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?<br/><br/>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business is will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."

","I rented this movie under the impression that it was about a theme park- not JUST dinosaurs. Instead I was hoping for a quality family film about having fun, instead I got a violent dinosaur filled movie about people running for their lives. What infuriated me the most, that caused me ultimate discomfort in this film, was the fact that it had too many dinosaurs. Maybe one dinosaur, such as Barney- you know one less violent- but instead there was a dinosaur every minute of this film. Plus I didn't find it entertaining that this nice (not Christian, but nice) family got chased around. This movie I know is considered a classic, but I don't know why. Perhaps this movie could have been slightly better if the dinosaurs hadn't been so prominent, or if it had been a friendly game of tag, or if they had went to church instead. Overall this movie is bad. Do not watch it, I recommend The Parent Trap (1998) instead."

After wondering ""How do you do it?!"" the movie explains very well how the dinos were cloned from dna taken from a fly dug up from fossils. The owner and dreamer of the park thinks that the park will bring a lot of success to tourists, but first must see approval by experts who predict and theorize the dangers and consequences of messing with an extinct species that humans know nothing about. And that's the whole theme of this movie ""You don't mess with nature or it will fight back!"" And what do you know things start going wrong and all **** breaks loose! The power goes out and the fences go down and the dinosaurs get loose. It turns from a beautiful moving picture to a survival game for the guests of the park. They try to make their way to get a chopper and get off the island after discovering for themselves that the park is just not worth going crazy for and they don't approve of it. Not only are the special effect ground breaking, but the score by John Williams is incredible like always! The Spielberg and Williams formula works great! Fantastic movie!

","Jurassic Park is one the best movies that has ever been made. The dinosaurs look so real, the storyline is perfect, it has good character development and is very well paced. The film also has good acting and some good humour. This is definitely one of Steven Spielbergs best films to date along with Minority Report and Saving Private Ryan. While there are a lot of scenes of awe, some scenes might be too frightening for smaller children. I heard some people say that Jurassic Park was the breakthrough film with the use of CG. But it was not Jurassic Park, it was Terminator 2: Judgement Day. If you like movies that are full of suspense and awe this is the film for you.

Maybe it was the utter amazement when I first saw the Brachiosaurus eat from a tree. Or maybe it was my adrenaline rushing when two 12 year old were attacked by Raptors. It might possibly be the chills that went down my spine when the T-Rex first made his terrifying roar. Whatever it was, it made me write this review.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg quite possibly the greatest film director alive today , Jurassic Park was a film worth sitting down and watching right through to the end.There is nothing bad to say about this film apart from asking to see ""More Dinosaurs"".But i guess from beginning to end it gave us many dinosaurs to shout,scream and cry throughout.The acting was also remarkable and you can tell that some actors may have got their big break with this film.<br/><br/>The plot is very original and with special effects as great as this , it is clear that this film will always and i mean always have a close place in my love for films.As i said before the acting is tremendous and the star of the show has to go to someone who out their heart and soul into the entire picture,in fact i would go as far to say that this person carried the entire picture...The T Rex.I mean come on didn't it deliver.Oh and Sam Neil also did impressive in the film too.<br/><br/>In Conclusion if anyone hasn't seen Jurassic Park...you are a fool for not seeing it.Simply one of the greatest films out there.I highly and I mean highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Grades 100 % = A+ - *****"

The entrepreneur, John Hammond and scientists working for him has managed to extract and develop dinosaur DNA, resurrecting one extinct species after another. Soon Jurassic Park, a theme park with living, wild dinosaurs, will open. But the tour is sabotaged, the security measures turned off, and soon the dinosaurs run free. The weekend tour is now a fight for survival.<br/><br/>Comments: I remember it very well when this movie opened at the cinemas, a major development in cgi and a big step for movies. I remember going to the cinema on several occasions to see it, enjoying it every time. Now, almost two decades later effects have developed massively but Jurrasic Park still holds its own against the competition. As a testament to the craftsmanship that was put into the movie, Jurassic Park don't look obsolete or out of place when watched even today.<br/><br/>What it has lost is its uniqueness, now cgi like that are hardly breathtaking. The story is OK, the music great, but the main attraction when it was released was the stunning effects. With that lost it is still a good adventure movie, with a few quite suspenseful moments and a few jokes and one-liners mixed in, but it is not the stellar movie experience it once was. That aside, I still enjoy it. The only parts that annoy me is that it occasionally suffers from irritating-kid-syndrome, for example with the flashlight in the jeep and the T-rex.<br/><br/>The cast is strong, with Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum heading the credits. But it is most fun to see Samuel L Jackson in a supporting role as a programmer before breaking through big time and becoming a leading actor himself.<br/><br/>8/10 (based upon how I felt when it was released, now it maybe is a 7)"

Know the guests who are at the park before it opens to the public are fresh meat for the so called extinct species. <br/><br/>Spielberg in his hey day, cranking out a film that defined a generation and changed the way special effects are used in films. Jurassic Park is a nail biting, amazement that dazzles and makes you smile with glee. If Superman made you believe a man can fly, then Jurassic Park made you believe we can re-create dinosaurs. Never before have dinosaurs looked so life like and realistic on the screen.

Sam Neil, Laura Dern and of course the one guy you want to play a doctor/scientist, Jeff Glodblum. While on the tour, a major storm hits and the power goes down. It doesn't help that Wayne Knight is trying to steal the embryos to make some ca-ching. Well, those dinosaurs who eat meat eventually escape and we are in for a thrilling ride. Our first introduction to the T-REX stands as one of the best introductions and visual film achievements to this day. <br/><br/>The cast do well together and the kids aren't AS ANNOYING as they use to be.

","""Welcome, to Jurassic Park.""<br/><br/>It seems like such a simple line, as it is, but I believe it went two directions: #1 it told you, the audience, were in line for an exciting, roller coaster ride of fright, suspense and intrigue. It's true; it didn't let you (or me) down. And #2: it started both the brand name of Jurassic Park in addition to the return of the big blockbuster. (Ironically, as it started off as a new brand name, it was marketed the same way the movie, itself, was preaching against. Much like Natural Born Killers taught us not to concentrate on violence. Good job!)<br/><br/>There are just too many comparisons that can be made about Jurassic Park and Jaws, aside from the obvious: both were directed by Steven Spielberg. Both are huge summer blockbusters that bring back the heart to connect with multiple audiences. Both are When Animal Attack stories. Both had the predictable outcome due to its ""family nature"" despite the gore. Both begin with a seemingly insignificant scene of death and foreshadowing. Both had source materials that were, in fact, deeper, more graphic, more adult and radically different endings. And both had one central leader who thought better of doing the right thing, valuing money over saving lives.<br/><br/>Not that I'm knocking the movie. It was, as stated, one helluva roller coaster. I have yet to visit the actual ride at Universal Studios, but from what I've seen by someone who taped the whole experience on YouTube, I doubt even the ""real"" experience is half of what this movie drags you, joyfully, that is, through.<br/><br/>John Hammond's rich and loves to make flea circuses small and large. So he ""steps on what others have done"" and genetically engineers dinosaurs on an island he's (ONLY) renting. I wonder what kind of pet deposits he had to produce like whenever I rent an apartment.<br/><br/>So, due to an ""accident"" leaving one dead from one of the smarter dinos, Hammond gathers up some prominent scientists, doctors and one lawyer to endorse his zoo/theme park, a la Jurassic Park, before it opens. Immediately, and not even allowing for the tour to be over, the group, Grant, Sattler and Malcolm justifiably see problems with ""control over nature"" albeit zoos apparently don't count. <br/><br/>That, above, is just the intro. The real movie arrives at one of the most influential and exciting scenes in almost any movie: Attack of the T-Rex! The power went out during the final bit of the tour and our heroes, including two thoroughly annoying kids, are caught between a meat-eater and a hard car in soft mud.<br/><br/>From there, you get grand-scale adventure with crisp scenery and a hunt/be hunted suspense film as the dinos escape their habitats due to a greedy enemy of both Jurassic Park and Jerry Seinfeld (Knight.) I've tone down a lot that happens, but really it's a paper-thin plot with more emphasis on the adventure over depth. Not that that's a bad thing here. What works is the suspense, the fun, the humor and lines of Goldblum, (again) the adventure along with suburb cinematography and one of the greatest scores in any movie – kudos to another wonderful theme from the great John Williams.<br/><br/>Did I mention the graphics? I was amazed back then, but damn, it holds up STILL (for the most part) 17 years later. Many have tried to reproduce, but haven't even come close to how real the dinos look and due to that, the suspense was heavier on whether or not our heroes will survive. If someone were to watch this for the first time today, they might even overlook the fantastic overlapping of the dinos and man, but think about it in 1993: like The Matrix, this changed cinema indefinitely.<br/><br/>That all said, I wouldn't go as far as to say this is a ""leave-your-brain-at-the-door"" feature, though it's close. Besides the cardboard cutout characters, there were flaws I just couldn't get past. Whether technical, such as the obvious car being lowered in the tree and the obvious green screen behind Goldblum while they strangely out run the T-Rex, or the continuity of one moment our heroes are looking over the edge and seeing the goat and the next, it's a 10-story drop. Hardly any movie's perfect, but in addition to the technical and continuity flaws, this also has the burden of having one of the oldest plot lines in Hollywood.<br/><br/>I've read the source material by the late Michael Crichton who wrote both the book and helped write this screenplay. Of course, there has to be changes. They got the gist in the film, and I understand the change of the finale from the original draft/source material – Terminator 2: Judgment Day did the same thing: Hollywood just loves to leave franchises open for sequels. Both T2 and JP's books had definite closures whereas the movies left it WIDE open. (In T2's defense, the ""book"" was made following the movie, but involved ""Judgment Day"" rightfully thwarted.)<br/><br/>I still award this 8/10 stars for being, well, so much fun. It's nice to get back to the real summer movie, it's nice to hear such a wonderful instrumental background juxtaposed with lush and beautiful surroundings and it's especially nice to see two of my favorites: Goldblum who was at the top of his game and Jackson, though he really, REALLY toned it down for his role. And finally, as mentioned multiple times, despite all that's wrong, it was a true adventure that seems big on the outside, but Spielberg did a perfect job of toning it down to a simple, though intense, story of survival. See it!"

","When i was young i knew more movie names than directors' but there was one name i always knew and that was Steven Spielberg.The reason,Jurassic Park.One of the obvious reasons would be that i love dinosaurs and this movie just happened to be (for me)the very best of all dinosaur movies ever created,from the music to Sam Neil's and Laura Dern's performance in the movie.I also jut love the music in the movie like the part when they land on the island,when they see the brachiosaur,when they leave the island and so on.John Williams' music was just perfect for the movie and for me still and always will remain delightful to hear. <br/><br/>The dinosaurs in the movie were also just unbelievably realistic.The movie made back then ,compared to today's movies seems to just outdo itself over and over again.I just love the scene when when characters Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler look at their very first real dinosaur (the brachiosaur),the expressions were just perfect,it was like looking at two other people who loved dinosaurs just as much as u did..The kids in the movie were also really good.The thunderous footsteps and the ripples were also very well presented using the glass of water in the car and the water in the potholes.Then there's the scene of Alan Grant stressing on the question of raptors being bred on the island ,you can see the look on his face when he asks that question as it gets you also waiting for them to arrive and when they do you see what he was so afraid of.They turn out to be even more dangerous than the T-Rex as they're not too big nor too small and enter through doors into buildings also very agile and so forth leaving the humans no place to run and no place to hide.<br/><br/>There's also the bonding of Alan with the children ,of whom he was not very fond of at the start ,not that it was anything personal but just that they were not adults.It was nice to see them end up with him from the middle of the movie and how the trio try to survive together from the scene where the car is about to fall from the tree to the scene where the girl's knowledge in computers buy them time to escape.<br/><br/>The ending was also very cool when out of nowhere something that was out to kill them ,saves the day.To say the least this is what i would call MovieMagic."
"filmsbythefire","10","1","2","14 April 2010"," Definitely one of my favourites, possibly my number one
","I adore this movie. Considering it came out only a year after I was born, I never had the privilege of seeing it in the cinema, but even when your first viewing is several years late and on TV, it's still such an incredible film you can't fail to be impressed with it. Even now, about sixteen years after the film's release, the CGI and animatronics look good. Although dinosaurs are only on screen for a relatively small portion of the film, they make up for this with amazing presence and spectacular entrances (think the T.Rex breakout, raptor kitchen scene and the first brachiosaur). I think Spielberg followed his effective formula from 'Jaws'; he knows that build-up and off-screen drama can create a much more impressive persona for a creature than full-on violent attacks left, right and centre. Not seeing the dinosaurs much makes us appreciate them more when they're on screen. One thing I really love about this movie is the sense of mystery it creates; it is so strong, so well executed, that it really does leave that question of 'what if?' hanging there. It is easy for a child to enjoy fantasies of cloning dinosaurs after seeing this, and I must confess that I rather hoped it was possible myself at first. The science behind the dino's creation is complex enough to be believable, but presented in a cute little cartoon that children will be able to follow and enjoy. The characters are also excellently portrayed by some extremely talented actors; for some, like young Joseph Mazzello, Jurassic Park was the breakout role, and one for which they will be remembered for generations. John Hammond is easily my favourite; his lovable, quirky behaviour and almost child-like dreams brought to life by ambition, imagination (and money) make him an endearing and well-liked character that will have both kids and adults in stitches at times. Alan Grant's hard, brusque exterior hides a good heart, and the audience will be pleased with the way he gradually warms to the children over time. Speaking of the children, they deliver some really knock-out performances, most notably in the car and kitchen scenes - they let you experience the whole thing through a child's eyes. Their trust in their grandpa, and their terror when the dream becomes a nightmare - all of it is just so real, so intense. The action is never overdone, and delivered sparingly, with good doses of calmer, soft-paced moments to even things out. This movie truly is a classic; from the director of so many great movies, it's hardly surprising. If you haven't seen this, I highly recommend you do so, and invite anybody else you know who has yet to enjoy this masterpiece of a film. You will not be disappointed."
"kdnor2011","10","1","2","20 March 2010"," My favorite movie of All Time
","I'm surprised that I actually waited so long to watch this movie. I mean it came out the same year I was born, and I didn't get around to watching it till about 2006. Granted I had always seen parodies and references, but I never actually watched the film, and now it's my favorite movie of all time.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean that this is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. This film defienently has it's faults. There are a few errors in logic, maybe a plot hole or two, some generic characters here and there, and of course the way to bring dinos back to life would never work in real life.<br/><br/>But you know what, it seems like it could. I bet that when you first hear about this and as long as your not a scientist, you might actually believe that could happen. Yes I have read the book, and it is one of my favorite books, but I actually like the movie better. For one the book has a few dry spots, especially near the beginning, and Lex has LITERALLY NO PURPOSE. In them movie she is good with computers and is older than Tim. In the book, she is younger (more annoying) and Tim is good with computers, so she has no point in existence. Also they made Malcolm much more likable in the movie. Speaking of which, all of the characters are great, likable, and humorous. The effects are amazing, CG that still holds up and practical effects to please both sides.<br/><br/>Really mostly every aspect of this film just works, any problems are just nitpicks. It may not be the best movie ever, but it's my personal best."
"moviesleuth2","10","1","2","6 March 2010"," A Classic
","In general, summer action movies are lumped together as dumb fun with over-the-top action sequences, simple stories that require limited to no brainpower and stock characters. However financially successful they may be, few of these are given any serious thought by cineastes. ""Jurassic Park,"" although one of the highest grossing films of all time (it was at the top until ""Titanic""), has been lumped together with ""dumb fun"" movies like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or ""Superman."" That's unfair, because it's not giving Steven Spielberg's film it's due credit. This film is a classic of cinema in the same way that ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""Casablanca"" are.<br/><br/>On a small island off the coast of Costa Rica, an entrepreneur named John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has done the impossible: he has brought dinosaurs back to life. In order to put his investors at ease, he has brought three scientists to take the tour and give their stamp of approval. But things go wrong, and what was going to be a fun weekend is now a desperate fight for survival.<br/><br/>The late great Michael Crichton had a tremendous gift for fudging science to make something impossible seem believable. Of course this story couldn't happen, but the story is told in a way that makes it seem credible. This adds a certain level of verisimilitude to the film that it desperately needs.<br/><br/>Many have criticized the film for its characterization, or lack thereof. This is not only unfair, but it's also untrue. Many characters in classic films were not richly developed. The characters here are no better developed than Rick and Ilsa from ""Casablanca."" What makes those two characters to memorable is that they were portrayed by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. Additionally, the characters here are indeed multi-faceted. Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) begins the film as a man who hates kids, but once he gets to know Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzello), he warms up to them. More importantly, any further attempts to develop the characters would have merely wasted time in an already perfect film.<br/><br/>The actors in the film were not big names at the time of production (obvously for budgetary reasons). That all changed after this movie. Most of the actors have had successful careers, especially Samuel L. Jackson and arguably Wayne Knight. All give solid performances. Sam Neill is good as the aloof scientist, but circumstances cause him to warm up to others. Laura Dern is also good as his paleobotanist girlfriend, who actively tries to bring out his human characteristics. Jeff Goldblum is delightful as the cynical and sarcastic ""chaotician,"" and he supplies most of the film's humor. Richard Attenborough is actually the film's most tragic figure. He had the best intentions, but he deluded himself into believing that he could control this startling new technology. Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Knight are on hand in small but important roles.<br/><br/>Without a doubt the dinosaurs are the main attraction of the movie. And believe me, they go above and beyond the call of duty. Creative and technical experts at Industrial Light and Magic pushed the limits of visual effects in film-making to a point that has been unrivaled ever since. These days, CGI is done cheaply, and it's obvious what is and what isn't computer-generated. Not here. Even today, after visual-effects extravaganzas like ""Titanic"" and ""Lord of the Rings,"" nothing has even come close to the dinosaurs of ""Jurassic Park.""<br/><br/>But for all the special effects and solid performances, one must not forget Steven Spielberg's stellar work on this film. 1993 was a huge year for Spielberg. In the summer, he came out with this mega-blockbuster classic. Later that fall, he released what is arguably his most celebrated work, the Holocaust-epic ""Schindler's List."" Altogether, they're two very different films than cannot and should not be compared, but if anything, they demonstrate Spielberg's skill and versatility. Spielberg is most at home with big budget epics (although he has taken forays into smaller scale films as well). But when viewing this film, one is forced to realize that Spielberg's skill when it comes to creating suspense. There are a number of sequences that are genuinely frightening. The first encounter with the T-Rex, the climax, just to name a few. But for me, the scariest part of the movie was Dennis' encounter with the Dilophosorus that sticks out in my mind when it comes to scary movie moments in ""Jurassic Park."" All in all, saying any more about ""Jurassic Park"" would either give something away, or become repetitive. The bottom line is that this movie is a terrifying classic that will get anyone's blood pumping. It is also one of the best films ever made."
"nunstampede","9","1","2","5 December 2009"," THE Dinosaur Movie of all Dinosaur Movies
","16 years later, I still love this movie, for a couple of reasons. It pushed the limits on special effects for its time, and the majority of the end result was as good as promised, but it still didn't compromise in content or purpose, and it tied a pretty important lesson into the plot without being preachy or being a stretch.<br/><br/>""Just because you can, doesn't mean you should."" Relevant for its day, and arguably more relevant for ours. This movie basically told the world about moderation, and about keeping perspective in the ever-changing world of technological advancement. It reminded us all that there is an underlying moral issue behind everything we create that should be addressed before the profit is made.<br/><br/>It also introduced America to Dr. Ian Malcolm, who despite being a pretentious know-it-all, has a good point about evolution, among other things.<br/><br/>Basically, to this day I am still convinced that Jurassic Park is still the perfect marriage of story and effects. The scenery is impeccable for being comprised of mostly extinct creatures and made in the early nineties, and it actually created quite a visual atmosphere. The score by John Williams is memorable, and serves the beautiful artificial scenery well. It's also there for the edgier moments, as is the CGI crew.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park may be the most nostalgic movie ever made for me, but I loved it the first time I saw it, and nothing has changed since then. It represents the ultimate movie experience, and I really wish I was a bit older so it could have made its gigantic impression on me on the big screen, rather me seeing it on VHS, and then getting my hopes up for the awful sequels that followed."

"KillerLord","10","1","2","8 October 2008"," Revolutionary CGI Effects...Simply Breathtaking Movie!
","Michael Crichton, in his novel, tells us how it is possible for us to have dinosaurs walking along side us in today's time. Steven Spielberg ambitiously takes it on himself to showcase the idea of dinosaurs walking and running along with us. And my God, what a wonderful job he does! Jurassic Park is simply an amazing movie that makes us drop our jaws and look in amazement and bewilderment at the dinosaurs as they walk on the silver screen. No encyclopedia and no book can be as effective as this movie is when it comes to showing what dinosaurs were and how grand they were when they ruled the earth.<br/><br/>The photography in the movie is outstanding. There is a scene at the beginning of the movie where we get to see the helicopter land on the heliport near a waterfall. The very beauty of the nature puts a smile on your face. And to make this shot even more wonderful, there is a wonderful music score that further broadens the smile. It puts you in a different mood altogether. And it does not fail to reproduce the magic even when you are seeing it again and again. Till today, whenever I see this one scene, it still puts a smile on my face.<br/><br/>Finally, when you get to that part of the movie where the dinosaurs are seen for the first time, your jaws drop. You look at them in sheer amazement. You are almost convinced that somehow dinosaurs continue to exist and all the filmmakers did was to capture them on their cameras! No, not true. Dinosaurs do not exist and the ones we see in this movie are computer animations. Any man who does not have any idea about how effective computer animation can be, they are surely going to believe that these mammoth creatures exist. There is much realism in them.<br/><br/>Prior to Jurassic Park, you always have had movies which were based on the concept of man vs beast. Once the movie has revealed the dinosaurs to us, the movie essentially becomes a struggle of survival. The dinosaurs are no longer secured and humans are in danger. I did not have any problem in this typicality of the plot. Because, it is not always necessary to create new plots. You can try and improvise on existing ones and show them in a more creative and different way. The Jurassic Park does that. So, I would not call it a weakness in the movie since it handles the overall plot beautifully.<br/><br/>If there is one complaint I would have for the movie, it is with regard to the villainous computer nerd who tries to sell off the embryos for cold cash. This part of the movie is a little loose and could have been handled in a better way. Also, the man who gets locked up in the toilet and the hunter getting outsmarted by the dinosaur are some things in the movie that are lame especially in comparison to how the overall plot has been so beautifully handled. But I still cannot take anything away from the movie. Sometimes negatives can be ignored if the positives are overwhelmingly strong. And the positives of the movie are way too strong for these things to be taken too seriously.<br/><br/>The movie is meant to be exciting and exciting it no doubt is. Steven Spielberg does a wonderful job with the Jurassic Park and this movie is surely destined to be a significant part of cinema history. It will be remembered for its special effects which were so excellently done. Though produced in early 90s, this movie can still be used as a benchmark to evaluate the standing of even the newer movies. This movie gets a 10/10 from me. Highly recommended for both watching and adding as a part of personal collection."
"KUAlum26","7","1","2","4 October 2007"," Got better with more viewings
","I recall that when I first saw this film fourteen years ago(in a theater,of course),I was more turned off by the amount of pat,cliché family/action caricature's(i.e. incorruptible,socially challenged expert or experts in field;oily,greedy lawyer;weaselly underling who will sell out anyone for a price;wide-eyed believer and,of course,kids--smart,cute,can-do kids)than I was in love with the impressive visual and sound gr4aphics. It wouldn't be until a couple more viewings of this movie would I come to appreciate the true entertainment value of this film.<br/><br/>In case you're not aware of the plot or story,here goes: The opening day of the Costa Rican-located them park ""Jurassic Park"",populated with dinosaurs made from fossilized DNA just-found,promises to be a grand event. That is,until someone shuts down the security grid,thus throwing the whole area into chaos. It's up to the pluck of two Paleontologists(Sam Neill and Laura Dern),two kids(Joseph Mazzello and Arianna Richardson),an eccentric but insightful Mathematician(Jeff Goldblum,still the best element of this film or its sequel!),the game warden(Bob Peck) and the PArk's creator,a cheerfully optimistic tycoon(Sir Ricahrd Attenborough) to survive this dilemma. <br/><br/>Director Steven Spielberg(who started on Schindler's List soon after this wrapped) doesn't seem to make any pretense as to what he's trying to do here,which,I must confess,is a good thing: He wants to make a fast,furious and eye-catching film that is light on characters or even some elements of logic and heavy on emotional and visual effects.Probably better as a wide-screen,big screen viewing experience,this is still a keeper,particularly of Mr.S's visual style and excess. You may,like me,also come to appreciate this film with more viewings."

"dunmore_ego","7","1","2","11 April 2007"," Dino Mighty
","DINOSAURS! No, not ""unbelievable"" and ""incredible""  on the contrary, Steven Spielberg and his special effects team do such a mighty job at recreating extinct saurians that they are altogether BELIEVABLE and CREDIBLE! Spielberg is the visionary who brought us *Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind* and *Raiders of the Lost Ark* - but *Jurassic Park* was his *Thriller*. If you didn't know his name before, you sure as dino-dropping knew it now.<br/><br/>Departing considerably from the Michael Crichton book of the same name, the movie follows paleontologists (Sam Neill and Laura Dern) to a remote island where billionaire entrepreneur, John Hammond (Sir Richard Attenborough), has cloned dinosaurs running around a proposed theme park. (The cloning process, via dinosaur DNA found in ancient mosquitoes, is ingenious, but specious.) Hammond wants the appraisal of experts and the park's target audience, so also invites a lawyer (Martin Ferrero), a chaotician (Jeff Goldblum, clad in all-black to connote some kind of scientific hipness, we presume), and two of his annoying grandkids.<br/><br/>I think we all entered *Jurassic Park* as jubilantly as the actors entered Jurassic Park: ""We're going to see dinosaurs! We're going to see dinosaurs!"" The wonder and awe lasts exactly one and a half acts. Then the Running and Screaming starts.<br/><br/>Though Crichton's book was an indictment against ""tampering in God's domain,"" weaving paleontology, anthropology, evolution, chaos and genetics into a plausible tale of scientific arrogance, the movie is unrepentantly all about the DINOSAURS. And the fun in seeing them alive and kicking.<br/><br/>The first sighting of the brachiosaur is immense, literally breath-taking, and when Hammond welcomes his charges with the line, ""Welcome to Jurassic Park!"" we are stunned into gape-mouthedness (as the characters are) with a long shot of Brachiosaurs and Parasauralophii herding by a lake, coupled with John Williams' fanfare theme, raising the hairs on the legs and driving a tear from the eye.<br/><br/>At this point, the film-makers had won. We were theirs. There could be no more stop-motion or Harryhausen after seeing the grandeur and ""real-ness"" of Spielberg's saurians. Working with the most revolutionary special effects (Industrial Light & Magic and Stan Winston's studio), Spielberg showed us Something Very Old as Something Very New.<br/><br/>And it was a Roarer. But the film (and the franchise) would never again be so wondrous.<br/><br/>For somewhere in the middle of the second act, Spielberg forgets why we love dinosaurs in the first place  for their uniqueness, their unattainable majesty, their awe-inspiring mystery - and instead of conjuring interest in the very fact that they live, they breathe, they walk like birds, spit like snakes and scream like jet engines, Spielberg gutlessly conforms to Hollywood movie convention, turning them into the film's ""villains,"" the element that the ""heroes"" must run from. In the end, the dinosaurs could have been anything (wolves, zombies, CGI monsters), it made no difference. (The velociraptor kitchen sequence, where they hunt Hammond's grandkids, is especially wasteful, not only because the two kids at that stage have become so irritating that we're rooting for the dinosaurs, but because Spielberg doesn't make movies where kids get eaten. Ergo: no suspense.) <br/><br/>From being the wondrous subjects of the whole excursion, the dinosaurs are demoted to merely providing the third act with Running and Screaming. And the movie degenerates to no better than its Harryhausen stop-motion ancestors. (I always watch this movie to the start of the third act. Then it sours enough to press Stop quite unregretfully and go finish the laundry.) <br/><br/>Spielberg ultimately fell into the trap created and abused by his pal, George Lucas  leaning on his scintillating effects and neglecting his half-baked story. Admittedly, the effects are DINO-MITE! (Somebody slap me.) The tyrannosaur alone is a juggernaut of adrenalin-charged mayhem, and its bellow is a frightful composite of elephants and lions and freight trains on steel wheels at midnight. Utilizing the most up-to-date paleontological data (including theories postulated by Robert Bakker in his iconoclastic tome, *The Dinosaur Heresies*), *Jurassic Park* shows us dinosaurs as ""modern"" as science can make them, pertaining to skin coloration, anatomy, physiology and behavior.<br/><br/>*Jurassic Park* succeeds on an entertainment level with its technical finesse, its Mesozoic marvels and manufactured excitement, but could have been so much more than a technological monster movie.<br/><br/>And I don't suppose it matters to the Great Unwashed that most of the dinosaurs are from the *Cretaceous* Period<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)"

","If there is the marketing hype surrounding the first Batman film, Jurassic Park is the one film of the summer that will be seen by nearly everyone, regardless of its merit or consistency of vision. C'mon, it's the biggest, grandest dinosaur movie ever, and I'll wager every coprolite in my possession that only the most cynical among us can resist the primal, childhood lure of those most personable of monsters. As expected, though, the dinosaurs rule the show -- without them on screen, Jurassic Park tends to bog down in occasionally unnecessary explanations; The explanation of the bird/dinosaur preaching and Richard Attenborough's whining about how his wonderful park is falling in around his ears. For the one guy out there who hasn't already heard the plot of the film, it involves an eccentric billionaire (Attenborough) who finances the cloning of ancient dinosaurs on an island off Costa Rica. Hoping to turn the beasts into the greatest amusement park in the world, he invites a team of dino experts (Neill and Dern) to check out his as-yet-unfinished theme park and give him an all-clear, safety-wise. Also along for the ride is a mathematician (Goldblum) specializing in the developing field of chaos theory, the science of unpredictability. From the moment Goldblum's character first lays eyes on the reborn monsters, he becomes the film's most prescient doom-sayer. It can't work, he says, and, of course, he's completely right. Before you can say ""a Tyrannosaur ate my lawyer,"" the beasts are loose in the park and people start turning into steak tartare.

","Film suffers from the flaws that are found in every Chricton novel and screenplay: great plot, intriguing development, but sappy and flat ending.<br/><br/>Thing that makes this different than other Chriton adaptations is the A+ acting. Perfect casting for each role. Each of the actors brought just the right interpretation too the role. Goldblum is great...probably his best ever. Attenbourgh gives his usual stellar performance, and adds just the right dignified touch to the role of Hammond. I even liked Ariana Richards and Joe Mazello as the kids....and I usually despise child actors. All around solid effort by the cast.<br/><br/>As an aside, on the Howard Stern Show it was just revealed by Wilmer Valderama (That 70s Show) that he took Ariana Richards virginity in 1996."
"eternalsea","10","1","2","11 March 2006"," My favourite film
","Jurassic Park is simply my favourite movie ever. It has everything action, suspense, thrills and even a little romance thrown in for good measure. I first saw the movie at the age of 6 and was a big dinosaur fan so it obviously was very appealing but even then I could feel there was so much more to this movie than the great visual effects and mighty dinosaurs. No this was a movie with a message and one that since my first viewing I have always been thoughtful about. The issue in the film is cloning. I nstead of providing you with a plot synopsis I will just say watch the movie. There is no excuse not to. Some scenes worth a mention however are the road side attack in which a Tyrannosaurus Rex or T-Rex for short attacks a land Rover with two children in it. That scene was more scary than anything in the exorcist or some of the other horror rubbish that is spewed out today. The Raptors in the kitchen sequence is also nail biting stuff. Again the two kids are stalked around a kitchen by two man size dinosaurs that are very smart and very mean. The characters are a real love to hate batch of people with Jeff Goldblum putting in the performance of a very respectable career as mathamatician I an Malcolm. Sam Neill and Laura Dern are also good as the leads and two new comers Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzelo are good value as the unlucky grandchildren of the parks owner. All in All Jurassic Park is simply astounding in every way and could well be Speilburgs finest film."
"farraak","8","1","2","2 February 2006"," Perfect Example of the Magic of Movie Making!
","In 1994 Jurassic Park was released on video. At that time I was nine years old. My dad had bought it and told me and my eleven year old brother we could only watch it after my dad viewed it first, and decided if it was appropriate for us. He watched it and told us we could watch it. The next weekend my dad made popcorn and kool aide and we three sat down to watch it together. Being nine years old, I didn't pay attention to the beginning much, and I only took notice when Dr. Grant pulled out his huge velocaraptor claw to show the boy. I was amazed. And then the music of the helicopter ride over the rocks going into the island hooked me. I hadn't even seen dinosaurs and I was already amazed. In this movie, there is something special and almost unspeakable about the value of this film. Jurassic Park captures what is so wondrous and untouchable. This is no ordinary movie about dinosaurs eating people. I can't say what it is about it, though. Is it seeing dinosaurs? Is it the great characters? Who knows. Yes, it scared me after watching it and I did have some bad dreams. But I have to say that this movie was one of my favorites from then on. I'm only 20 years old now, but, every time I watch Jurassic Park I feel like a child again, experiencing the wonder and excitement. Every single time I watch it, I lose my breath when the helicopter flies over the rocks in the beginning or when you get your first look of the brachiosauruses in the field. Now, that is how a movie is supposed to make you feel."
"hall895","8","1","2","17 January 2006"," A blockbuster that delivers
","You go to see Jurassic Park for the dinosaurs. And you will not be disappointed. If you are looking for well-developed human characters, great dialogue or top-notch acting Jurassic Park is hit-or-miss. There are some interesting characters, some snappy, witty lines and a few notable acting performances. But there are also some one-note, rather dull characters, some truly inane conversation and some performances which leave something to be desired. But have I mentioned the dinosaurs? A remarkable technical achievement for its time Jurassic Park places fully realized, totally believable dinosaurs right smack-dab into this live-action movie. Watching the human characters interact with each other can at times be rather dull. Watching the human characters interact with these amazing dinosaurs, many of whom are bent on eating the humans for dinner, makes it all worthwhile.<br/><br/>The plot, such as it is, is really rather simple and serves only as a way to get hungry dinosaurs chasing after terrified humans. Through a miracle of science wealthy John Hammond, played in one of the film's better performances by Richard Attenborough, is set to open a new theme park where real, living, breathing dinosaurs are the attraction. Before the park can open lawyers insist he gets the park approved and declared safe by a team of scientists. Enter dinosaur experts Alan Grant and Ellie Satler and chaos theory proponent Ian Malcolm. While Sam Neill shines in the role of Grant, really holding the whole film together, Laura Dern as Satler comes off as a bit of a cliché, the woman in peril trying to prove she's as tough as the guys. And Jeff Goldblum's portrayal of Malcolm, who thinks the park is a really, really bad idea, conjures up memories of the rather annoying guy you knew who always couldn't wait to tell you how much smarter he was than you.<br/><br/>Anyhow, suffice to say that once our threesome of experts enter the park (with Hammond's grandchildren in tow because, well we need some kids in danger don't we?) things go terribly wrong. Dinosaurs break loose and these magnificent creatures are bent on destruction. So for the rest of the film, dinosaurs chase humans, humans try to avoid being eaten by said dinosaurs and Malcolm gets to say ""I told you so"" a whole lot. You expect moments of great drama, sheer terror and somewhat unbearable suspense and Jurassic Park delivers. The movie promised a great dinosaur action-adventure and it delivered on that promise. Yes, you have to sit through some cheesy dialogue and some annoying performances. Dern is kind of dull, Goldblum somewhat too smart for his own good and the young actors playing the grandchildren quite obviously too inexperienced to handle much of what goes on around them. And the less said about Wayne Knight's cartoonish portrayal of blubbering idiot (yet supposedly brilliant computer technician) Dennis Nedry the better. So yes, Jurassic Park has its flaws. But once those dinosaurs are let loose the film is a rollicking good time and one can't ask for much more than that."
"silver271","9","1","2","27 December 2005"," Too much was left out
","The movie was excellent. However in the process of book to movie Spielberg left out too much! He left out the waterfall scene which included Grant, Lex, and Tim. He later used it in The lost world which was a bad book to an average movie. Spielberg also left out the Cterasaur scene which was used in Jurassic Park 3. Spielberg didn't even consider using the scene where Ellie. Grant, and Gennaro enter the Raptors nest. Not to mention we still don't know what happened to Wu or Harding. Spielberg should have remained true to the book in those aspects of the story as well. The scene where Nedry is killed by the Dilophasaur wasn't very realistic because if someone is getting eaten in a car it won't cause an increase in mud. However despite all this the movies fantastic. great acting, graphics, and plot. A must see!"
"normy132","10","1","2","14 December 2005"," A True Classic
","Even 12 years after Jurassic Park was first released in cinemas and 6 or 7 years after seeing it myself, this movie still scares the pants off anybody.<br/><br/>The scenes in the movie are natural-born thrillers from the start and every part of this movie contributes to it being a classic. Each part of the movie tells its own story that contributes to the main plot. Characters are easy to relate and most parts of the movie have been checked up on to make sure they are believable enough, such things as the mosquitoes with ""dino DNA"" that get merged with frog DNA wouldn't sound very believable on paper but Spielberg has somehow made it work!!<br/><br/>The plot of the story was simple and easy to understand for anyone. Yes, general public will need a bit of inside information on dinosaurs but for the most part it is common knowledge. Even if somebody doesn't know anything about dinosaurs the T-Rex scene about half an hour into the movie makes you realize these things are not pets!! <br/><br/>Overall, this is a classic from start to finish and a good movie to pull out if your looking for something good to watch once every 2 or 3 years only to relies this film was made in 1993. Amazing! Overall a perfect 10 from me."

Then the other day, I watched it again (19/11-2005) and I think I finally understood every part of the movie.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg did an amazing job with this movie, and even in 2005 the graphics are still good enough to make the movie watchable.

"patrick_dunne","8","1","2","20 October 2005"," Now I remember why I liked dinosaurs so much....
","It's true. I saw this film when I was little and I can't blame myself for falling in love with it. I used to study everything about dinosaurs and loved nothing more. How could you not love dinosaurs after seeing Jurassic Park? It has great well-planned action and wonderful CGI (computer generated images) that still look good today. However, this movie does suffer from a slow beginning (It's mostly just talking.) but soon gets more exciting. Starting from boring, this movie goes to exciting, to edge of your seat. Jurassic Park combines the amazing action and the amazing CGI so well, that it makes a film above amazing.<br/><br/>You must be tired of hearing how amazing this film is, so I'll explain it to you. Dr. Alan Grant, a paleontologist, is invited to Jurassic Park, which is a park showing off real-life dinosaurs. (You already knew that.) The dinosaurs were made by DNA found in they're blood, and the blood was found in mosquitoes, which was found in sap. However, the DNA wasn't complete, so they used frog DNA as a substitute.<br/><br/>Now, for the problem. Of course the workers have to keep safe, so the dinosaurs are surrounded by electric fences. However, one worker is also working for another person named Dauhgson. Dauhgson wants the dinosaur embryos, so he hires the worker. The worker opens up the security doors and turns off the electricity to steal the embryos. Sadly, not everything goes as planned. Turning off the electric fences means nothing but a weak fence stops the dinosaurs from escaping. So, the dinosaurs escape and wreak havoc among Dr. Alan Grant and his crew.<br/><br/>There would be no other way to show the amazing and stylized action without the amazing CGI. Combined with the storyline, this film is great; it will leave you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."
"basket_cas","8","1","2","5 October 2005"," Dinosaurs! Dinosaurs! Dinosaurs!
","What is it about dinosaurs that makes them so fascinating?Maybe, it is because they're extinct and we are intrigued by what used to be. Or, maybe, it is because we're so amazed by their size and eating habits that we can't actually believe they could've existed. If you fall into one of these categories, chances are you are going to like this movie.<br/><br/>John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) is a millionaire who creates a park on a island off the coast off Costa Rica, which has regenerated dinosaurs living on it. After an employee is accidentally killed, he must assign a group of people to make sure it is safe. The group includes paleontologists Alan Grant (San Neill) and his girlfriend, Ellie Sattler(Laura Dern), Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), and a lawyer who exists only to be the first victim of a T-Rex. Also, John Hammonds' two grandchildren, Tim and Lex Murphy(Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards) are there to take part. One of the employees,Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) is trying to steal dinosaur embryos, so when he does, he causes a security shutdown that causes even the dinosaurs to escape from their fences. So now, everyone must run for their lives or be dino-food. Samuel L. Jackson has a minor role in the movie as a scientist. Is it just me or is he in everything, nowadays? Who would of thought that Christopher Lee would be in the Guinness Book of World Records for the international star with the most screen credits to his name.<br/><br/>First and for all, yes, the dinosaurs are magnificent. They are a landmark in special effects. I have never seen a dinosaur, but if I did, this is exactly how I would imagine them to look like. They are majestic and towering. There are many awe-inspiring moments like when you see the brachiosaures eating leaves off of some tall trees. It is a miraculous sight, yet there are dark undertones foreshadowing that not all of them are so friendly. There is one particularly frightening scene where the two kids are in a jeep and all of a sudden, you see ripples in a cup of water. It is an excellent use of symbolism. The trembling of an object represents that something is coming to invade their lives because a few seconds later, a giant T-Rex is trying to get in the car, so he can eat them. Another scene that uses this effect is when Tim and Lex are eating dessert in a lab kitchen when the jello starts trembling. It is a good way to rise the tension, but there is also some comic relief provided by Wayne Knight's character.<br/><br/>I was reading a couple reviews about this movie written by other critics and they all said that this movie lacks character development and I sort of agree. Jeff Goldblum's character is wasted, if there was, in fact, an actual use for him. I thought Sam Neill did a good job with his character, though. At the beginning of the film, he is rather mean-spirited toward kids as in one the earlier scenes where he frightens a child by sticking out a Velociraptor claw and saying that if it still existed, it could cut him by ""splitting your intestines."" Yet, by the end of the film, he is more concerned and fatherly toward children. In one scene, Lex cries, ""He left us! He left us!"" after one of the men ran away instead of trying to save her, when Alan Grant replies, ""But that's not what I'm gonna do."" It is a touching moment. Laura Dern also does a decent job. She does exactly what the script tells her to do and nothing more. But, let's face the fact, no one wants to see a sweet, love story. We want dinosaurs, dinosaurs, DINOSAURS......and the film delivers. We see dinosaurs in all their ancient glory.<br/><br/>John Williams did the memorable score, which co-exists perfectly with the juxtaposed images on the screen. A lot of critics were dismayed that Steven Spielberg spent so much time focusing on the dinosaurs, but, hey, if you have it, flaunt it. The film is terrifying without five pounds of blood squirting at the screen per minute. I wish some of the scenes, like where a T-Rex swallows a man whole would leave more to the imagination because it looks more ridiculous than scary. Yet, this is a movie that works despite its flaws. This movie has everything you really need (except for character development, but who would want that when you have dinosaurs around?).Action, terror, and dinosaurs: sounds like the perfect formula for success.<br/><br/>P.S. Christopher Lee has starred in about 225 films, so far, while Samuel L. Jackson has starred in a measly 91 films(so far)."
"bobsteimle","9","1","2","29 June 2005"," Everybody likes dinosaurs
","I thought most of the characters in Jurassic Park were poorly directed. Especially when our two paleontologists first see the living dinosaurs and their jaws drop, I thought the acting was far too bad to blame on the actors. The only real good human acting by an adult in the movie was Jeff Goldblum's come-on to Laura Dern as he explained chaos theory to her. It was a little creepy, but it was brilliant acting. And of course, Malcolm turns out to be right. If I remember correctly, he was also quite brave when it came time to distract the T. Rex.<br/><br/>Despite the generally bad acting, my fascination with dinosaurs, the special effects, and the general idea that they were the ancestors of the birds of today made this a wonderful story. Like most good movies, if you want a real treat, read the book. I would highly recommend it."
"slokes","8","1","2","21 June 2005"," Roller Coaster With Teeth
","You expect certain things from Steven Spielberg when he sets out to make a popcorn thriller: Convincing action, scary moments, welcome dollops of humor, and a fluid logic stream that gives reason for all the cinematic craziness on offer. ""Jurassic Park"" not only lives up to those expectations but exceeds them. The result: Pure entertainment.<br/><br/>The premise of ""Jurassic Park"" is one thing Spielberg can't take credit for, as it is based on a best-selling novel by today's answer to Jules Verne, Michael Crichton. The idea, in some ways better executed in the novel than the movie, is that a genetics entrepreneur harvests dinosaur blood inside prehistoric mosquitoes preserved in amber so he can clone and grow the beasts on his island hideaway and make a theme park out of it. Problems ensue during a visit by scientists, as supposedly foolproof systems fail and some of the more ferocious dinosaurs escape.<br/><br/>When the entrepreneur, played in the film by Sir Richard Attenborough, insists there's nothing unusual about problems of this kind, that it happened when they opened Disneyland, one of the scientists, a chaos theorist played by Jeff Goldblum, deadpans: ""Yeah, but if 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' breaks down, the pirates don't eat the tourists."" Goldblum is a real joy in this movie, kind of the color guy like Richard Shaw was in ""Jaws,"" albeit in a completely different way. I love reading the quotes on this page. So many are from Goldblum's character, Ian Malcolm, and happily preserve the ""ums"" and ""ahs"" of Goldblum's trademark delivery. Elsewhere it can be annoying, but this is a perfect film for his snarky, knowing, ingratiating manner.<br/><br/>He also presents the central argument of the film, the notion of genetics run amok, which not only is pertinent to us today but also feeds the sense of dread that powers the thrills of this movie. As Malcolm so neatly puts it: ""God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs...""<br/><br/>All this talk about technology getting ahead of man's ability to constructively channel the results would have been cruelly ironic in this, a landmark in cinematic technology with its first-time extensive use of computer graphics imagery, or CGI, had the result been less well thought out, or more jarringly intrusive. Yet Spielberg shows terrific control of the new medium, using the dinosaurs sparingly at the outset and only letting them rip for maximum thrills. There's two sequences that deserve special mention, one where the T. Rex first appears and another where two children are cornered in a kitchen by a pair of hungry Velociraptors, which are first-rate from beginning to end. Throughout the film, in fact, Spielberg finds ways of delivering thrills, and having fun with audience expectations, in a way that feels like a ride on a very satisfying, though scary, roller-coaster.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Jaws,"" this isn't much of a film for characters. Goldblum's more of one than any, while nominal stars Sam Neill and Laura Dern are effective as dino-ologists, especially Neill who gives his character a welcome note of sadism. But the kids and Attenborough's John Hammond are annoying, not a fault of the actors so much as a script and director that coddle them. Hammond's theme park springs more than a leak, yet the fellow is treated more as a beautiful dreamer than a negligent businessman with blood on his hands. The film is a bit too long, with some padding at the beginning that should have been trimmed.<br/><br/>Spielberg's political correctness is also annoying: It's a relief to see Samuel L. Jackson in his extended cameo playing a decent guy who is smoking a cigarette. Otherwise, the nods to feminism and gun control are stifling and predictable, though not nearly as much as in the awful sequel, ""Jurassic Park: Lost World.""<br/><br/>So much is good here, though. ""Jurassic Park"" is a smart film that delivers thrills is always worth celebrating, and the special effects lift this up to near-classic status. This is not Spielberg's best effort, but it is a worthy, accessible demonstration of his greatness."

","This is a movie that I used to watch over and over again. However, I read the book last year, and now, although the movie is still very good, the book is really good too. Michael Crichton's story is very riveting, and I found it very helpful to have seen the movie before reading the book though, so that I was able to visualize what the characters looked like. The book does not end at all how the movie does, and I think that is mainly because of the movie sequels which would not have been possible if all had happened according to the book. Sam Neill (who did a great job in The Hunt for Red October - and if you like his portrayal of Dr. Grant in this movie, that is a must see) did a great acting job, as well as Laura Dern (although there was some romance in the movie not in the book). Jeff Golblum was absolutely hysterical, as he is in the other movies I have seen him in. Overall, Jurassic Park earns an 8 out of 10."

"Old Joe","Null","1","2","29 April 2004"," Spielberg and his team have made one fearsome and mesmerising movie.
","When I was told about the greatness of the 'dinosaurs' as a young child back in primary school, I had a complete fasciation with some of God's most powerful creatures. Dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus Rex have their own strange and unique characteristics which make them so interesting to learn about. So when I heard that Hollywood was making a movie on Dinosaurs titled 'Jurassic Park', I was truly excited. This film gives life back to creatures I wish I could have seen in the flesh.<br/><br/>One of mankind's most thrilling fantasies has come true, an astonishing technique for recovering and cloning dinosaur DNA has been discovered. With this discovery we get 'Jurassic Park', a remote island theme park, with actual living dinosaurs. The only problem is, it is about to turn deadly as five people, including two palaeontologists, must battle to survive among these prehistoric predators.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has made a film full of terror and scary creatures. I like how the film opens, as it gives us as the audience a chance to see what it is that man has created, and that it might not be the best investment to be involved with. The only problem I have with Spielberg's vision for 'Jurassic park' is the ending. Learning that he thought it up, I feel is a little corny and is too easy an escape for our characters, considering what they have escaped from before all this. Yet Spielberg did a great job in giving us a look at the wonder and/or scariness of the dinosaurs, as I believe I was moved almost every time I saw a scene with a dinosaur.<br/><br/>
This was definitely helped by the team that created these dinosaurs for Spielberg. The special effects are terrific, as the dinosaurs seem real and alive in this film. In the last few weeks I have seen films from a similar time as Jurassic Park, and the special effects were appalling. Now they were going to either make or break this film. Thankfully they were good enough to make this film. The dinosaur special effects were very well done by Stan Winston, Dennis Muren, Phill Tippett and Michael Lanteri.<br/><br/>The screen play was the inspiration of novelist Michael Crichton and David Koepp (from MI and MI2). The story to the film is taken from Crichton's novel on the same material. Although some of the character creations for the screenplay might be a little weak, the story is very interesting to see as<br/><br/>it unfolds, as the dinosaurs get into a very powerful position.<br/><br/>
At the forefront of the movie are palaeontologists and dinosaur experts Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Fern). They are convinced to come and evaluate a new 'family centric' park with living dinosaurs. The owner of the park is millionaire Dr. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough). The pair are initially overawed by what they see at the park. Neill and Fern are good in what they bring to the film, with Neill the standout, bringing a calmness and sensibility to his character, which keeps everybody from breaking down in many crisis situations.<br/><br/>Attenborough's character could have been better, as it is very strange how he reacts to the situation that he sees 'Jurassic park' in. The two young grandchildren of Hammond, Tim (Joseph Mazzello) and Lex (Ariana Richards) are very good, as they make us feel emotion for their many dangerous situations we see them in.<br/><br/>Yet the rest of the cast cannot get the same credit. Firstly you have a mathematician along for the joy ride here, his name is Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), who is only ever placed in the screenplay for some funny and some stupid lines. Then Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) is one of the computer experts, in charge of running Jurassic Park's main working centre. Now unfortunately Knight is not a good character here, as his storyline lacks in sense and does not add to the film, although it could have. If he got away with what he stole it would have been very interesting.<br/><br/>
The film has some very memorable moments. When the character's meet the many different dinosaurs, they truly have a sense of grandeur and amazement. The running herd of dinosaurs are wonderful, as they are very alive and it would be a dream to meet such a flock of animals. All the moments with T-Rex are terrifying, such as when the park shuts down and the two kids are attacked in their vehicle. The lawyer in the car makes a rather selfish and crazy choice. The kids also have a fascinating sequence, where they play hide and seek with two smaller dinosaurs in the park's kitchen.<br/><br/>The musical score to Jurassic Park is another of the film's highlights. Composed by the greatest movie composer ever, John Williams, the score gives the movie an awesome feel when it requires it. Then in an instant changes a scene to make the film seem terrifying. When a musical score does this to a film, it is hard not to be affected, as I know I was.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has been involved with some very impressive movie creatures, such as the scary shark 'Jaws', the very unique alien 'E.T', and of course the gruesome little buggers known as 'Gremlins', creatures that love to cause havoc. Now Spielberg has tinkered with Dinosaurs, awesome creatures that are very violent and destructive.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is a film that only confirms in my mind that dinosaurs are not meant to be played around with and shows what happens when man starts to play God. He soon realises that it is an area that he has no right to deal with. I like this film as I was entertained by the story, love the historical ideas that are presented by the dinosaurs and how man should only remember what Dinosaurs were like, as living with them in today's world could be catastrophic.<br/><br/>

Only real complaints are over length and some logic errors (like why the little boy doesn't try to get the gun to Sam and Laura when they're holding the door against the rapters)."

","Monster pictures don't get any better than this, especially if it's a Steven Spielberg movie. Throughout the years, Spielberg has made some of the most impressive fairy tales involving creatures from ""E.T."", and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" where the main characters experience an 'ooh' and 'ahh' moment where their imagination drives them out of their minds with an accomplish goal.<br/><br/>In ""Jurassic Park,"" a billionaire named John Hammond (Richard Attenbrouogh) has decided to play with mother nature by bringing the most dangerous animals in the world: dinosaurs. He pays to keep an abandoned island called Isla Nublar where he decides to bring his own theme park of dinosaurs to life for which he wants to bring in paleontologists Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), lawyer Donald Gennero (Martin Ferrero) and theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to evaluate what they think about the island.<br/><br/>When we first see the island with the Brachiosaurus walking and eating from a tree, we are stunned to see a creature like never before come to the 20th century. Even when we see a herd of herbivores walking together towards a lake, we see the scene full of grace and wonder to see that it's not such a bad idea after all to have creatures on the face of this earththink again.<br/><br/>In the film, the scientists and the theorist tell Hammond that it's a bad idea to bring creatures like dinosaurs into the 20th century where they have no idea where they are at and will destroy everything in their paths. Yet, Hammond wants to bring his dream to reality to attract the main audience: children. Hammond invites his grandkids Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzelo) to see what they think of the park; yet, Grant hates the idea of being a father. He even tells Ellie that kids are noisy, smelly and expensive.<br/><br/>The people inside the Jurassic Park control room are Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck) who is the game warden who knows everything about the Raptors and fears that they do more harm than the main attraction, the T-Rex; Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson) is one of the computer technicians along with Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight of ""Seinfeld"") who needs to get the embryos of every dinosaur species in order to get three million dollars and decides to shut down the security system in order to get the embryos.<br/><br/>As much as I gave away some of the plot of the film, what I liked about the film was the special effects and how ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) brought the dinosaurs to life. Jurassic Park may not have the best story line, but there is one thing that gets this film going: the nightmares of extinct dinosaurs coming to life."
"MF210","8","1","2","25 September 2003"," An Exercise in Special Effects
","My Rating: *** out of ****.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park represents good entertainment and a brilliant exercise in Special Effects. The Special Effects rank as some of the most impressive of the 90s. The action scenes are brilliantly executed. <br/><br/>The acting is probably the weakest point in the movie. You would probably expect this in this kind of movie. Sam Neil is believable as a scientist that isnt particularly fond of children. Laura Dern is equally believable as his partner, there was a sign of chemistry between them. Jeff Goldblum is the standout, all the good lines come from him. The kids are consistently annoying with their screaming and well mostly there just annoying. Samuel L. Jackson is in here briefly but he is memorable.<br/><br/>The story is mostly there for the special effects to be there. It is mostly unimportant, all you really need to see is the dinosaurs. They are so real you wont believe it. Jurassic Park is pretty well-paced, though some scenes maybe a bit overlong. The main reason to see Jurassic Park is for the special effects and to be entertained. Its not the best Spielberg film, but for two-hours you will be able to enjoy. Besides the special effects, nothing is really special about Jurassic Park. It represents something to entertain the audience and it succeeds."
"keuhkokala","8","1","2","1 September 2003"," Yay, dinosaurs!
","When I was a kid, I was really into dinosaurs. So when Jurassic Park came to the movie theaters it was like all my dreams had come true. The dinosaurs lived again. Well, I was eight. I grew up a little and the two sequels never really felt the same (Plus the fact that they are, especially #2, lame). And recently, when I re-watched the original movie I found it was actually kind of childish (well, it's a Spielberg movie) and full of the plot holes so big, T-Rex could get through them (and it did. In the end, when it entered the museum silently.).<br/><br/>Although the movie is twelve years old, its computer-created dinosaurs still look very realistic. That's a small wonder, regarding that most movies with effects a few years old look obsolete now, like Spider-Man or the Star Wars prequels. They rank alongside King Kong and Harryhausen's Thalos as stunning effects made with love, that make them last throughout ages. And no, dinos are not on the screen a second too little. Just look at what happened, when they were on the screen all the time in the Lost World! I'll have to say the movie is well paced meaning it's a good mixture of live actors talking and CG dinosaurs trying to eat them. The actors are good, the best being Sir Richard Attenburough. Wayne ""Newman"" Knight is a fun baddie, whereas Samuel L. Jackson has a rare role, where he doesn't steal every scene. In fact, you'll probably forget that he's even in it quite soon. And even the children are OK. <br/><br/>As this is a childhood movie for me, I can't get through a comment without talking some more about the dinosaurs. They are, of course, the real stars of the show. The best are the raptors, of course. I also like the Dilophosaurus (the one that kills Wayne Knight), but that may be due to the action figure I had, which could spit just like in the movie. <br/><br/>****<br/><br/>the Best Part (SPOILER): When the children are hiding in the kitchen and the raptors come in was scary as a kid, but it's still ace."

","As an avid fan of horror, sci-fi, and action flicks, I had become pretty numb to the adrenaline effects typically brought on by such movie experiences.  By the early 1990's, I figured I had seen it all and may never be frightened by a movie ever again...until Jurassic Park!  As a mother of young children, the ""t-rex attacking Tim and Lex"" scene just about knocked me into the theater aisle!  I couldn't get enough of the adrenaline factor. I watched the movie in theaters every weekend in the summer of 1994 and waited in agony for its release on VHS.  Now I own it (as well as II and III) on DVD and watch it every six months or so.  The continued appeal comes from the performances of Sam Neill and Robert Peck, the special effects, and the primary moral of the story (don't mess with Mother Nature)."

","Jurassic Park is one of my favourite films. It has a great plot, great acting, great writing and of course, great effects. I see alot of people bashing this film, but those people should remember that, if this movie had not been made, most of the movies made after it would not have been possible. Much of the CGI technology used today was developed for Jurassic Park. Sure, advanced CGI would have been developed without Jurassic Park, but it would have been very different. Todays films would be very different if this film haddn't been made. In fact, many of today's movies still can't compare to the CGI in Jurassic Park. It is an example of great film making and everyone involved in it should be applauded; everyone from the director to the actors to the best boy."
"Naggastos","9","1","2","5 January 2003"," Action packed dinosaur-fest
","The first time I saw Jurassic Park, I was 9 or 10 years old and really into dinosaurs. Mainly for that reason, this movie blew me away. The action, suspense, and well designed dinosaurs (both models and CGI) all combined to create a thrilling ride through a clash of time.<br/><br/>Compared to today's standards, and because most were models, the dinosaurs obviously weren't as neatly moving or looking. However, back in 1993 they looked amazing and seemed to have their own personalities (the cunning raptors, the ruthless T-rex, etc). Spielberg's directing was well done, with suspense built up in several scenes (for instance when Ellie runs through the trees to get to the isolated electrical shed).<br/><br/>The acting is good all round, with Sam Neill his usual serious self, Jeff Goldblum as the slightly odd mathematical genius, Wayne Knight humourously portraying the treacherous computer technician, and others fulfilling their roles satisfactorily. The acting isn't anything amazing, but works overall.<br/><br/>So, the best points of Jurassic Park are mainly the excellent action/suspense scenes, and the realistic (as far as we know) dinosaurs. Hugely popular in its day, but still a fun ride to go on.<br/><br/>Recommended to anyone who enjoys action involving big (and small) mean creatures!"
"druryd","8","1","2","12 December 2002"," A Very Good Movie, That Could Have Been Even Better!
","Jurassic Park is a very good movie, but it could have been even better. Very Good performances, amazing special effects and a decent plot.  So how do I think this movie could have been better, First I believe the addition of the grandchildren characters hurts rather than helps the film, but the real let down for me is the ending.  For the T-Rex to save the day at the end is absolutely ridiculous.  The T-Rex shows up at just the right time how convenient, why would it even be there or enter the building? Where was the opening for it to get in?  Why would it attack the raptors instead of the people? Why would the second raptor attack the T-Rex instead of fleeing? All very unlikely and really brings the whole movie down a notch for me.  It would have been much better ending if the Game Warden had survived and came in and blasted the raptors.  I'm sure Spielberg just wanted to give us one more scene with the T-rex but it would have been better to have it either chase the vehicle as they are driving the to the heli-pad or actually try and grab the helicopter.  With that all said, it is still a very good movie which I highly recommened."

","Rarely will a film capture my imagination and lose me in its own world. Jurassic Park is one of them.  After seeing the mosquito-in-amber trailer, I read the book and couldn't wait for the movie.<br/><br/>Spielberg was the only choice to direct this film.  He has one of the best and most recognizable styles of all directors.  From the opening moments, he leaves the audience knowing that a fantastic adventure will soon take place. He learned suspense from the best, and perfects it.  I loved the first scene on Isla Nublar, with the Raptor being transported to its holding pen. We don't see the animal, however, we really get the feeling that there is something horribly vicious inside!  We also get this feeling from the scene where the visitors witness the slaughter of a bull by raptors.  Spielberg does this with his lighting and sound effects, along with expertly paced editing.  When, after much suspense, he does show us the carnivorous dinosaurs, they are terrifying.  The T-Rex scene is a classic!  It is extremely intense and scary. <br/><br/>This movie has almost everything.  It has a great story, a great concept, and thrills galore.  What I guess it does lack the most is characterization, and although the characters are one-dimensional, they are brought to life well enough to tell the story.  My favorite character in the book and the movie was Muldoon (the big game hunter), although in the novel he didn't suffer the same fate as he did in the movie.  It still is a very good adaptation of Crichton's novel, and holds its own if you haven't read it. You can't have a summer without movies like this!  Grade; A."

Most movies of this kind (Independence Day, Godzilla, Armageddon, ect. Which I liked ALL of) are movies that don't really please like this movie. It's got really smart action sequences and fairly good acting but I think they should have used more popular stars, but you mostly concentrate on the dinosouars, which do good acting jobs. I thought they would have been nominated for Best Actresses. The f/x are another thing. They look really good! Only if the first half was more exciting but oh well. The rest of the movie makes up for that mistake. That leaves one more thing. The sequel. I thought the sequel was top notch. It was even better than this movie. In my opinion, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is just slightly better than the first because it starts out with more action. That's unlikly for sequels. Watch them both.

","Caution: a few spoilers throughout.<br/><br/>
The top film of 1993, Jurassic Park did a lot to pave the way for computer generated special effects. With a great premise and a top notch cast, Spielberg offers a special effects thrill ride that is impossible to forget.<br/><br/>
The premise is simple enough. Billionaire John Hammond (Attenborough), has created a zoological theme park that is getting ready to open. His problem is that a group of lawyers who are participating in funding want three scientists to give their approval. He enlists Phaleontoligist Alan Grant (Neill), Phaleobotonist Ellie Sattler (Dern), and Mathematician Ian Malcolm (A hilarious Goldblum), to give their approval. Also among the visiting group is a representative of the park's backers, Lawyer Donald Gennaro (Ferrero). What Hammond doesn't tell the visitors is that the park is made up of cloned dinosaurs. Everyone is enamored with the dinos. Everyone except Malcolm, that is. He has warned Hammond that the park is destined to collapse, according to his mathematical predictions. Hammond doesn't agree and invites his grandchildren Tim and Lex Murphy (Mazzelo and Richards) to view the park. Also of note in the list of characters is the park's Game Warden, Robert Muldoon (A very good Peck). The tour begins and the park's security system fails, due to disgruntled park employee Dennis Nedry's (Knight) tampering with of the system. Needless to say, The dinos get out, people are injured (Including Malcolm) and Grant is forced to lead the kids through the park.<br/><br/>
Speilberg pulls the same tricks here that he did with his first mega hit, Jaws, casting actors instead of superstars. While it's arguable which role would represten Quint (Either Neill's or Peck's) The Hooper character is definitely represented by Goldblum.<br/><br/>Now, on to the acting: Neill is ideal as the phaleontologist. Dern is very good as Ellie, Attenborough IS Hammond. And Bob Peck offers a very interesting portrayal as Muldoon. In the smaller roles, Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight, B.D. Wong, and Martin Ferrero do very well with what they're given, and Joseph Mazzelo and Ariana Richards are a perfect pair for the two kids.<br/><br/>But the show is consistently stolen by Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm. The character has so many hilarious one-liners that you are laughing constantly. After a Jeep with him, Peck and Dern narrowly escapes being destroyed by the T-Rex, he nonchalantly remarks ""Think they'll have that on the tour?"" While I like everything that Neill does, his character doesn't have as much humor as Goldblum's character does. It's too bad that he doesn't have as much to do in the movie's last act. It's also too bad that Goldblum didn't have as good a showcase for the Malcolm role, in the vastly inferior The Lost World: Jurassic Park!<br/><br/>Bottom line, sit down in a chair, forget the difficulties of cloning, and let yourself be amazed!<br/><br/>10/10 *****/*****"

"Skeletors_Hood","8","1","2","10 November 2001"," I liked it better as ""Frankenstein"" but still a great movie
","Please do not misunderstand me at all here.  I love this movie.  It was a great spectacle, and it still a thrill for me when I watch it.  I'm a long time dinosaur enthusiast, and I used to study them as often as I could, I collected books, toys, models, etc., anything that concerned itself with dinosaurs.<br/><br/>I just see this story as a modern retelling of Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein,"" and there isn't anything wrong with that, it's intertextuality, pure and simple, I just see past the hype that surrounds the movie and see it for the story that was presented. <br/><br/>
By now, you may think me mad by comparing this to ""Frankenstein.""  You'll say to yourself that I'm crazy and don't know what I'm talking about.  But answer me this; what is the difference between Victor Frankenstein and John Hammond?  They set out to create life for the sake of science, and in the end it costs them their lives.  The fundamental difference between the two is that Hammond is trying to exploit his creation for financial gain.  And Victor was so wrapped up in the aspect of discovery, that he was concerned more with wether he could than if he should.  Plus Victor's Monster and Hammond's T-Rex are the same entity, and perform the same role in both stories, insofar as they are the creations of one man trying to play god. And in the end, science was the cause for disaster in both stories, and both try to teach the wrongs of tampering with the unknown.<br/><br/>This of course does not take from the awe of this dino-tale at all.  It is wonderful, and the message still as powerful as it was in Shelley's story. I do like the dinosaurs in the movie.  I will not say that they look realistic, because for a comparative basis you must have been able to see a ""real"" dinosaur in the flesh, and I haven't seen any around recently.  But, they are convincing enough to suspend disbelief into accepting them as real in the world of the movie.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the talent assembled in the movie was wonderful, the actors were perfectly cast, especially Jeff Goldblum as Malcolm, who happens to be my favorite character.  The script followed the book with a few liberties, but that's Hollywood for you, but it still worked out in the end.<br/><br/>And so a great movie that is fun for all ages, even if you are a dino enthusiast or not.  The sequels did well to follow up on this story, and I feel that the movie is wonderful in its presentation, and is great for watching again and again."

","`Jurassic Park' is truly one of the last true Classics. It combines intellectual brilliance with action and suspense. Jurassic Park explores scientific theories of Chaos and the abuse of mankind's powers of science.<br/><br/>Unlike it's terrible and pointless sequels, the original Jurassic Park provides viewers with an unbelievable story that goes beyond people getting eaten by dinosaurs. For example, the scene when the tyrannosaurus rex escapes from his fence and attacks the Ford Explorer is far more than action. The scene goes for a good five minutes or so before the T-Rex eats anything or attacks anyone. Rather than just having the T-Rex  come out of his fence and begin attacking the Fords, Spielberg (and Chriton) build up suspense by letting the viewer wonder what the tyrannosaur is going to do next. The viewer actually sees what the children in the SUV do to make the the tyrant lizard king attack them before he actually attacks (I'll let you see the film to find out what that was).<br/><br/>Later in that scene, the Tyrannosaur come back towards the Explorer as Dr. Grant (Sam Neil) proceeds to help the kids out of the truck. Instead of having the T-Rex simply come and attack them right away, the scene, as before, builds up suspense by showing the dinosaur's foot stomp into the mud in front of them as they fear for their lives, and then the dinosaur begins sniffing around for the humans he wishes to dine on before he attacks the SUV. This is much better than having the T-Rex simply come back towards the truck and begin attacking it, because it makes the scene more memorable and long-lasting. In `The Lost World', `Jurassic Park's' Sequel, a similar scene was ruined when the tyrannosaurs simply came running up to the Mercedes-Benz SUV and in less than a minute and a half, was eating the man inside. When you produce a film that is all action, you have no story, and less suspense, but `Jurassic Park' avoids this because each action in the film is a reaction to something that has happened in the minutes before. The non-action events explain why the action happens, and build up suspense before the action happens.<br/><br/>The special effects are also outstanding in `Jurassic Park.' These dinosaurs look real. The action looks real. Out of any film Spielberg has ever directed, this one takes the cake in the field of outstanding special effects. In my favorite scene, discussed before, at the moment that the tyrannosaur comes out of the fence, the lighting was so perfect that it could not have looked more real. The way the dinosaurs walk, especially in that scene, looks very real and animal-like. Why wasn't `King Kong' scary? Because the Special Effects were so lousy. Why was `Jurassic Park' scary? Because those dinosaurs looked real! The sequel, `The Lost World,' had equally superb special effects, but they were ruined by lack of story and action scenes that happened too fast.  `Jurassic Park' was also full of superb sound effects, which was why it won an Oscar for that. The sounds of the dinosaurs and their mighty roars are another thing that made `JP' more realistic and more scary.<br/><br/>Although this film left out many things from the book, for the purpose of time restrictions, everything in the movie more or less follows the book closely. And although many people who read the book complain that the film was not as good, I feel that it is better because the movie left out many of the gory blood-and-guts elements that made the novel unsuitable for younger readers. This film is very suspenseful, but by no means gory. I feel that this film is suitable for anyone who won't be afraid of it. This film is also a heartwarming film about a man who hates children bonding with children, and finding his place in his heart for two special kids.<br/><br/>`Jurassic Park' is a  film of intense action, but also intense storytelling. It is a film which has special effects that amaze the eye and make the viewer believe. This film builds up suspense before anything happens. Before the viewer even see a dinosaur, they are afraid. The sound is realistic and Spielberg's directing reached it's all-time peak in the making of this 1993 film. `JP' is an excellent compromise between sticking to the novel's storyline and fitting the time slot, and that of providing horror without gore. All of this is the making of a true classic."

","When Jurassic Park was released in June 1993 we got a look at dinosaurs in a whole different view. The film had incredible special effects, but a movie cannot make it on special effects alone. The plot of this movie really carried the special effects. Most of the time it's the other way around. The plot stuck very closely to the book except for a couple of character issues. People got to see dinosaurs not just as giant lizard monsters but as living surviving animals. Ive read that there wasn't much character development. There was some development, but the development wasn't supposed to be on the characters it was supposed to be on cloning and the dinosaurs. The acting was very good, especially characters such as Ian Malcolm and Alan Grant. Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum did very good jobs of displaying these characters. Also, the late Bob Peck who was Robert Muldoon in the film gave incredible intensity to his character. For people who have forgotten the main plot, this movie is about a rich entrepreneur named John Hammond who has cloned dinosaurs and has built a tourist park on a remote island of the coast of Costa Rica. His corporate lawyer has concerns about the park and John invites a paleontologist, paleobotanist, theoretical mathematician, and his two grandchildren to experience and tour the island.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park's security system brakes down and the dinosaurs are let free.Then the tourists have to try to get jurassic park working again and get off of the island. So in all I have to say this is an incredible movie with a great special effects and a interesting cast and plot. ***1/2 out of ****"
"paleeoguy","Null","1","2","26 April 2001"," Appraisal for Jurassic
","Jurassic Park is surely a standard setter for all movies to come. Its revolutionary use of computer images ushered in a new era of movie special effects.  The plot is surely one of the most original (not to mention intriguing) that I have seen to come from any entertainment company for quite some time. Setting some of the dinosaurian inaccuracies aside (as in the Velociraptors really being Deinonychus and the Dilophosaurs being an eighth their real size) Jurassic Park is a film that will continue to entertain audiences for years to come.  It has a firm foundation in its plot and an ever-rolling dialogue.  Be warned that Jurassic is not just about carnivorous dinosaurs tearing people to shreds, it also focuses on the issues of genetic engineering. Michael Crichton wrote a thrilling, suspenseful book that could have only been done a certain justice by Steven Speilberg.  He intelligently cast the actors, scenario, and special effects crew. In closing,  I'd just like to say that Jurassic Park is a great movie for anyone who likes to imagine what it would be like to see a living, breathing dinosaur.  We were all kids at one time, and we reveled in a world of ""what if"".  Jurassic Park is great because it brings out that spirit in all of us."
"Gryosphere","10","1","2","30 March 2001"," Greatest movie of all time!!!
","Jurassic Park, is probably the greatest movie ever created, in my opinion. It was well planed out, and the dinosaurs were magnificant. I have never seen a better movie than this. The Lost World: Jurassic Park was a very good sequel to Jurassic Park, and Jurassic Park III looks to be maybe the best of them all. Sam Neill returns as Dr. Alan Grant, but this time he will be visiting Isla Sorna and not Isla Nublar. The new main dinosaur the Spinosaurus looks to be VERY awesome! Jurassic Park III may be the event hit of the summer. I am looking very forward to it. Also, I can't wait to see the trailer for it on May 4. But, July 18 will be the biggest day of the year 2001. Everybody go see Jurassic Park III. It will be GREAT!!!"
"Corsten","9","1","2","22 February 2001"," Finally...
","Well, I was browsing through the website, and I thought, 'whatever happened to that movie, ""Jurassic Park""'? Seeing as a third installment is brooding on the approaching horizon. So, I thought to myself, why not? Why not post a review on this film? So, here goes...<br/><br/>Well, what do we have here? Hmm, let's see...action, dinosaurs (that should actually be dinosaurs, then, action...) science, imagination, feasible plot, varying acting.<br/><br/>Well, the most memorable thing about this movie is, of course the effects and dinosaurs. Even now, eight years later, the dinosaurs look realistic and move believably. Time has not yet wreaked ravage on them, so that must say something.<br/><br/>The plot, and script are fine enough. The plot, credit for which must lie with the author of the book, the ol' boy Mike. With a little extended belief and a dollop of naievity, you have a feasible, even likely movie plot. It seems, unfortunately, there were problems in transistion from this to the scriptwriter...which is uncanny, seeing as there wasn't really much of a transistion. Why not? Because the credits state that the author of the novel is also the script-writer. Maybe Michael ought to stick with writing novels rather than scripts for movies.<br/><br/>The sound and lighting was all pretty faultless, and along with the scenery which obviously caused the designers much overtime in ensuring its realism, all paved the way for an impressive looking feature.<br/><br/>Spielberg's directing is, as ever, ubiquitous and lacking in any form of subtlety. It's always there - in the form of twee endings and, quite literally, unbelievable turn-outs. Still, he manages to pour the benefits of having a director of his experience on board, and the overall effect is pacey and slick.<br/><br/>Finally we come to the acting. Well, the general quality was high; shame about the two leads. Alan Grant had his moments, and though faltering periodically, wasn't too bad. No, what was distressing, was Laura Dern's performance. I feared for her as I watched the movie, I really did. Not because I thought she may get eaten, oh no. One could only wish. More like because she looked like she was in pain. Seriously, she was bent over for the whole movie. Watch her! All the way through - she is bending over, as if standing up straight would injure her back permanently. For that reason alone, I struggled to feel for her as she was set upon by the dinosaurs. Her acting was dubious at best, and I'm afraid falls far below the usual standard. The other actors range from fine and good, the best, arguably, being Jeff Goldblum. His trademark pauses, sarcasm and humour are all present. Top notch.<br/><br/>So, what of the movie as a movie? It isn't perfect, no film is - it could always be better - but it goes a long way along that path. It blew me away when I first saw it - and still does now. Very entertaining. If you haven't seen this movie, you need your head-checking!"

Admittedly, the film isn't very well paced, with whopping areas where the only object of fascination is Sam Neill's face, but the now-famous T-Rex chase and bit-with-raptors are both landmarks of cinema and a little bit pant soiling.

"adyroy","Null","1","2","25 July 2000"," One of the most overrated movies ever
","I've seen Jurassic Park a few times, and each time get more and more disappointed by it.  It has to be one of the most overrated movies ever (coming in right after a sinking-ship flick I won't bother to discuss here). A possible reason for my disgust comes from the fact that I read the book the day before I saw the movie.  Talk about a letdown.  The book's action sequences, had they been filmed as written, would have put several of the film's action sequences to shame.  In addition, the ""moralizing"" and ethical questioning from the novel is much more compelling and sophisticated than the dumbed-down tripe we finally see in this film.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong -- the movie isn't a bomb, just overrated.  Yes, the CGI were revolutionary and ushered in a new era of filmmaking;  much of the action truly thrilled and terrified me and still does so today, and the concept was a fascinating one with (as we now know) a somewhat sound scientific basis.<br/><br/>However, the holes in the plot are huge and frequent.  Subplots and scientific factoids from the book are given some compulsory screen time, only to be completely forgotten when the chasing and slaughter begins.  I left the movie asking, ""But what about...?"" over and over, with no answers in sight.  The acting is passable at best, grating at worst (those frustrating Spielberg cookie-cutter kids being one notable example), and the dialogue wanders from scientific b.s. to pure Hollywood kitsch.  Much of the science in the movie is also silly and poorly executed, yet it's hard to stop and notice for all the scaly beasties running amok.<br/><br/>The ""never tampering in God's domain"" preaching was about as subtle as a T-Rex walking through an electric fence.  I was hoping to see a movie with sophisticated, thoughtful characters that acted like adults and were involved in a compelling, desperate situation.  Instead I saw a sanitized, over-edited, Speilberg-ized ""family adventure"" (translation:  something with an attention span and the intelligence of an 8-year-old).<br/><br/>I think I'm one of the few people that actually liked ""The Lost World"" better (at least in a few respects) than the original.  It's not as boring (the first half of this movie is a total snoozer), and it doesn't try to be so preachy.  It's just a bunch of big lizards runnin' around eatin' people and scarin' the heck out of everybody.  Not that I'm advocating more brainless action flicks (we have too many of those already), but at least the sequel didn't take itself so seriously.<br/><br/>Watch Jurassic Park once on a big screen TV with good sound and you'll be blown away.  I don't recommend more viewings -- could be unhealthy."
"johnbobc","1","16","111","9 October 2005"," Jurassic Puke
","This has to be the worst, most manipulative, lowbrow, dreadful film I have ever seen. You cannot be older than 10, or have an IQ higher than the outside temperature on a blizzard-ridden midwinter's day in Antarctica, to appreciate this film. Goldblum is dreadful beyond belief- he can't even chew gum properly, and Neill and his girlfriend, whoever it is that plays her, are badly cast and deliver the disgracefully bad dialogue with cringe-inducing cheesiness. It is obvious from this that Spielberg values money and the distorted kind of fame that making the Blockbuster as an end-in-itself seems to guarantee, above all considerations of art or intelligence. His capitulation here to the lowest common denominator would be irredeemably shameful were it not for the moderate modicum of redemption he gained by making 'Schindler's List'. I imagine, and dearly hope, that Spielberg learnt his lesson from this disgraceful farce, so clearly engineered for people with an eight-year old mentality. Ironic, then, that this revolting tripe carried a PG-13 rating in many countries? Probably not. A lot of people seemed to love Jurassic Puke. Me being elitist? Possibly. A case of mass mental illness? Probably."
"Ziya90","2","6","32","24 December 2009"," A tour in the park
","To me, Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest directors of all time, just one movie is enough to call him a master; Saving Private Ryan. Jurassic Park was a very big disappointment to me, because I had expected much more from Spielberg, instead, it was a solid and at times very slow paced and mediocre adventure film. The first half was like an interminable introduction, it was too slow paced, I expected some action or fun, had none of them. Then I ask, where is fun in the first half? I had expected a perfectly directed, also perfectly written action, suspense, suspense or a gribbing story, but it was uninteresting till the second half. The only successful thing in the movie is visual effects, as you know, it was a revolutionary experience in cinema in that year. I appreciate, but as an adventure or action, I think that the movie is just OK. In the second half, I had expected that there would be a battle between the family and the dinosaurs. A do-or-die fight, but couldn't find anything spectacular. JP is a movie which when you are shocked by electric wire, nothing happens, but your hair bristles! Jurassic Park is like a tour in the park rather than being trapped feeling. When the family arrives Jurassic Park, we see dazzling dinosaurs, CGI is flawless and the famous car scene takes place which was impressive, but no more than that."
"meebly","3","5","27","10 November 1998"," Nothing HAPPENS in this movie!
","Two hours worth of vintage special effects, the likes have which have never been placed on screen, are corrupted by screenwriters Michael Crichton (who authored the book) and David Koepp's refusal to incorporate anything remotely resembling a plot or characters. Crichton's book, which was tedious but rich with characterizations and scientific plausibility (without being overly technical) gives way to a script in which the characters have no personalities, the scientists have no backgrounds to bring them or their ideas to this point, and the dinosaurs are, for all intents and purposes, just THERE. You can say all you want about how wonderful it was be frightened to death by real-looking dinosaurs (would you really know one if you saw it?), but even ""Land of the Lost,"" a 1970's Sat. morning live-actioner about a man and two children (his own) transported back in time and trying to survive amid free-roaming dinosaurs, had more of a plot than this garbage. And for all the hype about visuals, I, for one, would like to think we still go to the movies to be drawn into another world and other lives, not just an amusement park. Look for a few good one-liners out of Jeff Goldblum as chaos-theorist Ian Malcolm (allegedly based on at least one real-world ecologist), and completely lifeless performances from the otherwise reliable Sam Neill, Samuel L. Jackson and actor-turned-Gandhi-director Richard Attenborough, as well as non-actress Laura Dern. Just as a footnote: The ""Jurassic Park"" thrill-ride attraction opened at the Universal Studios theme park in Southern California in June 1996. A theme park is exactly where this whole ""movie"" really belongs."

"The-Sarkologist","3","3","14","20 May 2013"," I still do not understand all of the hype
","The first thing that I didn't like about this film was all of the hype. I remember when it was first released in the cinema and everybody on the media just raved about the special effects. Then I read in the Los Angeles Times an add saying ""If you have seen it once, it is not enough, see it again."" This was simply a blatant way of saying, ""give us more money"" and at that point I decided that I would not see this movie until it either came on television or somebody else paid for it. When I first saw it, somebody else paid for it and my opinion was that I expected more. When I saw it a second time on television my second opinion was that it was boring.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a book by Michael Crichton. As is standard the book is much better and dives into the ethics of creating dinosaurs for profit. The movie touches on the ethics but it is more of a special effects fest with little else. The movie did not hold me the second time around and as such I have decided that this movie is simply not worth seeing again.<br/><br/>The ethics of creating dinosaurs is the theme that is explored in the movie. A mosquito with dinosaur blood is found and from the blood the DNA sequence is recreated and thus dinosaurs are able to be cloned. A scientist thus does this and buys an island to place them on. He uses frog DNA to fill in the gaps, which causes a problem. He purposely creates females so that he can control their growth, but frogs have been known to change sex in a single sex environment.<br/><br/>The professor is trying to play God by creating the dinosaurs. Not only that but he is trying to control them and even make money from them. The movie goes on to have the system keeping the dinosaurs under control breaking down and allowing them to escape. As such it shows us that no matter how powerful we are, we are never in complete control. Humans can betray us, computers can break down, and unthinking creatures can not be anticipated.<br/><br/>The other thing that irked me about the movie was the Veloceraptor. I thought that it was simply too intelligent. These creatures are dinosaurs yet they were opening doors. They opened the movie by saying that the Veloceraptors were intelligent but I my disbelief came into full swing when their intelligence was equated with that of humans, that is they were able to open doors. Cats have been known to do that but that is after years of watching humans do it. The veloceraptor was in a cage and within half an hour of escaping, was able to open doors.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is not a great movie. In fact it is quite dull. When I first saw it, girls were screaming but I didn't find it scary. The second time I fell asleep, constantly. Watch it once and then don't bother."
"Rovin","4","3","14","14 August 1999"," Jurassic failure as Frankenstein ripoff and Harryhausen homage
","I suspect that the makers of Jurassic Park inserted a subliminal message into the film like ""YOU MUST LOVE THIS MOVIE."" or ""SHUT YOUR BRAIN OFF!"" or ""PLOT AND DIALOGUE DONT MATTER!"" since so many people seem to be under the illusion that this is a good movie--when it has some of the worst dialogue and annoying characters I have ever had to endure, and a non-existant story structure. <br/><br/>Dinosaurs are cloned, but we get little sense of the moral issues surrounding this. We have no sympathy for the dinosaurs, nor do we have discernable villians to hate. Hammond is portrayed as a cruel industrialist one minute(when feeding the raptors), and a Daddy Warbucks the next(the hatching of the raptor). The scientists who did the sinful deeds are in the background, and we are left with a lawyer to hiss at! Some may say the Raptors are the villians, but this insults the Frankenstein mythos(since the raptors were created by humans). If there is any discernable moral to the story it is that Alan Grant goes from hating children to ""kinda liking"" them--which is amazing when considering the whiny brats he was stuck with.<br/><br/>
But I could forgive the moral nihlism of the story if it wasnt for the hackneyed action of the narrative. A few humans running around for two hours, whining and gushing at the big dinos does not for great entertainment make. It lacked the imagination of King Kong, or the spectacle of Harryhausen's Gwangi effects work."

","It's perhaps not fair to judge a film 20 years after it came out, but on the other hand, that's how people define classics. This film fails. Yes, stunning CGI effects. Great photography. But the script is horrible. First, Spielberg's standby dysfunctional American family is in full bloom, with smart aleck kids and incompetent adults who when faced by technical challenges and alleged science seem to have an attention span of a five year old. No one listens to anyone else, no one collaborates, and the only voice of reason philosopher Dr Malcolm is played by Jeff Goldblum as a caricature. Every conceivable corny camera set up or angle is exploited, every lush note of John William's heroic score is designed to substitute the lack of human chemistry among the cast, every character reacts in a stereotypical fashion. Granted, perhaps Spielberg wanted idiot-savants (kids and adults alike) to showcase the dinos' personality, but even here we are treated to ridiculously anthropomorphised creatures instead of nature in the raw. I mean, dinos opening doors? The T-Rex was scary because it was hunting, not playing. Even the park's UNIX computer system is given a ridiculously amusing and needlessly complicated graphics Next-Generation interface to heighten the drama of rebooting the system after it is sabotaged. Not that this interface wasn't doable in 1993, but no one-of specialised system would have anything but text commands for such a massively complicated park. So, humanised computers, humanised dinos, but one dimensional humans. If it wasn't for the massive publicity campaign that let it slip that the film was 'about' hubris and so worthy of being taken seriously, this wouldn't pass muster with any but the simple-minded. In the end, the script is completely predictable, and no amount of gorgeous camera work can substitute hackneyed plotting."
"sddavis63","5","2","8","1 October 2011"," If You See A T-Rex - DON'T MOVE!!!
","There are a lot of good things about ""Jurassic Park."" The effects on the dinosaurs are excellent. The dinosaurs look, sound and move like real animals. They are completely and totally believable. There's a good reflection on the dangers involved when humanity insists on interfering with the natural world - dinosaurs went extinct without any help from human beings; maybe - even if we could bring them back - human beings should leave them that way is the most direct theme of the movie, although one can easily see the application of that theme about the dangers of human interference in the natural scheme of things going far beyond dinosaurs. And when ""Jurassic Park"" is exciting - it's very exciting and when it's suspenseful it's very suspenseful. I think of the t-rex chasing the car and trying to get at the children, or the children desperately hiding and trying to escape from the velociraptors. That's all well done, and the children were actually pretty good in their parts, very believably terrified. This is one of the better performances I've ever seen from children. But, to be honest, it wasn't very consistent.<br/><br/>The action was good when there was action. There were, however, sustained moments when there really wasn't very much action and when not much interesting was happening. Actually, that sums up much of the first half of the movie. In addition to that, we were given a collection of characters that I for one at least didn't really care about - at least two of whom (Dr. Malcolm, played by Jeff Goldblum, and Dennis, played by Wayne Knight) seemed totally extraneous to the story. Neither part was necessary to move this along. Dr. Malcolm's ""chaos theory"" really didn't interest me, and Dennis added a ""conspiracy"" element to the story that really went nowhere. Everything that happened could have been explained by natural causes - like the big storm approaching! Even the children, as well acted as the parts were, seemed like a rather forced addition. It's almost as if someone realized that having no characters to really care about (as I mentioned above) was a problem, and so a decision was made to add a couple of kids for that purpose. Even the leads (Sam Neill and Laura Dern) didn't come across to me as giving much spark to their characters.<br/><br/>For all the strengths of this movie - and they were many - there were also more than a few weaknesses.

","John Hammond is a PT Barnum style billionaire and as such wants to create the greatest show on Earth. Through the miracle of science and some preserved dinosaur DNA trapped in amber he recreates an entire range of dinosaur species. To check out his island he invites a number of scientists to endorse it for the brochure or something. Anyway after invoking Murphy's law (What can go wrong will go wrong) it all goes wrong and the Doctor's soon find themselves at the wrong end of the dinosaur experience.<br/><br/>At the time this was the most successful film of all time. I never really saw why? There were lots of other films before (Jaws, Star Wars, Raiders) and since (Matrix, Inception, Transformers, even) that are all better paced, acted, written special effects-ed. The beginning sequence when a worker is eaten and they try to shock it looks, well, cheap to be honest. Due to them using multi-coloured lights in the container it looks like a disco. This opening thrilling bit didn't work me, and then the pace of the film slows down even more as we then get a huge preamble until anything exciting actually happens as plot plot plot plot plot is explained over and over and over again. <br/><br/>Eventually we get to the good stuff and some actual dinosaur moments as the T-Rex finally appears, but then we get to the real killer, the thing that trashes the movie, the set piece with the car falling down the ravine that isn't there. We watch the dinosaurs walk out of a flat pen and then five minutes later that isn't a flat pen, but a massive drop ravine. It's just utter nonsense and from that point I had switched off as clearly the makers had so little regard for the viewer they thought that they could have anything happen and no-one will question it. This is no minor effect error or continuity blooper, it's an entire set piece that forgets where people have walked out of. For a movie this hyped it's just not good enough.<br/><br/>At the time it was praised by critics as being one of the best films ever. While it's sad that it's still far higher than it should be (try watching it again, folks. It's slow as hell)nit's good to see that some element of sanity has returned to this films rating.<br/><br/>That said it's a five alone for Bob Pecks thighs, they're stunning and they're not even an effect."

Neil would be good in the third, but Goldblum sucked in the second.  The kids as some have mentioned are kind of annoying, but you learn to put up with it. Samuel L.

This movie had NO POINT whatsoever. I was lead to believe early on that there would be some sort of ""don't mess with Mother Nature"" moral to the story. Instead, things went to hell strictly because of human greed, rather than as a direct result of us playing God.<br/><br/>Did it have redeeming qualities? Yes, barely. Jeff Goldblum's hilarious character, for one, and a couple of all too rare decent child actors. Normally I would include the ""general concept"" as a redeeming quality, because I've always been good at filling in the blanks of a bad plot with my imagination, but there is a limit.

Of course this will turn out badly. The huge beasts are set free when the electrical fences are put off by mistake or something else I cannot remember now and chase the visitors and the park premises.
As a matter of fact one of the characters at a certain moment doubts that it is legitimate to reverse the natural evolution process recreating species that Nature has destroyed and putting them to live together with human beings that didn't exist at the time of those extinct species.

","I vividly recall my friend coming over the day he saw 'Jurassic Park' and telling me that it was the best movie he'd seen since 'Star Wars'. That set the bar awfully high, and while my experience wasn't quite the same as his, I was certainly in awe of the amazing special f/x and I did enjoy my self immensely. Over the years I've revisited the original about once every five years or so, and each time I actually gain a bit more of an appreciation for it. The wonder and discovery of the first act is something they were never able to re-capture in the sequels (for obvious reasons) and the white-knuckle intensity of its action scenes are proof of just how good Spielberg was at this sort of thing before he started making these kinds of popcorn films more out of obligation than passion.<br/><br/>The cast is great, with Sam Neill proving to be a charming lead in what could've been a thankless roll. Richard Attenborough is an absolute delight, Laura Dern is likeably spunky and Jeff Goldblum steals every scene he's in as the eccentric ""chaotician"" Ian Malcolm. My one complaint has always been sidelining Malcolm in the third act.<br/><br/>This really is a grand adventure. A sort of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' meets 'Jaws', fitting given they're all directed by the same man."

The dinosaurs chasing the main characters was also hilarious and the acting in those parts was impressively good. Truthfully, I found small parts in the movie where actual science came into play, but the movie is mostly based off of a popular idea of ""what would happen if dinosaurs decided to come back to life""?

","JURASSIC PARK has one thing above all else going for it: those dinosaurs. Unfortunately, the uneven performances of most of the cast tend to undermine even THOSE fx. Laura Dern appears BEMUSED throughout the whole thing, like a kid who's wandered onto a playground when in fact she was looking for an indoor outhouse; she appears oddly out of place. Likewise, Attenborough himself: he often seems to be waiting for direction. Goldblum constantly mutters to himself like he's stumbled into the wrong movie and can't figure out how to get out. His reactions to the monsters are almost sedate. Sam Jackson literally chain-smokes his way through his wantonly gratuitous scenes as if he has nothing better to do. The best performances are those of the dinosaurs. I guess THAT really sums this one up for me. It COULD'VE been Great, but is, ultimately, a mediocre movie with great fx."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","3","10 April 2013"," Still Some of the Best Special Effects You're Going to See
","Jurassic Park (1993) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel about a group of people invited to an island to try out a new amusement park, which just happens to have real dinosaurs on it. Before long there's a breach in the security and the dinosaurs are running loose and man has to face them. JURASSIC PARK was recently re-released in 3-D and I must say that I really didn't think the format made the film any better or worse. There were a few nice shots in the 3-D but overall I'd say people can just be happy with the original version. As for the movie itself, I still remember the lines around the block when this thing came out and I still remember the hype of opening day. I've always thought this was a good movie but at the same time I have never fallen in love with it like so many other have. I think my biggest problem with the picture is that I just didn't find it scary enough. Spielberg spends the first half of the movie getting the viewer to let their mind go in the wonder of dinosaurs being alive. The second half of the film is when the action takes place and I just didn't find any of it scary. I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that I never believed for a second that any of the major characters were ever going to be harm and I won't spoil how the film turned out. Outside of that, the film is technically well-made by Spielberg who does a great job hinting at what we're about to see early on before actually bringing out the dinosaurs. Once they're released on screen you can't help but be impressed by the special effects, which hold up incredibly well when viewed today and I think a strong argument can be made that these type of effects haven't been beaten by any other film. Another major plus is that we're given a good cast but I will say Jeff Goldblum's one-liners are as bad today as they were in 1993. The music score from John Williams is another classic as it too really brings this fantasy world to life and makes you believe in the miracle of how they came to be. JURASSIC PARK certainly isn't one of my favorites but it still has a lot going for it that makes it worth seeing."

","Upon hearing that Steven Spielberg was planning on releasing Jurassic Park, I immediately bought Michael Crichton's book and read it. Since I love science, I was mesmerized with all the scientific aspects which sounded VERY believable. The rich details of the island, scientific processes, and fears for the characters on the island caused me to start from page one once I finished the book. If you are into biology, genetics, or science, in general, this is an awesome book. When I went to watch the movie I had images of the book in my imagination and I was deeply saddened to see that the visual representation only teased some of the aspects of the book. I thought that with Crichton writing the screenplay, the movie would closely resemble the book, but I was wrong. He left out all the best parts and inserted ideas that weren't as good as his book. It is true that Crichton adapted a screenplay with one image in mind: teeth. He understood that, like in Jaws, movie-goers love flesh eaters. Computer generated dinosaurs with menacing teeth running amuck on an island is basically the standard he lowered his book to. He eliminated the experiments the scientists made to create the dinosaurs, the egg factories, prehistoric plant life, how the dinosaurs evolved to reproduce on their own, and the fact that some dinosaurs escaped the island from his book. Sure, I thought the movie was cool, if it was a stand alone, but when you compare it to the book it was a flop. Then Crichton did the unimaginable, he wrote two more adaptations and released movies for them. He understands that the public, especially children, wants to see more `chomping,' hence the PG-13 rating. Now, I've noticed that he plans on releasing a fourth installment in 2005. Sounds like a rental to me."

State-of-the-art computer generated special effects are the true stars of the film thanks to Industrial Light and Magic and Stan Winston's Oscar-winning special effects creatures, in making flesh and blood monsters eye-poppingly real.  Despite many plot and character changes and the not-appropriate carnage for very young viewers, the film is an adventure to behold: best scene is the Tyrannosaurus Rex' first appearance."

"claudemercure","8","1","3","15 August 2002"," a return to form for Spielberg
","I've noticed the general public often lumps Steven Spielberg movies in with the rest of Hollywood product (because they're popular), and it drives me nuts. The guy is an artist, and shouldn't be placed in the same category as hacks like Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay. Granted, the period from 1986 to 1992 was a pretty dry one for him. This is why I was so excited when I saw this movie.<br/><br/>Like a roller-coaster, this witty, very entertaining adventure/fantasy climbs that first hill slowly (the first half hour feels forced), but once it gets going, it is terrifically scary, with exhilarating, inventive, expertly staged suspense scenes, which will carry you over plot holes and implausibilities. The script is unfortunately as schlocky as its source (a Michael Crichton novel). The story could easily have turned laughable, but it was skillfully handled. The only other flaw of importance is the self-conscious acting of the child actors, especially Joseph Mazzello, who acts like someone who watches too much TV. <br/><br/>What breathes life into this movie is Spielberg's sense of wonder. And it's the first time since The Color Purple that it feels like he's fully invested in a movie. This was the first time he makes extensive use of computer-generated effects, and perhaps this new toy fired up his imagination. When digital effects first became popular, Spielberg and James Cameron were the only two directors who truly knew how to use them. No one else used them with as much imagination and purpose. Digital effects felt as though they were merely inserted with a click of the mouse. In Jurassic Park, you can tell a lot of work and imagination went into perfecting the images (down to individual drops of rain on a dinosaur's head) so they would be as real to the audience as possible. Spielberg magically transports you to the world he has created."
"Bors","Null","1","3","4 September 1998"," A movie that ALMOST makes up for its flaws in adrenaline
","When I first saw this film in the cinema, I was enchanted. But after mulling it over and re-reading the book, I found that, while it was certainly a visually interesting film, it was, in fact, rather empty. The book employs itself in going on about genetics, chaos theory and environmentalist policies. The movie only addresses these issues in two scenes. Had there been more scenes in this respect, I would have liked the movie more."
"Auselan","7","1","3","30 July 2001"," In depth analysis
","Based on a rather slow moving book by Michael Crichton (Sci-Fi author and screenwriter of ER), The movie Jurassic Park is an excellent adaptation that provides staple entertainment.  The movie has flaws  some of the typical cliché's of Sci-Fi movies, but is presented so well, that we can forgive it and enjoy a good old-fashioned Dino romp.<br/><br/>The central theme of the book  Chaos theory  underpins the plot, but it fails to come across effectively in the film.  While chaos theory finds order and pattern in apparent disorder, the film bastardises this into the philosophy that `life cannot be contained', as embodied by the dinosaurs. They break through the boundaries of time through being reincarnated, and then proceed to defy the control imposed upon them by the park owners. This theme is at times subtle (such as when the lawyer trips on some uneven rocks), and at times garishly unsubtle, such as some of the debates that take place.  If it were not for Jeff Goldblum's superbly awkward acting of mathematician Ian Malcolm as he explains, it would be cringeable, and yet he pulls it off  we can forgive him.  Again, however we are made aware that the screen adaptor did not understand chaos theory  he has his `Chaotician' (a mathematician specialising in chaos theory) telling us that chaos theory is all about unpredictability and chaos (and implies a celebration of such concepts).  WRONG! Chaos theory is the opposite  it says that there are patterns in chaos, even if they are too complex for us to understand. Mathematicians are the worlds best at managing order.  In the book we are educated about chaos theory, fractals and such matters which apparently are too deep for the big screen.  Dr.Malcolm's little potted theme `life breaks free' about how living things cannot be controlled is even proved wrong  we watch a dumb placid cow being hoisted to its doom, still chewing the cud like the controllable beast that it is.  Shame on you cow, for your poor acting skills  didn't anyone tell you to wriggle about a bit?<br/><br/>The characters are rather hit and miss, a flaw present in the original book, which is not character focussed  rather pop-science and monsters based. None are particularly likeable or memorable, and even Richard Attenborough struggles to maintain sincerity in his acting.  His character, Hammond (the orchestrator of the park) is a supreme control freak, and he is good at it. He succeeds in manipulating our two protagonists into visiting the island by waving his fat cheque book: we loose all respect for them at this point. We are slowly shown how paper thin Hammond's control is, first by the jerky helicopter landing, then by how easily the scientists escape his guided tour  indoors, and later outdoors when they leave their vehicles in the middle of the next tour.  His statement of `No expense spared' is revealed to be a complete lie as it is his underpaying one of his employees that undoes the park.  Left at being said once, this would be a nice irony, however, the line becomes laboured after a while, and after the n-th time it is said, our upper lips curl impatiently.<br/><br/>Dr Grant (Sam Neill) is a simple run-of-the-mill luddite who is a fossil himself  unwilling to co-operate with technology (he cannot even do up his seatbelt).  While the character is unsubtle, Sam Neill does look rather like a dinosaur, and the zooming in close ups are in keeping with the films shots of the dinos.  Apart from that, he is rather dull, and is only partly saved by the growth of his affection to the children (a cheap way of making us like him, that did not fool me).<br/><br/>Despite such flaws, there is a solid scientific basis for the film, with nice explanations that are plausible with no need for deeper exploration. In the light of the cloning in recent years, the JP concept is even more acceptable.<br/><br/>It is not enough to call this just another special effects movie, as if that in itself belittles it.  The excellent documentaries on the DVD provide insight into the enormous effort that went into making the film look so effortlessly good, employing Industrial Light & Magic (George Lucas' SFX company), THX (Lucas' digital sound company) and top animators, the results are truly breathtaking, especially in the cinema (other links with Star Wars include a soundtrack by John Williams, and James Earl Jones narrating the documentary).<br/><br/>Computer imaging and animation are art forms, and like most art forms, attempt to recreate life; to understand it.  Whereas quality fiction authors look at character and plot in an attempt to mimic human society, sci-fi authors use their imagination to further existing ideas and create new worlds, focusing on a more immediate and less subtle approach such as brightly coloured lasers and massive aliens.  What they skimp in character and plot (and they always do), they make up for in creativity in other areas.  It is very rare to excel in more than one area of creativity  it takes a genius such as Leonardo Da Vinci to be a superb painter AND a genius scientist.  JP will never be Shakespeare, but then Shakespeare never had dinosaurs walking about munching on each other, which is also pretty fun too. 7/10"
"virek213","10","1","3","30 July 2001"," Past, present, and future collide on Isla Nublar
","After pretty much hitting the bottom with HOOK, Steven Spielberg bounced back in 1993 with the double-barrel triumph of JURASSIC PARK and SCHINDLER'S LIST.  JURASSIC PARK would become only the second film to gross over a billion dollars (E.T., another Spielberg film, had passsed the mark prior to JURASSIC PARK's release), and win three Oscars in the technical fields (sound, sound effects editing, special effects).<br/><br/>Spielberg collaborated with sci-fi writer Michael Crichton for this amazing and suspenseful look at how an ambitious billionaire (Richard Attenborough) finds a way to clone dinosaurs from fossilized DNA and turn this discovery into a reason for an island amusement park 200 miles off of Costa Rica. The problem, however, is what noted paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill) points out: because dinosaurs and Man have been separated by sixty-five million years of evolution and are now suddenly living together, ""How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect?""<br/><br/>Pretty much everything, is the answer, as Grant, paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Attenborough's two grandkids (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards) find themselves at the mercy of the dinosaurs when park security systems are shut off by the park's computer specialist (Wayne Knight) as he tries to smuggle dinosaur embryos off the island.  Not all the dinosaurs are to be feared, of course; but then, there's also T-Rex and Velociraptor to contend with.<br/><br/>The 'PG-13' rating attached to JURASSIC PARK is very appropriate; there is intense suspense and brief graphic violence within.  But neither this film nor its two (so far) sequels are violent monster bloodbaths.  Neill and Dern are excellent in their roles, as is Jeff Goldblum in his role as chaos theorist Ian Malcolm.  John Williams' now-classic score seals the deal for JURASSIC PARK."

Chaos ensues from that point on. The T-Rex breaks loose from his fencing and almost kills the mathematician (whose name in the movie is Ian Malcolm), eats a lawyer (whose name is Donald Gennaro), almost eats the paleontoligist (Alan Grant) and the two children (Alexis or Lex Murphy and Timothy or Tim Murphy), and almost eats the paleobotanist (Ellie Satler), the game warden (Robert Muldoon), and Ian Malcolm (again!).

If you enjoy thrillers and just want to see people getting wiped out by dinosaurs, then this is the film to see. As usual, its plot is really weak, and the characters are pretty two-dimensional.

"rmax304823","7","1","4","16 October 2006"," Some mean mothers --
","As a critic, Edgar Allan Poe had a simple theory of literary aesthetics. Throw logic out the window and go for the effect. Does it really MATTER why the guy is in a pitch-black room with a pit in the middle and a scythe swinging overhead? As a novelist Michael Crighton is too much the techie to ignore logic. He gives us a step-by-step recreation of the process by which dinosaurs can be resurrected. Then he throws in some kinds of his own. He has a juvenile T. rex finding a helpless human being that is about to become a meal. And the dinosaur plays with his victim, the way a cat plays with an injured mouse. A bit of a stretch because, unlike mammals, reptiles aren't known for their playfulness.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's movie version of the novel is epic, heroic, monumental -- and big. Everything about it is big. The novel, grand enough in itself, seems to have exploded gloriously on the screen. And, the introductory explanation of dinosaur resurrection aside, it follows Poe's theory closely. One glitch in the system and the id is loosed on a dozen or so people in Jurassic Park, a kind of living Disneyland. (Attenborough: ""Nothing works perfectly the first time. When Disneyland was first opened nothing worked."" Goldblum: ""When The Pirates of the Caribbean stopped working, the pirates didn't eat the tourists."") After the glitch, similar to the one in Crighton's ""Westworld"", the administrators and experts running the park have to do a lot of running themselves to escape the various man eaters. It was sharks in Spielberg's ""Jaws."" And, man, that must be one primeval fear. Everybody faces eventual dissolution, running out of telomeres, but being EATEN ALIVE is another matter. A common dream involves being chased by some unknown monstrous anthropophage while we seem to slog in slow motion through a pond of molasses.<br/><br/>And people do get eaten in this movie. The first two of them are bad guys anyway, one an overweight, giggling industrial spy who is so stupid he tries to play ""fetch"" with his pursuer. The other is ""a blood-sucking lawyer"" who is snapped up while sitting on the john.<br/><br/>The movie is one big set piece after another. It isn't possible to describe them all, and not necessary really, because if you can think of a suspenseful scene that might take place in this kind of narrative context, you'll find it here. There are innumerably cross-cuts between a catastrophe about to happen and someone elsewhere feverishly trying to prevent the catastrophe from happening. Chase scenes abound -- on open plains, among museum displays, in computer rooms, in cars, in large kitchens. Someone hollers to someone else who is threatened: ""Don't move! He can only see you if you MOVE!"" The potential victim moves.<br/><br/>A lot depends on special effects and CGI and they are splendid. The dinosaurs seem real enough, attended by appropriate sounds. (The sound man should get a medal.) Not just roars but chirps, whistles, the patter of heavy rain drops on Plexiglas, the thud of gigantic reptilian feet on earth. ""Impact tremors"", observes Goldblum. The musical score never leaves us in doubt about what we are supposed to feel. The first sight of a couple of those towering beasts is accompanied by a heavenly choir. (A neon sign should be blinking, ""Awe"".) Spielberg lets his story and his imagination run wild and it carries you along. The whole family will be glued to the set. If the theme had been cheerier it could easily have been made by the old Walt Disney studio.<br/><br/>A slight problem is that when you go for big effects you sometimes lose a little in the way of continuity. I mean, the fat guy playing ""fetch"" with his killer, for instance. And then there are Sam O'Neill and the two kids, traipsing through the bush. They've just been attacked and almost killed by T. rex and they've seen a man eaten alive. So what do they do? They settle down and sleep for the night in the crook of a huge tree, smiling. When they see a couple of herbivorous animals with necks the size and shape of the Washington monument, O'Neill cheerfully begins to hoot at them to see if they will answer or -- better yet -- come to him and let the kids pet them. Right. The dinosaurs leave mists when they breathe on glass. Are they warm blooded? As I recall, their hearts have three and a half chambers or something. We see one of the little buggers hatch from her egg, and the egg tooth she should probably have is absent. There is some business about frog DNA having gotten mixed up with the dino DNA, so the dinos have become a greater threat because they are now able to reproduce. But they may not have needed the frogs because in modern reptiles parthenogenesis isn't uncommon. Where I live, we're surrounded by New Mexico whiptail lizards and every one of them is a female, just as in the movie. I don't know if they LIKE it, but that's the way it is. That's just carping though.<br/><br/>There's a bit of philosophizing near the beginning. Is it right or wrong to resurrect dinosaurs. But the conversation doesn't lead anywhere, and I suppose it's just there to remind us not to fool Mother Nature -- as if we cared. The question is a real one. Is nature there only to be shaped to our utilitarian ends? Or is it better to live in harmony with our own ecosystem. That's a lot different from asking if it's right for elephants to have tusks, but the movie isn't interested in the issue because it might irritate our nervous systems. Better to stick with Poe.<br/><br/>Fascinating movie. Spielberg has his fingers on the public pulse. Or his probes into our reptilian brains."

","As a fan of 'B' grade sci-fi and horror films of the 1930's through the '50's, I always get a kick out of the scientific rationale offered behind some new experiment or discovery. In ""Jurassic Park"", dinosaurs have left behind their blueprints as preserved DNA strands in the blood of prehistoric mosquitoes trapped in amber - I love it!!! Could anything sound more convincing to make you believe that dinosaur cloning is possible? <br/><br/>The buzz surrounding this monster film in 1993 took the movie world by storm, and with good reason. Here finally was a film where dinosaurs actually looked real, and responding just the way we might be inclined to think of them. A brachiosaurus nibbles from the tops of trees and tyrannosaurs literally shake the ground they walk on. There were even a few creatures thrown into the mix I'd never heard of when reading about dinosaurs as a kid - like when were velociraptors discovered? Seeing the movie the first time I thought they were invented for the film until I did some research.<br/><br/>Now one or two beasts at a time is remarkable enough, but the scene that really mesmerized me was the dinosaur stampede, once again with creatures I never knew about. If one is a gallimimus, would more than one be gallimimuses or gallimimi? Just wondering.<br/><br/>You would expect outstanding performances from the principal players, and all did well, but I found the acting of the kids (Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards) to be exceptional. Their expressions of wonder, awe, excitement and outright terror are conveyed as convincingly as if they suddenly found themselves actually surrounded by live dinosaurs. Ariana Richards' expression in particular, in the scene where her brother might have been electrocuted is almost heartbreaking.<br/><br/>""Jurassic Park"" is one of those pictures you can take literally when it comes to a movie going 'experience'. The film was the first to be recorded in DTS digital surround sound, thereby adding to it's thrill as an auditory as well as visual treat. A little over a decade since it's original release, it's the kind of movie that just begs for the home theater treatment."

","Save for the charismatic presence of Sam Neill and Samuel Jackson, the only thing which makes this film worthwhile is the T-Rex and the fabulous legs of Laura Dern. Its a shame too, given that Steven Spielberg (hailed as the greatest American filmmaker ever it seems) had at his disposal revolutionary special effects and a very talented cast. In the end, this could have been a fantastic work, yet has the feel of just propping up a thin ""story"" to serve as a lean-to for the showcasing of brilliant CGI. As usual, the sound and visuals are incredible, but the scrip is nil. What happened to Spielberg along the route of his career? He gave us ""Duel"", an interesting project that delt with the issue of road rage when Americans didn't even know what the hell it was, directing an overtly simple storyline to convey the horrors a motorist faces on the highways. How did he accomplish this? He did it through character development. Yes, the real star of ""Jaws"" was not the shark- but the story, and the actors who brought that story to life- the same with ""Close Encounters"", the story was engaging amid the FX. Spielberg even made the diesel in ""Duel"" a living breathing character- too bad its such an unknown element in Jurassic Park."

","**** out of ****<br/><br/>When I was a kid, I always had an obsession with dinosaurs, so it was natural that, at the tender age of 9, I embraced Jurassic Park as THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE. I have since grown considerably since then, and now in my late teens, have come to the conclusion that Jurassic Park is indeed not the greatest movie ever made. But it's a damn good one, and it's an even match with any of the Indiana Jones films for sheer escapist adventure (thank God Steven Spielberg directed films during my adolescence).<br/><br/>
This movie is, of course, hardly plot-driven, but a summary of sorts is in order. Sam Neill stars as Alan Grant, a paleontologist who doesn't much like high-tech equipment, or kids for that matter. Laura Dern stars as his girlfriend, Ellie Sattler, apparently a paleobotanist. Both of them (along with Jeff Goldblum as a chaos theoretician) are invited to an amusement park by a rather kindly, enthusiastic old man named John Hammond (Richard Attenborough). Well, it turns out the park is full of cloned dinosaurs and they've arrived as experts to deem whether or not the place is safe for tourists. But a saboteur within the park knocks out the power, leaving the guests stranded somewhere in the island, and the hungry dinosaurs on the loose, searching for food.<br/><br/>Premise like that sounds like fun, doesn't it? And yes, Jurassic Park is very fun. It's unlikely anyone who's reading this review has never seen the movie, but it's always nice to reiterate to a fan (or detractor) why it is I hold such adoration for this film. Ever since Jurassic Park's initial theatrical release, the movie's always had a lot of unfair criticism thrown at it, a lot of it aimed at how Spielberg should have learned his lesson from Jaws and show restraint toward presenting the dinos, or how the character development was somewhat lacking. I'm guessing the fact it was directed by Spielberg set it up for far more nitpicky complaints than if it had been helmed by someone else (which makes it all the more amazing how acclaimed Spielberg's movies, especially his most recent ones, are).<br/><br/>To both alleged faults, I cannot agree with. Whether or not anyone actually noticed, Spielberg actually showed restraint by not revealing the T-rex (or dilophosaurus) right off the bat, waiting patiently until the perfect moment, when all hell breaks loose. As a result, its first appearance is truly terrifying. Besides, these are dinosaurs, gargantuan sights that are appropriately astounding and awe-inspiring (with these images nicely boosted by John Williams' rousing score), and with such great special effects on hand, holding back the sight of the dinosaurs would be a pretty silly notion.<br/><br/>As for the characters, most everyone here made at least a slight impression on me. Sam Neill is great as always, playing the likeable Grant as a convincing action hero who never resorts to ridiculous stunts. The friendship he develops with the two kids (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards) is ""typical"" Spielberg, but what's typical of his is still far better done than your average, first-rate filmmaker (yeah, I admit it, I'm an exremely ardent Spielberg fan). The other performances are good; Jeff Goldblum is very funny as the sarcastic chaotician, Laura Dern makes a sexy heroine, and Bob Peck is simply too cool as the park's game hunter. Loved the man, wish he was in the movie more.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note that the pacing is so good, I never noticed that the film doesn't get into the dino action until almost the halfway mark. The film was enjoyable before the dinosaur mayhem, and once the dinosaurs start chomping down on puny humans, the movie jumpstarts into a remarkable thrill ride. There are two action sequences, in particular, that stand out. The first is the T-rex assault on the motionless cable cars, which nicely builds up suspense, then pays off in spades. The climactic cat-and-mouse game with the raptors is an even more impressive nail-biter, initially set in a kitchen, then turning into a full-blown chase through the ducts, all the way to a wide-spaced museum.<br/><br/>Opinions for this movie have always been rather mixed, but with the majority aiming toward the positive. JP's got great action, first-rate special effects, and charismatic leads; what's not to like? Personally, I enjoyed it a bit more than Jaws, probably because Williams' score never goes inappropriately playful at any point in JP. By certain definitions, Jurassic Park might not rate as a great movie, but it's great entertainment, and what more could you ask from a film?"

"mjneu59","6","1","5","29 November 2010"," 'Westworld' revisited
","Steven Spielberg's popular crowd-pleaser rode the crest of a passing dinosaur craze (a craze engineered, in part, to coincide with the film's release), but it also delivered enough genuine summer matinée fun to justify all the hoopla. There isn't anything particularly original about the film: the skimpy plot, following a group of reluctant tourists trapped on an island theme park with marauding dinosaur clones, is a state-of-the-art update of 'Westworld', also written by Michael Crichton; Sam Neill's paleontologist hero is a cardboard ringer for Indiana Jones (the role might have been written for Harrison Ford); and if the film is Spielberg's most effective thrill ride since 'Jaws' it's only because his dinosaurs are distant cousins to Bruce the Great White Shark.<br/><br/>The script may be thin and the (human) characters unforgivably shallow, but none of that should worry viewers expecting to be scared half out of their seats. Spielberg's only aim - reinforced by an anticlimactic ending almost begging for a sequel - is to provide two hours of undiluted distraction, and (fortunately) the best moments lean more on expensive lab work than on decent writing or depth of character. For one tenth the budget (and one tenth the profits) Ray Harryhausen could have made essentially the same movie, but 'Jurassic Park' is a legitimate blockbuster, with one nagging reservation: after so much advance publicity, did the director really need to plug his own promotional merchandise in the film?"
"seppo-sihvo","7","1","5","26 May 2008"," The greatest mind trick of all time.
","When I first went to see this in a theater back during year '93 I was blown away for being a typical nine year old. Time went on, my collection of dinosaur toys grew and I dreamed of an effects artist career. So it's an understatement to say that I was merely inspired. I'm certainly less gullible presently when it comes to movies. I've felt for a certain period that the first movie lacks a lot of substance thanks to it's sequels. But as of today I now accept this movie for what it is, a great sci-fi piece of it's own that entertains if you have the right sense of mind to allow it to while adding to that a remarkable tale. The story is clever in all it's simplicity, about man needing to learn about the responsibilities to the power of altering nature. The characters aren't overly complex and can sometimes give you the usual cardboard image. But all that they manage to represent with success is enough to still make us care about their fates. But the most valuable aspect is in how the movie handles the dinosaur effects, the first time computer animation is used to enhance a scenario too impossible to show practically while still managing to enhance said practicality with magical end results. This reciprocity is a total success. It was ironically also the last time a movie would use CGI as an enhancement instead of a replacement. No such luck with it's two follow-ups where the dinosaurs become out-shadowed by a cast of human characters with too much saturation for their own good starting with The Lost World that totally messes up the moral successfully represented here in favor of larger sequences and laughable human motives with Jurassic Park 3 dumbing down the rest as, some may say, the final nail to the coffin. In the sequels the entire concept has become mere overcomplicated padding to sell the excuse of ""dinosaurs chasing people"" and forgetting what actually made it so good here. That really is a shame. It is because of it that to me there is only one true Jurassic Park, a promising concept of man playing god with a moral dilemma strong enough to reach out to the reality which we ourselves live in but sadly diminished by neglect in the follow-ups. A watered down yet entertaining version of a smart science fiction novel that manages to keep most of that smartness without compromising the enjoyment. 7/10."

The flick plays like a first-draft storyboard animatic. Driven by the producers' knee-jerk responses to dailies, the ""denouement"" is funneled into an insulting joke of a resolution.

"baileygiannini","5","1","8","1 July 2018"," Not Terrible, But Not Amazing
","Jurassic Park is a classic and an iconic film since Steven Spielberg did his film Jaws back in 1975. The thing about Jurassic Park is that kids about age ten to thirteen years old will find it boring. The reason being is that in the beginning of the film after Spielberg hooks you in with a scary scene involving a Velociraptor they go into Dino DNA and the making of the dinosaurs and about how John Hammond created the dinosaurs. When we finally get to the dinosaurs it feels like half an hour has gone by. Young kids will find it a bore until the action hits the screen. That is the reason why I was torn between giving this film a thumbs up or thumbs down at first. For me it's a slight thumbs down. I only recommend you see this movie if you have the patience for waiting for the action to happen, which isn't for quite awhile in this film. Again this isn't a terrible movie, but it's not amazing either. It has a great concept, but the execution isn't all the way there. Spielberg did a lot better job with Jaws than this one. <br/><br/>He knew how to set everything up and develop the characters without boring us. Jurassic Park does the opposite of that. It can be very boring at times, even though the character development is there, there's really nothing interesting to develope about the characters. Even Jeff Goldblooms' character, Ian Malcolm didn't have any interesting development facts for his background of character developement. The style is good, but the storyline lacks and it's a very slow paced movie. The story would've been a lot better if the pace was a lot faster. Because of the uninteresting character developement and slow pace I am giving this film 5 and 1/2 stars, only because once it does get going it is quite an exordinary picture."

","I have a love/hate relationship with Steven Spielberg's films. The relationship has been more hate than love, but after recently watching Jaws I have decided to move the gauge closer to the middle. Anyway, Jurassic Park did little to move the gauge closer to the ""love"" column. The popular 1993 adventure directed by Spielberg starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum about a modern-day park in which dinosaurs roam free, was plagued by poor pacing and over-the-top effects use of the famous director.<br/><br/>Through decades of scientific work and development, John Hammond, a wealthy financier has developed a park in which real dinosaurs he has developed through cloning from mosquitos over a million years old. Once he recruits scientists Ellie (Laura Dern) and Grant (Sam Neill) and brings along mathematician Malcolm, Hammond thinks he is on easy street for securing his park and bringing dinosaurs to a public that would otherwise never experience them in real life. After a park employee attempts to steal embryos and the dinosaurs break free, it becomes a race for their lives while dinosaurs walk free around the planet once again.<br/><br/>I am just the biggest fan of Laura Dern, so anytime she is a lead in a film is a treat to be enjoyed. Dern was fantastic in her role as the awestruck scientist. You feel her watching her dreams come true as she watches the manufactured dinosaurs in their natural habitats. You can see the prime directorial efforts in each scene. The audience is able to recognize that Spielberg is really pulling more from his actors than he does in other films. In order to create the world of Jurassic Park, the reactions of the actors must be larger than life, and Spielberg was able to elicit those reactions lending to the credibility of the film. Jeff Goldblum was a fun surprise in this film. Having no experience with him as an actor, I was pleasantly surprised with his performance. He was fun, and serious when it called for it, creating a nice bit of comic relief to a predominately stuffy cast. The acting was definitely the standout of this Jurassic Park and was the only aspect lending credibility to an otherwise over-the-top CGI ridden film.<br/><br/>An inventive concept, a great cast, and larger than life characters, Jurassic Park should have been a home-run, and it largely was among audiences of the time. Going back to revisit the film, however, exposes the film's weaknesses. The Achilles heel Jurassic Park suffers is its pacing. Far too much is fleshed out in explaining each aspect of the creation of the dinosaurs, with nearly an hour passing before we even see any dinosaurs. The action scenes make up for the slow start to a point, but it would have been nicer to focus on more actuality of the dinosaurs rather than the concepts of what brought them about. Of course, the audience needs to understand how the dinosaurs came to be, but not to exhaustive detail. Exhaustive detail is precisely what you get with Jurassic Park; one of the many movies, I feel, whose sequels surpass the originals."
"redlippedqueen","4","1","13","12 August 2003"," Cretaceous Park
","All right, maybe I'm super picky because I used to aspire to be a paleontologist, but has anyone else noticed that almost every dinosaur in this movie is from the cretaceous period.  While I understand that ""Cretaceous Park"" is not the catchiest of titles, why couldn't they at least use dinosaurs from the Jurassic period if they were going to call it by the title they chose.  In any event, aside from dino details getting on my nerves, the movie wasn't any kind of steaming crap pile or anything.  I think my favorite thing about the movie is the soundtrack.  It has it's funny moments, i.e. (when the guy gets eaten off the toilet, etc.), and it's rather suspenseful moments with the raptors.  Overall, I enjoyed it when I was a kid, (except for little things like the fact that I knew that velociraptors were the size of chickens), but now, having gotten a little older it doesn't quite excite me the way it used to.  It's a decent movie for what it's worth, but nothing too incredibly special."
"mrskywalker","2","2","44","3 August 2001"," Was It The Best
","Jurassic Park was surely a tremendous ground breaking event. Spielberg is at his best here.  The special effects are fantastic and each scene has a special tension and effect of its own.  Spielberg weaves a magic web and pleases everyone in the process.  He puts in a few things here and there to please the more liberal in the audience as well as the more traditional.  He even sends messages to the critics with words such as sexism to try and appease the media critics.<br/><br/>Spielberg also has us rooting against every one who dies and for everyone who lives.  He even gets the audience to laugh hysterically while a person is torn apart.  In fact a number of people complained that there was not enough gore in Jurassic Park 3.  If you are looking for gore than you will get much more with this film than with JP3.  There was a more gritty tone with this film than with JP3. We got to see cows and other animals eaten alive in detail. But beyond the appeasement of those who need to be convinced of realism through gore and other methods, it is with action that Spielberg excels.  Fantastic use of sound and special effects make this film a thrilling event.  Spielberg has shown he is the king of action even on the small budget of Duel.  I was reminded of the terror invoked through the shaking of the ground and the loud sounds of a dinosaur walking. <br/><br/>
Jurassic Park was about terror and fear while JP3 was about adventure.  JP3 was a thrll ride in which the audience wishes it was on the island while Jurassic Park we were more in a state of fear.  JP3 was full of imagination and excitement and we really cared about the characters.  The smart kid in JP1 was more enjoyable than the crying kids in JP1.  Those who say he could not have survived because teenagers are dumb would probably be the same ones who at one time said women were unable to do anything.  Anyway JP3 was just an adventure that really found redeeming value in every character where JP1 just killed off all the creeps. I was also reminded that Jurassic Park was a statement movie.  The statement being that people should not clone creatures or try and create monsters similar to the ideas in Frankenstein.  JP3 was more like Dracula in that it had no real statement.  JP3 was really about whether or not the characters would escape with their son similar to whether or not one could survive a night in Dracula's castle.  So JP3 was more of a good old fashioned scary adventure and about imagination.  It really depends on what you like.  JP3 also was at a disadvantage being the second sequel but was still very exciting.  Personally, I give a slight edge to JP3 because I just enjoyed it more, though it definately could have been a little longer and would have been even better had Jeff Goldblum been in it."

","This film is a classic. Of all the sci-fi movies I've watched, and that would be a lot, this is probably the best I have seen. Given the time period the portrayal of the dinosaurs was great. The special effects that just made the dinosaurs come to life really tied the whole movie together. Although the acting could of been better the movie was still great. Something about kids getting chased by Velociraptors, a man getting eaten by a T-Rex off the toilet, and just the idea of a island full of dinosaurs makes the movie worth watching. the amount of tension in the movie makes the movie a nail biter. One more thing I enjoy about this movie is the constant question of ""what is going to happen next?"""

","Basically it is defined as a science fiction action movie, but at the same time it has great thriller and sometimes horror elements. It contains comedy too, there are some funny lines, most of them from Malcolm. Other memorable and interesting lines and conversations about the relationship between nature and human can make you think also. The beginning is really well built up to the cathartic ""welcome to jurassic park"" moment, when we actually first see dinosaurs. Every action scene is exciting. For example the t-rex scene, the whole last raptor chase segment starting with the kitchen scene, or the ""back in business"" scene. Characters are great too. I think everybody wanted to be Alan Grant as a child. Or Ian Malcolm. The technical side of the movie is frenetic also. The dinosaurs are way more realistic, then CGI creatures nowadays. The visual effects are awesome. The music of John Williams just make the whole thing perfect. So, this film has a little from everything and the result is just phenomenal. A 10/10 rating is very rare from me, but this movie definitely deserves it. This is my childhood favorite, i think i have seen it more than 30 times and i can watch it every time nowadays too, it haven't lost its quality with time."

","John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) invites a 'select' group of people to take a tour of a theme park that he's created called 'Jurassic Park'. This theme park is one of a kind which boasts live dinosaurs made possible by Hammond and his team extracting dinosaur blood from mosquitos that have been preserved in tree sap for millions of years. Hammond decides to give the group a tour of his theme park, but whilst the group are on this tour the park suffers some major mechanical problems and the dinosaurs start to turn their attention on their human hosts....<br/><br/>Jurassic Park, in many ways, shares a lot in common with Michael Crichton's other science-fiction novel Westworld. Westworld's central plot focused on an amusement park where paying guests integrate with robots and a power outage causes the robots to malfunction resulting in them turning on their human counterparts. In this respect, Jurassic Park is very similar and this is the main thing that ensures that it holds your interest.<br/><br/>One criticism that I have with this film is that it is a little on the slow side and it is around the one hour mark before the 'theme park' malfunction occurs. There is a lot of exposition at the start, of which some of it is interesting and relevant, but the cynic in me couldn't help but see some of it as being merely padding. There is a sub-plot involving one employee selling embryos to a rival which seems important at the start, but ultimately goes nowhere which again merely elongated a film with an already overly generous running time.<br/><br/>Having said that though, once the second half of the film arrives then it rarely let's up and Spielberg does turn this into an effective chase picture. The special effects are good and still look quite impressive to this day.<br/><br/>The performances from the main players are all OK, but particular praise should go to the child actors who actually managed to not be particularly annoying at any point which came as a great relief to me.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park is definitely worth watching although one thing I will say is to be careful if you're intending to watch this with young children - it's PG Certificate is a bit misleading and I suspect that younger children may find some of the scenes distressing. Also as I mentioned earlier, if you enjoyed this film then you should definitely check out Westworld - although if you do choose to watch Westworld make sure that you don't watch it with your kids!!!!"

"PredragReviews","8","0","1","15 April 2016"," Spielberg goes pre-historic!
","It's more than a little uncommon for a film to visually impress two times in a row. What made for spectacular viewing the first time becomes old news by the second. And with the rate at which the technologies used at the movies advances, these former special- effects heavyweights begin to look dated very quickly.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around a group of people employed to verify the safety of a theme park being built by the CEO of InGen and creator of the park John Hammond (Richard Attenborough); the group consists of lawyer and the representative of investors Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), mathematician and chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern). And they are inspecting the park, a series of events lead to dinosaurs breaking loose and instilling peril among the crew. However, the storyline flows very well, providing the audience with enough action to allow for some of the more mellow scenes. The characters in the film are very, very well acted and even the children are believable when screaming at a dinosaur which isn't really there. It's good to know that (at the time) these actor's were not Hollywood's biggest stars, meaning the emphasis is placed upon their acting instead of the looks.<br/><br/>There are plenty of holes to pick in the plot if you want to get scientific, but that's not what this film is about. It's a terrific roller-coaster ride of a film that all the family (except the smallest maybe) can hold hands together to watch. One point that many argue is the velociraptors were only six-foot long and half the height of humans - Spielberg obviously wanted more dramatic impetus. Strangely enough, during filming scientists uncovered evidence of a 10-foot-tall variety, now named Utahraptors - so how's that for a bit of Spielberg magic?<br/><br/>Overall rating: 8 out of 10."
"ramaken33","8","0","1","5 March 2016"," A Review 23 Years in the Making...
","The 1993 Jurassic Park was (and still is) one of the high water marks in Steven Spielberg's pantheon of blockbuster movies. Based on the bestselling Michael Crichton novel of the same name, the story of a theme park where genetically engineered dinosaurs are bred to be the main attractions provided the dinosaur movie genre, and the study of dinosaurs in general a huge PR boost. Turning on its head the by then clichÃ©d plot-lines of people finding a ""lost world"" or time traveling to the Mesozoic, the ingenious idea of genetically creating the animals neatly allowed the creatures to ""exist"" in a contemporary setting, while the logic of using the dinosaurs for financial gain also providing a practical reason for their presence.<br/><br/>While the movie differs significantly from the book, which primarily explored the scientific and moral implications of using genetics to resurrect extinct species-the dinosaurs representing the plot device of an out of control technology, the movie instead wisely focused more on the dinosaurs themselves. Clearly realizing that the visuals of Jurassic Park would be the dominating reason film-goers would want to see the film, much of the more ""techy"" aspects of the book were jettisoned. The book's lengthy discussions about the moral implications of whether companies have the right to patent living creatures created artificially were limited to a couple of scenes where Ian Malcolm (played with typical quirkiness by Jeff Goldblum) rebuked John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) for his lack of humility in utilizing genetic engineering to create the denizens of his park.<br/><br/>While I generally don't like to compare films or film technologies from different eras, I am going to make an exception with Jurassic Park, primarily because it was one of the biggest films to lead the charge towards CGI. Industrial Light and Magic had broken ground with some amazing CGI; first with the now almost-forgotten Young Sherlock Holmes, then their ""fluid"" creations in the Abyss and Terminator 2: Judgement Day, but Jurassic Park was likely the first to use fully rendered and textured CGI for a feature film. This was a major breakthrough, however the actual amount of CGI used in the film was limited to about four minutes-the remainder consisting of Stan Winston animatronics and in a few cases (such as the Velociraptor attacking Muldoon the gamekeeper) actors in suits. After twenty three years, and a deluge of CGI effects, some of the images have lost their luster, while others have stood up to the test of time. Having watched the film again recently, the initial shot of the T.rex snapping the fencing wires and striding between the Jeeps in the storm still has the power to suspend disbelief for this viewer. Obviously, the box office revenues for this film proved the merits of CGI, but considering that ILM had all but perfected computer aided stop-motion animation (their process labeled go-motion) it was a watershed moment when Spielberg made the decision to eschew go-motion for fully digital dinosaurs, and potentially a risky one. Since the visuals were originally conceived to be completed in go-motion, the switch to CGI required that the computer animators take months learning to realistically portray animals that veteran go-motion animator Phil Tippet had spent many years honing to near-perfection. Fortunately, Tippet was still kept on the crew which aided the transition from go-motion to CGI for the visual effects team.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park marks another transition of sorts, and a more personal one from Spielberg's perspective. Jurassic Park was one of the last films from the director that still echoed his earlier style of fast paced adventure, danger and inclusion of children to draw in juvenile audiences as well as adults. While the Color Purple was an exception from his usual reputation as a director of summer blockbusters, it was his other 1993 release Schindler's List that seems to be the dividing point between Spielberg the box office giant and Spielberg the artist. He still occasionally embraces the more imaginative aspects of movie-making, but Jurassic Park marked one of the last times he approached a fantasy/science fiction subject without a darker subtext lying beneath the story he was telling on screen.<br/><br/>Of course Jurassic Park was also enhanced by having John Williams compose one of his most memorable scores; the main theme becoming as familiar as Star Wars, and included in every one of Jurassic Park's sequels, including the recent Jurassic World. Williams's long time collaboration with Spielberg is probably one of the better examples of two diverse talents working together to create a product that is a visual and audio treat for the senses in a consistent fashion.<br/><br/>Overall, I think Jurassic Park is certainly a good film; having seen it in first release it had several ""WOW"" moments for me on the big screen (and as a die-hard fan of stop/go motion animation that means a LOT) My only real criticism is that because the CGI footage was sparse, the cuts between CGI and Winston's animatronics stood out to me even back in 1993, even though the matching up of the animatronics to the CGI was generally good. I won't critique the live actor's performances too in-depth; they were adequate for their time, and in particular Ariana Richard's character of Lex as a tween hacker was a relief over the book's portrayal of Lex as the whining obnoxious little sister of Tim. With the passing of twenty three years since the film's release it now has some dated aspects, not the least of which is due to what it inspired - a resurgence in dinosaur studies. What was state of the art knowledge in 1993 has become as outdated as the go-motion process due to new findings that continue to challenge scientific thinking about dinosaurs. Jurassic Park is still compelling entertainment and one of the most important footnotes in the history of movie visual effects."
"arussell23","8","0","2","8 June 2015"," 'Jurassic Park' is a technological achievement, but not infallible
","In 1990, Michael Crichton released a successful novel under the name of Jurassic Park. Steven Spielberg took an interest in the novel, and so, with the full cooperation of Crichton, the two began work on adapting the novel into a feature film. The film was released in 1993, to rave reviews, and soon spawned a film franchise that is planning it's fourth release in the next few weeks. Let us venture into the film where it all began. <br/><br/>Jurassic Park follows a group hand-picked by the CEO of a powerful company to inspect the CEO's new park composed entirely of genetically modified dinosaurs. However, as the group takes a tour of the park, things suddenly go south and it's now a fight to survive the stormy night, without becoming a dino's next meal.<br/><br/>Okay, I'm not gonna lie. I didn't see Jurassic Park at all until about two or three days before writing this review. So, maybe I don't have the rose-colored glasses that most people have when it comes to talking about this movie. Either way, I do agree with most when I say it's an enjoyable film, however, I have my qualms with the film.<br/><br/>Let's start with the positives. The acting is great from all. Sam Neill and Laura Dern as Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler do excellent jobs, especially in some of the later climatic scenes. Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm is a riot for me, considering I love how he just keeps doing the ""uhs"" and the ""uhms,"" it's actually really funny if you think about it. Richard Attenborough as John Hammond was quite the treat, especially since he managed to convey that mystical wonder you would come to expect from anyone who just spent all that time building a freaking Dino park. The kids in the film (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello) also did a great job. I was surprised I didn't hate them.<br/><br/>The special effects blew me away, especially considering they were done in a time where CGI was relatively new and most of the dinosaur shots (from farther away) were all CGI. It's quite amazing, to be honest. And actually kind of funny, because while the dinosaurs look so real here (and still hold up), in other films involving dinosaurs (I'm looking at you, Transformers 4), they look really fake. Have we really regressed that far?<br/><br/>The music by John Williams is great, as per usual with a composer like him. I swear, I will never get that damn theme song out of my head, it's that catchy. The cinematography is amazing as well. In some of the shots of the park, it's kind of hard to believe that the dinosaurs aren't really there and that the island didn't exactly exist. It looks all beautiful though, even on the DVD set I watched it with.<br/><br/>I think my biggest problem with the film is how slow the first act of the film is. The film only really gets going when the kids arrive, and before that, it's a lot of expositional dialogue. Don't get me wrong, some of it is interesting, but there becomes a point where it's a bit too much to just have all of this dialogue and no dino action.<br/><br/>Overall, however, Jurassic Park is a very solid film. The acting, special effects, cinematography and music are great, as I expected them to be. While it does have some plotting and pacing issues, it is still a film that holds up very well, and is definitely a timeless classic for all to enjoy."
"dyllon_jeng","8","0","3","30 May 2015"," Slightly immature but a doubtlessly fun watch
","Before I watched this film, I probably expected too much, because I was slightly disappointed. But that's most likely because this movie was probably targeted for a younger audience. Much of the dialogue was pretty corny, the acting was over the top in multiple scenes, and the whole film sort of has a cheesy feel at times. Despite the reputation Jurassic Park has earned as a classic, I suppose for a movie that's mostly a kids film, these flaws are excusable. What this movie deserves a lot of credit for are the wonderful direction, groundbreaking visual effects, a great score by the legendary John Williams, and a well- written story. Although I say I was slightly disappointed, I definitely enjoyed watching this movie."

"troup01","Null","0","1","12 December 2014"," Jurassic Park, Fears Realized
","Based on a novel of the same title Jurassic Park, created a unique theme park environment centered on genetically cloned dinosaurs. Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) are brought to John Hammond's (Richard Attenborough) park for damage control following an accident. During the tour it experienced widespread systematic failures, through the sabotage of Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) exerting revenge. This allowed the viscous dinosaurs to roam free. Dr. Grant, Lex (Ariana Richards), and Tim(Joseph Mazzello) are faced with surviving in the park surrounded by the dinosaurs. Meanwhile, Dr. Sattler and John Hammond are trying to restore the park to operation. The overall theme of the film is the potential for danger with reliance on technology. Jurassic Park was released in the early years of personal computing, a large part of the population at the time potentially had never accessed technology building on the fear. The park was presented as the most technologically advanced amusement park ever created with a sprawling network of systems all reporting back to the control room. Unfortunately, in the film technology is wielded by a sub-contractor who feels he is being under compensated. This revelation, along with his interactions with a rival business proprietor presents the central conflict of the film. Additional to the computer technology, is presented a concept of genetic engineering which was fought by Dr. Malcom. Throughout the film Dr. Malcom presents a theory of pending catastrophe which is soon realized. The film follows a similar theme as Terminator, although this film presents more a favorable outcome for humanity. The acting sequences centered on the technology were expanded cinematically in order to build suspense. Specifically when the park was being brought back online Lex Murphy (Ariana Richards) was immediately aware of the type of system and how to interact with it. All this despite the complexities of such a large scale automation project. During the rest of the film lighting was used to bring key visuals to the center focus, highlighting the features of the computer generated and animatronic dinosaurs. While using complex camera angles, post production editing coupled with the CGI, the viewer is presented a feeling of immersion. Once you add in the audio artifacts the film seems to pull you into the action. Technology has come a long way since the film was produced but our reliance on the vast network of interconnected devices is still a cause for concern. This could be a for-shadowing of a similar collapse of our would minus the dinosaurs of course."

","Jurassic Park. <br/><br/>It's nearing 21 years now, since the release of this film. My goodness it still holds up. Now this film was released in June of 1993, I was born in March of 1993, never saw it it theaters, but I saw it in VHS and man I loved it even as a child. I will point out however, I saw The Lost World: Jurassic Park first with my aunt as a youngster in theaters, then I saw this film. <br/><br/>In my youth, when I compare this one to the second film, I recall being terrified and being on the edge in The Lost World, but with Jurassic Park, I felt a sense of wonderment and excitement. Having seen the second one first, I felt this one, even with some suspenseful moments, is a little lighter in tone, and has a more subtle approach.<br/><br/>All the actors do the best they can in this film and they all do a commendable job. They're not very fleshed out, aside from John Hammond portrayed by Richard Attenborough, founder and owner of Ingen and Jurassic Park. More often than not we get good moments where the trio of leads get to show off their personality. <br/><br/>Sam Neill is great as the calm, collective, and stern Dr. Alan Grant, who has a fascination with dinosaurs and dislikes kids, much to his annoyance Hammond's grandkids Lex(Ariana Richards) and Tim(Joseph Mazzello) who are great by the way, one of the few films where I actually enjoyed child actors and their performances, are also at the park and is stuck with Grant after narrowly escaping an incident with the fierce T-Rex. Laura Dern's character Dr. Ellie Sattler has a nice banter with Dr. Grant and the romance is very subtle which I admired. Sattler also holds her own against the Velociraptors in the film. Jeff Goldblum is awesome as Dr. Ian Malcolm a mathematician who specializes in chaos theory. He provides some of the most funniest moments within the film. <br/><br/>Wayne Knight, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bob Peck also have decent supporting roles that are served for the plot. Knight and Jackson also provide humor in the film, and Peck provides and fills in the typical tough guy, as well as being a Velociraptor specialist. <br/><br/>Now lets be honest here, as great as the cast is, it provides some of the film's slowest moments. Its the dinosaurs that make this film work. Director Steven Spielberg, Stan Winston(RIP) and his crew wisely uses practical dinosaur mechanics and visual cgi to bring these creatures to life. Think about this it's been nearly 21 years since its release and the visuals still look great. Some would argue maybe even up to par or better than most cgi-fest blockbusters released today. Spielberg also uses the dinosaurs very effectively for every scene they're in. The Velociraptors are smart and deadly and provides the film's scariest moments. The T-Rex scene is also effective sending chills by your spine. The Brachiosaurus scene in the beginning, combined with John Williams's powerful score, brings the scene to life, quite literally. It is so powerful that it can bring goosebumps to your skin and make you feel as if you're there with Dr. Grant and Sattler actually witnessing a real dinosaur right in front of you. <br/><br/>Jurassic Park is not a typical brainless blockbuster. Not to say that a brainless blockbuster can't be fun or enjoyable, but Jurassic Park is more than that. It has science in it that is plausible to a certain degree that you can easily follow. It's not convoluted at all by any means and every dinosaur sequence rocks, and it'll make you want more. Yes some of the technological aspects in the film involving computers, cell phones, and whatnot are very outdated, but even so the film has not aged a bit. <br/><br/>8.6/10"

Of course, all of our humans are overshadowed by the real stars of the film, the dinosaurs.

Thankfully, the film came out in 1993 when we were dino-crazy and the special effects, which come off as simply family friendly, were seen as some scary shtuff... Richard Attenborough as Walt Disney like rich wanna be was just silly. His enormous theme park of wild beasts has no more than 15 employees and he only comes to the epiphany that what he was attempting was grotesque in a side comment during his escape. Our silly bad guy is the nerdy tech, played by Wayne ""Newman"" Knight (whose character is called Nedry - get it?). When Samuel L Jackson needs to sit at the workspace he's been sitting only 10 feet from for presumably years, he does so with an ash- dripping nasty cigarette and states to his boss, ""man, how can this guy work in such filth"" as he pushes away hordes of empty candy bar wrappers and empty coke cans..... just stupid. The dialog in this is embarrassing, yet Jeff Goldblum resumes his rambling scientist common sense, which is always fun. Laura Dern does her best in the silly I wanna be a Mother role, so she can't say much or we'd hate her. Sam Neill does OK, fighting off the oncoming fatherhood train by being a perfect role model and caretaker for the two grandkids of our old coot dressed in all white like this is Fantasy Island. The lawyer gets it first ids like Las Vegas getting nuked first in War Games. These two movies are a bit on the same level, but the latter keeps your sense of disbelief a bit longer and that's where this is a Classic Jurassic fail.

I never realized that there could be a movie that just never gets old and gets more and more exciting with every time you watch it. Steven Spielberg adapts the novel faithfully and brings the dinosaurs to life with amazing technology which still amazes me to this day, 20 years later. John William's score is still as unforgettable as ever, it's just a really beautiful and moving score that suits the movie perfectly. <br/><br/>True, the story may not be all that believable, but its a film for entertainment, not education. It is truly a classic and well worth adding to your film collection. The following sequels are not even worth mentioning but Jurassic Park, standing on its own, is as impressive today as it was all those years ago.<br/><br/>Spielberg spends the first half of the movie getting the viewer to let their mind go in the wonder of dinosaurs being alive. The second half of the film is when all the action takes place.<br/><br/>What I most enjoyed about the movie were the action sequences(duh!). I've seen hundreds of movies, yet my favorite scene of all time is the scene where the Tyrannosaur escapes and attack the cars. It's just so amazing and so iconic. The rain just adds a certain tone that draws you in, adding tons of tension; And when I see the T-Rex escaping through her fence and attacking the 2 children still gives me shivers. <br/><br/>Performance: My favorite individual performance in the film was that of Jeff Goldblum! He was just terrific, possibly one of his best roles as he too tends to be an acquired taste, as Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician who warns right from the beginning of playing God. <br/><br/>Sam Neill was perfect for the role as Dino genius Dr. Allan Grant!<br/><br/>Laura Dern has also done well as Ellie Sattler.<br/><br/>Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards play Tim and Lexi Murphy, Hammond's grandkids. Oh my word! Both were terrific and truly capture the teen audience very well and have some really hair raising scenes. <br/><br/>Summary: The movie has an amazing story, riveting action and everything that makes an epic film amazing. All in all, the movie is quite solid. Audiences of all ages will love it, especially those with interest in science or dinosaurs. It might be frightening for some children!<br/><br/>The film is great fun from beginning to end and deserves to be up there with Jaws and King Kong as one of the all time great monster movies.<br/><br/>Verdict: A groundbreaking classic. (There was no need for Sequels tho!)<br/><br/>Note: I can point out many flaws but would care not to as its a movie to enjoy not to analyze! As I said before this film is for entertainment, not education! Timeless classic!"

","Just caught a 3D screening of ""Jurassic Park"" a while ago and it's still a very entertaining slice of popcorn fare; in fact it's the Steven Spielberg us movie aficionados knew and loved. <br/><br/>The 3D effects look good and it was certainly fun to experience the film this way. The ground breaking visual effects (some 20 years ago; man how time flies!) still hold up extremely well. <br/><br/>As for the film; the 3D doesn't make it better but it doesn't detract anything from it either. Compared to today's big budget summer flicks ""Jurassic Park"" would undoubtedly be considered fairly slow moving but it builds momentum very well and climaxes in a number of knock out suspense sequences. <br/><br/>It's fun to look back at the cast 20 years back; Jeff Goldblum is fun here and you can easily see how his fledgling career got second wind with his performance here; Sam Neill demonstrates why he could have been a possible successor for Roger Moore as James Bond and Laura Dern was quite the eye candy in 1993. And now we know that Wayne Knight didn't die a nasty death; he simply went into hiding and found work as a postal worker in New York :)<br/><br/>""Jurassic Park 3D"" was a fun night at the movies.

","This movie will forever be one of my favorite films. Spielberg once again captures his audience as we are taken on a pre historic ride with these lovable and relatable characters. As a huge fan, the scene that stood out to me most was the car scene with the children, Dr. Grant and the T- rex. Spielberg's use of sound as well as a lack thereof create such a haunting scene. As you watch, your attention is so focused, it's hard to take a step back and notice the little things. There is absolutely no music in this scene. It creates such a realistic feeling because it is so raw. Instead of depending on the music to show us how to feel, we can hear it through the screams of the children and the T-Rex. The pitter patter of the rain as well as the Thunder again adds to the heavy emotion. Another thing is it is so much easier to notice the heaving breathing of the characters. Or when Dr. Grant and Malcom are in the other car, we can hear the window squeaking as Malcom tries to defog it. It's these little effects that again create such a raw experience for the audience. The fear and stress is contagious to its audience instead of being told to us. This is the sign of a truly talented director and an artist."
"AaronCapenBanner","7","0","2","18 September 2013"," Realistic Dinosaurs.
","Based on Michael Crichton's novel, this Steven Spielberg directed Sci-Fi film is grand adventure, though hurt somewhat by a contrived plot, that details how scientists have recreated living dinosaurs from recovered DNA extracted from fossilized Mosquitoes. The park owner John Hammond(played by Richard Attenborough) is oblivious to the dangers, though his guests are not: (Sam Neil as Dr. Grant, Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler, and Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm). All of them will be proved correct as the security system breaks down, and the dangerous dinosaurs run loose...<br/><br/>The CGI F/X are absolutely superb, and still hold up today, so realistic do they portray living dinosaurs that it is terrifying. The acting is also quite good, though the only area the film falls short in is the plot, with the Wayne Knight character being so morally dubious(and stupid!) that he defies belief, but that still doesn't damage this otherwise entertaining film too badly."

","Although the concepts and general framework of this story are faithfully lifted from the Crichton-penned source material, in action it's got Steven Spielberg's fingerprints all over it. That isn't a negative, really, as the director was still clearly in his prime, but it does fit quite snugly next to the other family-friendly adventure flicks in his portfolio in that it's big and intense without going so far over-the-top as to scare the kiddos. Of course, at the time the real star here was the film's fantastic effects work - it was CGI's coming out party, after all - and that aspect has aged surprisingly well over the past two decades. Sure, if we look closely a few seams might show here or there, but the raptors remain unsettlingly vivid and our first glimpses of a grazing brachiosaurus remain nothing short of stunning. Some excellent casting decisions enrich the whole package (Jeff Goldblum is pitch-perfect as the muttering, brainy Ian Malcolm) and there are plenty of character moments scattered about to flesh out the more extravagant action sets."
"thewillt08","8","0","1","15 April 2013"," Rip Roaring Adventure with Brilliant Science
","Hold onto your butts, this is the review of the epic battle we see all the time of Science vs. Nature. In 1993 Steven Spielberg blew the world away with groundbreaking CGI dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. Jurassic has intense moments with unforgettable characters and lines that are quoted time and time again. The basic premise is that a millionaire wants to open a theme park that features scientifically engineered dinosaurs, but before he can open it he needs to make sure it is safe so he brings a team to the island and it all goes to hell when the dinosaurs escape and run wild all over the park. This highly entertaining film is considered a classic and is up there in one of my favorites.<br/><br/>I say a few things a lot when it comes to movies. ""Music makes the movie."" And ""The first few scenes are curtail."" If a movie an do that than its on a good start to getting the Seal of Approval. Jurassic Park didn't disappoint as the very first scene is a quick incident at the park involving the raptors but more on them later. It then kind of slows down with a lot of explanation but if you listen to the conversations then you should be sucked right in. The music is absolutely fantastic as well. Everybody knows the Jurassic Park theme and the very first shot of the island the theme kicks in and you know it's about to get real and the movie starts to get good. Then it gets even better. The very first shot of any dinosaur is the Brontosaurus and it looks fantastic. It looks beyond real and they shot on site. It's the same with all the dinosaurs; they look amazing and are still some of the best special effects I have ever seen to date. <br/><br/>Now let's get into characters. Jurassic Park was originally a book written by my favorite author Michael Crichton, God rest his soul, so he already created the characters so the actors just had to play it properly. Ian Malcolm is one of my favorite characters ever. His wit and brilliance fit in perfectly and Jeff Goldblum plays him. He delivers memorable lines. ""Ah, life will find a way. God creates dinosaurs, God destroys dinosaurs, God creates man, Man creates dinosaurs, Man destroys God."" Malcolm has trouble speaking, literally, and I love everything about this character. Everything he says doesn't sound like it could happen but he is the only one with any sense. My favorite scene is when everybody is eating lunch discussing the park.<br/><br/>This scene is just great conversation and is the reality of the situation. Sam Neil plays Dr. Allen Grant, the main character and hero and in this scene he says it best. I love remembering lines but I can't remember word for word, but basically he says that dinosaurs have been extinct for 65 million years and how can anybody know what to expect now that they are back in another time period. Personally everything scientific about this movie is fascinating and makes it that much better. When I was younger I found it boring and only wanted to see dinosaurs eat people but with a more mature look at the move I see the brilliance and wonder of Spielberg and Crichton.<br/><br/>I read the book Jurassic Park and I loved it for what it was. Seeing it on the big screen was a lot different from the book. There were characters in the book that were a lot more important. The man who gives Newman the can to get the embryos off the island, Dogson, is so much more important in the books and the movie doesn't do him justice. One could make an argument for Muldoon but think his character was well represented even though he played a bigger role in the book. Also Dr. Wu is a significant side character and he is only in one scene and his name is only mentioned. Then there are the Compys which are the scavengers of the dinosaur world and they aren't even in the movie at all. Things like this really bugged me until I saw the credits the other day and found out that Crichton wrote the screen play or was involved with the writing so he chose what to cut out, so I was OK with it. At least he gave a lot of focus on the raptors in the movie. <br/><br/>If you ask any kid before 1993 what their favorite dinosaur is, they are going to say the T-Rex. If you ask any kid in the 90s or maybe any kid today they will say the raptor. These things were so intelligent and fast, the perfect hunter. They establish themselves as the elite villain in the movie and everybody is afraid of them. If you say you didn't jump when the raptor scared Ellie in the basement thing, then you're just lying to yourself. Another great scene is early on when Dr. Grant scares the life out of the little kid about how the raptor feeds. The look on his face was priceless. After seeing this movie raptors are easily my favorite dinosaur because they are intense and they get approved.<br/><br/>Overall, Jurassic Park is an amazing movie with special effects that still hold up today. The visuals look even better than most CGI movies we see today. For incredible characters, unforgettable dialogue, intense action sequences, a high re-watch value, and just because it has dinosaurs in general Jurassic Park gets the WillyT seal of approval. If you haven't seen this movie yet then I have nothing to say to you other than you haven't lived. See this movie, It is a great time alone or with friends. Let's be honest, nothing looks cooler than the T-Rex tearing through the electric fence. WillyT out!"
"aag189","8","0","1","8 April 2013"," Still an awesome movie but I'm not going to watch it in 3D
","I remember this when I was a kid and watched it again on Blu-Ray last week. The special effects still hold up today. But 3D kills movies and I am not going to waste time watching this in 3D. 3D is only good for movies that are filmed at 48 fps. When it comes to 3D you shouldn't waste your money. If they released this again in non-3D I could go see it maybe.<br/><br/>So everything about this movie is great; the acting, the story, the effects, the action. It is a must see for people that enjoy smart movies. Sam Jackson is even in this movie. The special effects stand out the most. This movie is just an epic dino adventure. A movie for people of all ages. So few smart movies nowadays. Why is that?"

","Jurassic park is the brain child of John Hammond, an eccentric psychopath with money to burn, wild ideas and questionable ethics, who drags an unlikely group of friends and relatives into a terrifying ordeal in his new theme park. John who walks with the aid of a cane and wears a short sleeved white shirt throughout is clearly insane and somehow creates dinosaurs which he in turn releases onto an island somewhere, sadly at least 2 people are killed as a consequence. Also present are dr Malcolm and doctor grant. Doctor Malcolm being a snake like creature with a sing song voice and a leather jacket who's actions lead to a lawyer getting eaten alive and dr grant is a shifty, mischievous, oddball who has some knowledge of theme parks. After gathering on the island the actions of John Hammond become even more sinister as he throws his spoiled, know it all grand children into the mix which clearly angers grant. The plot thickens with an obese, bespectacled, mercenary who engages in some under hand antics as some sort of prank on his colleagues leading to mayhem at the park, all of which comes to a head when he is brutally assaulted in his car by a small dinosaur. After several heart stopping moments the film comes to a dramatic end with Hammond deserting the island leaving chaos in his wake."

","Went to a screening of Jurassic Park 3D today. Although it was nice seeing the movie on the big screen again, I have to say the 3D conversion wasn't done very well in fact most of the movie it was distracting. At times it was like you weren't even wearing the 3D glasses, it was blurry or you were seeing double. Did they even watch it themselves before releasing it? As we were leaving the theater there were a couple of reps that asked what everyone thought. Everyone said the same thing... ""The 3D wasn't done very well and was distracting"" the reps didn't write down any comments and didn't even pretend to care what anyone was saying. Personally I'm glad I didn't pay to go see this movie and I wouldn't recommend anyone else to either."
"Wuchakk","7","0","1","16 December 2012"," Family-friendly adventure mixed with total horror
","I saw ""Jurassic Park"" at the theater with my then-girlfriend wife in 1993. There was much anticipation concerning Spielberg's dinosaurs and, as far as that goes, the film delivers. The story is a good-enough stage for the dinosaurs and the characters are okay. As my title blurb points out, this is essentially a Disney adventure with horrific dinosaurs.<br/><br/>The latter is where the film excels, but it takes a whole hour to arrive. The good thing about the long wait is that it creates much anticipation. (""Jurassic Park III"" does the exact opposite and suffers for it). When the t-rex sequence arrives it is both most welcome and truly horrifying. Two other thrilling scenes are memorable – the t-rex chasing the jeep and the closing velociraptor sequence, particularly in the kitchen.<br/><br/>As far as the principle cast goes, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are effective as the male protagonists while Laura Dern is likable enough. She doesn't trip my trigger in the sex appeal department, but that's just a matter of taste. The kids are good, especially the girl (Ariana Richards), while Richard Attenborough comes across as Santa Claus. Wayne Knight plays the quasi-villain and he originally struck me as wandering off the set of another movie. Seeing the film recently, he's still a bit over-the-top and cartoony, but provides a necessary contrast to the other characters.<br/><br/>The film runs 127 minutes and was shot in Hawaii, Dominican Republic and Costa Rica.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: The dinosaurs and thrills are A+ while the story and characters are just good-enough. This is a straight-ahead family-friendly adventure with little depth and there's nothing wrong with that, especially since the film delivers what we came for – realistic-looking dinosaurs, and more – total horror.<br/><br/>GRADE: B"

","One of my top thrilling movies ever, and it was made by one of the best director's known Steven Spielberg. This 1993 science fiction adventure film is based on the novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. Who was also hired to develop the screenplay for the movie.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park won the Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Visual Effects.<br/><br/>Before Crichton published the book the movie is based on, he demanded a non-negotiable fee of $1.5 million which Universal paid for the rights to the movie and they further paid him 500,000 for the screenplay adaptation which Crichton noted that because the book was ""fairly long"" his script only had up to 20 percent of the novel's content.<br/><br/>The movie title depicts that the dinosaurs being featured all existed in the Jurassic period, but most of the dinosaurs your saw on screen didn't exist until the Cretaceous period, with the exception of Brachiosaurus and Dilophosaurus.<br/><br/>The movie plot is about a billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) and a small team of genetic scientists who were working together to create an amusement park of cloned dinosaurs.<br/><br/>John then recruits Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), a leading palaeontologist and Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) to come endorse the park; with them was Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), a mathematician and chaos theorist.<br/><br/>John decided to take them all on a tour of the park; he also took along his grand children.<br/><br/>Greed can be dangerous as one of the main programmers of the park decides to shut it down in other to escape with some samples of dinosaur DNA in other to sell them for profit. The movie is about a tour go wrong with hunger dinosaurs on the loose.<br/><br/>The thing is Jurassic park started a revolution, because film makers were so impressed by the powerful CGI, that they knew that anything was possible. The movie raked in over $900 million compared to its $60 million budget, and it also gave birth to two sequels, The Lost World 1997 (directed also by Spielberg) and Jurassic Park III 2001 (directed by Joe Johnston) both were also financial success but none as close to that of the first.<br/><br/>My favourite line in the movie was by Jeff Goldblum, ""God creates dinosaurs, God destroys dinosaurs, God creates man, man destroys God, man creates dinosaurs"" I feel Jurassic park is one of my all time thrills, and i advice that you go get a dose of it again.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
"Digory","8","0","1","27 August 2012"," Still astounds visually
","I didn't see it on its release unfortunately so I won't be able to experience it on the big screen until a re-release. I have great respect for Steven Spielberg as a filmmaker and this would be one of the movies I would present as one of my reasons. I'm aware it is based on the novel but I won't be comparing the two because I haven't read the book yet. I only found out about the source several years after I saw this movie. <br/><br/>Since the movie relies on thrills with a large scale, the story is expected to take a backseat. As far as storytelling goes, it is good enough to set the whole movie up (maybe like Jaws except Jaws, in my opinion, had more character development). That doesn't mean the characters are not likable. With a cast consisting of Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, and several well-known actors, it adds more fun to the whole situation seeing them dish out their personalities amidst the danger.<br/><br/>As for the effects, there's not much I can say that hasn't been said before. It's innovative and just a wonder seeing dinosaurs come to life, however inaccurate they might be. From the seemingly peaceful brontosaurus to the frightening tyrannosaurus rex down to the smallest (yet dangerous) of these prehistoric creatures, I can see there's was a lot of work done and it really paid off in a big way. Escapism on a whole other level."

","In the 80s Steven Spielberg showed millions of ticket buyers how much fun could be had at the movies, it seemed almost unfair to give that guy access to computer technology that could render the impossible possible, but with Jurassic Park in 1993 that was what happened. And I must say almost 20 years later they are some impressive fake dinosaurs.<br/><br/>When an eccentric wealthy Brit named John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) and his team of scientific gurus devise a way to genetically recreate any and all species of dinosaurs his first thought is to turn the whole thing into a theme park for the kiddies. Call me cynical but I would've thought that a very American thing to do.<br/><br/>But first for insurance purposes Hammond must get some real dinosaur experts in to assess whether the park poses a real threat to paying punters or not Ummm, let me cut you off there; dinosaurs + people = threat. Movie over right? Thankfully no.<br/><br/>Enter Dr Allen Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), a couple of palaeontologists (dino-docs) that think painstakingly brushing away at the dirt to find tiny scraps of million year old bone is loads of fun – they're in for a shock. Also in tow is a lawyer overseeing proceedings and a 'professor of chaos' Dr Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) who is not a WWE wrestler even though the job title practically demands this should be the case but a mathematician who has the proverbial 'very bad feeling about this'. To spice things up Hammond has invited his two young grandchildren along for the ride, sort of like bringing the teenage model daughter to an R. Kelly, Michael Jackson show.<br/><br/>They explain how it all happens in preposterously possible jargon but who cares? I mean BRING ON THE OLD GIANT LIZARDS! So off the three docs, lawyer and two kids head off in automatically piloted jeeps on a preset course through the park for a private viewing of the as yet unopened park.<br/><br/>Of course things don't go smoothly for the maiden tour, our reluctant heroes spend much of the time screaming and running around covered in mud and followed closely by sharp toothed ferocious computer generated beasties.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is quite PG and reasonably safe for most kids in the double digits there are of course casualties, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the first two munched on are a lawyer and an annoying bit character from Seinfeld.<br/><br/>Spielberg sensibly holds off with his coup de grace the T Rex but when he does unleash the big guy he makes sure that it is the centrepiece of the film and by far the best sequence. It has been often parodied since but the menacing ripples in the cups of water are quite foreboding, and the money shot of the big eye still works.<br/><br/>The second half of the finale made such a star of the velociraptor that it not only is now probably the #2 best know dinosaur behind Rex but even managed to become the mascot of a NBA team – not that they are very good As alluded to previously the visual effects were absolutely astonishing near 20 years ago and they still hold up to close scrutiny today. It's only a pity they didn't think to take some pixels to Laura Dern, who it needs to be said has a face like a shoe (with apologies to Ben Harper).<br/><br/>As the character of John Hammond likes to say – frequently – he 'spared no expense' in making Jurassic Park. The same can be said of Steven Spielberg who really went to town with his new toy CGI, but while Jurassic Park might have been undeniably groundbreaking cinema, as a film it is only very good; not great.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 8 / 10. Spawned a couple of increasingly 'samey' sequels, but as is usually the case the original is still the best."

","JURASSIC PARK was the film that ignited my interest in filmmaking and drove me to get a degree in it, so I will always have a soft spot for it. I was eleven when I read the book, but all the technical stuff lost me and I never finished it. A couple years later when I heard the movie was coming out, I decided I would just see it instead. With advance tickets selling out fast, my mom was lucky enough to get some a few days before it's premiere. We stood in line for roughly thirty minutes before we finally got in. Even as the lights were dimming, I still had no idea what to expect. Within moments I was glued to my seat. The opening sequences remains one of my favorite scenes in any film and continues to give me goosebumps to this day. For the next two hours, I sat in my seat just staring at the screen as these marvelous, life-like creatures that were unlike anything I had ever seen before. The film was full of awe and scares. I walked out of the theater virtually trying to catch my breath. What a thrill ride the film had been, and I eventually went back and saw it a few more times. The film was a turning point in my life, as I said, because I walked out saying to myself, ""That's what I want to do."" Sure the characters aren't deep and the dialogue isn't great, but who cares when the film is this entertaining? The actors are good in their parts, especially the always great Sam Neill, and the dinosaurs are incredibly life-like. The action is great, and the pacing (after a slow start) is relentless. The film has a few continuity flaws, but none of them matter. This film is great entertainment."

I believe this movie has to be one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Although not entirely true to the book, (though someone should never say a movie is not good because it is not exactly like the book because that really doesn't matter) Steven Spielberg made this story a landmark in special effects and a standard for thriller films to be compared to. It also contains some scenes that are instant classics, such as the first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the scene where the T-Rex chases the jeep.

","Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler are two paleontologists who are invited by reclusive tycoon John Hammond to visit a theme park he is building on an island near Costa Rica. When they arrive they are astounded to discover Hammond seems to have recreated creatures which haven't existed for sixty-five million years <br/><br/>In 1993, Jurassic Park did for monster movies what King Kong had originally done in 1933. It combines the new (at the time) visual effects technology of CG with a fantastic story and great characters to create a dizzying exciting movie packed with action, scares, intrigue, drama and humour. After a few too many years (in my view) attempting to win acclaim, this is Spielberg doing what he does better than just about anybody - creating pure cinematic entertainment which is visually stunning and emotional dynamite. He sets up the story with brilliant flourishes, like the opening killing of the park worker where all we see of the monster is a closeup of its eye, then moves on to show us the dinosaurs in a perfectly judged mixture of awe, wonder and terror. The eight minute sequence where the T-Rex attacks the children in the rainstorm is for my money the best monster scene in the whole of cinema, sustaining an incredible level of suspense throughout. The entire movie is filled with such brilliant scenes though - the juxtaposition of the kids on the electric fence with Ellie trying to turn the power back on, the hide-and-seek with the raptors in the kitchen. Even the quiet moments where Alan and the kids hide in the tree or when Hammond tells the melancholic story of his flea circus are all charged with emotion. The whole cast are excellent, with Neill and Dern great non-star leads and Goldblum stealing all the best lines (""I'm always on the lookout for a future ex-Mrs Malcolm""). Peck is terrific as the warden Muldoon, complete with big game hunter outfit and a memorable two-word final speech. There are some detractors who claim Michael Crichton's book is a retread of his earlier Westworld, substituting dinosaurs for robots, but this misses the point - the twin ideas of finding dinosaur DNA in mosquito blood and then housing the monsters in a theme park are spectacularly brilliant and original. If I have one thing that irks me in the story it's the industrial espionage subplot, purely because I'm not sure it needs it, even if it is the kicker for the power shutdown, and Knight is a bit too obvious as a fat guy slob villain who does everything wrong. These are minor quibbles though in a movie which is breathtaking from start to finish. The photography by Dean Cundey (John Carpenter's old cameraman) is stunning throughout, and John Williams contributes an extraordinarily beautiful score full of choral tones and delicate brass motifs. The visual effects are stunning (the shot of the T-Rex chasing Goldblum down the rain-soaked road is my favourite I think); Dennis Muren redefined what CGI could do for this movie and the late great Stan Winston built some amazing mechanical dinosaurs (including a 6000 kilo T-Rex) - both men deservedly won an Oscar. This is the best kind of Hollywood blockbuster; a rich, eye-popping, scary entertainment extravaganza from a tremendous fantasy story, lovingly crafted by one of the greatest filmmakers of all time."

","Jurassic Park is Spielberg theme park hijinks unfolding in that of a theme park; his film a cut and thrust escapade through varying B-movie traits, tracts and ideas totalling up into an experience akin to that of romping through an array of 'themed' locales within a park proper. By the time one has had a go on the dodgems and the ghost train, one has been there long enough and built up enough verve for the huge trademark roller-coaster ride; after that experience, we bring ourselves back down with a shooting range or some spinning tea-cups. There are some terrific scenes of terror, chase and thrills in Jurassic Park that essentially act as the park's ""leaner, meaner"" rides, and they are dotted around some other sequences that effectively act as a prelude to those ""leaner, meaner"" rides – the fun of the fair before we're strapped in proper for the big one.<br/><br/>There is one instance, at a heightened moment of distress, in which a character must sprint for her life toward a small building located out in the dinosaur infested jungle. In running for the door, Spielberg shoots her jog from an Evil Dead-inspired low angle alluding to something small and monstrous being right there and then on her heels. Of course, there isn't actually anything there and the angle rings false in this sense; the sequence, like most theme park rides, runs on prolonged adrenaline built out of the thrills and spills on offer: the placing of one in a predicament of peril and fear that is out of the ordinary, but without with the intense risk of injury or death, thats' somehow pleasurable for the onlooker, even if it perhaps shouldn't be.<br/><br/>Spielberg will begin the film in the mould of his 1975 monster-movie Jaws; here, rather than focus on a teen-aged girl mangled to death by an unseen beast, we observe a middle-aged employee caught up in a botched operation by a creature the film's poster, like Jaws, tells us is a dinosaur. It is arguably more striking here, everything is organised and not as spontaneous as it was in Jaws; there are several professional-looking personnel armed and trained to deal with something which still gets the better of them. The death brings about a law-suit from the family of the deceased, lawyer Donald Gennaro (Ferrero) arrives at an amber mine owned by the employer of the deceased, whom it's established cannot turn up for such a sombre occasion out of business, such is his nature. By way of his dress, Gennaro looks out of sorts where he is and struggles to negate the terrain; alluding to a wider extent of being unable to deal with what he's getting into. Things develop and the owner, a certain John Hammond (Attenborough) whose wealth might exceed that of anyone else's in movie history, enlists three experts in archaeological doctors Grant (Neill) and Sadler (Dern), as well as doctor of mathematician Ian Malcolm (Goldblum), to tour certain facilities before they go public so as to give it a proverbial ""nod"".<br/><br/>Those facilities form the titular Jurassic Park, a place in which dinosaurs come to life and strut around like zoo creatures as the paying customers gawk on; a bit different to that of travelling to Finkley Down Farm, a family spot located in the South of England, where your biggest risk was having the crude paper bag of 'feed' you were given snatched from your very hands if you took your eye off the goats. Spielberg has fun with his monsters and his sequences of peril, but deserves credit for not rendering the presence of his humans as not much more than action figures in a children's fantasy game. Sadler and Grant are in a relationship, their archaeological digs are crude but sweetly old fashioned; they drink champagne, but only on the special occasions. Grant cannot fathom modern technology, but through the wonder of Hammond's innovations, he will come to face his fears of what it is he studies brought to life via technology, as well as doing well to banish his dislike of children. There is some fun to be had out of his rapport with Malcolm, who's ""always looking out for the next ex-Mrs. Malcolm""; his eyes are on Sadler, he loves children and she wants some – when he tries to explain Chaos theory to her, we wonder if it is a genuine discussion or whether it's a bogus exercise that provides him with an opportunity to flirt and stroke her wrist.<br/><br/>There is great energy and craft in most of what constitutes antagonism with the dinosaurs, let loose by a fun sub-plot to do with a corrupt employee looking to steal DNA. The rendez-vous with the T-Rex, as it breaks out of his paddock with everyone beside it, is a superb exercise in sound and fear; the audience allowing a good look at the automobiles the characters travel in prior to departure via a long tracking shot capturing the pristine nature of the things and their advanced touch-screen technology and roomy qualities: later reduced to that of the equivalent of a T-Rex chewy-toy as the beasties run amok. There is talk of the Rex prior to this engagement as a threat; its skeleton in the main entrance brings us aware of its size, a similar trait Spielberg implements unto that of the Velociraptor, whose methods are verbally reiterated by Grant early on and whose claw Grant carries around with him as a novelty charm shows us their weapon. From its character driven beginnings to its calm; peaceful and exhausted ride home akin to that of the driving back from a theme park experience with the kids, Jurassic Park combines meaty thrills with enjoyable film-making substance capitalising on some wondrous special effects for the time and studious direction from a man capable of delivering on as many fronts as possible."
"amesmonde","Null","0","2","1 May 2011"," A benchmark but I prefer the third.
","Genetically engineered dinosaurs run amok in their own theme park when the power to their enclosures is sabotaged allowing them to escape.<br/><br/>In 1993 after queueing forever I watched the much hyped film and left the cinema unfulfilled, I still feel the same way. The effects still hold up well, although the seams between C.G.I, animatronics and puppets are even more apparent it was a mile stone.  <br/><br/>Although Michael Crichton's book wasn't fully realised Steven Spielberg's film adaptation has some fantastic set pieces, notably the T-Rex attack, raptor kitchen action and closing finale. Sadly, even though superior in scope it's not as balanced as West World,the in between segments feel like gap fillers and the characters are given little, albeit some witty dialogue, usually from the most developed character Ian Malcolm played by Jeff Goldblum others are are wasted. Laura Dern is good but the script let's her down at times making her unnecessary dated feminist fodder. Sam Neill is on form but is given some cringe-worthy dialogue usually involving the kids.  The supporting cast are fine, even the child actors are likable and superb. Samuel L. Jackson Richard Attenborough, Bob Peck are solid and Wayne Knight as crook Dennis Nerdy is memorable. Nevertheless, characters fleet in and out, either killed or never seen again. There are a too many cliffhangers and throw away gags. Events appear as just that, events and it doesn't flow as well as it should. In addition, the editing doesn't compliment the earlier action or the dialogue scenes as much as in the later half. Too much happens off screen and I don't just mean the dinosaur shenanigans.    <br/><br/>John Williams score is simply wonderful, and the location feel gives it a unique atmosphere. Even with a lack of blood and an archetype hero to root for Jurassic Park still manages to thrill but these magic moments are few and far between compared to Spielberg's other works. <br/><br/>An entertaining benchmark in effects history but as a dino-bite of cinema but I prefer the flow of Joe Johnson's third instalment."

"elshikh4","7","0","6","20 February 2009"," The ""O"" Word !
","I remember well that I was craving to see (Jurassic Park) right after its release. For one reason, (Steven Spielberg) is interesting to watch; at that time I was about completing all what he did of movies up to that moment. And for another reason, the movie hit high and became the most successful movie ever, reaching to the unthinkable number: 900 Million Dollar. (Titanic) would ascend the throne later, achieving 100 million more, but not before 4 years. So, I went to watch it.. and what a disappointment!<br/><br/>Yes, the idea is wild, the action is good, and the performance is fair, BUT that's, from my point of view, isn't my idea of the movie that millions must watch, love, and remember greatly. The only exceptional thing here was the CGI. Back then, it was so rare to call the CGI in a movie ""perfect"", but this one deserved that. 95 % of those dinosaurs was real. However, I don't think for this reason apart that this movie got to be selected in the best 100 movies ever!<br/><br/>The action was good, which's bad as long as we're talking about a (Spielberg) movie, where the action is always super. The ending was laconic and badly-directed, maybe that's because (Spielberg), as I knew later, had to be connected with (Schindler's List) while finishing this one in the same time. (Spielberg)'s specter of flying, as the ultimate pure dream, or as a reference to the victory of the spiritual nature against the terrestrial evil (from E.T, Hook, etc..) was portrayed in the end naively. (John Williams)'s music is better than the movie at times. And the message is simple: ""Don't play with nature"". Ok, it's simple and pretty old too!<br/><br/>Therefore, I'm certain that the movie's huge success got something to do with factors outside of it (political, economical, social, whatever..) more than factors in it. Sometimes I read about this movie stuff that provokes me to the max, such as: ""Scrutinize closely the way the dinosaurs look with their eyes, then you'll understand the deep philosophy of Spielberg while he's dealing with the humanity's end??"". This kind of serious balderdash makes me so sick!<br/><br/>So, eventually, it's nothing but good action, with good idea, and very good CGI, nothing more. In fact, it's a case of one movie that has been produced by 60 million dollar and has been propagandized by 68 million dollar, so you have to notice the power of publicity very well if you want to understand the success of this movie.<br/><br/>Sorry, but after hearing about the score that this movie hit, watching it, then reading about the hidden grand meanings in it (!), I must say the ""O"" word, which's maybe the most frequently used word in all of the reviews nowadays: This movie is ""Overrated"". At least I said it once!"

","How did Jaws hold the tension and suspense? Because Spielberg held off showing the shark until halfway through the film (partly because the damn thing wouldn't work). The opening scene with the girl being dragged all over the water and slamming her into a buoy was scary as hell because you couldn't see the shark. I'm 44 and I remember it to this day! All you saw was the girl being ripped to shreds! IMO, that was the scariest scene in the movie! Tell me, when you went swimming in the ocean, didn't it bother you that you couldn't see what was swimming around your feet, just like the girl couldn't? <br/><br/>The same goes for JP. If Spielberg were smart, he would have held off showing the dinosaurs until the T-Rex attack. Can you imagine how scary and cool that would have been if you hadn't seen the creatures, and almost halfway through the movie, you're sitting there in the dark theater, you hear the approaching booming footsteps of the T-Rex and then ROAR, there it is! The first dinosaur that you see is the one that will rip you to pieces, instead of the cute, ""oooh, look at the dinosaur"" scene that was in the first 15 minutes of the movie? <br/><br/>What you see is much scarier than what you don't see.

","A big budget, big imagination, big CG & animatronics, & director Steven Spielberg. What do all these things add up to? One of Hollywood's most successful money-making sci-fi adventure blockbusters to ever hit the silver screen. Children & adults alike flocked to the theaters in droves in 1993 to witness movie-making magic never before attempted. Still today, ""Jurrasic Park"" ranks in the top ten in highest grossing major motion picture in Hollywood history.<br/><br/>The film features the scientific work of billionaire entrepreneur John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) who creates dinosaurs from fossilized mosquito containing DNA from dinosaur blood. Hammond's research & lab team engineers the dinosaurs to be all female, thus keeping their population numbers stable & have no authorized breeding in the Park. Hammond also builds a mega theme park on a remote island where the dinosaurs are displayed in grand fashion. In order to obtain endorsement approval from his company's stockholders & impress a nervous attorney, Hammond agrees to have a paleobotanist, paleontologist, mathematician, & his unassuming grandchildren to visit Jurassic Park to get their approval. Unbeknownst to Hammond, computer genius Dennis Nedry(Wayne Knight) has plans of his own to cash in on Hammond's dinosaurs. Making a shady deal with crooks, Nedry is selling dino DNA but needs to temporarily shut down the park's security system to gain access to a restricted area. Hammond finds paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant(Sam Neill), paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler(Laura Dern), mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm(Goldblum), & grandchildren Lex(Arianna Richards) & Tim Murphy(Joseph Mazzello). The group is flown in & gets right to Hammond's tour from dino eggs to finished product. Hammond next takes the group by jeep to an open plain where everyone is astonished by the sight of real live dinosaurs herding, feeding, & co-habitating amongst each other in the park!!! Hammond also shows the group his prize Velociraptors who must be separated from other dinosaurs & must be fed by lowering a cow into their pen. The Velociraptors are the most cunning, most resourceful, most intelligent, & most skilled hunters of all the dinosaurs. They also are very vocal, using various calls to signal each other & relay messages. Hammond & his dino wranglers use extreme caution when handling Velociraptors.<br/><br/>After returning to the main park building & a brief explanation of how dinosaurs are created, Hammond takes the group to the motorized tour where the dinosaurs are showcased in their natural habitats. Nedry, determined to make money for black market dino DNA, crashes his jeep on the way to his deal but ends up dino food for some nasty acid-spitting dinosaurs. The trouble now is that only Nedry knows the passcode to turn the security system he created back on-line. The group goes by area after area with dino no-show, faulty equipment, & boredom. Everything goes fairly well with the Jurrasic Park tour until the security system is shut down & the disasters to come are realized! Stopped at the featured T-Rex exhibit, the group is greeted by Jurrasic Park resident menace Tyrannasaurus Rex, who broke through the non-electrified fencing containing him. The giant carnivore sniffs out & attacks the group, killing the bloodsucking lawyer & injuring Malcom's leg. The children flee the wrecked Jeep & run for their lives with Dr. Grant. Dr. Sattler makes her way to the compound where she tells Hammond of the carnage inflicted on the group by the dinosaurs. One other big problem has arisen; the Velociraptors are loose from their pens & are now hunting the group. Dr. Sattler & a Park dino wrangler find Dr. Malcolm just in time to escape the hungry jaws of an angry T-Rex!! While resting in a tree, Dr. Grant consoles the children while encountering one of Jurrasic Park's kinder residents, a frisky Brachiasaurus. Dr. Grant discovers the awful truth of the dinosaur reproductive dilemma; the African frog used to fill the dino DNA strand gap has caused some of the all female dinosaurs to change their sex to facilitate mating!! Hammond, Dr. Sattler, & computer whiz Ray Arnold(Samuel L. Jackson) decide that the only way to reboot the security system for the Park is to shut down the main power & restart everything. Dr. Sattler agrees to run to the power shed & risk her life to save Dr. Grant & Hammond's grandchildren still out in the Park. Luckily, Dr. Sattler makes it to the power shed & rushes down to the main fuse box following Hammond's lead. The plan works but the joy is short lived when Dr. Sattler is stalked by a vicious Velociraptor! She escapes the immediate danger right into the arms of Dr. Grant. The two scientists & Hammond's grandchildren make their way into the main compound in order to find refuge from the ever cunning Velociraptors. After surviving several attempts by the Velociraptor, the group is saved unexpectedly by the ferocious T-Rex!! After boarding his private helicopter to escape the island, the scientists all agree not to endorse Hammond's Jurrasic Park, with the deflated billionaire in agreement.<br/><br/>With record-breaking premiere attendance, superb product marketing, & terrific publicity, ""Jurrasic Park"" was destined to make movie history. A great film to watch with older kids, there are many reasons to enjoy this film(dinosaurs, story, CG, & cinematography). I give this film an 8 out of 10 with 1 1/2 thumbs up!!!"

","Dinosaur-mania peaked with the movie based on Michael Crichton's novel. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic Era between 65 and 220 million years ago. The Mesozoic Era is divided into the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. ""Jurassic Park"" brings dinosaurs into the present by cloning them from DNA. They are kept in a park on an island off Costa Rica with plans of making them a public attraction. The dinosaurs get loose. T. Rex goes on a rampage. The velociraptors are fierce. I feel like there are not enough species represented. Where are triceratops and stegosaurs? Duckbills and ankylosaurs? The theme is that man should not tamper with nature which is ridiculous because the whole point of science and technology is that man can better himself by understanding and harnessing natural forces. Movie-makers generally lean toward the negative. Both Steven Spielberg and George Lucas employ dark, confusing scenes. Watching their movies is like taking a beating. Still, we learn from them."

","I credit this film with changing the nature of summer blockbusters more than Jaws or Star Wars. It presented a new formula that was so compelling in terms of what could be accomplished on screen, and what resources could be spared, that frugal studio moguls were bound to seize on the opportunity. I can imagine the head of every agency making the ""We can have a coupon day.."" remark. Spielberg saw the power of this new technology, and made the film about the discovery of CGI. There's a lot of good philosophy here. Filmmakers take note. Just because computers _can_ generate an effect, doesn't necessarily mean that they should. This is no longer a flea circus we invent in our minds based on clever suggestions of the camera. We literally see the fleas on the merry-go-round, animated like Cirque du Soleil acrobats. This allows the creators to be lazy and the audience's imagination atrophies.<br/><br/>Jurassic uses the technology effectively and I don't mind that it showcases itself a bit.

And less than half of the movie has dinosaurs in it. <br/><br/>No professional on a subject would react like Neill and Dern did when they see the ill triceratops. ""Aw, hey, baby girl"" and petting it. It's absurd to think that a non-domestic animal or creature will be won over with hand pats. Go find a raccoon and pet it, going 'aw, baby'. Surprise!<br/><br/>So once we actually get dinosaurs in this thing, what happens? Let's look at things in order. <br/><br/>Now I suppose the girl may have been distraught at the lawyer fellow leaving her and her brother in the jeep, but suddenly she loses all her precocious wisdom and intelligence because there is no adult to supervise her?<br/><br/>Upon the arrival of the tyrannosaur, all that book-learning the kids had went out the friggin' window.

We saw them right here.<br/><br/>I guess Missy thought Rex was disrespectful of her vegetarianism because it ate the goat. Ah, she can go complain to ACLU.<br/><br/>So what happens next? Sissy screams at Rex. Brave little girl.<br/><br/>When Missy and Neill make their way down the wall, she is still whining about the toilet man leaving her and Bubba in the jeep. She must have really felt betrayed, but what did she expect him to do against Rex? File a restraining order if Rex invaded their private space?<br/><br/>Then we get Neill and Junior running and climbing down the tree getting away from the jeep, which is caught on branches and slowly coming after them.<br/><br/>As I watched this all progress, I sighed. Okay, where are the DINOSAURS!!!!<br/><br/>I didn't want to watch a movie called ""Attack of the Jeep In A Tree"".<br/><br/>Attenborough's scream into the telephone, Dern's cry to run. Was this supposed to be emotion? <br/><br/>We would get more faux suspense with the power lines. Will Bubba get off the line in time? Bubba! Bubba! <br/><br/>Where are the DINOSAURS?<br/><br/>Then we would have Dern and the diabolical flashlight tied around her ankle.<br/><br/>I felt the movie only picked up when the kids were in the dining room and running in the kitchen, but by then it was like an entirely different movie.<br/><br/>The bit with Rex chasing the jeep was fun as well, but when this movie was bad, it was really bad. <br/><br/>Looking back ten years now, I recall the hype over the vibrating water in the glass and the puddle. It was like anticipation was wanted out of the most minute situations. <br/><br/>I'm watching it as I type this and there is just too many hammy things in it, for some reason mostly around Dern and Goldblum. Pity he wasn't eaten by a thunder lizard. <br/><br/>Every time he offered his opinion, it was incredibly annoying. Eww eww, dino doo. <br/><br/>It will go down as just one more good idea executed badly. It needed more human input than what it offered.

There actually is a bad guy in the movie, Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) a nerd who's trying to steal the dinosaurs and sell them.  nedry turns the power off...which causes all the extreme danger to brake lose.<br/><br/>Let me just say that it was so scary when nedry gets killed by a dilophosaurus, it even made me afraid to get in the car by myself. But let me shed some light on this, Jeff Goldblum gives all the humor with all his dry, facetious, and sometimes cynical humor.  I can't get enough of some of the things he says, with so little respect, like when he says, ""Now how can you be sure all the dinosaurs are female, does someone pull up the dinosaurs skirt?"" Dr. hammond, says that the reason for all the danger is that all major theme parks have their delays, he mentions about when the first opened Disneyland in 1956, and Dr. malcolm says, ""yeah, John but when Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down the pirates don't EAT the tourists."" It would of been even funnier if he said, ""it's a Small World, has irked the entire world, but when the dolls sing in that ever annoying, repetative way, they don't turn into Chucky Dolls and KILL the Tourists.

They've given me nightmares. i'd have to say there was more than moderate violence, there's a severed human arm, something you only see in a horror movie. This was Joseph Mazzello's claim to fame, his turning point.<br/><br/>he had a great role as  a genius, who was so tough and had such incredible endurance, it even seemed totally fake the amount he had. like the scence where the T-Rex ambushes the car, and he gets left in and the car gets smashed, twisted, and falls about 40-feet into a tree., and later gets electricutted by 10, 000 volts., and he doesn't scream or cry, and he's ok, althoug he has to see a doctor, and has blood all over his ears and other places. For a movie that's a claim to fame of such an expressive actor, who always cries in hi major roles, the character he played seemed like it wasn't hard at all.  The Raptors kill at least 8-people, and the crew from the beggining are the only for sure survivors. Just seeing advertisements, pictures,the poster, merchandise etc. scared me, and back, then bid jungles like that gave me the creeps. i survived watching it the first time when I was 8, but I was nervous to see the sequel in theaters."

","This is basically one of my favorite movies based on one of my favorite books, and definitely a movie I recommend everyone see.  After reading many reviews, I see where people didn't care for it, and I wanted to address some of those things. *spoilers ahead for both book and movie*<br/><br/>Some people said the plot was dumb, and it might have seemed a little weak in the movie, and others said that it lacked too much.  The book did a great job of explaining everything sometimes in ridiculous detail, and as it was a 2 hour movie it couldn't do what the book did in that respect; instead what it did was took the major plots out of the book and wind them into the movie.  So a lot of detail was lost, but enough was kept to make leave it entertaining enough.  I didn't like how some things were left out though; in the book the dinos were breeding and out of their pens long before the fences were out, and that added a huge angle to the book.  Also the migration of raptors, showing how bird like they were.  One huge thing was chaos as well, which was really watered down in the movie.  The movie lacked a lot, but it was the best job that could have been done with so much to work with.<br/><br/>One part that was left out that I wanted to see was the river scene; in the book for a good day Grant and the kids head down the river away from the rex, and see a lot of things.  It was a great part I was sad to see left out of the film.  Also Hammond's role changed a bit, and I have to say while I enjoyed how they changed him, I think his end in the book would have been nice to see.  I did like the raptor parts a little better in the book, but the movie was just as good.<br/><br/>If it seems I am comparing, I have to; it was an awesome book.  I think it was a great movie with a great adoption that didn't go too far off of the book, and is a must see and definitely better than the two sequels.  8 out of 10"

","I was the editor of a busy publication when Jurassic Park opened, but that didn't stop me from playing hooky and seeing the movie. Having read the book the moment it came out, I was impatient for the movie that would marry the scientific scribe of future possibilities to the man many call the master of motion picture art, Spiels.  Spielburg and Crichton -- what a hellava combination. The movie did not disappoint me in the least, I hung onto the arms of my seat and let the movie pull me in inch by inch.  When T-Rex was chasing Ellie and Ian, I felt myself slipping down the chair.  The wind was in my hair, I could almost smell the dino spore, the storm, Muldoon (so perfectly cast), Denis Nedry and the kitchen scene, and I didn't even mind that it was a stark impossibility T-Rex could have gotten into the pavilon at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>It was magic. Then and now.<br/><br/>In the past ten years, I have watched JP 1 -- at least five times a year. When I'm working I have to have it on sometimes -- even if I'm not glued to the TV. I just have to hear it. There is a rhythm to the narrative, one I would think Koep created and Spiels enhanced -- moving forward, echoing Ian's observation, ""Life moves forward, it breaks through barriers, painfully..."" It is among my top ten films, and no matter how cheesy, I will always go see a JP movie.<br/><br/>To be fair and realistic, I am not so blind to think JP is a perfect movie. So here are some things I didn't like - though through the ages I have softened considerably.<br/><br/>A - Ian was supposed to be an early 20's kid. (but we love Jeff G)<br/><br/>B - The whole migration angle from the book was missed.<br/><br/>C- I would have liked more 'Dino Snacks' (humans) on the island.<br/><br/>D- I wish Henry Wu (B.D. Wong) had a bigger role<br/><br/>E- I missed the end scene of the book, Oh to have been in the Raptor cave. Oh, to have seen the Raptors out on the beach waiting for the transport like birds.<br/><br/>F - I wanted John H to be more of a bad guy -- I liked him too much.<br/><br/>All in all, JP 1 will always be in my little boy heart.

","I'm guessing you've seen ""Jurassic Park,"" because, let's face it, everyone in the whole world has seen ""Jurassic Park."" For a time, it was the highest-grossing movie ever.  I think ""Titanic"" bumped it to #2 though, although I could be wrong.  Even still, being the second-most popular movie of all time, it's unlikely that you haven't seen it.<br/><br/>I love this movie.  I watch it at least once a year.  I can't get enough of ""Jurassic Park"" and its sequel, ""The Lost World.""<br/><br/>But the movie itself really isn't all that great.  Nothing about the plot or the characters is even the slightest bit original.  We've seen movies that show us why man shouldn't mess with nature, and we've seen movies with scary monsters that eat people.  In fact, these are usually the same movies.<br/><br/>So what is it about ""Jurassic Park"" that keeps us coming back for more? It all boils down to the dinosaurs.  Sure, other movies have had dinosaurs in them, but they never looked quite convincing.  You could always tell it was a guy in a suit, or that it was herky-jerky stop-motion.  Or you could never see the whole creature in one frame, which gave away the fact that it was some sort of puppetry.  But in ""Jurassic Park,"" for the first time, dinosaurs were real.  They moved, acted, and sounded like real creatures. Thanks to advances in computer technology, there were no more matte lines, no more herky-jerky movements, just what appeared to be living, breathing dinosaurs.  Sure, there were animatronics as well, but in this movie it is absolutely impossible to tell the difference between what's real and what's computerized.  Spielberg, Stan Winston, Dennis Muren, Phil Tippet and all the others involved really deserve kudos for that accomplishment.<br/><br/>Who, as a child hasn't had some kind of fascination with dinosaurs? Everyone at some point in their lives has fantasized about these ancient, nearly mythical creatures.  I'm sure everyone has wanted their own pet T-Rex, or to gaze upon a herd of triceratops.  ""Jurassic Park"" offers that dream, and that's why we love it.  It may not be Spielberg's finest work, but for every minute those dinosaurs are onscreen, it's pure movie magic."

But Steven Spielberg didn't originally plan to use CGI--he had more mechanical methods in mind--but turned to the rapidly evolving world of digital resources late in production, which indicates a technical savviness and flexibility on his part.

","I remember when this film was being mentioned for the summer sweeps.  It was said that it was going to be like Jaws on land.  Well that is unfair to put that kind of pressure on it.  After all, nothing can really compete with Jaws when it comes to summer time terror.  But having said that, Jurassic Park is a good movie with quite a few tense scenes in it.  But what Jurassic Park lacks, and what would have made it a better film is something that I think we all would have liked to see.<br/><br/>Dinosaurs are amazing creatures.  Being that it is the year 2000, we all know what they look like now.  But picture this back in 1993.  No one had seen a dinosaur on film.  Not a good one anyway.  There were a few old television shows where really fake and synthetic looking T-Rex's would chase down it's human prey, but that doesn't really count.  The world had never been exposed to Spielberg's vision and therefore, we had never really experienced what a dinosaur looked like for real.  But if you remember what Dern's and Golddblum's reactions were when they first saw the Brontosaurus' roaming in the field, that is probably what we all felt.  A complete and utter sense of awe.  Here is a species of animal that has been extinct for about 65 million years and we are getting to witness it for the first time on the big screen.  I just wish we had more time and more shots of these magnificent beasts roaming the earth.  I wish we had more time to just watch what they do, how they move, how they interact.  I realize this isn't a National Geographic show about dinosaurs, it is big budgetted Hollywood summer film that has to contain action, suspense and humour, but it just would have been nice to see them in all their glory for just a little longer than what we did.  I guess seven years later it really doesn't matter how I feel seeing as there have been countless other films with dinosaurs in them and Jurassic Park went onto become the biggest movie ever until James Cameron came along and decided to sink some ship.  But at the time it was a legitimate gripe.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, it is an enjoyable romp through the jungle.  It has enough scares and suspense to keep everyone happy.  It also boasts of a very impressive cast.  Newman and Jules have substantial roles in it as well as Dern, Neil and Goldblum.  I am not really going to say much else about it.  After all, it has probably already been said.  It's not that I didn't enjoy the film because I did, it's just that I think they could have done more with it.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10<br/><br/>Jurassic Park 3 should be interesting, especially now since Spielberg has traded in his director's hat for just a producing one."

One surprise scene in particular continues to surprise and entertain me because it was so well done.

Director Spielberg superbly handles the action and Crichton's script skillfully builds up the tension before heading into all out action, thrills and scares. Less successfully are the performances from the human cast with Sam Neil and Laura Dern in particular phoning in their performances while Joe Mazzello's uncanny ability keep surviving after several normally fatal situations, is a tad ridiculous to say the least.

","**** out of ****<br/><br/>Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg's ground-breaking (in terms of visuals, not plot) sci-fi action/thriller, may not have the everlasting historical and human importance of Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan, but damn if it doesn't thrill me every time I see it.  This is the film that finally proved to me that Spielberg could do anything when it comes to action and adventure (beforehand, he had the Indiana Jones films).  It's a movie that just about everyone has heard of seen by now, and it's impact is still felt now, so many years later.<br/><br/>Upon it's initial release I noticed nothing good reviews for the film, but I've always noticed comments and slight criticism about the lack of character development.  I'm still at a loss about all those complaints. First of all, while it might not have quite as much characterization as Spieblerg's Jaws (I actually prefer JP just a tad over that film), it's certainly far more than you'd expect from the typical summber blockbuster. I can say with ease I found the cast and characters likable and engaging, particularly Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Bob Peck. <br/><br/>This is the movie that made Neill a recognizable figure worldwide.  Before this, he'd proven his thespian talents in the thriller Dead Calm, but had never been in something as high-profile as this.  I give kudos to Spielberg for not trying to put some mega-star in the lead, but instead chose to go with Neill, who has yet to deliver anything below a fine performance.  To this day, Neill remains among my favorite actors, and it was great to see him back in Jurassic Park 3.<br/><br/>Laura Dern hasn't quite had as much attention since then, but is still solid in anything she does.  It was quite good to see her in JP3 and her scenes with Neill in that respective film brought back some of the well-done sentimental feeling that Spielberg used effectively in this film.  Jeff Goldblum is very funny as Ian Malcolm and would continue to be humorous in The Lost World, and Bob Peck is quite a standout as the park's game warden who understands the danger of the situation better than anyone else. Richard Attenborough is also good as the park's owner, and it's nice to see that he's not portrayed as a megalomaniac, as is what we usually see in most ""science runs amok"" thrillers.<br/><br/>But, of course, nobody watched this movie for the performances.  It was all on the basis of the special effects and the action.  Both are spectacular and exciting, to say the least.  Stan Winston's animatronic effects are the best, creating dinosaurs so lifelike, you'd swear it had be the real thing. Michael Lantieri and Phil Tippett set up a new stage of CGI as their work on this film was unlike anything anybody had ever seen before.  There are even moments when it's hard to tell which dino is an animatronic or CGI-rendered product.<br/><br/>As I've said before, I've always considered Steven Spielberg not only one of cinema's greatest filmmakers, but also the best action director ever. Whether it's rollicking adventure with Indiana Jones or brilliantly tense and harrowing battle scenes in Saving Private Ryan, he never fails to generate thrills and excitement.  Jurassic Park is a further testament to his skill.  The dino attacks are nail-biters, especially a scene with two raptors inside a kitchen that's among the film's best setpieces.  The t-rex also never fails to get a chill out of me.  <br/><br/>I have two particular favorite moments.  The first is the t-rex attack on the two electric cars, which jumpstarts the movie's thrill ride mode.  The other is the extended raptor chase, all the way from the kitchen to the computer room to the museum.  A very tense and long sequence that caps off with a fun showdown between 3 dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Most summer blockbusters have this certain rule that a movie should run over two hours, thus making it an event movie, but a lot of them have the tendency to run out of steam well before they reach that mark.  Jurassic Park runs at 127 minutes, but is never dull for single moment.  Spielberg paces the film perfectly, building up momentum and paying off with great action and suspense.<br/><br/>David Koepp's script is a bit different than Michael Crichton's novel, and while I did enjoy the book immensely, I'm rather glad Spielberg's version wasn't quite in the same vein with Crichton, perhaps because certain aspects of it seemed a little too violent and too far out-of-tone.  From what I've read, Crichton's script was ultra-violent and some of the characters were downright unpleasant (similar to the book, but would feel a heck of a lot different on-screen).<br/><br/>Another constant complaint, perhaps, is the sentimentalism Spielberg brings to the film, mostly the addition of Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards as the two children under Neill's care as they're lost in the park.  Hmm, aside from the fact that it didn't bother me in the least and that all they're scenes are handled quite well, both child actors are quite talented. Besides, these scenes actually make their characters even more engaging and likable.<br/><br/>Adding immensely to the overall experience of the film is John Williams' score.  To say this is one of his best would be a huge statement, but it is easily one of his better scores.  Whether it's creating wonder or tension, Williams hits all the right notes.  There's no doubting this is one of the more popular scores around, and considering Williams' resume, it's no surprise.<br/><br/>Jurassic Park has been compared to Jaws many times and it's usually deemed inferior, but I slightly prefer this film.  Both are thrill rides that will never be equaled to be sure, but Jurassic Park adds a sense of awe and wonder that brings it up a notch.  I suppose it wouldn't be outright scary as Jaws, seeing how it is sharks do exist and dinosaurs have been dead for a while, but it's still got its own good scares.<br/><br/>There have been 3 films released in the series and I'm sure another will be coming up in the next couple of years.  Jurassic Park still easily remains the best, but its sequels are nonetheless very entertaining and enjoyable. I'm still waiting for Spielberg's next non-sequel thrill ride, and it will take quite a bit of effort to match this one."

","Even though this was the most overrated movie of 1993, when I saw Jurassic Park in the theaters back then, I actually liked it.  But the plot was very thin, it was so comprehensible that a idiot with the mental capacity of a 6 year old would understand it!  A child under 10 can watch this movie and understand it!  <br/><br/>   When Jurassic Park came out, immediately came the cashing in on the merchindise!  Everything from Jurassic Park beach towels, toothbrushes, lunchboxes, water bottles, toys, action figures, t-shirts, jackets, and even a video game for Sega!  Even some resturants joined in on the craze!  Just everything product you can think of had to be Jurassic Park related.  You couldn't walk into a mall without seeing any JP products within 30 yards of a distance!  <br/><br/>   But despite all of that, what's not to like?  The one thing I didn't like about this movie was that whiny teenage girl who was scared all the time and acted like an advocate for political correction!  But throw in some decent acting, well-known actors, innovative special effects, action, adventure, and Jurassic Park is quite a ride!  A fun movie for all ages!  I give it 3 stars!"

","I have seen this movie over and over again and have read the book. Michael Crichton came up with a great storyline which makes the movie so good.  Steven Spielberg is a genius.  No other director could have made Jurassic Park come alive like he did. After reading the members of the cast for the first time, there were some names I'd never heard before.  Especially Sam Neill, the lead actor. I did realize however that with this cast the movie was great.  You might think more popular actors need to be in a box office hit like Jurassic Park, but really the cast used was perfect. Ian Malcom's character was a great character.  He brings so much to the movie.  My hat is off to Jeff Goldblum, who played Malcom.  Malcom was a very complex character because of his theories and opinions.  Goldblum nailed the part. The special effects in this movie blew me away.  For 1993 the dinosaurs were a breakthrough in animatronics.  Stan Winston created the dinosaurs all the way down to the smallest detail.  I have seen all Jurassic Park movies and still believe that the dinosaurs in the first movie were the greatest.<br/><br/>This movie is action-packed but it also has a great story.  I rate it a must see for moviegoers everywhere."

The biggest reason it has the best story is because the scientists were not expecting anything bad to happen. In the second one, Jeff Goldblum expected of what was going to happen and the audience kind of knew what was going to happen. The dinosaurs are going to attack. Another reason this is a masterpiece is because it has intensity. The most intense part is probably the scene in the kitchen. The velocaraptors had some of the best scenes in the movie. The T- Rex also had some very good. I like the part with the toilet seat. LOL! But this is a great movie, and they released at a perfect time which was summer, to get the most business.

","Never fails to inspire a sense of awe, and fear. There's a sort of mythical grandeur prevading every frame of this film that is by and large absent from The Lost World(I have not seen part three, so I cannot comment on that, though I doubt a change in directors has helped much). I remember that year very clearly. Sitting the theater waiting in anticipation for dinorsaurs. It was just like my first trip to the zoo. Then they did show up after an hour(I think) and it totally blew me away. The sound, the sights! It was too real. Now, of course the movie has flaws(mainly the lack of a real ending, the movie simply stops) but I'd rather not focus on these; Jurrasic Park is a classic adventure movie in the best Spielberg tradition rivaling even Jaws. There is something eeire, wonderous, yet mysterious about the mist shrouded jungle where the movie is set. The leaves moving in the wind to a portentious soundtrack boom is an image that will never leave my mind. I wanted to believe this is was a real place I could travel to, and see the dinosaurs lurking just behind the palm fronds(from a safe distance of course!). Simply a 10/10!"

","Jurassic Park is without a doubt a great movie and a king to its peer Jurassic Park 2: The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3. Jurassic Park was the best because it stated how the park came to be and there were thorough questions and answers throughout the movie, and came through with a good plot and meaning of controlling nature. If the movie explains too little and doesn't explain enough which even sequels should be ripe with it doesn't live up to the original feel to Jurassic Park. Take Jurassic Park 3 for example plenty of action and special effects but hardly any more just sit for a good 10 minutes and explain and learn for the audience to give the movie a more deeper appreciation. Jurassic Park totally explained in depth almost all 15 species on the island and mentioned almost all of them. Even though the sequels don't live up to the first. I'm really glad they are making sequels and despite people not in favor for a fourth return, I would really like it anyway because all a sequel can do is add toward the original and make an even bigger story."

","Yes, it's Jurassic Park  one of the most expensive and profitable blockbuster movies of all time, with revolutionary special effects and a director of the highest standing.  But does that make it any good? Set in the near future, on a small, remote island a new theme park has been constructed  Jurassic Park.  Dinosaurs that died out over 65 million years ago have been recreated by removing and cloning DNA from the blood contained in a mosquito.  This is noticeably unbelievable, as there are a huge variety of dinosaurs from different time periods from one mosquito, and the entire concept is simply an excuse to display new computer-animated special effects. Which are, incidentally, superb.  Even a few years on, with computing power doubling every 18 months, the animation is still top-notch and is definitely the highlight of the film. The dialogue is well written, with some interesting debates on the nature of life, and the characters fit in with what they are saying.  The plot is uninspired and, in fact, the entire scenario for the book by Michael Crichton that the film was based on was lifted from a 1979 issue of the graphic novel 2000AD, entitled, Jurassic Park'.  The plot is almost certainly the most predictable I have ever witnessed, and the outcome is blatantly obvious, with a nice clear moral for the American family. The directing is excellent, with tension easily flowing and all the props are realistic.  The acting is sketchy from a few main characters, with lines delivered unconvincingly. Altogether, an excellent film provided you know what to expect.  It is a typical Hollywood family blockbuster movie, raised from the bog-standard by some incredible special effects and creditable directing for what it was intending to achieve.  However, it would have benefited enormously from a change of general attitude, and thus a higher certificate.  The plot could have easily had more depth and some twists.  If i were American, i would call this a no-brainer."

Sam Neill is always reliable, and he has three of my favorite scenes: the sheer mindnumbing wonder of the first look at the apatosaurus; his raptures over the ""flight"" of the ornithopods; and my favorite line in the whole movie -- when Lexie cries out, completely betrayed, ""He left us! He left us!"" he responds, so sincerely that you really believe it would convince her, ""But that's NOT what I'M gonna do."" Great special effects, the dinosaurs seem to be real, and good action. The film is marred by the ending, which is, in fact, just that: an end. Not a resolution, just a stop.

We waited at the front of what became a very long line, at 10 in the morining, outside the theater. We finally got into the huge theater and I sat in th middle seat of the middle row. When the movie started I was enthralled from start to finish. I was thrilled by the first appearence of the dinosaurs, having the same feeling that the characters had. I was on the edge of my seat for the scenes with the T-Rex and the Velociraptors. I loved every character in that movie. When it ended, and the rousing John Williams score played again, the theater broke into thunderous applause, and I was clapping the hardest. I knew what I wanted to do when I grew up. I wanted to make films that will thrill audiences like Jurassic Park thrilled me. Now I look back on Jurassic Park very fondly. It is no longer my favorite film. I have moved onto more, more adults films like Fight Club and American Beauty. But I will always love Jurassic Park, and will never understand any of the critics who did not like the script or thought the characters were thin.

Four years later came the other wonder: The Lost World - Jurassic Park, in my opinion, the unique movie that is equivalent to Jurassic Park. And I hope so much that Jurassic Park 3 be another wonder. This is just a preview of my history, because I can´t describe that movie in less of 1 Billion words."

","Jurassic Park is an extremely entertaining film; it's fun, it's about dinosaurs and the special effects are very convincing. Apart from some major scientific faults (not Crichton's first, I assure you), this film is well worth the time.<br/><br/>There is something of a saga over it, with the bombastic scenery and animals, and the sensitive music parading throughout the film. It's a fairly simple film, too, there being no real antagonists or protagonists - the animals just do what they do, no malice aforethought involved.<br/><br/>After seeing it the first time, I was slightly angry with what has to be one of the most obvious sequel-teasers ever, but I guess there was no chance they weren't going to make a sequel (or two, as it is) - money corrupts artistry."

","Well, I've never seen a movie like this before!  Monsters, or in this case Dinosaurs, are locked up in cages, they escape and go on a rampage.  No, we've never seen that before!<br/><br/>That statement was a statement of sarcasm.  This kind of plot has been done so many times, I'm surprised lawsuits haven't been thrown out.  But even though we've seen this kind of plot before, 'Jurassic Park' is still at least half decent.  I saw it for the first time when I was 10.  And at that age, a movie like this will terrify a young child to the bones, and this one did just that.  The scene in the kitchen with the raptors was horribly tense.  I can't think of a time I've been more scared. But now that I'm older, and a little more mature, it's hard to find a movie that will scare me like that ever again.  And that's a little sad, because I like it when a movie scares me.  It shows that the people who made the movie did a good job.  But aside from the fact that I was scared, I also enjoyed it very much.  The dinosaurs looked real, some of the acting was pretty good, which in my opinion is important for any movie.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie is one of my favourites.  And even though that kitchen scene doesn't scare me anymore, I will never forget how it scared me the first time.  However, if you want a movie that will create the same tension, only make it last longer, see 'Aliens'.  It will terrify you. Believe me.  But if you haven't seen 'Jurassic Park', I'd like to ask you where the hell you've been the last 6 years?"
